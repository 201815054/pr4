""Our current libel laws are a sham and a disgrace and do not represent American values or American fairness so we're going to take a strong look at that,"" he told reporters as he met members of his Cabinet.
In ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,"" author Michael Wolff has questioned Trump's mental fitness, portraying him as child-like with a short attention span. Trump had often complained about U.S. libel laws on the 2016 campaign trail.
""We are going to take a strong look at our country's libel laws so that when somebody says something that is false and defamatory about someone, that person will have meaningful recourse in our courts,"" Trump said.
To prove libel, a public figure must show a writer or publisher acted with actual malice in publishing a false statement. Malice is either reckless or purposeful disregard for the truth.
In what was seen as an attempt to show Trump is mentally fit and in command, the president had kept a pool of reporters, including a TV camera, inside of a meeting he had on Tuesday with U.S. lawmakers on immigration.
Reporters would have typically been escorted out after a few opening remarks, but they were kept in the meeting for 55 minutes as Trump and his Republicans debated immigration policy and ideas with Democratic members.
On Wednesday in the same room when Trump met members of his Cabinet, the president was ecstatic that TV networks had focused heavy attention on the immigration meeting.

""Some of them called it a performance. I consider it work,"" Trump said.

The coalition destroyed a boat carrying explosives as it headed toward the tanker on Saturday, coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Maliki said.
Yemen lies on the southern mouth of the Red Sea, one of the world's most important trade routes for oil tankers, which pass its shores as they head from the Middle East through the Suez Canal to Europe.
""There is no doubt that Hodeidah Port has now become a starting point for terrorist operations to threaten the maritime navigation in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab strait,"" Maliki said.
Yemen's armed Houthi movement threatened to block the Red Sea shipping lane on Tuesday if the coalition keeps pushing toward the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah, SABA news agency reported.
Maliki said the United Nations should take the initiative and take control of the port from the armed group.
U.N. officials have been trying to get the two sides back to the negotiating table after talks collapsed in 2016.
Yemen, one of the Arab world's poorest countries, is embroiled in a proxy war between the Houthis, who are allied with Iran, and a U.S.-backed military coalition headed by Saudi Arabia.
The Saudi-led coalition has been trying since the start of the war in March 2015 to capture Hodeidah, which receives 80 percent of Yemen's imports, and has in recent weeks launched a ground campaign and intensified air strikes.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Print distributors in Lithuania are being forced to tear pages out from magazines such as Vogue and National Geographic after the country introduced an alcohol advertising ban on Jan. 1.
The situation is an unintended consequence of an alcohol control bill signed into law in June by President Dalia Grybauskaite, who herself likened the outcome to medieval times and said it brought shame on the country.
Lithuania is third largest alcohol consumer, per capita, in the world. It has forbidden liquor adverts as one of a number of measures aimed at curbing widespread alcohol abuse. 
Press Express, the largest distributor of print media, now risks being slapped with a fine of up to 30,000 euros per page if it fails to remove or cover up liquor advertisements, its general manager, Vigintas Bartasevicius, said.
""We know that we create a problem for ourselves and for the publishers, because we cover their content and advertising which was paid for,"" he said. 
""Our buyers are of course very unhappy, they created a scandal on social media, so even the official institutions have begun thinking about solving this.""
Bartasevicius said the country's largest retail chain had refused to stock the altered magazines, deeming them ""damaged goods"".
However, he said the publishers of National Geographic had told him they could not create an edition of a magazine free from alcohol ads for a country which only sells up to 500 copies of a title per month. 
Politicians do not yet have any solution to a problem they have created.

""It is reminiscent of medieval times and it brings international shame on Lithuania,"" Grybauskaite told reporters on Wednesday. ""We must have laws without such flaws.""

5,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>","On eve of trip, Pope orders takeover of Catholic group in Peru","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has ordered the Vatican takeover of an elite Catholic society in Peru whose founder is accused of sexually and physically abusing children and former members of the group.
The move, announced by the Vatican on Wednesday, is the latest step in a saga that has damaged the reputation of the Catholic Church in Peru and comes a week before Francis is due to make his first visit as pope to that country and Chile.
It also comes as victims of sexual abuse say he has not done enough to stop root it out. The credibility of a commission he formed in 2014 has been severely damaged by the defections of senior members who accused the Vatican of dragging its feet.
The Vatican said the pope had appointed an administrator to run Sodalitium Christianae Vitae (SCV), whose founder Luis Figari, a layman, is due to go on trial in Peru for the sexual abuse of minors later this year. Figari has denied wrongdoing.
An internal report by the group last year concluded that Figari, who founded it in 1971 and headed it until 2010, and three other high-ranking ex members had abused 19 minors and 10 adults.
Most of the cases took place between the 1970s and 2000.
The report, published on the group's website, describes Figari as a charismatic, authoritarian and cult-like leader who publicly humiliated members as part of his strategy to control them.
Peruvian authorities opened an investigation into Figari in 2015 following the publication of a book into the alleged abuse written by Peruvian investigative journalists Pao Ugaz and Pedro Salinas.
Salinas once belonged to the ultra-conservative Sodalitium, whose members include businessmen, writers and politicians from Peru's upper classes and was founded as a part of a backlash to so-called ""Liberation Theology"", which took the side of the poor.
The Vatican statement said the pope had been following the group's situation ""with worry"" for years and had taken the action ""after a detailed analysis of all the documentation"".
It said the pope was concerned about ""the gravity of information regarding the internal system, (religious) formation (of members) and economic and financial management"".
The Vatican move came a month after a lawyer for victims said a public prosecutor was seeking pre-trial detention for Figari and three other former leaders of the group.
The Vatican, which officially recognized the group in 1997, last year prohibited Figari from having any contact with members.
The takeover of the SCV was similar to the action the Vatican took against another conservative group, the Legionaries of Christ. 
An administrator was appointed to run the Legionaries after its founder, the late Mexican priest Marcial Maciel Degollado, was discovered to have been a sexual abuser with a secret family.

The Vatican said the SCV would be run by Colombian Bishop Noel Antonio Londono Buitrago.

LONDON (Reuters) - The reluctance of foreign banks to deal with Iran could complicate any compensation payments resulting from the collision last week of an Iranian oil tanker and a Chinese cargo ship, sources say.
The tanker Sanchi, carrying 136,000 tonnes of highly flammable condensate oil, collided with the Chinese dry cargo vessel CF Crystal on Saturday in the East China Sea, causing an oil spill and a blaze that is still raging four days later.
Liability has yet to be established but lawyers and insurers say wherever the fault lies compensation payments risk getting bogged down or even blocked because the tanker and most of its crew were from Iran.
The potential hitches stem from U.S. restrictions on financial transactions with Iran still in place despite the lifting of international sanctions against the country in 2016 following its nuclear deal with world powers, lawyers say. 
The Sanchi's $60 million cargo of ultra-light crude oil spilled into the ocean and caught fire after the collision in international waters some 160 nautical miles (300 km) off China.
While the CF Crystal has returned safely to port with its crew, dozens of rescue boats from China and South Korea have been battling strong winds, high waves and poisonous fumes to try to find 31 sailors from the Sanchi and tame the fire.
Rahul Khanna, global head of marine risk consulting with German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG), said losses from the collision could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
""The value of the cargo and the value of the hull itself would be one major impact, but I think the oil pollution liability aspects are probably the largest element,"" he said. 
He said the environmental impact would be less severe than for a heavy crude spill, however, as condensate evaporates quickly and would not cause a major oil slick.
U.S. SANCTIONS
Some lawyers said there would be payment problems whether Iranian parties were the beneficiaries of any compensation, or if they were found liable.
Nigel Kushner, chief executive of law firm W Legal and an Iran specialist, said any compensation process would be complex as there were four different insurance issues at play: the ship itself, or the hull, the cargo, pollution and the deceased.
Thirty of the Sanchi's crew are from Iran and two are from Bangladesh. One body has been recovered from the sea but the rest are missing. The vessel (IMO:9356608) is run by Iran's top oil shipping operator, NITC. 
""It will probably be perfectly legal for insurers to pay, but in practice near impossible,"" Kushner said. 
""Numerous insurers will be involved requiring multiple payments,"" he said. ""I have seen lengthy and frustrating delays for clients previously with respect to insurance payments coming out of the Lloyd's (insurance) market when payments are delayed or blocked.""
Under U.S. sanctions, U.S. financial institutions and are prohibited from any trade with Iran, despite the nuclear deal struck in 2015, known as the JCPOA.
While non-U.S. banks can do business with Iran, lawyers say transactions involving U.S. dollars can be problematic as they must not involve the U.S. financial system in any way and that can be difficult in practice. 
Banks and individuals are still restricted from trade with individuals or entities that remain on a U.S. blacklist, adding to further caution over any business with Iran. 
Transactions in other currencies are allowed, but lawyers say large Western banks, for example, are wary of dealing with Iran in case they fall foul of existing U.S. sanctions.
""As a general matter, despite the sanctions relief contained within the JCPOA, there is still great difficulty in Western banks processing payments to Iranian counterparties, no matter the currency,"" said Matthew Oresman, a partner with Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, who advises companies on Iran compliance.
""For this specific incident, depending on the source of the insurance funds and the process by which it is to be delivered to Iranian recipients, there could be difficulties for the policy holders or other beneficiaries,"" he said.
BANKING PARALYSIS
In recent years, compensation claims for major oil pollution incidents have largely been handled by the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (IOPC Funds) inter-governmental body. It typically steps in to provide compensation for disasters over and above insurance company caps on payouts.
Maritime officials say compensation this time would fall under China's far smaller scheme known as the COPC Fund, partly because the oil in question is condensate which is not covered by IOPC Funds.
Xia Jun, a Beijing-based environmental lawyer, said the Chinese government would calculate the losses arising from pollution to the environment and fishing sector.
Protection and Indemnity (P&I) clubs - owned by shipping companies - insure the world's ocean-going tonnage against pollution and injury claims, typically the biggest costs when a vessel sinks. Separate hull and machinery policies cover vessels against physical damage. 
In the case of the Panama-flagged Sanchi, it is insured for P&I by Steamship Mutual based in London. 
""The vessel is entered with the Club and we have been very busy over the weekend with our emergency response. Clearly a major incident and we are doing all we can to support the members,"" Steamship said.
Seventy percent of the value of Sanchi itself is covered by 11 international insurers, led by Norway's Skuld, with the other 30 percent covered by Iranian insurers, according to Skuld Chief Executive Stale Hansen.
Skuld also covers the Hong Kong-flagged CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) for protection and indemnity while the vessel's hull is covered by a Chinese insurer.
""The major issue with this case is going to be the banking issue,"" said a shipping source familiar with the incident. ""There is a degree of paralysis among banks.""
CHINESE BANKS?
An Iranian government official acknowledged that when it came to the collision involving Sanchi there may be banking issues, though he was optimistic a solution could be found.
""Major banks still refuse to do money transactions with Iran but there are tens of smaller banks willing to do such businesses,"" the official said.
""Also, this is an extraordinary situation ... Asian banks, especially Chinese banks, will surely help. There are several methods, including using local currencies or paying Iran's debts somewhere else,"" he said.
Chinese banks, however, have become more reticent about doing some business with Iran.
Iranian media reported in October that some had closed accounts of certain Iranian nationals in China due to tougher enforcement by Chinese banks of money laundering rules. FATF, an international body that monitors money laundering worldwide, has kept Iran on its blacklist of high-risk countries.
Andrew Bardot, executive officer of the International Group of P&I Clubs - the umbrella association for ship insurers that provide cover for pollution and injury claims - said any problems with compensation payments from the incident would stem from the banking sector rather than issues about legality.

""That being said, there are banks who have been and are able to facilitate Iranian related payments, which in the recent experience of the (International) Group have proved effective,"" he said.

The vessel was detected sailing near the Greek island of Crete on Saturday. Authorities found 29 containers carrying materials including ammonium nitrate, non-electric detonators and 11 empty liquefied petroleum gas tanks.
""The materials were headed to Libya,"" Rear Admiral Ioannis Argiriou told reporters. He said the material could be used ""for all sorts of work, from work in quarries to making bombs and acts of terrorism"".
European Union and United Nations-imposed arms embargoes have prohibited the sale, supply or transfer of arms to Libya since 2011.
According to the ship's bill of lading, the cargo had been loaded in the Turkish ports of Mersin and Iskenderum and was destined for Djibouti and Oman.
But the coastguard said a preliminary investigation found the captain had been ordered by the vessel's owner to sail to the Libyan city of Misrata to unload and deliver the entire cargo.
No shipping maps were found on the ship's logbook for the Djibouti and Oman areas, the coastguard said. 
The eight-member crew has been arrested and will appear before a prosecutor on Thursday.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Countries along the Mekong River said on Wednesday they would reinforce security, trade and environmental cooperation in the face of concerns over competing demands on its waters, particularly given multiple dams being built by China.
The 4,350 km (2,700-mile) long Mekong, known as the Lancang in its upper reaches, flows from China along the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand through Cambodia and Vietnam, where it has supported farming and fishing communities for millennia.
Following an inaugural meeting of the Lancang Mekong Cooperation (MLC) forum in 2016, its member countries met for a second time in Phnom Penh at talks chaired jointly by China - an ever more dominant force in the region - and host nation Cambodia.
""Political and security cooperation is of crucial importance to the MLC initiative,"" they said in a statement. Cooperation on trade, transport tourism and environmental protection was also vital.
Despite the show of unity between the Mekong leaders, campaign group International Rivers said there were major concerns about the future of the river, with 20 dams planned on the upper Mekong in addition to eight already built.
""Over the past two decades, China's upstream dams have altered the river's natural flood-drought cycle and blocked the transport of sediment, drastically affecting ecosystems and fisheries downstream,"" said Maureen Harris, its Southeast Asia program director.
""Effective regional cooperation is urgently needed on the Mekong to ensure its sustainable development and management.""
Communities in Cambodia are as reliant as any on the river.
But the government is a strong backer of China's positions and has won billions of dollars in Chinese aid and investment as well as political support at a time when it is facing criticism from Western donors for eliminating the main opposition party.

In an article in the Khmer Times newspaper, Chinese premier Li Keqiang said the Mekong meeting and his official visit on Thursday would further strengthen the relationship.

BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - European powers will reaffirm on Thursday their support for the Iran nuclear deal that Donald Trump has rejected, EU diplomats said, on the eve of a deadline for the U.S. president to decide whether to reimpose oil sanctions lifted under the agreement. 
At a meeting with Iran, Britain, France, and Germany, convened by the EU's top diplomat Federica Mogherini, the European powers that helped negotiate the 2015 accord will reassure Tehran they remain committed to it. 
They will also urge Iran to continue to comply with international inspectors, the diplomats said. Tehran has always denied seeking nuclear arms.
""The aim is to send a message to Washington that Iran is complying and that it is better to have the nuclear agreement than to isolate Tehran,"" one diplomat said.
A second diplomat said: ""The date of the meeting is not a coincidence ... It's a campaign that we have carried on since October,"" referring to Trump's decision not to certify that Tehran is meeting the terms of a pact to stop it developing nuclear weapons. 
A spokesman for Iran's atomic energy agency said on Wednesday that a reimposition of sanctions by the United States would be a violation of the nuclear deal and added that the Islamic Republic had the capacity to greatly increase its enrichment of uranium.
The foreign ministers of Britain, Germany, France as well as Iran's Mohammad Javad Zarif, are expected to meet on Thursday morning with Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief. 
The Thursday meeting in Brussels is part of diplomacy on both sides of the Atlantic before deadlines related to the deal falling this month, including deciding whether to reimpose oil sanctions lifted under the deal. 
Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil exports under the terms of the pact. The State Department said on Tuesday the Trump administration was expected to decide on Friday.
The decision comes as Iran's government deals with protests over economic hardships and corruption that are linked to frustration among younger Iranians who hoped to see more benefits from the lifting of sanctions.
Retired U.S. military officers, members of the U.S. Congress and former U.S. ambassadors were among 52 U.S. national security experts who signed a letter released on Monday urging Trump not to jeopardize the deal with Iran.
European countries including France and Italy have benefited from renewed trade with Iran, whose proven natural gas reserves are as vast as Russia's, while Britain reopened its embassy in Tehran following the deal. 
If Trump reimposes sanctions on Tehran, European powers fear the deal would fall apart. The EU is adamant the deal cannot be renegotiated.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - European Union observers of Kenya's 2017 presidential and parliamentary elections said on Wednesday that a lack of government cooperation meant they were unable to travel to the East African nation to present their final report on the vote. 
Chief observer Marietje Schaake said the EU mission was scheduled to present its final report to the government and other groups in Kenya this week. The report must be published within three months of the vote, per the mission's agreement with the government. 
""It was made very clear [by the government] that there was no willingness and no preparedness to meet us now,"" she told Reuters by phone from Brussels, where she gave a press conference on Wednesday to release the report. 
""We need to know we can be received properly, because of issues like security concerns.""
She said she could not speculate on why the mission was rebuffed but said it had been criticized by both the ruling party and the opposition and intimidated during its observation of the turbulent electoral period in Kenya.
President Uhuru Kenyatta won an October re-run of the August presidential election and was sworn in for second five-year term in November. The Supreme Court nullified the first presidential election over irregularities.
The extended election season in East Africa's richest economy was marred by violence between police and protesters and by an opposition boycott of the repeat vote. 
It is very rare, Schaake said, for EU election missions not to return to the host country to present their conclusions, she said, recalling only a handful of times in more than 150 such missions. 
Johnson Weru, Kenya's ambassador to Belgium and the EU, rejected Schaake's claim, saying they observation mission had confirmed a visit between mid-February to mid-March to release the report.
""The Government ... regrets the unprocedural and premature manner in which the Final Report on the EU Election Observation Mission has been released by ... Schaake,"" he said in a statement.
The EU report concluded that the election commission had performed better in the October re-run than in the initial August poll, but that a persistent lack of trust in the institution by the opposition and other stakeholders affected the credibility of the process.
Other key concerns raised in the report were ""intimidation by politicians from both sides of independent institutions, such as the [election commission] IEBC and the judiciary, some violence by opposition protesters and the use of disproportionate force by security forces."" 
Schaake said the EU has ""continuously called for dialogue to overcome the deep polarization"" caused by the elections. She said it did not seem that this dialogue was occurring.

As Kenyatta was sworn in, police teargassed the convoy of opposition leader Raila Odinga, who has repeatedly promised his supporters that he himself will be ""sworn"" in as what he calls the ""people's president"".

Police in the capital of Sudan fired tear gas on Wednesday to disperse stone-throwing students protesting against a doubling of bread prices. 
Police vehicles sealed off main roads leading to the university, forcing about 400 demonstrators onto the campus of Khartoum University, and continued to fire tear gas at the students who chanted “No, no to price rises”.
Street protests broke out across the sprawling northeast African country after bread prices doubled following a government announcement late last month that it was eliminating subsidies in its 2018 budget.
A high school student was killed and six others wounded on Sunday in the southwestern city of Geneina.
Sudan this month devalued its pound currency to 18 per U.S. dollar from 6.7 previously.
Hard currency remains scarce in the formal banking system however, forcing importers to resort to an increasingly expensive black market.
Amid the continuing unrest, the currency weakened to 30.5 pounds to the dollar on Tuesday on the black market, compared with 29.5 on Monday.
Addressing parliament on Wednesday, State Minister for Finance Magdi Hassan Yassin called price rises the result of ""black market manipulation of the exchange rate"" and said the ministry and central bank were working to shut it down, without specifying how.
Annual inflation stood at 24.76 percent in November, the latest available reading.
The government has ruled out floating its currency, a measure the International Monetary Fund has urged it to take as part of broader reforms it says are needed to attract investment and revive a reeling economy.
""The rise in prices is not related to the devaluation of the official exchange rate from 6.7 pounds to 18 pounds, because there have been government efforts to reduce the prices of staple consumer goods,"" Yassin said.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Two civilians were killed when officers fired live rounds to disburse crowds that attacked a police station in Pakistan on Wednesday in a protest over the rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl.
Police recovered the body of Zainab Ansari on Tuesday from a garbage dumpster in the town of Kasur in eastern Pakistan, four days after she was reported missing.
It was the twelfth incident of a girl being adducted, raped, and killed in the past year in Kasur district, police say. Residents have been furious at the authorities for what they see as a failure to investigate such cases.
The spokesman for Pakistan's Punjab province, Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan, told Reuters that protesters turned violent and attacked a local police office. 
""They started throwing stones at the office and some of armed protesters shot bullets at police. In order to stop them, police resorted to aerial firing,"" Khan said, adding that two people were killed and one wounded as a result. 
Locals said police responded with undue force. 
""A peaceful protest was taking place, some students threw stones and police responded by firing at the crowd,"" Saleem ur Rehman, a resident who was at the protest, told Reuters. ""The law and order situation here is really bad and there have been many such incidents. That is what the protest was about.""
Ansari's parents, who were not in the country when their daughter was kidnapped, returned on Wednesday.
""I want justice! I want justice!"" Zainab's mother cried, surrounded by reporters at the international airport in the capital Islamabad. 
Ansari's case has attracted the attention of the country's civilian and military leadership, with Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif calling for immediate action. 
Police in Kasur deny they have been lax in investigating child abductions in the town. Regional police officer Zulfiqar Hameed told Reuters that four kidnappers had been arrested and another killed during an arrest attempt. 
""Investigations reveal that in each case a pedophile kidnaps little girls, rapes them and kills them,"" he said. 
The case of Ansari would soon be solved, he said: ""We have got CCTV footage that shows a young man taking her along. We will catch him very soon,"" he said, adding that 95 DNA samples had been taken from suspects.
A number of police officials have been transferred out of the region for failing to investigate complaints of missing children since 2015, when authorities uncovered what they called a pedophile ring linked to a prominent local family. At least two people have been convicted in the case, in which authorities say hundreds of children in the district were abused.

Scottish ministers are unhappy with several elements of May's approach to legally enacting Britain's exit from the European Union, including the way that powers reclaimed from Brussels will be distributed back to Scotland.
May's government says she expects to have to seek permission from Scotland's devolved parliament to enact her exit plan via legislation known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which is going through the British parliament.. 
The Scottish government has said it is not willing to give its consent until concerns about devolution are addressed.
With that in mind, Scotland's ministers said they wanted to start contingency planning by preparing the Scottish parliament for the introduction of its own bill designed to ensure legal continuity after leaving the EU.
""As things stand, we need to prepare responsibly for the possibility of consent being withheld. To that end, our officials are developing a Continuity Bill for Scotland,"" said a letter signed by Scotland's Brexit negotiator Michael Russell and parliamentary business minister Joe Fitzpatrick.
The letter to Scotland's parliament said their first preference was to negotiate assurances and safeguards from the British government over May's plan. But, if those talks failed to produce a compromise, they would probably seek to start legislating on their own plan in February.

""The purpose of introducing the bill is to ensure that Scotland's laws can be prepared for the effects of EU withdrawal even if it does not prove possible to rely on the UK Bill,"" the letter said.

""Villagers and members of the security forces have confessed that they committed murder,"" the military said in a statement.
It was a rare admission of wrongdoing by the Myanmar military during its operations in the western state of Rakhine.
The army launched a sweeping counteroffensive in the north of the state in response to Rohingya militant attacks on Aug. 25, triggering an exodus of more than 650,000 Rohingya Muslim villagers.
The United Nations has condemned the army's campaign as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar denies that, saying its forces were carrying out legitimate counterinsurgency operations.
The military announced on Dec. 18 that a mass grave containing 10 bodies had been found at the coastal village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe. The army appointed a senior officer to investigate.
The military said on Wednesday its investigation had found that members of the security forces had killed the 10 and that action would be taken against them.
Security forces had been conducting a ""clearance operation"" in the area on Sept. 1 when ""200 Bengali terrorists attacked using sticks and swords"", the military said in a statement posted on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of its commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.
The military refers to members of the Rohingya Muslim minority as ""Bengalis"", a term the Rohingya reject as implying they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh.
Ten of the attackers were captured after the security forces drove the rest off by firing into the air, according to the statement on Facebook, which the military often uses to make announcements.
The captives should have been handed over to the police, in line with procedures, but the militants were attacking ""continuously"" and had destroyed two military vehicles with explosives, it said.
""It was found that there were no conditions to transfer the 10 Bengali terrorists to the police station and so it was decided to kill them,"" the military said, referring to the findings of the investigating team.
Angry ethnic Rakhine Buddhist villagers, who had lost relatives in militant attacks, wanted to kill the captives, and stabbed them after forcing them into a grave on the outskirts of the village. Then members of the security forces shot them dead, the military said.
""Action will be taken against the villagers ... and the security force members who violated the rules of engagement according to the law,"" the statement said. 
Action would also be taken against those who had failed to report the incident to their seniors, and those responsible for supervising the operation, it added.
The military investigation was led by Lieutenant General Aye Win. The same officer had been in charge of a wider probe into the conduct of troops in the conflict that concluded in a report in November that no atrocities had taken place.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Soldiers in Ivory Coast's second largest city looted weapons from the base of a rival elite military unit before setting it on fire during an overnight clash, leaders of the faction that carried out the raid said on Wednesday.
The soldiers, who were involved in a series of mutinies last year that tarnished the image of Ivory Coast, one of Africa's fastest growing economies, accuse the elite unit, known as the CCDO, of spying on them. 
Gunshots and heavy weapons fire erupted between the rival factions late on Tuesday, though residents said the situation on Wednesday was calm after some early sporadic gunfire, and businesses were operating normally.
""We entered the CCDO camp around midnight and took all of their arms and ammunitions,"" one of the faction's leaders, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. ""Their troops fled the camp but we are looking for them."" 
A government spokesman said that there were no deaths in the clash and about 100 troops along with armoured vehicles and attack helicopters had been sent to Bouake to reinforce security. 
Footage of the damage at the CCDO base broadcast on state television showed burned vehicles and offices gutted by fire. Authorities said they were carrying out an investigation into the attack.
The CCDO is a rapid-reaction unit composed of army soldiers, paramilitary gendarmes and police officers.
""We have to stop this. I've asked the soldiers to keep their heads. No matter what their demands are, they can't launch such brutal protests,"" Nicolas Djibo, Bouake's mayor, told state broadcaster RTI. 
Bouake, in the centre of the west African nation, was the epicentre of several months of army mutinies last year that spread across the nation, forcing the government to yield to demands for bonuses and promotions.
Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa grower, emerged from a decade-long political crisis as a rising African economic star and a darling of international investors.

But last year's instability laid bare the dangerous divisions that still persist within an army cobbled together from rival rebel and loyalist factions at the end of a 2011 civil war.

Conditions in the enclave, the last major rebel-held zone near Damascus and where at least 390,000 civilians have been besieged for four years, amount to a humanitarian catastrophe, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said.
""Residential areas are being hit day and night by strikes from the ground and from the air, forcing civilians to hide in basements,"" he said in a statement.
Zeid said warring parties were obliged by law to distinguish between civilians and lawful military targets, and reports from Eastern Ghouta suggested of the attackers were flouting those principles, ""raising concerns that war crimes may have been committed.""
Among the dead civilians were 21 women and 30 children, Zeid said.
Backed by Russian strikes, Syrian government forces have escalated military operations against Eastern Ghouta in recent months. Russia rejects accusations that its jets have been targeting civilians.
Zeid said failure to evacuate urgent medical cases from the enclave was also against international humanitarian law.
Armed opposition groups holed up in Eastern Ghouta had also continued to fire rockets into residential areas of Damascus, which he said caused terror among the population.

A rocket landed near a bakery in Old Damascus on Jan. 4, killing a woman and injuring 13 other civilians, he said.

Anti-Semitism remains a sensitive issue in Germany, one of Israel's closest allies, more than 70 years after the end of the Nazi-era Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed.
The government decried as shameful the spectacle of the Israeli flag being burned at demonstrations last month against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Josef Schuster, head of the Central Council of Jews expressed support for a proposal by Sawsan Chebli, a Berlin state senator, for mandatory visits by newly arrived refugees to Nazi concentration camps memorials.
""People who have fled to us who have themselves had to escape or been expelled, can develop empathy in such memorials,"" Schuster told Deutschlandfunk radio on Wednesday.
Germany has received well over a million migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
Germany is home today to an estimated 200,000 Jews and has built a reputation in recent decades as a tolerant, safe place for Jews to live - though data shows anti-Semitic crimes reported to the police rose 4 percent to 681 in the first eight months of 2017 from the same period in 2016.
""It makes sense for everyone living in this country to be obliged to visit a concentration camp memorial site at least once in their lives,"" Chebli told Bild am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday when she first floated the proposal.
She said such visits, long a staple of high school education in a country determined that the lessons of its history not be forgotten, should also be extended to new migrants, who should make trips as part of their compulsory integration courses.
Currently, the integration courses focus on learning the German language and about Germany's history, culture and its legal system
Asked about the possibility of mandatory visits to concentration camps, a spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ministry said the integration course for immigrants already had a module regarding the consequences of the Nazi rule for the people of Germany and Europe.
Last month, Germany's justice minister called for more emphasis on the Holocaust in migrants' integration courses. 
Schuster said everyone who wanted to live permanently in Germany must identify with its history.
Such visits, which should be prepared by schools, would show where anti-Semitism and hatred for Jews could lead, he said.

""I generally believe that with added effort to explain our intentions we will be able to clarify misunderstandings,"" he said. ""I believe dialogue will lead to de-escalation."" 
But he sidestepped a question on whether Poland would be willing to offer concessions on judicial reform which lies at the heart of Warsaw's dispute with Brussels.
The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party which follows a nationalistic agenda sees the reforms as a fundamental part of its efforts to overhaul Poland's democratic institutions.
The PiS believes they are needed because the country has lost sight of its Catholic roots and is steeped in mentality and power structures dating to the post-war communist era.
Critics say that the government's efforts to wield control over courts and public media are tilting Poland toward authoritarian rule.
Morawiecki, speaking to foreign media on Wednesday, said the country wanted to play a constructive role in talks about the future of the EU.
The PiS carried out a government reshuffle on Tuesday, removing some of the most criticized ministers, such as defense, health, environment, and foreign affairs from Morawiecki's team.

Some analysts say the move was aimed at improving the PiS's image externally and internally as it faces up to the spat with the EU and looks ahead to local elections this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May will meet executives from major finance companies on Thursday to give them a clearer idea of what Britain's European Union exit will mean for them.
There are concerns that Brexit threatens London's status as the financial capital of Europe and that banks are preparing to move thousands of jobs to the continent to preserve their access to the EU's single market.
The meeting is one of a regular series with business leaders and will also be attended by finance minister Philip Hammond and junior Brexit minister Robin Walker, a spokesman for May said. 
A stand-off between Britain and the EU over the future access to single market for London's vast financial services industry is shaping up to be one of the key Brexit battlegrounds before Britain is due to leave the bloc in March 2019.
Britain and the EU will soon begin the much harder task of defining their future trading relationship, after settling the broad terms of their divorce settlement last month.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said there will be no special deal for one of Britain's most important industries, which accounts for more than 10 percent of GDP.
But British officials are confident the EU will be flexible, partly because they say European countries risk damaging their own economies if they are cut off from London's markets.
Chancellor Philip Hammond and Brexit minister David Davis, who are visiting Germany, wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that giving Britain a good trade deal could help avert ""such a catastrophe"" as another financial crisis.
""We must re-double our collective effort to ensure that we do not put that hard-earned financial stability at risk, by getting a deal that supports collaboration within the European banking sector, rather than forcing it to fragment,"" they said.
Among those due to attend Thursday's meeting are Jes Staley, chief executive of  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Mark Wilson, chief executive of insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV), and Richard Gnodde, chief executive of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) International, sources familiar with the matter said. 
The firms involved declined to comment.
Britain's financial sector employs 2.2 million people and its executives say the industry deserves to be a priority in the Brexit negotiations because it is the country's largest exporter and accounts for about 12 percent of its tax revenues.
But banks and insurers are already enacting contingency plans to shift parts of their European operations from Britain if Brexit means the country does not maintain access to the EU single market.
The Bank of England has said it is plausible that 10,000 jobs may leave by the time Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.

Consultants such as Oliver Wyman have forecast losses of 75,000 or far higher, although over several years.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",U.N. endorses elections for Libya by end of 2018,"By Ahmed Elumami
TRIPOLI (Reuters) - The United Nations is committed to helping Libya organize elections by the end of this year, encouraged by the rate at which Libyans have been registering to vote, a top U.N. official said on Wednesday.
The U.N. hopes elections can help stabilize Libya, which was thrown into turmoil after long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.
Holding elections is a major challenge in a country still split among military and political factions, and where rival governments have claimed authority since the result of a 2014 vote was disputed. Security in many parts of Libya is poor.
A new electoral law would likely have to be agreed and a referendum on a constitution held before national polls. 
A U.N. effort launched in September aims to amend a December 2015 peace plan for Libya and pave the way for a vote, but has so far produced no deal on how to move toward one.
Jeffrey Feltman, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, said the U.N. saw elections this year as a route to a ""peaceful and inclusive end to the transition phase"".
""The goal is a Libyan goal: to end the transition phase with an inclusive peaceful process that produces a unified government that is a product of the will of the Libyan people,"" Feltman told reporters in Tripoli after meeting Fayez Seraj, head of the internationally recognized government. 
""I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister about the commitment of the secretary-general, the hope of the United Nations, to see inclusive elections take place in 2018, and to pledge the support of the United Nations to support those elections.""
Feltman said the U.N. had been ""very encouraged"" by the apparent enthusiasm for elections, pointing to around half a million new voters who have signed up since voter registration was opened in early December.
""Public opinion poll after public opinion poll demonstrate the strong support of the majority of Libyans from all parts of the country to be able to participate in credible elections and to be able to participate in credible elections in this year,"" he said.
Libya's election commission says a total of 1,965,450 people are now registered to vote, out of a population of more than six million. Turnout in the 2014 election was just 630,000. The polls led to a battle for control of Tripoli, and to rival governments being set up in the capital and in eastern Libya.
The government in the east is aligned with powerful military commander Khalifa Haftar, a likely contender in any presidential poll.

The Vatican said on Wednesday that the office of the pope's almoner, which manages his local charity disbursements and activities, had arranged for 2,100 people to take in a show at the Medrano Circus on Rome's outskirts.
The Vatican arranged for tickets for the Thursday afternoon performance for poor, homeless, a group of prisoners, children of needy families, volunteers and care givers.
In 2016, a court in the northern city of Padua handed down an eight-month suspended sentence to an administrator of the circus following accusations by animal rights advocates that its animals were mistreated.
Salvatore Mendola, a manager and spokesman for the circus, said the charges were denied at the time and that the case was still in the appeals process.
Mendola told Reuters on Wednesday that the circus was now under a different administrator.
""We treat our animals very well. We have to get permission to hold shows in each city and are inspected by veterinarians before permission is given,"" he said.
""Our animals are super-controlled,"" he said.
The Vatican said a mobile medical clinic would be on hand outside the circus tent on Thursday to treat the visitors' routine health problems.

In recent years, the pope has set up places for the homeless to get showers, hair cuts and shaves near the Vatican. He has also offered them a private tour of the Sistine Chapel and last November hosted about 7,000 of them to a gourmet meal at the Vatican.

24,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Hong Kong's legal chief vows not to resign over unauthorized home improvements,"By James Pomfret and Venus Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's new justice secretary on Wednesday vowed not to resign despite a scandal over unauthorized structures in her home that called into question her integrity as the Asian financial hub's top legal official.
Critics say the perception that Teresa Cheng, a lawyer and chartered civil engineer by training, knowingly broke the law could further damage waning public confidence in Hong Kong's vaunted rule of law.
Cheng, who only took office last Saturday, apologized for what she called ""an oversight"", saying all but one of the structures were already in place when she bought the three-storey house in 2008.
""This particular incident has given me a lot to learn and actually allows me to strengthen myself in performing my duties as the Secretary for Justice in the future,"" Cheng told a news conference. ""I won't resign.""
People in space-starved Hong Kong are highly sensitive to the issue of unauthorized structures, with wealthy home owners often opting for such additions to optimize space.
Similar scandals have hit other senior officials, such as former leader Leung Chun-ying, and former chief secretary Henry Tang, whose quest to be Hong Kong's next leader suffered from 2012 revelations of his ""palatial"" basement and wine cellar.
""It isn't befitting for a Secretary of Justice who is considered a guardian angel of the rule of law,"" said pro-democracy politician and barrister Alan Leong, while adding that illegal construction was not a grave crime.
Cheng's office made no immediate response to emailed questions from Reuters.
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has defended Cheng publicly, saying she had not covered up anything.
The rule of law and an independent judiciary have long been seen as key pillars in the success of the former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and enjoys a high degree of autonomy under a ""one country, two systems"" arrangement.
In recent years, however, China has weighed into the city's legal system on a number of occasions, such as a legal interpretation that led to the disqualification of opposition lawmakers from the legislature.
Several cases in which democracy activists and police officers were jailed have also provoked criticism of judges. Hundreds of lawyers held two rare protest marches in recent years to voice concerns about China's interference.
The Buildings Department told Reuters its inspectors were initially barred from entering Cheng's nearly $3-million villa when the scandal first broke.
But when allowed in on a repeat visit on Tuesday, the inspectors discovered nine unauthorized structures, including a basement, a swimming pool and a rooftop den with French windows in Cheng's house and an adjoining one owned by her husband. 
Land records reviewed by Reuters show Cheng bought the property through a company called Sparkle Star Development Limited. Her husband, Otto Poon, who lives next door, bought his house in 2012. They married in 2016.
Cheng said a rectification proposal was submitted to the Buildings Department on Wednesday, adding that neither she nor her husband, a past president of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers, was trained to identify illegal structures.

""One doesn't look at a thing and know whether it's illegal,"" said Cheng, who has been a member of government-linked housing panels and co-authored a book on construction law.

Alexandre Djouhri, 58, was arrested at London's Heathrow Airport on Sunday on an international arrest warrant issued by France.
He appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court to apply for bail which was granted on condition that he pays security of one million pounds ($1.35 million), surrenders his passport, lives in a specified area of London and reports to police daily.
A full extradition hearing will start on April 17. 
Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, has always denied receiving any illicit campaign funding and has dismissed the Libyan allegations as ""grotesque"". 
Djouhri opposes extradition to France. His lawyer Mark Summers said there was a ""political genesis"" to the allegations against him and noted that a French inquiry into them has been running for several years with no decision having been made to charge anyone.
""As far as the main allegations are concerned, the understanding is that there hasn’t been any evidence uncovered,"" Summers told the court.
He said that Djouhri, who holds joint French and Algerian nationality, is a company director of a firm that deals with sanitation, water treatment and solar energy, earning about 200,000 pounds a year and has been based in Switzerland since the 1990s.
According to French media reports over the years, Djouhri had a long career acting as a discreet intermediary between business and political figures in France and North Africa.
Sarkozy has been ordered to stand trial in a separate campaign finance investigation related to events in 2012, when he ran for a second term but was defeated by Francois Hollande.

Six Arab foreign ministers who met in Amman last week said Arab states would embark on a diplomatic drive to persuade the United Nations to recognize a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital on territory captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
Arab foreign ministers said in an emergency meeting held following Trump's decision on December 6 that the move would spur violence throughout the region. They described Trump's announcement as a ""dangerous violation of international law"" which had no legal impact.
In recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy, imperiling Middle East peace efforts and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies alike.

The status of Jerusalem - home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions - is one of the biggest obstacles to reaching a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

27,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Berlusconi's coalition rises in polls ahead of Italian vote,"By Isla Binnie
ROME (Reuters) - A center-right coalition around former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's party is steadily climbing in opinion polls as a campaign heats up for Italy's elections on March 4.
Surveys conducted by Tecne and IPR showed the centre-right far outstripping both a center-left coalition led by the ruling Democratic Party (PD), and Italy's single most popular party, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
Italy's complex electoral mix of proportional representation and first-past-the-post makes a hung parliament likely, stoking fears political instability could stunt a modest recovery in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
But Berlusconi's group looks ""very close"" to being able to obtain a parliamentary majority, said Tecne chairman Carlo Buttaroni. 
The four-time prime minister cannot personally stand for office because of a 2013 conviction for tax fraud.
Support from 39.2 percent of voters in the Tecne poll takes it toward the 40 percent which is considered the necessary base for a bloc to have a realistic chance of governing alone. The IPR poll gave it 38 percent. 
As well as clearing this threshold, a party or coalition must beat the second-placed hopefuls by more than 12 percentage points, Buttaroni said. Both Tecne and IPR showed the second-placed 5-Star lagging by 10 percentage points or more.
As support for the PD erodes, 5-Star now comfortably beats it as the most popular party, with a lead of six points according to IPR and more than seven according to Tecne. 
Parties across the spectrum have pledged to change or scrap European Union budget rules, cut taxes and spend more.
Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and its main ally, the anti-immigration Northern League, have also pledged to change or abolish reforms of pensions and the labor market which have been welcomed by the European Union.
Following a joint pledge over the weekend to halt planned increases in the retirement age, Berlusconi was asked on Wednesday by state radio RAI whether he would scrap the ""Jobs Act"" that was the flagship reform of former prime minister Matteo Renzi.
Berlusconi said, ""Yes, because it was an injection that gave a temporary boost, but only to fixed-term contracts."" All of the jobs created in the three months to November last year were temporary contracts, data showed on Tuesday. 
Support for the PD has slumped to 22.0 percent according to IPR and 20.7 percent according to Tecne. Adding in their allies, the whole center-left coalition scores 27.5 percent and 25 percent in the respective polls. 
Renzi is leading the PD into the election a little more than a year after resigning when Italians voted against a constitutional reform he proposed in a referendum.
""For the PD (and voters), it's like two people who were once in love,"" Buttaroni said. ""The referendum was like a break-up, then every attempt to rebuild that relationship is irritating."" 

Despite being set to get more votes than any other party, 5-Star's opposition to coalition-building means it is considered unlikely to get the first chance to try to form a government.

28,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>","France worried by Syrian army offensive in Idlib, wants Astana deal respected","PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday it was ""extremely concerned"" by a Syrian government offensive in the rebel-held northwestern province of Idlib and demanded that commitments made at an international deal in Astana to reduce hostilities be respected.
Nearly three million people are believed to be in the Idlib region, their numbers swelled by fighters and civilians who fled Syrian army advances elsewhere in the country.
""France condemns the intense bombardments carried out by the Bashar al-Assad regime's air force and its allies in the Idlib region in recent days, particularly those targeting the civilian population and several hospitals,"" France's foreign ministry said in a statement. 
It added that deliberately targeting health centers constituted a violation of international law.
The Syrian army, supported by Iran-backed militias and Russian air power, began an offensive in late October in Hama province. By the end of last week, they had advanced into Idlib, close to an insurgent-held military airport.
The fighting and air strikes have forced more than 60,000 people to leave their homes since Nov. 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
The area is part of a de-escalation zone agreement in the Kazakh capital Astana last year between Turkey, which supports rebel groups, and Assad allies Iran and Russia. 
""We ask that the commitments made in Astana be respected, so that the violence stops as soon as possible. Safe, comprehensive and unimpeded humanitarian access to all people in need must be ensured immediately,"" the ministry added.
It also said it was ""outraged"" by the ongoing siege in Eastern Ghouta, another rebel-held area, where the U.N. human rights chief said on Wednesday that at least 85 civilians have been killed since Dec. 31.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 07:53AM ET</span>","Turkey urges Russia, Iran to stop Syrian army offensive in Idlib","By Tuvan Gumrukcu
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey called on Russia and Iran on Wednesday to pressure Syrian authorities to halt a military offensive in Syria's rebel-held Idlib province, which Damascus launched despite an international deal to reduce hostilities there.
As pro-government forces pressed the assault, the Russian defense ministry's newspaper said Moscow had asked the Turkish military to tighten control over armed groups in Idlib. It said militants had used the province as the launchpad for a drone attack on two Russian bases in the last week.
Idlib has become a focal point of the Syrian war as government forces and allied militia have thrust toward an insurgent-held air base. Idlib, bordering Turkey, is the largest single chunk of Syria still under the control of rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed grave concern for an estimated 2 million people in the Idlib region, where the population has grown as Syrian rebels and civilians fled government advances in other areas. Fresh conflict could trigger more displacement on Turkey's southern border.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Russia and Iran must fulfill their duties under a joint accord reached with Turkey last year in which the three countries announced a ""de-escalation zone"" in Idlib.
He said advances by the Syrian army and allied forces into Idlib could not have taken place without the support of Moscow and Tehran, which have both backed Assad in the war.
""Iran and Russia need to carry out their responsibilities. If you are guarantors, which you are, stop the regime,"" Cavusoglu told the state-run Anadolu news agency in an interview broadcast on Turkish television channels.
Cavusoglu's ministry summoned the Iranian and Russian ambassadors on Tuesday to complain about violations of the Idlib de-escalation zone, and he said President Tayyip Erdogan might call Russia's Vladimir Putin on the issue.
Turkey, which has been fiercely opposed to Assad, has recently been working with his allies Russia and Iran for a political resolution to the conflict. But Cavusoglu said the Idlib offensive was endangering those efforts. 
""This isn't a simple air strike, the regime is advancing into Idlib. The goal is different here,"" he said. ""If the aim here is to make some unwilling opposition groups go to Sochi, it will backfire,"" he added, referring to Russia's plans to host a congress on Syria at the end of this month.
In the first attack of its kind, Moscow said on Monday militants had used drones to attack its naval and air bases in the nearby provinces of Tartus and Latakia. The Russian defense ministry's newspaper said on Wednesday the drones had been launched from the south-western part of the Idlib de-escalation zone held by ""moderate opposition"" armed groups.
60,000 DISPLACED 
Syrian government forces have taken scores of villages in recent weeks near the provincial border between Idlib and Hama, with the help of Iran-backed militias and Russian air power. They have progressed toward the Abu al-Duhur military airport, where rebels completely ousted the army in 2015. 
The forces had advanced to within 3 km of the air base on Wednesday, said a military media unit run by Lebanon's Hezbollah, which fights on the Syrian army's side.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the army and allied militias captured 16 villages and positions on Wednesday. They clashed with Tahrir al-Sham fighters around the airport, the Britain-based war monitoring group said. 
The combatants also battled from another direction along a front south of Aleppo city, near the border with Idlib. 
Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al-Qaeda's former Syria branch is now the dominant insurgent force in the northwestern province of Idlib. 
Rebel groups seized Idlib, which borders Turkey, in 2015 and it has since become the only Syrian province fully under insurgent control.
Fighting and air strikes have forced more than 60,000 people to leave their homes since Nov. 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
""What I am seeing here is the use of the presence of al Nusra and HTS as an excuse to attack civilians and moderate oppositions,"" Cavusoglu added.
Under last year's deal with Iran and Russia, Turkey says it has deployed troops to observation points in northern Idlib, about 60 km (40 miles) north of the latest Syrian army offensive.
Cavusoglu said Ankara would host a meeting on Syria with like-minded countries after the summit in Russia's Sochi.
With Russian and Iranian backing, government forces have recovered large swathes of territory from rebel factions and Islamic State militants over the past year.

Assad and his allies now command the single largest chunk of Syria, followed by U.S.-backed Kurdish militias who control much of the north and east Syria and are more concerned with shoring up their regional autonomy than fighting Damascus.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 07:38AM ET</span>",The challenge of turning inter-Korean thaw into longer-term detente,"By Hyonhee Shin and Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - A day of smiles and jokes at the first inter-Korean talks in two years quickly evaporated Tuesday night when the North's chief negotiator threatened to walk out after the South Korean side brought up Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes. 
""We had started in a good spirit but this came to an icky mood,"" North Korea's lead delegate Ri Son Gwon complained in closing remarks. 
His rebuke highlights the challenges that lie ahead for Seoul after the 11 hours of talks yielded agreements to hold military talks and facilitate North Korea's participation in next month's Winter Olympics in South Korea.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in attained his immediate goal of getting North Korea to participate in the games - and reducing the chance its leader Kim Jong Un would disrupt the event with another missile or nuclear test. But turning the winter thaw into a longer-term detente will be far more daunting.
To do so, Moon must navigate a volatile mix of mutually exclusive policies, including North Korea's stance that its nuclear arsenal is non-negotiable and Washington's equally strident insistence that complete denuclearisation is the only acceptable outcome.
Seoul has proposed that the two Koreas make a show of unity by marching together at the Pyeongchang Olympics. The last time they did that was in January 2007 at the Asian Winter Games in Changchun, China, just three months after North Korea conducted its first nuclear test. 
The first U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang followed that nuclear test and over the next 12 years, international sanctions ramped up along with North Korea's increasingly sophisticated missile and nuclear tests, a cycle that has left Pyongyang increasingly isolated. Along the way, six-country talks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear programme became moribund.
Participation in the Olympics would help ease the North's isolation. And Pyongyang may hope South Korea could resume desperately needed economic aid at some point. Moon, after all, was once an advocate of former president Kim Dae Jung's ""sunshine policy"" of reconciliation with the North. 
""LARGER ISSUES""
Ri said he would not discuss North Korea's nuclear weapons programme with the South because its nuclear bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) are aimed ""thoroughly"" at the United States, not at its ""brethren"" in the South.
Seoul believes improved inter-Korean ties and a series of steps agreed on Tuesday could pave the way for discussion of a ""fundamental resolution"" of the nuclear issue in the future, the South's unification ministry said on Wednesday.
But the two Korea's can do little themselves about denuclearisation ""without having the United States on board,"" said Hwang In-sung, secretary-general of the secretariat of the presidential National Unification Advisory council in Seoul. 
South Korea should not repeat past failures where seemingly vigorous talks fell apart and ties froze in a flash, he said. 
""Given the mistrust and high bars set up by both North Korea and the U.S., we will need to drive the experience from Pyeongchang when it's over, in a way that contributes to the opening of nuclear negotiations"", Hwang told Reuters. 
The two Koreas initiated sports diplomacy in 1957 in an effort to form a unified team for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. That effort, however, ended in failure.
Culture and sports diplomacy between them since then has followed the ups and downs of their Cold War-era relations. The two countries remain technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armed truce that has yet to be replaced with a peace agreement. 
""Sports exchanges have their own limits given the complex dynamics surrounding the Korean Peninsula, but they can help rally public support and provide a boost for other serious issues to go forward"", said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.
SPORTS AND AID 
A high point came in 2000, when athletes from both sides marched together under a single flag depicting the Korean Peninsula during the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Sydney. 
Even back then, Seoul's offer of economic aid in return to facilitate such events was a source of contention in South Korea, which has lived with military threats from the North for decades. 
""While the hope is certainly that these things will lead to further political developments between the two, such cooperation has often ended without any larger-scale issues being solved"", said Benjamin Silberstein, associate scholar at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia.

""There are few signs to suggest that this time is any different, but it is still too soon to tell"".

U.S. President Donald Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue the suspension of U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports under the pact, which eased economic pressure on Tehran in exchange for limits on its nuclear programme.
""If the suspension is not continued it's a violation of the (nuclear deal) and the Islamic Republic of Iran will, of course, take the necessary actions,"" Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said in an interview with state TV.
He did not specify what such actions might be. Later in the interview, he said: “The capacity exists within the atomic energy agency to speed up nuclear work in various fields, particularly in the field of enrichment, which can be increased several times more than in the period before the nuclear agreement.” 
Enrichment, a process which can produce weapons-grade uranium, is restricted under the terms of the deal. Supporters of the pact insist that strong international monitoring will prevent Iran from developing nuclear bombs. Iran has denied that it wants to acquire nuclear weapons.
“The American government should think wisely,” Kamalvandi said in the interview. “Even though they have shown until now unfortunately that they are not thinking or acting wisely.”
The head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, said on Monday Tehran might reconsider its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if the United States failed to respect its commitments in the deal.
The IAEA, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It is scrutinising Iran’s compliance with the agreement.
Majid Takht Ravanchi, a senior aide to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, said on Wednesday Trump’s unpredictable personality made it difficult to foresee whether sanctions would be renewed.
“We are prepared for the worst-case scenario,” Takht Ravanchi said, according to state media. “Not only in the political field but even on the economic front.”

The National Liberation Army (ELN) and the government have been in peace talks in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, since the beginning of last year in a bid to end more than 53 years of fighting. Negotiations are expected to begin again on Wednesday.
The group's first-ever ceasefire, which began in October, ended without being extended as logistical problems prevented the two sides from meeting at the scheduled time on Monday, the government said.
The ELN has said it is not keen on extending the truce under original terms and wants a new deal drawn up. Center-right President Juan Manuel Santos has not said he would launch an immediate offensive against the group now that the ceasefire has ended. 
During the ceasefire, reached on Sept. 4, the insurgent group promised to suspend hostage taking, attacks on roads and oil installations, the use of landmines and the recruitment of minors. In turn, the government agreed to improve protection for community leaders and conditions for about 450 jailed rebels.
The 2,000-strong ELN, which has regularly bombed oil infrastructure and taken hostages, has clashed with other armed groups during the suspension of hostilities.
Santos, who leaves office this year, signed a peace deal with the larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in late 2016 after negotiations in Cuba that lasted four years. 
The FARC is now a political party with a candidate for president in May elections. 
Founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1964, the ELN has sought peace with the government before but made little progress. It is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union.

36,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>",Explosion on Iranian oil tanker forces rescue team to retreat,"By Josephine Mason and Yuna Park
BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - Rescue crews were forced to retreat from a stricken Iranian oil tanker in the East China Sea on Wednesday following an explosion on the ship as a fire raged for a fourth day after a dramatic collision.
The blast happened on board the tanker in the afternoon after rescue crews were dousing the ship with foam in an attempt to put out the fire, China's Transport Ministry (MOT) said in a statement on Wednesday.
The cause and damage to the tanker from the incident were not clear. The ship was carrying condensate, a highly flammable ultra-light crude, to deliver to South Korea when it collided with a Chinese freight ship on Saturday.
Dozens of rescue boats from China and South Korea have been battling strong winds, high waves and poisonous fumes to comb a 900-square-nautical-mile (3,100-square-kilometre) area for 31 missing sailors and tame the fire, amid growing concerns the listing ship may explode or sink.
Iran's Navy joined the effort on Wednesday, a government official said, according to the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA).
The lashing winds are expected to ease on Thursday, the MOT said.
The tanker Sanchi (IMO:9356608), run by Iran's top oil shipping operator, National Iranian Tanker Co, collided on Saturday with the CF Crystal (IMO:9497050), carrying grain from the United States, about 160 nautical miles (300 km) off China's coast near Shanghai. 
The Sanchi was carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate, equivalent to about 1 million barrels and worth some $60 million.
(Graphic on ship collision: http://tmsnrt.rs/2CBgqai)
The Chinese government said late on Tuesday it had not found a ""large-scale"" oil leak, and the condensate was burning off or evaporating so quickly that it would leave little residue - less than 1 percent - within five hours of a spill. That reduces the chances of a crude-style oil slick.
Iranian officials said there was still a chance of finding survivors among the 31 remaining crew, who are all Iranian nationals except for two Bangladeshi citizens. The body of a crew member was found on Monday in the water near the tanker.
""If the crew have been able to reach (...) some place like the engine room, then the chances of their rescue are high,"" said Hassan Qashqavi, a senior Iranian foreign ministry official, according to ISNA. 
""But if, God forbid, they have been caught up in explosions because of flames inside the ship, then the chance of their rescue is small.""
VULNERABLE TO BREAK-UP
Authorities and environmentalists worry though the ship is increasingly vulnerable to breaking up and sinking the longer the blaze rages. Still, the ultra light crude is highly volatile when exposed to air and water.
South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries warned on Wednesday the tanker could burn for up to one month, potentially expelling the tanker's bunker fuel, or the heavy fuel oil that powers a ship's engines and contaminating the waters.
""We believe flames would last for two weeks or a month considering previous cases of oil tank accidents,"" said Park Sung-dong, an official at the ministry.
Bunker fuel is the dirtiest kind of oil, extremely toxic when spilled, though much less explosive. 
Fuel oil is relatively easy to contain because volumes are lower and its viscosity means it's easier to extract from water, but even small volumes can hurt marine life. 
""The problem is the ship's heavy bunker fuel,"" said Chauncey Naylor, a U.S.-based director of emergency response and training at Tyco Corp's oil-fire specialists Williams Fire & Hazard Control, which is not involved in the clean-up. 
""It burns real slow and it's heavy and will lay on the ocean and on any twisted metal and create heavy smoke. It's the stuff that spills and gets on birds."" 
The Zhoushan fishing ground where the collision occurred is known as one of the biggest in the East China Sea, particularly for mackerel and croaker, according to Greenpeace. In 2016, the catch from the East China Sea was 5.18 million tonnes, making it China's largest fishing ground. 
A Suezmax tanker can hold a maximum of 5,000 tonnes of bunker fuel to keep it running. The Sanchi may have been carrying about 1,000 tonnes by the time it hit the grain freighter, according to bunker fuel traders' estimates.

Park said it's unlikely the oil will spread to South Korea at the moment because the tanker has moved 100 kilometres (62 miles) to the southeast.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rights activists said on Wednesday they suspected a set-up, a day after police in Chechnya detained a human rights activist, saying they had found a substance in his car that smelled like marijuana, a crime punishable by up to 10 years in jail. 
Chechnya's interior ministry said in a statement on Tuesday police had detained Oyub Titiev, who runs the office of the Memorial Human Rights Centre in Chechnya, which has reported disappearances, torture, and punitive house burnings in the internal majority-Muslim Russian republic.
Titiev's predecessor, Natalia Estemirova, was kidnapped and shot dead in 2009. Nobody has been convicted for her murder. Titiev continued her work, despite colleagues saying he received threats to desist. 
The interior ministry said police had found what looked like 180 grams of cannabis in Titiev's car after stopping him to check his documents. The substance has been sent for checks, it said. 
The illegal possession of such a quantity of cannabis is punishable with a jail term of between three and 10 years and a fine. Titiev says the drugs were planted. 
Katya Sokirianskaia, director at the Conflict Analysis and Prevention Centre and someone with extensive experience working in the region, told Reuters Titiev's detention looked like an attempt to squeeze Memorial and ""all remaining seeds of activism"" out of Chechnya.
U.S. SANCTIONS
Critics have accused the Kremlin of turning a blind eye to rights abuses in Chechnya saying it values stability above the rule of law. Chechnya fought two wars against Russia after the 1991 Soviet collapse, but now, in return for generous subsidies and a wide degree of autonomy, pledges loyalty to Moscow.
A Kremlin spokesman on Wednesday referred a question about Titiev's case to the police, saying specific allegations against the activist had been made. 
Sokirianskaia said Chechen officials had stepped up their rhetoric against rights defenders after the United States in December sanctioned Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed head of Chechnya, for alleged rights abuses. [nL1N1OK1A4]
Kadyrov was removed from the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram social networks as a result, platforms he used assiduously for public relations purposes. 
""The Chechen authorities directly blamed human rights defenders for this,"" said Sokirianskaia. 
Kadyrov, who calls himself a foot soldier of President Vladimir Putin, denies any abuses, casting his critics as being motivated by foreign grants and a desire to weaken Russia.
Tanya Lokshina, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, said framing people for drug crimes had ""become an increasingly frequent tactic used by Chechnya's authorities"" to punish and discredit their critics.""
Nils Muiznieks, the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, called on Russia to free Titiev immediately, saying he'd been detained ""under dubious charges that lack credibility.""

There was widespread local media speculation this week that Zuma's opponents in the ANC's newly elected 80-member national executive committee would raise a motion of no-confidence at its first meeting under new party leader Cyril Ramaphosa.
ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule told reporters at a break in the meeting that the only item on the agenda was the statement to be read by Ramaphosa on Jan. 8 to mark the 106th birthday of the ANC.
The rand briefly extended losses against the U.S. dollar. Zuma has been unpopular with investors.
""That matter was not for any discussion or debate,"" Magashule told reporters in response to a question about whether Zuma's future was raised.
""There was only one item on the agenda.""
Zuma has been weakened since Ramaphosa narrowly defeated Zuma's ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in an ANC leadership contest last month.
The ANC's NEC, which was elected at the party conference in December, is meeting in the quiet coastal town of East London.
Two senior committee members told Reuters Ramaphosa's faction in the ANC did not want to try to openly oust Zuma since the NEC was only elected a month ago and because Ramaphosa's victory was marginal.
There could be a less high-profile meeting of the NEC next week where a more serious discussion about Zuma leaving would be held, one of the senior party members said.

""Ramaphosa has to chart a very careful course so he can win broad ANC support and negotiate a dignified exit for Zuma,"" independent political analyst Daniel Silke said.

MADRID (Reuters) - The two main pro-independence parties in the Spanish region of Catalonia have agreed to back former leader Carles Puigdemont as candidate for regional head, raising the likelihood of a renewed push for a split from Spain this year.
Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) representative Jordi Xucla said on Wednesday that his party and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC)(Republican Left of Catalonia) will support Puigdemont's return to the job in which he spearheaded the independence push. 
""The Dec. 21 result gave us the mandate to reflect the majority. The presidential candidate will evidently be Puigdemont,"" Xucla told Spanish national radio.
Puigdemont is in self-imposed exile in Brussels and could be arrested if he returns to Spain. The other main potential candidate to represent the pro-independence parties would be ERC leader Oriol Junqueras, who is serving a custodial sentence in a Madrid jail. 
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called a regional election on Dec. 21 to resolve Spain's worst political crisis in decades after Catalan leaders declared independence in October following a banned referendum on secession.
Pro-independence parties achieved a slim majority of parliamentary seats in the election although they failed to get over 50 percent of the popular vote. The inconclusive results failed to resolve the crisis as it showed Catalans split between backing independence and unity with Spain. 
The new Catalan parliament will hold its first session on Jan. 17, the first step in reinstating local government after Madrid fired the old regional administration, led by Puigdemont, for illegally declaring independence.
Once the parliament is formed, potential leaders of the regional government will put themselves forward for a vote of confidence, although it could take months for a new government to emerge.

Many of the Catalan political leaders were arrested on charges of sedition and rebellion after the independence declaration, with three still behind bars pending a trial, while Puigdemont, with four of his cabinet members, fled to Brussels.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Social Democrats sounded downbeat about their coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on Wednesday, a day before both camps decide whether they want to move to formal negotiations on establishing a new government.
Merkel, weakened by an election setback in September, turned to the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) to seek a re-run of their so-called ""grand coalition"" after the collapse in November of talks on a three-way coalition untested at national level.
The chancellor, who has won widespread respect abroad in more than 12 years in power, needs the coalition talks to succeed in order to avoid her personal authority being further undermined and Germany's international standing diminished.
The Social Democrats know this, and are playing hard ball.
""The mood is like the weather,"" Ralf Stegner, one of the SPD's deputy leaders, said as he gazed at the cloudy sky above Berlin ahead of Wednesday's talks.
SPD leader Martin Schulz added: ""It will be a long day.""
As Europe's largest economy and pre-eminent power broker, Germany is crucial to the region's fortunes. Berlin's partners are eagerly awaiting a new German government to help drive forward Brexit talks, euro zone reform and EU diplomatic initiatives.
Senior officials from the SPD, Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have been holding exploratory talks this week on whether to pursue formal coalition negotiations.
The talks are due to conclude on Thursday, before SPD leaders recommend to their members whether they should shift into official negotiations.
""We have a lot of work ahead of us today and tomorrow,"" said conservative Finance Minister Peter Altmaier.
Participants have described the negotiations as ""good"", but SPD leaders need to convince their party members as they are offering them a vote on Jan. 21 on whether to proceed.
The leader of the Jusos youth branch of the SPD told broadcaster ARD that a deal between the coalition negotiators to drop plans to lower carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 ""was not a good start to these talks"".
Merkel has ruled with the SPD in a sometimes unwieldy ""grand coalition"" in two of her three previous terms in office, including in the last parliament from 2013-2017. But both parties bled support in the Sept. 24 election, which saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) enter the Bundestag (national parliament) for the first time.
Many in the SPD rank-and-file oppose a repeat of the grand coalition as they fear it will further diminish the identity of the party, which suffered its worst result in September's vote since 1933. Some SPD members are also concerned that a new grand coalition would make the AfD the main opposition party.
Despite such reticence, German media reported on Tuesday that conservative and SPD negotiators had reached agreement on a law to attract skilled immigrants.
Should the two biggest party groups fail to agree on moving ahead, Merkel could try to form a minority government or Germany could face new elections.

President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, eager to broker a deal, is keenly aware that the source of Germany's international clout is its economic might and that businesses want a stable coalition soon to end the uncertainty and avoid another vote.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani journalist, known for criticizing his country's military establishment, said on Wednesday he had narrowly escaped being kidnapped by armed men, in an incident that came months after he complained of being harassed by security services.
Taha Siddiqui, who reports for France 24 and is the Pakistan bureau chief of Indian television channel WION, said the attempted abduction took place while he was being driven by taxi to the airport serving the capital Islamabad and the neighboring, larger garrison city of Rawalpindi.
""I was on my way to airport today at 8:20 am when 10-12 armed men stopped my cab & forcibly tried to abduct me. I managed to escape. Safe and with police now,"" Siddiqui tweeted from a friend's Twitter account early in the morning.
""Looking for support in any way possible #StopEnforcedDisappearances,"" he added in the same tweet.
Rights groups have denounced the kidnappings of several social media activists over the past year as attempts to intimidate and silence critics of the Pakistan's security establishment. 
Last year, five Pakistani bloggers went missing for several weeks before four of them were released. All four fled abroad and two afterwards told media that they were tortured by a state intelligence agency during their disappearance.
The military has staunchly denied playing a role in any enforced disappearances, as has the civilian government. In the past, militants have also targeted journalists.
Siddiqui spoke to Reuters from a police station where he was filing a report on the incident, and described how his taxi was stopped on the highway when another vehicle swerved, and braked suddenly in front of it.
About a dozen men armed with rifles and revolvers pulled him out of the cab, beat him and ""threatened to kill"" him.
""They threw me in the back of the vehicle in which I had been traveling, but the door on the other side was open,"" Siddiqui said. 
""I jumped out and ran and was able to get into a taxi that was nearby, whose driver then floored it.""
In a police statement, seen by Reuters, Siddiqui said during the kidnap attempt he appealed for help from a military vehicle that was passing by.
""I saw a military vehicle and shouted for help but one of the abductors gestured (the vehicle) to move on and they did,"" Siddiqui said in the police statement, adding he had previously been ""intimidated"" by civilian and military security officials.
Siddiqui pleaded with police to help him recover his personal belongings - laptop computer, phone, hard drives, passport and suitcase - and provide him and his family with ""police protection"".
""My life is under threat,"" he said in the statement.
Last year, the Committee to Protect Journalists said ""Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency should stop harassing Taha Siddiqui"", referring to the civilian agency that last year began a crackdown on online criticism of the powerful military.

Siddiqui last year filed a court petition to stop the agency from harassing him.

Western Sahara has been contested since 1975 when Spanish colonial powers left. Morocco claimed the territory as it own and fought the 16-year war with the Polisario Front independence movement which established its self-declared Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.
The United Nations says the region has a right to self-determination and campaigners have sought to challenge the EU's trade deals with Morocco in the courts because they include the desert region.
Wednesday's opinion by the European Union Court of Justice's Advocate General Melchior Wathelet came in response to British-based campaigners who said Britain was wrong to uphold the EU-Morocco fisheries deal. Britain asked the ECJ for advice. 
""The fisheries exploitation by the EU of the waters adjacent to Western Sahara established and implemented by the contested acts does not respect the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination,"" Wathelet said.
Wathelet also said his opinion was based on the condition in international law that any wealth gained from exploiting Western Sahara's rich marine life should benefit its people.
The sparsely populated stretch of desert has offshore fishing as well as phosphate and possibly oil reserves.
The opinion, if followed up by a ruling from the ECJ, is likely reignite a diplomatic dispute between Brussels and Rabat that erupted in 2016 when the lower General Court ruled that the EU trade deals dating from 2000 and 2012 with Morocco were void. 
Morocco briefly suspended contact with the EU to lodge a legal appeal.
The EU's top court later overrode the lower court's decision, saying the trade accords were valid but could not include Western Sahara, appearing to sidestep the issue.
But the court still said that some EU fisheries in disputed coastal waters would be in violation of the ruling, as the court signaled deals signed with Morocco could not include Western Saharan resources as its inhabitants had not agreed to that.
The court adviser's latest opinion appeared to support that.
Wathelet said most of the waters fished in the EU-Morocco trade pacts were along Western Sahara's coast. On that basis Western Sahara should be paid for the fish exported to the EU. 
""The fisheries agreement does not contain the legal safeguards necessary for the fisheries exploitation to be for the benefit of the people of Western Sahara,"" he said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Private Islamic schools in Thailand's Muslim-dominated south will teach the history of past kings, a governor said on Wednesday, the Buddhist-majority nation's latest bid to bring peace to the strife-torn region, but one that could backfire.
The mostly Muslim southern provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala are home to an insurgency by ethnic Malay Muslims fighting for autonomy, in which more than 6,000 people have been killed since 2004.
Narathiwat governor Suraporn Prommool said 62 Islamic schools in the province would introduce the subject, dealing with the merits of Thai kings and national history, this year. 
""There are a few people who do not understand Thai history and use it to create conflict and violence,"" he told Reuters.
""This initiative will teach the merits of the kings and will create unity and love amongst Thai people.""
The move has provoked mixed feelings, however, said Artef Sokho, the head of a support group for conflict victims, the Network of Pattanians outside the Motherland.
""I don't understand what the Thai government wants out of this,"" Artef told Reuters, adding that some people in the region see the history as imposing on their Malay-Muslim identity.
""Thai nation-building history and the history of Pattani are incompatible ... people here feel they have more of a shared history with the Malay peninsula,"" Artef said.
Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat were part of an independent Malay Muslim sultanate before Thailand annexed them in 1909.
Insurgent attacks have long targeted government schools and teachers in the deep south, because they are seen as representatives of the Thai state.
""History in the Thai school curriculum is a centralized, Bangkok-focused version which doesn't give importance to the southern provinces,"" said independent analyst Rungrawee Chalermsripinyorat.
Successive Thai governments have initiated talks to reach peace with insurgent groups operating in the south but the talks have gone almost nowhere. 
The military has also tried programs to win ""hearts and minds"" in the region.
But several rights groups have accused the authorities of heavy-handed tactics, such as torturing suspected insurgents in custody. 
Despite court rulings that Muslim detainees were tortured in the south while in custody, no troops have ever been prosecuted.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 05:15AM ET</span>",Former Vietnam official points to ex-PM in high-profile trial,"By Mi Nguyen
HANOI (Reuters) - A former Vietnamese politburo member on trial over the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars at state oil firm PetroVietnam has testified that a key decision was taken by the previous prime minister, according to video published on local media.
Dinh La Thang is the most senior politician to face trial in decades, having been caught in a widening crackdown on corruption that intensified last year after Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong emerged as the winner in a power struggle with former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung. 
Thang is accused of deliberate mismanagement alongside 21 others who face the same charge, charges of embezzlement or both, in what is the most important trial of a widening crackdown on corruption.
He was asked by the court on Tuesday about the decision to assign the PetroVietnam Construction (PVC) subsidiary to the contract for the Thai Binh 2 thermal power plant project when it did not have the capacity to carry out the project.
""Assigning PVC was the right policy, with the decision of the Prime Minister of the government,"" according to video published by local media. Thang also described it as ""the policy of the politburo"" - of which he was not a member at the time.
Thang told the court that his impatience had led to the violation of regulations. Only state-backed media are allowed into the court hearings, but other Vietnamese media are allowed to watch a video feed in an adjacent room.
Reuters was unable to contact former prime minister Dung for comment.
Scores of people have been arrested in the anti-graft campaign as the security establishment gained influence after Trong defeated Dung in a power struggle for the Communist Party's top position in 2016.
Government critics have noted that many of those detained had prospered under Dung's administration.
Among the other officials on trial is Trinh Xuan Thanh, the former chairman of PetroVietnam Corruption, whose case grabbed world headlines last year when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping him from a Berlin park.
Thanh denied accusations made by witnesses in the court on Tuesday that he had handled bags of money sent as bribes to officials, the local VNexpress website reported. Thanh is accused over losses of more than $150 million.

A document reviewed by Reuters last year showed that Thanh had been cleared of wrongdoing by the previous government.

49,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 05:04AM ET</span>",Malaysia to pay U.S. firm up to $70 million if it finds missing MH370,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia signed a deal on Wednesday to pay a U.S. seabed exploration firm up to $70 million if it finds the missing Malaysia Airlines aircraft MH370 within 90 days of embarking on a new search in the Southern Indian ocean.
The disappearance of the aircraft en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people aboard ranks among the world's greatest aviation mysteries.
Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200-million ($157 million) search of a 120,000 sq. km area in January last year, despite investigators urging the search be extended to a 25,000-square-km area further to the north.
Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said a Houston-based private firm, Ocean Infinity, would search for MH370 in that 25,000-sq-km priority area on a ""no-cure, no-fee"" basis, meaning it will only get paid if it finds the plane.
""As we speak, the vessel, Seabed Constructor, is on her way to the search area, taking advantage of favorable weather conditions in the South Indian ocean,"" Liow told a news conference. 
The search will begin on Jan. 17, said Ocean Infinity Chief Executive Oliver Plunkett, who attended the signing event.
Ocean Infinity will be paid $20 million if the plane is found within 5,000 sq km, $30 million if it is found within 10,000 square km and $50 million if it is found within an area of 25,000 square km. Beyond that area, Ocean Infinity will receive $70 million, Liow said.
Its priority is to locate the wreckage or the flight and cockpit recorders, and present credible evidence to confirm their location within 90 days, Liow added.
""They cannot take forever or drag it on for another six months or a year."" 
'UNIQUE SOLUTION' 
Ocean Infinity's vessel carries eight autonomous underwater vehicles that will scour the seabed with scanning equipment for information to be sent back for analysis.
It has 65 crew, including two government representatives drawn from the Malaysian navy.
The ship could complete the search within three or four weeks, and cover up to 60,000 square km in 90 days, or four times faster than earlier efforts, Plunkett told Reuters. 
""It was a unique problem that required a unique solution... We looked at it and said, 'Let's do something different than what other people would do,' and that's the essence of our business."" 
Ocean Infinity's core business is in the oil and gas industry, as well as subsea exploration services for tasks such as underwater cabling and seabed mapping, he said. 
The company's shareholders would bear the upfront costs of the search, Plunkett added.
Debris from MH370 could provide clues to events on board before the crash. There have been competing theories that the aircraft suffered mechanical failure or was intentionally flown off course.
Investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean.

At least three pieces of debris collected from sites on Indian Ocean islands and along Africa's east coast have been confirmed as being from the missing plane.

Petrol bombs thrown at the school on the tourist resort island of Djerba, home to an ancient Jewish community, caused some damage but no injuries, the head of the local Jewish community, Perez Trabelsi, told Reuters on Wednesday.
There were no protests in Djerba but locals said the assailants had exploited the fact that there was a reduced security presence as police were busy combating anti-government protests elsewhere in the North African state.
""Unknown people took the opportunity of the protests and threw Molotov cocktails into the lobby of a Jewish religious school in Djerba,"" Trabelsi said.
At the time of the attack, violent clashes were raging in some 20 Tunisian cities as people protested against rising prices and new taxes imposed by on Jan. 1.
About 50 policemen were wounded in the clashes, said Interior Ministry spokesman Khelifa Chibani.
""Last night criminals looted and burned security centers, 45 police cars were torched and some government offices were attacked,"" he said. ""They blocked roads and carried out robberies in many cities ... Obviously, these are not protests, but theft and damage to public and private property.""
Mainly Muslim Tunisia has a Jewish minority of fewer than 1,800 people. Jews have lived in Tunisia for over 2,000 years and Djerba is home to Africa's oldest synagogue, El Ghriba, which was hit by al Qaeda-linked militants in 2002 in a truck bomb attack that killed 21 people including Western tourists.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 04:11AM ET</span>",Hong Kong government adviser resigns over illegal ivory links,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong ivory trader fined this week for illegal possession of ivory resigned on Wednesday from a government advisory panel to protect endangered species, a potentially embarrassing blow for a city fighting to stamp out smuggling of ivory.
Hong Kong has the largest retail market for ivory, which it has traded for more than 150 years. The territory is a prime transit and consumption hub, with more than 90 percent of consumers from mainland China. 
Earlier on Wednesday Reuters reported that government records showed Lau Sai-yuan was a member of the Endangered Species Advisory Committee of Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD). 
Lau announced he would step down from the committee, broadcaster RTHK said on Wednesday afternoon. His term was to have run until Sept. 30 this year.
Neither the AFCD nor the government responded to requests for comment.
Lau, a member of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Hong Kong Art Craft Merchants Association, had pleaded guilty on Tuesday to illegal ivory possession and was fined HK$8,000 ($1,022).
The conviction came less than two weeks after China enforced a total ban on ivory sales.
""This entire debacle demonstrates just how rotten and corrupt the Hong Kong ivory trade has become, which is why lawmakers need to hurry up and pass the ivory ban and maximum penalty review,"" said Alex Hofford, a campaigner for non-government body WildAid.
Hong Kong lawmakers are considering a boost in penalties, to a fine to up to HK$10 million and jail time of 10 years, from the current maximum penalty of two years in prison. 
China is the world's largest importer and end user of elephant tusks. Wildlife activists called the ban, adopted at the end of 2017, a vital step to reduce the slaughter of the endangered animals.
Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, has lagged far behind and only set a timetable for a ban on ivory trading last year, with a phase-out time of five years.
The former British colony adheres to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which started in the 1970s to regulate international trade in ivory, before banning it from 1990.
A Hong Kong government-led operation in June 2017 found Lau was one of two ivory traders who had sold ivory chopsticks with ivory obtained after the 1990 ban.
Only ""pre-Convention ivory"" is allowed to be traded, with the ivory accompanied by a pre-convention certificate.
Trade in pre-convention ivory has thrived in China and Hong Kong since 1975. Environmental activists say it has led to an increase in laundering ivory and is a prime obstacle in stamping out poaching.

BEIJING (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said a contract with China for 184 Airbus (PA:AIR) A320 narrow-body jets would be finalized soon and that his country also had ambitions to sell A350 and A380 planes to China in coming weeks or months.
The potential A320 order, which had not been previously announced, would be worth more than $18 billion at list prices.
""On the order for 184 A320s, it's something that will be finalised shortly,"" Macron said during his state visit to China, adding it was confirmed to him by Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
""And we also have ambitions on A350 and A380 mid-range and large carriers in the weeks or months to come,"" Macron said.
The A320s would be delivered in 2019 and 2020, a French presidency official said on condition of anonymity.
Ahead of Macron's trip, sources had told Reuters that Airbus was in talks about an order for 100 or more jets. New jet orders have historically featured during such tours by French leaders. 
While no deal has been finalised over the current official visit, Macron said China had assured him it would respect market-share parity between Airbus and Boeing (N:BA).
China regularly splits large orders between Europe and the United States to cope with its fast-expanding airline traffic, but the momentum has recently been with rival Boeing (N:BA), which sold 300 jets during a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump last year.
China, however, placed a large order for 140 Airbus jets during a visit to Germany by Xi last July.
Airbus signed a provisional deal on Tuesday to boost the number of A320 family jets assembled in Tianjin to six a month by 2020 from four at present.

Airbus declined to comment on Wednesday.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 01:45AM ET</span>","At Vietnam's biggest corruption trial, some skeptical views","By Mi Nguyen and Alex Dobuzinskis
HANOI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Vietnam is gripped by its highest profile corruption trial in memory, but some spectators are questioning whether the Communist Party elite in the dock were charged because of infighting in the ruling class or a crackdown on abuse of office.
Onlookers have gathered at the Hanoi People's Court since Monday for a glimpse of Dinh La Thang, the first politburo member to be arrested in decades, and Trinh Xuan Thanh, a state oil firm executive who Germany says was kidnapped from Berlin by Vietnamese agents.
Led to the court in handcuffs along with 20 other defendants, their simple clothes and rough haircuts contrasted with their former well-groomed images as scions of the establishment.
They face charges related to losses of hundreds of millions of dollars at state oil giant PetroVietnam. Reuters was unable to contact either the defendants or the lawyers representing them for comment.
""This trial has raised a voice against corruption, but is not effective enough,"" said Vu Van Thuong, a 60-year-old retired businessman who was among those outside the court. ""Even if embezzled properties are returned, if policies don't change, then this country will remain poor.""
Similar sentiments were expressed by a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) user called Quyet Le Quoc, who wrote: ""Who believes this is a corruption crackdown?"" 
""Almost everyone knows that two sides are fighting for power,"" the writer said, adding that the accused deserved to be put on trial.
The government says the accused are being tried for mismanagement, embezzlement or both. 
On the first day of the trial, curious crowds began gathering around the courtroom before dawn and had to be kept back by police. The only reporters allowed inside the courtroom are from state-linked organizations and news about the trial tops bulletins on the strictly-controlled government media.
Vietnam's fight against corruption intensified last year after the security establishment gained greater sway under 73 year-old Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong.
Scores of officials and executives have been arrested, most of them from PetroVietnam and the banking sector in the Communist-ruled country of over 90 million people. [L4N1P32YQ]
The PetroVietnam trial is taking place at the same time as a separate trial in the commercial capital Ho Chi Minh City, where a fraud case involving Vietnam's Construction Bank is being heard.
WINNERS AND LOSERS
Many of the most prominent figures at the trial in Hanoi were aligned with former Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, who lost out to Trong in a 2016 power struggle.
While Dung was noted for the high profile ties of his family and lieutenants to big business in one of Southeast Asia's most dynamic economies, Trong is a party stalwart with a much more modest personal reputation.
Among the Vietnamese diaspora, details of the trial are being lapped up - particularly in the United States, home to an estimated 1.3 million Vietnamese immigrants.
In Vietnamese-American communities in the United States, such as Little Saigon in Orange County, California, many residents fled as refugees during or soon after the U.S. war in Vietnam ended in 1975 - bringing with them an enduring hatred of communism.
Few saw the trial as being the start of real change, to end corruption in a country that ranked 113 of 176 countries on Transparency International's most recent index of corruption perceptions. But there was scant sign of sympathy for those in the dock.
    ""Political observers within the community see this as basically Mafia members, Communist Mafia members, using their own legal system and their kangaroo courts to whack each other,"" said Van Tran, a former Republican member of the California legislature.
    Vietnamese-language papers and radio stations in hubs such as Westminster, California, and Houston, Texas, are following the trial and have an avid audience. 
    ""Fighting corruption is meaningless when you don't have a checks and balance system,"" said Tuyet Ngoc Dinh, who came to the United States as a teenager in 1989 and lives in Louisville, Kentucky.
Longstanding anti-communists saw signs of internal division in the trials - signs welcomed by Huu Vo, 67, president of the Federation of Vietnamese American Communities of USA and a resident of Pomona, California.

    ""When there's a power struggle, they grow weaker,"" he said.

55,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 01:19AM ET</span>",Myanmar prosecutor seeks Official Secrets Act charges against two Reuters reporters,"By Antoni Slodkowski and Simon Lewis
YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar prosecutors sought charges on Wednesday against two Reuters reporters under the Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years, the reporters' lawyer said.
Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained on Dec. 12 after they had been invited to meet police officers over dinner. Family members have said the two told them they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents by the officers they had gone to meet. 
The two had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where - according to U.N. estimates - about 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.
“They arrested us and took action against us because we were trying to reveal the truth,"" Wa Lone told reporters as he and Kyaw Soe Oo were led out of the court and back to Yangon's Insein prison after the 30-minute hearing.
Khin Maung Zaw, a lawyer representing the two journalists, said the charges being sought came under Section 3.1 (c) of the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act. 
The act dates back to 1923, when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was a province of British India.
Section 3 covers entering prohibited places, taking images or handling secret official documents that ""might be or is intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy"".
The Ministry of Information had previously cited police as saying they were ""arrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces"". The ministry has said they ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"".
The case was adjourned until Jan. 23.
The prosecutor objected to an application for bail, the reporters' lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said. The court took it under consideration and will decide at the next hearing, he said.
The government has said two police officers were also arrested for investigation under suspicion of having violated the Official Secrets Act. It has given no further information on the police arrested.
DRESSED IN BLACK
In the court, Kyaw Soe Oo embraced his wife and held his daughter for a couple of minutes. His daughter began to weep as he was escorted away and had to hand her back to other family members.
Wa Lone’s wife gave him a few small pieces of cake that she had brought.
""I am trying to be strong in everything. I never made any mistake; I never did anything wrong,” Wa Lone said before leaving the court.
Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler said he was extremely disappointed that the authorities were seeking to prosecute the pair.
""We view this as a wholly unwarranted, blatant attack on press freedom. Our colleagues should be allowed to return to their jobs reporting on events in Myanmar. We believe time is of the essence and we continue to call for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo’s prompt release,"" he said.
Observers from the United Nations and from several embassies, including the Netherlands, Australia and Britain.
""We hope that these journalists will get a fair trial and a speedy trial that represents international practices,"" the first secretary of the EU mission, Andreas Magnusson, told reporters.
PROTEST OUTSIDE COURT
About 30 journalists were outside the court, most dressed in black as a sign of protest against the arrest of the pair. Several had the message ""journalism is not a crime"" or ""release the arrested journalists now"" on their T-shirts.
Police were on duty outside the court, and some areas were cordoned off with barbed wire.
The two were brought to court in a police vehicle and emerged from it smiling, both in handcuffs. Wa Lone gave a thumbs up sign.
Government officials from some of the world's major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top United Nations officials, have called for the release of the reporters.
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton also urged that they be freed immediately.
""A free press is critical to a free society - the detention of journalists anywhere is unacceptable. The Reuters journalists being held in Myanmar should be released immediately,"" Clinton said in a Twitter post on Monday.
Clinton was U.S. president for much of the 1990s when the United States pressed Myanmar's then military rulers to release democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi from years of house arrest.
Suu Kyi won a 2015 election and formed a government in early 2016, although she is barred by the constitution from becoming president.

She has made no public comment on the detention of the two Reuters reporters. The government has denied that their arrests represent an attack on press freedom and Suu Kyi's spokesman has said the case would be handled according to the law.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 that struck near remote islands belonging to Honduras on Tuesday was felt across northern Central America but there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage. 
The quake rattled windows in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa roughly 323 miles (519 km) to the east and was felt at least as far north as the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, but no damage was immediately reported.
Rodrigo Anaya Rodriguez was in a hammock inside his house near the popular tourist site of Bacalar Lake near Mexico's Caribbean coast when he felt three tremors. 
""It felt like a bulldozer was driving past,"" he said. ""It didn't last long but was very violent.""
He ran to his balcony and saw electricity posts and cables swaying.
In Honduras, firefighters said some residents in southern neighborhoods fled their homes after feeling the shaking.
The country operates a small naval base on Great Swan Island, about 27 miles (44 km) west of the quake's epicenter, but it was not immediately clear how the tremors affected the station. 
""We have reports that it was felt in the majority of the country, but we don't have reports of damage,"" said Lizandro Rosales, director of Honduras' contingencies commission. 
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, initially reported as a magnitude 7.8, was centered 125 miles (202 km)northeast of Barra Patuca in Honduras and 191 miles (307 km)southwest of George Town in the Cayman Islands.
The quake was very shallow, at only 6.2 miles (10 km), which would have amplified its effect. 
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that tsunami waves up to 1 meter (3 feet) above tide level could hit parts of Honduras, Belize and Puerto Rico along with the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. 
About two hours after the quake, the center said the threat had passed, withdrawing all tsunami advisories connected with the quake. 
The tremors were felt in Belize's capital, Belize City, but there were no immediate reports of damage.
Belize's minister in charge of emergency management, Edmond Castro, spoke on local radio to urge people living in low lying coastal areas and islands to stay alert for potentially dangerous waves.

News of the sale comes as North and South Korea hold their first talks in more than two years aimed at solving the crisis over the North's nuclear missile program.
The missile deal follows a year of ramped-up North Korean missile launches, some of them over Japanese territory, and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. These actions have prompted a stepped-up U.S.-led campaign to toughen U.N. sanctions, which Pyongyang has called an act of war.
The State Department on Tuesday asked Congress to approve the $133 million sale of the four missiles and related hardware, which can be launched from destroyers at sea or from a land-based system.
The sale of the anti-ballistic missiles, made by  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN) and BAE Systems (L:BAES), follows through ""on President Trump's commitment to provide additional defensive capabilities to treaty allies threatened by the DPRK's provocative behavior,"" the official said, using the initials for North Korea.
Japan formally decided in December it would expand its ballistic missile defense system with U.S.-made ground-based Aegis radar stations and interceptors.
The proposal to build two Aegis Ashore batteries without the missiles will likely cost at least $2 billion and was not likely to be operational until 2023 at the earliest, sources familiar with the plan told Reuters in December.

WARSAW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Poland's new Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki fired several senior ministers and visited Brussels on Tuesday in an effort to patch up relations with the European Union, but said he would not unwind the country's most-contested judicial reforms.
Facing unprecedented EU legal action over accusations of backsliding on democracy by politicizing Polish courts, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party may seek to ease tensions in other areas like environmental policy or defense.
Shortly after announcing the government changes, Morawiecki left for his first face-to-face talks with officials in Brussels, the second foreign capital he has visited so far as prime minister after Budapest.
""Our intention is to make the system more effective, more just, more objective,"" Morawiecki told a news conference defending PiS moves on the courts after nearly three hours of talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Jean-Claude Juncker.
A joint statement with the EU's executive said the dinner was ""friendly"" and included a ""detailed discussion"" on the rule of law issues in Poland. The two leaders would meet again ""with the view to making progress by the end of February.""
The Polish government changes also come as the EU embarks on negotiations on a new seven-year budget that will decide which member states get what out of the bloc's coffers - with Poland currently the biggest net recipient.
Among those who lost their posts on Tuesday was the staunchly conservative Environment Minister Jan Szyszko, who has spearheaded large-scale logging in an ancient forest that prompted action by the European Court of Justice.
Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz, a former anti-communist crusader facing criticism over delays in modernizing the army as well as conflicts with top generals, and Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski - seen as petulant and ineffective in Brussels - were also dismissed.
The reshuffle follows the appointment of former banker and finance minister Morawiecki as prime minister last month at the midpoint of the parliamentary term. PiS faces local elections in late 2018 and legislative and presidential ballots in 2019-20.
""The new (government) should help us build a sovereign Poland within a strong Europe, a Europe of homelands,"" Morawiecki said earlier in Warsaw in announcing the new appointments.
The feud between Brussels and Warsaw's eurosceptic government is a key element in mounting tensions between wealthier western EU members and the ex-communist east, amid a wider debate over the bloc's future provoked by Brexit.
WARMER TONE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH
Many Westerners are keen for EU countries to integrate further in the wake of Britain's decision to leave, but this is strongly opposed by eastern members like Poland and Hungary.
Despite the warmer tone, Morawiecki made clear he would not give up on the courts overhaul, which, together with Warsaw's refusal to host refugees, is central in the row with Brussels.
Rights groups, western EU states and Poland's political opposition say the government is undercutting the courts' independence. PiS says the reforms are needed because the country is steeped in power structures dating from the post-war communist era.
In another sign that government policy is unlikely to change, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro kept his job on Tuesday, and new rules give him powers to appoint the heads of lower-level courts as well as oversight over prosecutors.
EU states will on Feb. 27 look into whether Poland is backsliding on democracy, though the top sanction of suspending Poland's EU voting rights is unlikely to materialize, as Hungary has said it would block any such punishment. 
The 27 are likely to ask Warsaw to make amends, issuing recommendations echoing those by Brussels that the PiS has so far ignored, and giving it some time to react.
France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy are among EU states saying Warsaw should be not allowed to get away with what they see as an assault on the bloc's core values.
Szyszko had attracted widespread criticism domestically over moves to lift limits on hunting as well as for allowing massive logging in areas of Poland. The dismissed health minister has struggled to contain protests by medical staff in recent months.
The outgoing, hardline defense chief has been the PiS investigator into the 2010 plane crash over Russia that killed President Lech Kaczynski - the twin brother of current party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski - and dozens of other senior Polish officials.

Kaczynski and Macierewicz believe the crash may have been caused by foul play and not pilot error, which was the official cause returned by a investigation by the previous centrist government.

61,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 06:38PM ET</span>",Bannon steps down from Breitbart News after drawing fire from Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Steve Bannon has stepped down as executive chairman of Breitbart News, the right-wing news website said on Tuesday, after the former White House chief strategist drew fire from President Donald Trump for harshly criticizing his eldest son.
Bannon was quoted in a new book about the Trump White House as calling Donald Trump Jr. ""treasonous"" and ""unpatriotic"" for meeting during the 2016 presidential campaign with a Russian lawyer who was said to have damaging information on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The comments drew a furious response from President Trump, who said Bannon ""had lost his mind.""
Their public fight ended an alliance that began when Bannon joined the Trump campaign and helped the political novice defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Bannon was fired by Trump in August as the president tried to bring order to feuding factions in the White House, but the two men continued to communicate and Bannon had remained an ally.
Losing his Breitbart post threatens Bannon's dream of leading a new political movement that challenges the Republican establishment and supports his ""America First"" agenda of tougher trade deals and immigration laws.
Bannon has also lost his talk show on SiriusXM radio, the company said on Tuesday. Sirius said in a statement its programming agreement was with Breitbart, not with Bannon.
In an effort to try to repair the damage from the book, Bannon said his ""treasonous"" comment was directed at a former Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who also attended the meeting at Trump Tower. The author of the book, Michael Wolff, disputed Bannon's account.
""Bannon died of his own sword,"" said Roger Stone, a long-time Trump friend. ""A classic example of hubris and beginning to think you are smarter than the boss.""
Wolff's book, ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,"" characterized Trump as mentally unstable, inept and unprepared for the presidency. 
After publication of the book last week, major Republican Party donor Rebekah Mercer, who owns a stake in Breitbart, issued a statement distancing herself from Bannon, saying she did not support his ""recent actions and statements.""
SUPPORTED ROY MOORE
Bannon joined Breitbart in 2012 and helped raise the profile of the news site, which he once called the platform for the so-called alt-right, a loose confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.
""I’m proud of what the Breitbart team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class news platform,"" Bannon said in a statement cited by Breitbart News.
Bannon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
Breitbart Chief Executive Larry Solov, in a statement on the organization's website, called Bannon ""a valued part of our legacy.""
""We will always be grateful for his contributions, and what he has helped us to accomplish,"" Solov said.
After leaving the White House in August, Bannon picked a fight with the Republican establishment that may have cost the party a U.S. Senate seat in deeply conservative Alabama.
He supported Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore in his primary fight against incumbent Luther Strange, who was backed by Trump and mainstream Republicans.

Moore won the primary but lost to Democrat Doug Jones in December's general election after Moore was accused of sexual misconduct against teenagers.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, battling allegations his business empire illegally tapped European Union subsidies a decade ago, looks certain to lose a parliamentary confidence vote on Wednesday.
The billionaire's ANO party won an October election by a wide margin but fell short of a majority and has struggled to gain partners.
If his minority government, appointed in December, loses the confidence vote it will stay in power until a new one is formed. President Milos Zeman has promised to allow Babis another try. 
But the other eight parties in the lower house of parliament have refused to support Babis while fraud charges hang over him. He denies wrongdoing in the case.
Losing the confidence vote would lead to further weeks or months of political talks, giving his opponents more time to try to unseat him as prime minister. 
However, ANO's convincing election victory means any viable government will involve the party, with or without Babis, and analysts see the fear of early elections pushing the other parties to eventually compromise.
Babis himself is counting on more talks. He told newspaper Pravo: ""It already looks like the government will not get confidence at the first attempt.""
MARKETS CALM
The tussle over a new government has not so far troubled financial markets, thanks to the country's strong economy and sound budget.
ANO has won support with promises to run the state more efficiently and end political corruption.
Babis is the Czech Republic's second richest person through his Agrofert conglomerate, the country's biggest private employer with firms in food, farming, chemicals and media. 
He is fighting allegations he hid ownership of a farm and conference center to get a 2 million-euro subsidy earmarked for small businesses when he ran Agrofert.
An investigation by the EU anti-fraud office OLAF has found ""irregularities"", according to a report released last week by the Finance Ministry.
Babis has been formally charged in the case but has immunity from prosecution as a member of parliament, unless lawmakers lift this in a coming vote. He has called the charges politically motivated.
Political analyst Borivoj Hnizdo said the subsidy affair would figure in further party talks, but Babis still might have a stronger hand than his rivals. 

""Babis has a bigger chance in a second round because a lot of parties do not want early elections,"" he said. ""It would be financially difficult for some parties and some parties could fear losing votes.""

Libyan coastguard vessels picked up nearly 300 migrants from three boats off the coast of the North African country on Tuesday, but one rubber boat was punctured and the coastguard only found 16 survivors clinging to its wreckage. 
""We found the migrant boat at about 10 o'clock this morning, it had sunk and we found 16 migrants. The rest were all missing and unfortunately we didn't find any bodies or (other) survivors,"" said Nasr al-Qamoudi, a coastguard commander.
Several of the survivors, who were brought back to a naval base in Tripoli, said there were originally about 70 people on board the boat when it set off near the town of Khoms, east of the capital. A coastguard statement later said that ""at least 90-100"" migrants were missing.
The two other migrant boats were found off Zawiya, west of Tripoli.
A Nigerian woman who had been on board the boat that sank, Zainab Abdesalam, told Reuters the migrants had waited several hours to be rescued and that the survivors were extremely weak. 
""I feel so disappointed because I could not make it to where I want to go,"" she said, sobbing. ""I feel so disappointed and I don't want to go to prison."" 
Libya is the most common departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe from Africa by sea. More than 600,000 have crossed the central Mediterranean in the past four years, generally travelling in flimsy inflatable craft provided by smugglers that often break down or puncture.
Under heavy pressure from Italy, some Libyan armed factions have blocked smuggling since last summer. Libya's Italian-backed coastguard has also stepped up interceptions, returning migrants to Libya where they are detained and often reenter smuggling networks.
There has been a surge in attempted crossings in recent days, with dozens more migrants feared to have drowned over the weekend. 

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated that 2,832 migrants died last year trying to reach Italy from North Africa, down from 4,581 in 2016. Some 119,310 people made it alive to Italy in 2017 against 181,436 the year before.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to deliver a new trading relationship with the EU with her authority diminished by party infighting, the resignation of key allies, a fractious parliament, a divided electorate and a tight timetable before the March 2019 Brexit deadline.
Research carried out in October by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen), where Curtice is senior research fellow, found Britons increasingly critical of the UK government's handling of Brexit. 
""Although voters ... blame the government, blame the EU, 'Leave' voters for the most part have not changed their minds about their decision,"" Curtice, who is also a professor of politics at Strathclyde University, told a presentation in the Scottish capital. ""'Leave' voters are saying the government is mucking up, not that the decision we made (to leave the EU) was wrong.""
The NatCen poll found 52 percent of Britons thought the economy would be worse off after Brexit, versus 46 percent in a similar poll last February. That compared with 58 percent of Scots, polled separately, unchanged from February.
As for Scotland, which voted to stay in the EU, Brexit is not a catalyst for Scottish independence from the UK but it has not dampened separatist fervor either, the poll found. Support for secession is at about 44 percent versus 45 percent in a 2014 independence referendum.
The poll also showed 52 percent of Britons now expect a ""bad deal"" versus 55 percent of Scots. That compares with 37 percent of Britons last February.
NatCen also found that support for a different Scottish immigration policy from the rest of the UK after Brexit, as favored by the Scottish government, does not have majority support either and most Scots want the same immigration policy nationwide.
In Britain as a whole, 61 percent of those polled thought Brexit had been badly handled by the UK government, up from 41 percent in February and versus 69 percent in Scotland.

ScotCen polled 859 people, all of whom had been interviewed as part of the 2015 or 2016 Scottish Social Attitudes survey, which is carried out face to face.

65,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 05:46PM ET</span>",Israel to approve hundreds of new settler homes in West Bank,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will approve construction of hundreds of new settlement homes in the occupied West Bank, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Tuesday.
Settlements are one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, frozen since 2014.
Palestinians want the West Bank for a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Most countries consider as illegal the Israeli settlements built in the territory which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Israel disputes that its settlements are illegal and says their future should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians. 
Israeli authorities were due to approve on Wednesday the construction of 1,285 housing units to be built in 2018 and advance planning for 2,500 others in about 20 different settlements, Lieberman said in a statement.
There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian officials. The Palestinians say Israeli settlements in the West bank, a key issue in peace talks, deny them a viable contiguous state. 
U.S.-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014 and a bid by President Donald Trump's administration to restart them have shown little sign of progress.
Asked about the construction plans, a U.S. State Department official said there had been no change in policy on settlements and the Israeli government had made clear that going forward ""its intent is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes the President's concerns into consideration.""
""The United States welcomes this. As the President has said repeatedly, the administration is firmly committed to pursuing a comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians,"" the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
The White House said on Monday U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will visit the region from Jan. 20 to 23, embarking on a tour originally planned for December after Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Pence will hold talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Jordan's King Abdullah and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said.

Trump's decision on Jerusalem and announcement in December that the United States would start the process of moving its embassy from Tel Aviv enraged the Palestinians who said the United States can no longer broker peace with Israel.

RED BANK, N.J. (Reuters) - Three decades after fleeing civil war in his native El Salvador, Luis Munoz has built a life for himself in the New Jersey coastal town of Red Bank, working as a mechanic and raising three children with his wife.
Now Munoz and his adult kids may face deportation in 2019 along with around 200,000 other Salvadorans, after the Trump administration said on Monday they would no longer have legal protection under a program known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS).
""I cannot go back to my country,"" Munoz, 58, said on Monday evening, sitting on the couch with his bichon frise dog, Hachi, in the apartment he shares with his wife, an immigrant from Belize. 
Not only did he get death threats before he left El Salvador in the 1980s, he said, but current gang violence makes going back too dangerous and the ailing economy offers few opportunities.
Salvadoran families across the United States faced an anguished choice, with those like Munoz saying a return to their crime-ravaged country was not an option.
Many had feared an end to their protected status after the Trump administration cut TPS for Nicaraguans and Haitians as part of its broader push to tighten immigration laws.
TPS, which began in 1990, offers protection from deportation to immigrants already in the United States, including those who entered illegally, from countries affected by natural disasters, civil conflicts and other problems.
Salvadorans were admitted following a pair of destructive earthquakes in 2001. U.S. officials on Monday said TPS by definition was not intended to become permanent and that the unsafe conditions created by the earthquakes no longer exist. They said the protections would expire for Salvadorans in September 2019.
Many of the recipients were not affected by the earthquakes but took advantage of the program to gain legal status.
Ricardo Lemus, 38, crossed the Mexican border with his brother in 1997. As a legal immigrant under TPS, he has started his own hardwood flooring company in Rockland County, New York. He said he had put expansion plans on hold while he determined whether he would lose his business.
""I don't have any options,"" said Lemus, who has three American-born daughters and is not willing to take them to a country they have never known. ""I'm not sure yet what I can do.""
Elba Perlera, 47, came to the United States illegally in 1997. As a single mother, she intended to work for a few years in the United States to earn money and then return to her young son, whom she left with her mother.
But once she arrived, she said, it became more difficult to return. She found work as a janitor, got married and had another child.
Her son, now 22, made it to the United States at age 15 after gangs threatened him at his school and works in construction. Her U.S.-born 11-year-old daughter wrote a handwritten letter to lawmakers earlier this year pleading with them to protect TPS for the sake of her parents.
Both Perlera and her Salvadoran husband were granted TPS status in 2001, allowing them to get driver's licenses, work permits and better jobs.
""Now with this decision we could lose all that,"" she said.
She hopes Congress passes a legislative solution and plans to make her case to lawmakers in Washington. She had no wish to return to El Salvador.
""Life there is not easy, and the government is not prepared to take people back,"" she said.
Like Lemus and Perlera, Munoz was not an earthquake victim. At the time of the disasters, he was already in the United States, having entered from Belize legally on a tourist visa and then overstaying his time before applying to TPS.
His children, who were born in Belize and have TPS protection, have virtually no connection with the country they may soon be forced to repatriate to. 
""Basically they would return to a world they do not know,"" Munoz said.
Munoz fled El Salvador in the 1980s as a student, at a time when many of his classmates were arrested or killed by the army for suspected ties to leftist guerrillas. A day after a friend was killed, Munoz's brother, who was in the army, called to warn him that he would be next.

""There are too many sad memories for me there - all my friends, my schoolmates were murdered just because they were young,"" Munoz said. ""They stopped the war but they were not able to establish peace or security. No one would say it is better off now.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would back a two-step immigration approach that initially protects young ""Dreamer"" immigrants from deportation if it includes immigration restrictions and provisions for a border wall with Mexico that Democrats have opposed.
At a White House meeting of Republican and Democratic lawmakers, Trump said after the first phase was complete he wanted to move quickly to even more contentious issues including a possible pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants that is opposed by many Republicans.
""If you want to take it that further step, I'll take the heat, I don't care,"" Trump told lawmakers of a broad immigration bill. ""You are not that far away from comprehensive immigration reform.""
Trump said he would sign any bill that gives legal status to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children as long as it had the border security protections he has sought, including funding for a border wall.
""If you don't have the wall, you don't have security,"" Trump told the lawmakers.
Trump and his fellow Republicans, who control the U.S. Congress, have been unable to reach agreement with Democrats on a deal to resolve the status of an estimated 700,000 young immigrants whose protection from potential deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program ends in early March.
MIDTERM ELECTIONS
Under pressure from immigrant groups ahead of midterm congressional elections in November, Democrats are reluctant to give ground to Trump on the issue of the wall - his central promise from the 2016 presidential campaign. 
But after the meeting, lawmaker from both parties said they would meet as early as Wednesday to continue negotiations on a deal covering DACA and border security, as well as a visa lottery program and ""chain migration,"" which could address the status of relatives of Dreamers who are still in the United States illegally.
""From that standpoint it was a very productive meeting,"" said U.S. Senator David Perdue, a Republican. ""We have a scope now.""
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who also was at the meeting, said negotiators in Congress still faced difficulties but it was important that Trump had shown he had ""no animosity toward the Dream Act kids"" and the “wall is not going to be 2,220 miles wide.""
The U.S. Congress has been trying and failing to pass a comprehensive immigration bill for more than a decade, most recently when the Senate passed one in 2013 that later died in the House of Representatives.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the broader bill with a path to citizenship was not a focus for now.
""Our focus is on the four things that I laid out. That's where our negotiation is and that's phase one,"" she said at a regular White House briefing.
""We're certainly open to talking about a number of other issues when it comes to immigration, but right now this administration is focused on those four things and that negotiation, and not a lot else at this front.""
The immigration negotiations are part of a broader series of talks over issues ranging from funding the federal government through next September to renewing a children’s health insurance program and giving U.S. territories and states additional aid for rebuilding following last year’s hurricanes and wildfires.
Top congressional leaders did not attend the hour-long meeting. Instead, the guest list included lawmakers from both parties involved in the immigration debate, such as Republican Graham and Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, a Democrat.
Many of the Dreamers are from Mexico and Central America and have spent most of their lives in the United States, attending school and participating in society.
Trump put their fate in doubt in early September when he announced he was ending former President Barack Obama's DACA program, which allowed them to legally live and work in the United States temporarily.
Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House of Representatives, said a DACA bill could win support for passage even though there are differences between the parties over constitutes necessary border security. 
""Democrats are for security at the border,"" Hoyer told Trump during the meeting. ""There are obviously differences, however, Mr. President, on how you affect that.""
On Monday, Trump announced that he was ending immigration protections for about 200,000 El Salvadorans who are living legally in the United States under the Temporary Protection Status program. Haitians and other groups have faced similar actions.
A congressional aide told Reuters that negotiators in Congress also have been talking about legislation that would expand TPS in return for ending a visa lottery program that Republicans want to terminate.

These discussions are part of broader talks on protecting Dreamers and enacting additional immigration law changes, including beefed up border security.

""I can confirm today that amendments to Clause 11 of the bill will be brought forward in the House of Lords (Britain's upper legislative chamber), allowing for further discussions to take place between the UK government and Scottish government,"" David Mundell said in a statement.
Clause 11 has raised hackles in Scotland and Wales, two of the United Kingdom's four nations, because it specifies that powers currently held in Brussels return to Britain's central government in the first instance, although some of them are currently the remit of Britain's devolved administrations. 
With a pledge to amend the proposed law, Mundell may help to soothe fears that devolved powers will be watered down by Brexit. 
""Our commitment to improve the bill remains absolute. The most important thing is that the changes we bring forward command support on all sides,"" he said.
""I remain confident we can reach a place where the Scottish parliament will give legislative consent to this vitally important piece of legislation."" 
The bill, part of Prime Minister Theresa May's strategy for delivering an orderly Brexit, is designed to convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones so that there is clarity after the separation occurs in March 2019.
But it has grated in Edinburgh and Cardiff, which currently control policy areas such as health, education, transport and agriculture, because it does not make clear what the status of their devolved powers will be once Brexit happens. 
Both Welsh and Scottish administrations have said that, as it stands, they will not recommend the bill receives consent in their assemblies. 
Under Britain's constitution, the British parliament must seek consent from the Scottish and Welsh assemblies when legislating on policy areas that overlap with their devolved powers.

While they do not have veto powers over the Brexit bill, ignoring their wishes would pressure yet further their already tense relations with London, and could feed public appetite for Scottish independence.

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador said on Tuesday it was exploring mediation to solve the standoff over WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in Ecuador's Embassy in London for five years, and called for cooperation from the United Kingdom and the international community.
Former leftist President Rafael Correa, who had said Assange was a ""journalist,"" granted him asylum in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over rape allegations.
The Andean country's new government, however, has said it is concerned over Assange's ""complicated"" situation. President Lenin Moreno has described Assange as a ""hacker,"" while stressing he would not be kicked out of the embassy.
""We're considering, exploring the possibility of a mediation,"" Foreign Minister Maria Fernanda Espinosa told foreign reporters on Tuesday, adding that a third country or person could lead a potential mediation.
""No solution can be reached without international cooperation and without cooperation from the United Kingdom, which in addition has shown interest in finding a solution."" 
Further details were not immediately available.
In May, Sweden dropped the investigation into rape allegations that led Assange to seek asylum in the embassy in 2012, but British police said he would still be arrested if he left the building.

Assange, who denies the rape allegations, fears being handed over to the United States to face prosecution over WikiLeaks' publication of thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents in one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history.

A military spokeswoman said troops were searching for the suspects.
Tensions in the region have risen since U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on Dec 6 in which he recognized disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital. 
Trump's reversal of decades of U.S. policy enraged Palestinians, who seek to create an independent state including Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its eternal, indivisible capital. 
Trump's announcement sparked protests and violent clashes in the West Bank and along the Israel-Gaza border.

Following an illegal referendum last October and the imposition of direct rule on the region by Madrid, the pro-independence movement has become fractured over whether to continue with its push for an independent state or to engage in talks with the Spanish government to gain more regional autonomy in the short term.
A Dec. 21 election gave separatists a slim majority in the regional parliament in a blow to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who had hoped it would quash the independence movement and resolve Spain's worst political crisis in decades.
""This new stage requires new leaders, it is necessary to leave open spaces so that certain people can lead this project for the future,"" Mas told a news conference.
A Catalan court barred Mas from public office in March 2017 for two years for staging an informal referendum on independence in 2014 at a time when secessionist leaders were trying to drum up support for a new ballot.
However, Mas remained leader of the conservative PDeCat party, which he has led for about 15 years. 
PDeCat's political platform in the election, the Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) led by Carles Puigdemont, emerged as the largest separatist group ahead of Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left).
But Puigdemont remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels after he fled to Belgium with four of his cabinet members when Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia and sacked his government following an Oct. 27 declaration of independence.
He is likely to be detained if he returns to Spain, pending an investigation on charges of sedition, rebellion, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust.
Mas previously supported Puigdemont in his push for independence but he may now favor a different candidate within the PdeCat in order to pave the way for a new separatist-led government, according to Barcelona-based newspaper La Vanguardia.
""This should not be seen as me walking away from this project,"" he said.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called for the Catalan parliament to be formed on January 17.

Market-friendly Ciudadanos, which wants Catalonia to remain part of Spain and is led by Ines Arrimadas, gained the largest share of the popular vote but unionist parties did not win enough seats to govern by majority.

CIUDAD GUAYANA, Venezuela (Reuters) - A second day of lootings and scattered street protests hit the Ciudad Guayana in southeastern Venezuela on Tuesday, as unrest grows in the once-booming industrial city plagued with food shortages and a malaria outbreak. 
At least five food stores were looted overnight, with police sources saying some 20 people had been arrested. Angry Venezuelans also blocked three major roads to demand anti-malaria medicine, food, cooking gas and spare parts for trucks. 
There has been increasing unrest around the South American OPEC member in the last few weeks as a fourth straight year of painful recession and the world's highest inflation leaves millions unable to eat enough. 
Erika Garcia tearfully recounted how looters ransacked her food shop and home just 10 minutes after National Guard soldiers who had been patrolling the area withdrew late on Monday night. 
""They stole everything. They broke off the water pipes, they ripped off the toilet bowl, they took away the windows, the fences, the doors, the beds. Everything. They did not kill us because we ran, but they did beat us up,"" said Garcia, 38, who planned to sleep at a relative's house on Tuesday night
She said there was no way she could reopen her store. 
The overnight lootings follow at least four similar in the early hours of Monday. Around 10 liquor stores were also looted on Christmas day in southeastern Bolivar state, according to the local chamber of commerce head Florenzo Schettino. [nL1N1OQ0V9]
Critics blame President Nicolas Maduro and the ruling Socialist Party for Venezuela's economic mess, saying they have persisted with failed statist policies for too long while turning a blind eye to rampant corruption and suffering.
The government says it is the victim of an ""economic war"" by political opponents and right-wing foreign powers, intent on bringing down Maduro in a coup. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the lootings on Tuesday. 
The wave of plunder has spooked many in Ciudad Guyana, leading more people to stay indoors come nightfall and dissuading some stores from opening. 
Metal worker Alvaro Becerra lives near a store that was ransacked overnight. 
""We lived a night of terror,"" said Becerra, 52, adding he heard gunshots and saw people carrying a freezer full of food.

Rainfall totals ranged from 2 inches (5 cm) to 4.5 inches (11 cm) in the area, said the National Weather Service. 
At least two deaths were blamed on the storm and mudslides in Santa Barbara County, the hardest-hit county in the area, County Supervisor Janet Wolf said in a telephone interview. She did not specify the cause of the deaths. 
The threat of mudslides prompted the county to order 7,000 residents to leave their homes before the rains came and to urge 23,000 others to evacuate voluntarily.
Photos posted by the local fire department showed a teenager covered in black mud being led away from the rubble of a house that was destroyed by the mudslide in Montecito. She had been trapped in the home for hours before rescuers came to her aid, the Santa Barbara County Fire Department said on Twitter.
Other pictures showed ankle-deep mud, logs, boulders and other debris in residential areas.
Last month's wildfires, including the largest in the state's history, left the area vulnerable to mudslides. The fires burned away grass and shrubs that hold the soil in place, and also baked a waxy layer into the earth that prevents water from sinking deeply into the ground. 
The overnight rains forced road closures, including sections of Highway 101, essentially cutting off vehicular traffic between Santa Barbara and Ventura counties northwest of Los Angeles. But Ventura County escaped with little damage, the sheriff's office said.

The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday morning declared a local emergency and asked the state to also make an emergency declaration.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen's armed Houthi movement threatened to block the strategic Red Sea shipping lane if the Saudi-led coalition it is fighting keeps pushing toward the port of Hodeidah it controls, the Houthi-run SABA news agency reported.
Yemen lies beside the southern mouth of the Red Sea, one of the most important trade routes in the world for oil tankers, which pass near Yemen's shores while heading from the Middle East through the Suez Canal to Europe.
While SABA gave no details on how Houthis could carry out any such move, the Bab al-Mandab strait, where the Red Sea meets the Gulf of Aden in the Arabian Sea, is only 20 km (12 mile) wide, making hundreds of ships potentially an easy target.
""If the aggressors keep pushing toward Hodeidah and if the political solution hits wall, there are some strategic choices that will be taken as a no return point, including blocking the international navigation in the Red Sea,"" Houthis' Ansarullah political council chief, Saleh al-Samad, was quoted saying.
""Their ships pass by our waters while our people starve,"" Samad was quoted as saying while he met U.N. officials.
U.N. officials have been trying to get the two sides back to the negotiating table after talks collapsed 2016. Samad said his movement was ready to give concessions in any political talks in order to stop the bloodshed. 
Yemen, one of the Arab world's poorest countries, is embroiled in a proxy war between the Houthi armed movement, allied with Iran, and a U.S.-backed military coalition headed by Saudi Arabia.
Some 8 million people are on the brink of famine, more than 10,000 have been killed and tens of thousands of others are struggling with cholera, diphtheria and other diseases.
The Saudi-led coalition has been trying since the start of the war in March 2015 to capture Hodeidah, Yemen's biggest port, which receives 80 percent of Yemen's imports, and has in recent weeks launched a ground campaign and intensified air strikes. 
On Tuesday, the United Arab Emirates minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said on Twitter the threats were another proof of ""the terrorist nature of the Houthi militias"", especially as Samad was meeting a U.N. delegation. UAE is a major partner of the military coalition fighting the Houthis.

""The Houthi who decimated crops and seeds, destroyed Yemen, betrayed his ally and partner, is now threatening the international navigation; we are facing a terrorist gang that the end of its existence in Yemen is nigh,"" Gargash said.

Sisi has yet to announce his candidacy for the ballot, scheduled for March 26-28. But he is widely expected to run and win the election.
The former general won a landslide victory in an election in 2014, one year after - as a military commander - he led the overthrow of elected president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood.
The election will be Egypt's third since the 2011 uprising that ended strongman Hosni Mubarak's long rule.
Election regulations stipulate that would-be candidates must obtain the backing of at least 20 members of parliament for their candidacy or must be supported by at least 25,000 eligible voters in at least 15 governorates. 
So far, 464 of the 596 members of parliament have come forward to support Sisi, deputy secretary general of parliament Mohamed Nosair said. Lawmakers are not permitted to support more than one candidate.
The national election commission has said that candidates must register from Jan. 20 to 29 and that a final list of candidates will be announced on Feb. 20.]
Sisi's critics say his popularity has been dimmed by austerity reforms, security problems and a crackdown on dissidents. But few contenders have come forward in a contest that most observers expect Sisi to win easily. 
Former prime minister Ahmed Shafik, who was seen as the most serious potential challenger to Sisi's rule, said on Sunday he was no longer considering running.
Another presidential hopeful, rights lawyer Khaled Ali, faces a potential three-month prison sentence for public indecency over an alleged rude hand gesture he made outside a courthouse last year. He may be disqualified from standing if he loses his appeal on March 7.
Haitham al-Hariri, leader of a leftist bloc in parliament, told Reuters that his 16-member group of lawmakers has not signed on to Sisi's nomination and remains open to backing other candidates.
""The bloc has disagreements with policies but not with people... with the current policies being followed whether economic, social or security-related policies,"" said Hariri.

""The bloc doesn't believe that the continuation of these policies is best for Egypt,"" he said.

""My concern (is) that as we talk about region stability, withdrawing funding for UNRWA would be very negative both in terms of humanitarian needs of over 5 million people but also of course it would be destabilizing for the region,"" Olof Skoog said, referring to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees.
The United States is the largest donor to UNRWA, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to the organization's website.
Last Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the United States may withhold future aid payments to Palestinians, accusing them of being unwilling to talk peace with Israel. Earlier, his U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the future U.S. funding for UNRWA was under review.
A State Department official later said that no decision had been made on payment.
""We’re just trying to sort out what the exact information is on that,"" Skoog said on Tuesday, adding that he has brought the subject up bilaterally with Haley.
Relations between the Palestinians and Washington soured last month after Trump announced the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, generating outrage across the Arab world and concern among Washington's Western allies.
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Palestinian officials have said Trump's declaration on Jerusalem meant he could not serve as an honest broker in peace negotiations with Israel that Washington has been trying to revive.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated over the weekend his call for UNRWA to be dismantled.

At least 83 people have been killed in the communal violence since Dec. 31. 
Muhammadu Buhari, who called for calm, has already ordered a heightened police presence in the central state of Benue, where most of the killings took place in the last few weeks, including the relocation of the country's police chief. 
Muslim herdsmen, mainly of the Fulani ethnic group, and Christian farmers often clash over the use of land in parts of central Nigeria, known as the Middle Belt. 
""President Buhari holds the view, as do many experts, that these conflicts are more often than not, as a result of major demographic changes in Nigeria,"" said an emailed statement issued by the presidency. 
""While the land size has not changed and will not change, urban sprawl and development have simply reduced land area both for peasant farming and cattle grazing,"" said the statement, urging people to remain calm and cooperate with security agencies. 
It said Nigeria's population was around 63 million when the west African country gained independence in 1960, compared with a population now ""estimated at close to 200 million"".
The United Nations estimates that Africa's most populous country is set to become the country with the world's third largest population, behind India and China, by 2050. 
The presidency said a conference would be set up in an attempt to identify short and long term solutions to the problem of clashes between the semi-nomadic farmers and the mostly settled farmers. 
The Middle Belt region is a diverse region in which differing religious, ancestral and cultural differences have frequently kindled conflict in the last few decades.
Despite the most recent outbreaks of violence, Nigerians, split roughly equally between Christians and Muslims from around 250 different ethnic groups, mostly live peacefully together.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's would-be coalition partners have reached agreement on a law to attract skilled immigrants, German media reported on Tuesday, suggesting the parties are edging closer to a decision to open formal coalition negotiations.
Conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel is betting on the reluctant Social Democrats (SPD) to give her a fourth term after 12 years at the helm after her initial efforts to form a coalition with two smaller parties failed in November.
But many in the SPD oppose a repeat of the ""grand coalition"" that governed for the past four years as they fear it will further weaken the center-left party, which suffered its worst result in September's vote since 1933. Some SPD members are also concerned that a new grand coalition would make the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) the main opposition party.
Immigration is one of the most sensitive topics in the talks. German newspaper network RND cited a paper from a working group in the exploratory talks as saying the parties had agreed that skilled workers should be encouraged to come to Germany in an orderly way. But they disagreed on the law's name, it said.
More than a million migrants, many of them fleeing conflict in the Middle East, have arrived in Germany since mid-2015 but many have struggled find their feet in the labor market due to a lack of language or vocational skills. Europe's largest economy needs skilled labor given its aging population.
The understanding on that topic, following compromises on tax and carbon emissions policy achieved on Monday, indicates the parties could strike a deal to end the political impasse in Germany more than three months after the national election.
The political uncertainty has not cast a shadow over the booming economy, with the government on Tuesday raising its 2017 growth forecast and saying it expected the upswing to continue this year.
That is having a knock-on effect on public finances. The financial daily Handelsblatt reported that the government had a stronger-than-expected surplus in 2017 and that, combined with unused funds earmarked for asylum seekers, means it has 10.4 billion euros more to spend than planned.
The extra cash should make it easier for the parties to paper over their differences with freer spending.
MAKING PROGRESS
RND also reported that the parties had agreed to expand fast internet around the country by 2025, an investment they expected to require up to 12 billion euros in public financing during this legislative period.
The parties further agreed on tax incentives to promote research and investment in digitalization, RND said.
The conservative bloc and SPD have agreed to keep mum during the five days of exploratory talks due to end on Thursday but senior members of both groups suggested talks were progressing well.
Senior conservative Volker Kauder said the negotiations had been ""good"" and the participants were on track to decide by Thursday whether to progress to full-blown negotiations. The SPD will then ask its members to vote on that.
SPD leader Martin Schulz said the party chairs had held a ""good discussion"" on European Union reform - another topic expected to prove contentious during the talks - but did not give any specifics. 

Peter Altmaier, acting finance minister and Merkel's chancellery chief, said negotiations were tough and it was necessary to recognize ""that we need to pull ourselves together because the people expect that"", and the parties needed to be prepared to enter into compromises on some points.

LONDON (Reuters) - A government reshuffle by British Prime Minister Theresa May was dismissed even by some of her allies on Tuesday as a failure that one said left her attempt to reassert her authority in ""smoke and wreckage"".
One former minister, George Osborne, sacked by May when she came to power in July 2016, led the criticism, calling the moves a ""farce"".
But other more loyal members of her governing Conservatives also questioned the prime minister's ability to put the party back on track for election success after a year of scandals, gaffes and divisions over Brexit.
A cabinet reshuffle is meant to offer a chance for a leader to assert authority on a team. May had hoped the limited changes would not only re-energize her domestic agenda but also strengthen her hand in talks to leave the European Union.
Instead, it did little more than demonstrate May's weakness, with the only high-profile moves derailed when one minister quit rather than take a new job and another talked May out of changing his role.
May said her reshuffle helped the government look ""more like the country it serves"".
""It allows a new generation of gifted ministers to step up and make life better for people across the whole UK,"" she said in a statement.
But for Osborne, it was simply a ""farce"".
""You have to hand it to this prime minister: she's given us the hat-trick of the worst reshuffle, the worst party conference speech and the worst manifesto in modern history,"" the former finance minister wrote in his newspaper, London's Evening Standard.
""If they were not facing one of the worst oppositions we’ve ever had, the Tories would be finished.""
But while his criticism was to be expected, even loyal lawmakers and commentators asked why the prime minister had launched a reshuffle from a weakened position, unable to force her will.
""She should not have been in the position of having to plead with a minister whose talents she needs, faced with a choice of giving in or sacking him,"" the Conservativehome website, which airs the views of the party, wrote in an editorial.
But, it added, in the ""smoke and wreckage this morning, there are a few points of hope and light"".
PALE, MALE, STALE
On Tuesday, May moved to promote younger, black and women lawmakers to junior roles in government, hoping to rid the party of its reputation of being ""pale, stale and male"".
But by playing very much to her own party rather than the country, some critics said May risks losing the chance to revitalize what her aides call her ""reform agenda"", already hampered by Brexit, a scandal over sexual harassment and struggling public services.
Monday's reshuffle was blown off course when Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt convinced May at a lengthy meeting not to move him to a different job. Newspapers said he refused to accept a new post, although a source close to May denied that, and said Hunt simply persuaded her.
Then education minister Justine Greening refused to take a job at the pensions department and quit instead.
Losing the only gay minister in the cabinet threatens what May hoped to be the narrative of her reshuffle: that she was ushering in a new, more diverse team to counter accusations that the Conservative Party is out of touch.
The resignation of the newly appointed board member of a new universities watchdog over sexist tweets also did little to help distance May from scandals over sexual harassment last year that brought down two ministers.
But aides had long said Monday's moves were less important that those on Tuesday, when May promoted lawmakers to junior positions in preparation of a wider reshuffle after Brexit.
""Today I expect the rest of the picture to show that it's more about preparing the ground for a post-Brexit reshuffle at a senior level,"" Crispin Blunt, a Conservative lawmaker, told Reuters.
And few predicted the furor to lead to her downfall.

""Once everyone is in place, there won't be any trouble,"" a senior Conservative member said on condition of anonymity. ""It'll be more of the same, she will take one step at a time ... and suddenly, we'll be in 2019.""

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek demonstrators stormed the country's labor ministry and confronted its chief on Tuesday in protest at moves to restrict the right to strike, a condition set by international creditors in exchange for bailout funds.
Athens is set to introduce legislation which could limit the frequency of strikes in the country, infuriating labor unions which regard industrial action as sacrosanct. 
Using crowbars, about 500 demonstrators with Greek Communist-affiliated group PAME prised open metal shutters of the labor ministry in central Athens, racing up to the eighth floor of the building where about 50 of them came face to face with Labor Minister Effie Achtsioglou.
The 32-year old minister is a staunch leftist in the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
Visibly disturbed, Achtsioglou was silent as demonstrators shouted ""shame on you"" over legislation due to go to parliament this week. 
""Take it back,"" they shouted. ""I will not take it back,"" she responded.
Her office was undamaged, but a Reuters witness saw two to three desks in the corridor leading to her office damaged or overturned.
Earlier, about 500 protesters had rallied outside the labor ministry, putting up a banner reading ""Ministry of EU and IMF!"" and chanting ""We won't yield to plutocracy!""
The European Union and International Monetary Fund have bailed Greece out from becoming bankrupt due to oppressive debt, but demanded severe austerity in exchange. Part of that has been changes to the labor law. 
More protesters arrived as a group unfurled a huge banner that read ""Hands off strikes, it's a labor right!"", hanging it from the roof of the ministry on a busy street in central Athens. 
Greece's leftist-led government was due to submit a bill with bailout-mandated reforms to parliament on Tuesday. The government has agreed to increase the quorum for unions to vote on a strike. 

Lawmakers are expected to vote on the reforms before a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Jan 22, which will assess the country's bailout progress as part of a review by its lenders.

YANGON (Reuters) - Calls grew on Tuesday for the release of two Reuters journalists in Myanmar who are facing accusations of breaching the country's Official Secrets Act, with former U.S. President Bill Clinton urging that they be freed immediately.
The reporters, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained on Dec. 12. They are due to make their second appearance in court in the main city of Yangon on Wednesday.
The two had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a military crackdown that followed militant attacks on security forces.
""A free press is critical to a free society - the detention of journalists anywhere is unacceptable. The Reuters journalists being held in Myanmar should be released immediately,"" Clinton said in a Twitter post.
Clinton was U.S. president for much of the 1990s when the United States pressed Myanmar's then military rulers to release democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi from years of house arrest.
Suu Kyi won a 2015 election and formed a government in early 2016, although she is barred by the constitution from becoming president. She has made no public comment on the case of the two Reuters reporters. Her spokesman has said the case would be handled according to the law.
The Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying the two reporters were ""arrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces."" 
It said they had ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"".
The Official Secrets Act dates back to 1923, when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was a province of British India. It carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power referred in a post on Twitter to the detention of the two reporters as ""an outrage & symptom of a world without credible US leadership"".
Government officials from nations such as the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for the release of the reporters.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, Katina Adams, reiterated Washington's deep concern about the prosecution of the journalists.
""We call for their immediate and unconditional release, and for the charges against them to be dropped,"" she said. ""A free press is vital to Burma’s transition and to becoming a viable democracy, and we want Burma’s democracy to succeed.""
'INNOCENT OF WRONGDOING'
Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of the reporters.
""As they near their hearing date, it remains entirely clear that they are innocent of any wrongdoing,"" Adler said in a statement on Monday.
A group of Myanmar reporters asked the government on Monday for details about the arrest of the two, arguing that the case could have implications for the ability of journalists to do their jobs.
Authorities have blocked most media access to the north of Rakhine State, where Rohingya militant attacks on the security forces on Aug. 25 sparked the military crackdown.
The United Nations has condemned the Myanmar military campaign as ethnic cleansing. Buddhist-majority Myanmar has rejected the accusation.
The Committee to Protect Journalists also called on Myanmar to release the two reporters.

An independent Myanmar media outlet, the Development Media Group, which is based in and focuses on coverage of events in Rakhine State, also called for the release of the pair.

The recording, aired late on Monday by Israeli Hadashot News, was made in 2015 while Netanyahu's son, Yair, toured strip clubs in Tel Aviv while partying with two friends.
In it, Yair Netanyahu and his friends are heard teasing each other on who has paid for what during their night out on the town. When one of the friends tells Yair he spotted him 400 Shekels (about $115), Yair says: ""No, that was for the hooker.""
In other portions of the recording Yair offers ""to arrange"" an ex-girlfriend for his friend in order to settle his debts, appears to rate strippers' skills and appearances and is embarrassed by a late-night phone-call from his mother.
Yair issued a statement in which he said the news report was salacious, the recording illegal and that he was inebriated at the time. 
""I said ridiculous things about women and about other people, which should not have been said. These things do not represent me, the values I was raised on and what I believe in. I regret these and apologise to anyone hurt by them,"" said the statement, quoted in Israeli media.
The recording has made headlines in Israel, where Yair was criticised for using a state-funded car and driver to take him around strip clubs along with his state-funded security guard.
""This is terrible moral bankruptcy. Debased, disgusting, rude behavior objectifying women while accompanied by a car and security funded by the state,"" opposition lawmaker Shelly Yachimovich said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Speaking with reporters in Jerusalem on Tuesday, the prime minister said his son was right to apologize. ""My wife and I raised our children to respect any person and to respect all women,"" Netanyahu said.
One of the friends Netanyahu was with is the son of an Israeli businessman, Kobi Maimon, who has a stake in Israel's offshore natural gas fields. At the time of the recording Netanyahu's government was finalizing a deal for their development. 
""Bro, my dad just arranged 20 billion dollars for your dad and you can't spot me 400 Shekels?"" Yair told his friend jokingly as laughter was heard. 
In a written response issued to the report on Monday, Netanyahu said he was unaware of his son's friendship with Maimon and that it had no bearing on the gas deal, nor did Yair have any knowledge of it. 
He called the report wicked gossip and said the media was hounding his family as part of a campaign against his right-wing government.
Netanyahu, who has a sometimes adversarial relationship with Israeli media, is under police investigation for alleged corruption in two criminal cases. He denies wrongdoing. 
The 26-year-old Yair Netanyahu has found himself the center of controversy in the past. 
In September he drew anger in Israel and abroad for posting a cartoon using what the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors anti-Semitism worldwide, described as anti-Semitic imagery in a Facebook post mocking some of his father’s critics. 

In August, he made another headline-grabbing post after a protester was killed during a white nationalist rally in the U.S. state of Virginia, that suggested hard-left organizations pose more of a danger than neo-Nazi groups.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss Alpine resort of Zermatt airlifted guests by helicopter on Tuesday after heavy snow and a power cut stranded thousands of visitors.
An estimated 13,000 people were stuck in Zermatt after snow closed mountain lifts, ski runs, walking paths and train services to the village.
With the onset of the wintery weather, avalanche danger in the rugged region of Wallis that includes Zermatt near the Italian border is now rated as ""very great"", the highest level, according to the Swiss Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research. 
In the town of Visp, about 30 km (20 miles) down the valley from Zermatt, 20 people were evacuated from their homes after a mud- and snowslide sent debris into a portion of the village, Swiss broadcaster SRG reported on Tuesday. Nobody was injured.
However, the tourist office said there was no reason for concern in Zermatt. Town officials say the airlift service was just arranged for those wishing to leave.
""Power has returned, there's still the chance that it could go out ... but at this time things look good,"" a tourist office spokeswoman said. ""The atmosphere in the village is relaxed and comfortable.""
Helicopters flew for about two hours on Tuesday afternoon, she said.
Guests seeking to leave the car-free village at the foot of the Matterhorn were flown to Taesch, about 5 km (3 miles) away. 
From there, Zermatt had enlisted buses in place of rail service to take people further down the valley following the opening of the road. Helicopters were also used to transport people seeking to reach Zermatt, officials said.

Swiss mountain communities have been in the spotlight for geological risks since August, when the side of a mountain collapsed in the southern canton of Grisons, killing eight hikers. Their bodies have not been found.

The Federal Constitutional Court overturned a ruling by a lower court that ordered the deportation of the man, who was born and raised in Germany, after he was convicted of traveling to Syria and supporting a ""terrorist organization"".
Nearly a thousand people are believed to have left Germany to fight with Islamist militants. Some are now returning as the jihadist group's presence in the Middle East crumbles.
The court ruling said the 30 year-old man, who was not identified by name, went to Syria with his wife and children in 2013 where he supported an Islamist militia group, After his return to Germany, he transferred money to an account related to Islamic State, it said.
He was initially sentenced to three years and six months in prison in Germany in 2015, but immigration authorities ordered his immediate deportation to Turkey.
The high court called for checks.
""It is constitutionally necessary for responsible authorities and courts to be informed about the conditions in a destination country before a deportation,"" the court said.
Germany is home to around three million people of Turkish descent, some of who have German citizenship, while others only hold Turkish passports.
A growing number of Turks have sought asylum in Germany since the 2016 failed military coup in Turkey.

""Once again, the nation tells the US, Britain, and those who seek to overthrow the Islamic Republic of Iran from abroad that 'you've failed, and you will fail in the future, too.'"" Khamenei tweeted.
The Revolutionary Guards, the military force loyal to Khamenei, said on Sunday security forces had put an end to the unrest that it too said had been whipped up by foreign enemies. 
At least 1,000 people have been arrested in the biggest anti-government protests for nearly a decade, with the judiciary saying ringleaders could face the death penalty.
A judiciary official announced on Tuesday that a detainee in Arak, a town approximately 200 km south of Tehran, had died after committing suicide, according to Mizan, the website of the Iranian judiciary. 
On Monday, a separate judiciary official announced that a detainee had committed suicide in Tehran's Evin prison.
The reports have raised concerns among human rights activists and some Iranian politicians that detainees may have been killed by security forces while in custody.
""I warn the president and security and judiciary officials to prevent the occurrence of a second Kahrizak,"" Mahmoud Sadeghi, a parliamentarian, tweeted on Monday. The Kahrizak prison gained notoriety when a handful of detainees were killed and tortured at the site after unrest in 2009.
Khamenei said U.S. President Donald Trump was grandstanding when he tweeted support for protesters he said were trying ""to take back their corrupt government"" and promising ""great support from the United States at the appropriate time!""
The Iranian leader tweeted: ""... this man who sits at the head of the White House - although, he seems to be a very unstable man - he must realize that these extreme and psychotic episodes won't be left without a response.""
As well as Washington and London, Khamenei blamed the violence on Israel, exiled dissident group People's Mujahedin of Iran and ""a wealthy government"" in the Gulf, a probable reference to Iran's regional rival, Saudi Arabia.
In a rare public appearance, the head of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad said the protests were due to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's failure to improve people's economic or social circumstances, but he said they were unlikely to overthrow the establishment.
""In Iran too, we have eyes and ears,"" Yossi Cohen told a Finance Ministry conference in Jerusalem.
""One shouldn't develop high hopes, though I would be happy to see a meaningful revolution,"" he added.
Khamenei has called the protests - which were initially about the economy but soon turned political - ""playing with fireworks"", but he said citizens had a right to air legitimate concerns, a rare concession by a leader who usually voices clear support for security crackdowns.
""These concerns must be addressed. We must listen, we must hear. We must provide answers within our means,"" Khamenei was quoted as saying, hinting that not only the government of Rouhani, but his own clerical leadership must also respond. 

""I am also responsible. All of us must follow up,"" Khamenei said.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - A bomb went off in the center of the Pakistani city of Quetta, capital of the province of Balochistan, killing seven people and wounding 23 on Tuesday, police and hospital officials said.
The blast targeted a police truck close to a high security area where the provincial assembly and other government offices are located. A suicide bomber was believed to have walked up to the truck and blown himself up, senior police officer Abdul Razzaq Cheema told Reuters.
The bodies of five policemen and two civilians, as well as the wounded victims, were brought to the Civil Hospital, Dr Waseem Baig told Reuters, adding that death toll could climb as some of the injured were in serious condition.
The attack took place hours after the provincial chief minister, Sanaullah Zehri, resigned, although there was no indication that the blast was connected to provincial politics.
Zehri quit after some members of his PML Nawaz party rebelled against him to back a no-confidence motion in the provincial assembly, where he no longer commanded majority support. 
Balochistan province is an important leg in the $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor of energy and infrastructure projects that China hopes to build as part of its ""belt and road"" initiative.

Last month two suicide bombers stormed a packed Christian church in southwestern Pakistan killing nine people and wounding up to 56, in the latest attack claimed by Islamic State in the country.

Under Switzerland's system of direct democracy, voters on March 4 will have their say on extending the federal government's right to levy federal income tax and value-added tax.
The direct federal tax and the sales tax together contributed about two-thirds of the Swiss central government's budget, bringing in around 43.5 billion Swiss francs ($44.25 billion) in 2016.
However the right to levy the taxes is limited by the Swiss constitution, with current approval running only to the end of 2020.
Should voters reject the measure, the government would have to slash spending by more than 60 percent practically overnight or find new sources of revenue, Maurer told reporters. 
""That would hardly be feasible and also not be in the interests of broad swathes of the population,"" he said.
The country's cantons would also suffer because they get part of the direct tax revenue, he said, noting the new law was not an excuse to raise taxation levels.

Parliament adopted the law without opposition after a debate on whether the federal government's authority to levy taxes should have a time limit. The compromise solution was to extend the deadline for both levies to 2035.

They were charged with causing the deaths of two policemen during clashes at al-Nahda square in Giza in southern Cairo, as well as other counts of attempted murder and vandalism.
Seventeen people were sentenced to life in prison, 223 were given 15 years and another 22 accused were given three years.
The court acquitted 115 others accused in the case.
Al-Nahda square was one of two sites where Mursi supporters gathered in the weeks following his overthrow by the military in July 2013 led by then general and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Sisi was elected in 2014 and is expected to seek a second term in a March vote this year.
Authorities broke up the two sit-ins - at al-Nahda and Rabaa squares - in August 2013, killing hundreds of protesters. Protests were banned shortly after the two pro-Mursi camps were dispersed and scores were arrested. 
Hundreds of Mursi sympathizers have been detained and prosecuted since his ousting. Egypt has banned the Muslim Brotherhood, deeming it a terrorist organization.
The government accuses the Brotherhood of fomenting an Islamist insurgency since Mursi's removal. Militant attacks have killed hundreds of Egyptians, mostly soldiers and police.
Security forces have killed hundreds and detained thousands of members of the group, which says it is committed to political change through peaceful means only.

The court also ordered on Tuesday that those sentenced be fined a total of nearly 40 million Egyptian pounds ($2.27 million) for damaging public property.

Athens has blocked the ex-Yugoslav republic's attempts to join NATO and objects to its EU membership bid because it says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over Greece's own northerly region of that name.
""We are committed to finding a solution in this six months,"" said Bujar Osmani, FYROM's deputy prime minister responsible for European affairs. ""2018 is the golden year of opportunity for my country to make progress in terms of Euro-atlantic integration. That is why we are committed to finding a solution."" 
Under a 1995 accord, Greece has only agreed that the country be referred to as the ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"", as an interim measure until the dispute is resolved. 
It will not acquiesce to the country joining NATO or the EU, of which Greece is a member, under the FYROM banner.
Osmani, who was visiting Athens, said he believed there was a ""sincerity and commitment""' by Greece to resolve the issue. 
Greeks are very sensitive about the name issue, and rallies were planned in northern Greece later in January against any compromise which may use the name Macedonia.
But Athens says there is now a window of opportunity to resolve the row following the election of a more moderate government in the neighboring country which appears more amenable to a deal.
""Right now the issue...is to create conditions for the widest possible consensus to put behind us a problem which has weighed on the country, and the wider region, for the past twenty five years,"" Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said.
Greece and FYROM were due to hold a new round of talks with a United Nations mediator in late January. 
The Balkan state declared independence from ex-Yugoslavia in 1991 but almost immediately found itself at loggerheads with Greece. 

""There are a lot of emotional layers. We need to peel them off to find a rational solution,"" Osmani told reporters after meeting Greek officials.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Israel should stop plans to send tens of thousands of migrants back to Africa forcibly, the United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday, suggesting some could be resettled in Europe or other countries. 
Israel said last Wednesday it would pay thousands of African migrants living illegally in the country to leave, threatening them with jail if they are caught after the end of March.
The vast majority come from Eritrea and Sudan and many say they fled war and persecution as well as economic hardship. Israel treats them mostly as economic migrants.
The plan offers African migrants a $3,500 payment from the Israeli government and a free air ticket to return home or go to ""third countries"", which rights groups identified as Rwanda and Uganda.
""We are again appealing to Israel to halt its policy of relocating Eritreans and Sudanese to sub-Saharan Africa,"" William Spindler of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told a Geneva briefing.
""Official statements that the plans may eventually target families and those with pending asylum claims, or that asylum seekers might be taken to the airport in handcuffs, are particularly alarming,"" he said.
Some 27,000 Eritreans and 7,700 Sudanese live in Israel, but authorities there have only granted refugee status to 11 since 2009, Spindler said.
In Europe, Eritreans have a very high rate of recognition as refugees fleeing war or persecution, he said. ""So we would expect that among them, many would qualify for refugee status.
""What we would like to see in Israel – and we are willing to help in that respect – is to find legal alternatives for these people, through resettlement in other countries."" 
Rwanda and Uganda both said last Friday they had not struck any deal to take in African migrants from Israel under a scheme condemned by rights groups.
Over the past two years, UNHCR has interviewed 80 Eritrean refugees or asylum seekers in Rome who arrived in Italy after a hazardous journey across Africa following their departure from Israel to Rwanda, Spindler said.
""Along the way, they suffered abuse, torture and extortion before risking their lives once again by crossing the Mediterranean to Italy,"" he said. 

Some migrants had reportedly died en route to Libya, he said, noting that U.N. agencies are carrying out emergency evacuations of migrants from Libya, where slave-like conditions have been reported in detention centers.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's center-right coalition government will scale back its tax-cut plan to get it through parliament rather than link it to legislation on revoking refugees' residence rights, as sought by its nationalist ally the Danish People's Party (DF).
The move is another reminder of the minority government's difficulties in pushing through its economic agenda in a parliament dominated by parties, including DF, that support the welfare state and its high taxes.
In return for the proposed tax cuts, DF had demanded new legislation that would make it easier to revoke residence permits for refugees from nations such as Syria once peace is restored in their home countries.
But Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said at a press conference on Tuesday that he saw no reason why the two subjects should be linked.
""The government would very much like to discuss immigration policy with DF. But it should be on the immigration policy's own terms ... not to get tax cuts,"" he said.
Rasmussen, who heads the Liberal Party, said he would therefore only continue tax negotiations in areas where DF and the government have already agreed to proceed.
He said he hoped to be able to ""rather quickly"" reach a deal on the tax policy for the next four years but not for the years through to 2025 as he had first intended.
""I bet there will be other opportunities before we get there, so it's not that the government is giving up on its ambitions,"" Rasmussen said.
His junior coalition partner Liberal Alliance (LA) had said before Christmas that the coming tax cuts would be ""historically big"".
The anti-immigration DF is not part of the three-way coalition, but the government depends on it for a majority in parliament.
DF leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl said Rasmussen's decision on Tuesday made it possible for the parties to move on despite the rather ""locked"" political situation in parliament. 
Dahl said DF would continue to work for its tighter immigration proposals regarding war refugees.

The move comes after the March conviction of a Pakistani man for spying for Iran in Germany went into force.
Mustufa Haidar Syed-Naqfi was convicted of gathering intelligence on Reinhold Robbe, the former head of the German-Israel Friendship Society, and an Israeli-French economics professor in Paris, for Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.
The Foreign Ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador to deliver the unusually sharp rebuke once the German constitutional court rejected his appeal. The meeting took place on Dec. 22 but was not disclosed until now. 
""Spying on people and institutions with special ties to the state of Israel on German soil is an egregious violation of German law,"" a ministry official said. 
The official said Philipp Ackermann, acting director of the Foreign Ministry's political section, had told the Iranian ambassador that ""such activities would not be tolerated and were completely unacceptable"".
News of the meeting comes days before the foreign ministers of Iran, Germany, France and Britain are due to meet in Brussels to discuss a 2015 landmark nuclear agreement with Iran, and growing concerns about Iran's crackdown on anti-government protesters.
Germany, which helped negotiate the nuclear deal, has sought to balance its interest in expanding trade ties with Iran with its strong commitment to human rights.
It has played a key role in European efforts to persuade Washington to keep the nuclear accord in place, an issue that will come up again late this week, when U.S. President Donald Trump must decide whether to reimpose oil sanctions lifted under the agreement. 
Germany's domestic intelligence service, which handles counterespionage, highlighted Iran's spying activities in its annual report in July, noting that Tehran was focused heavily on Israeli or pro-Jewish targets.

Austria's ruling coalition of conservatives and the far right last week unveiled plans to cut the benefits, which start at around 114 euros ($136) a month for a child.
Austria borders eight countries, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, where wages are significantly lower. 
Eastern Europeans make up a large part of its workforce in sectors including healthcare and construction but they often live and work away from their families and children. 
Speaking at a news conference in Bratislava after a meeting Austria's Foreign Affairs Minister Karin Kneissl, Slovakia's acting Foreign Minister Ivan Korcok called on Austria to honor the principle of non-discrimination.
""Our citizens who work in Austria, and work there legally, pay contributions to Austrian funds, therefore we expect they would receive appropriate benefits from these funds,"" Korcok said.
Kneissl said Austria would seek a change on a European level so that children benefits reflect the standard of living, welfare, and purchasing power in each country.
""We diplomats agreed we should open the door for (social affairs) ministers to discuss the issue,"" she added. 
In 2016, Austria transferred 273 million euros ($325 million) abroad to EU and European Economic Area countries in benefit payments for 132,000 children.
The European Commission criticized Germany last year for a similar plan to cut child benefits, which was later abandoned. 
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said last week the Austrian proposal was legally possible.

LONDON (Reuters) - Judges, not the government, will be in charge of enforcing French President Emmanuel Macron's proposed new legislation to fight fake news on the Internet, a minister said on Tuesday, dismissing concerns over state control of information.
Macron, a target of fake news and of a major data hack during his run for the presidency last year, announced plans last week to give judges powers to delete some content ion the Internet, close a user's account or block access to a website during election campaigns.
The plans also include giving French media regulator CSA new powers to remove broadcasters' rights to air content in France if it is deemed to be fake news.
The proposals quickly ran into opposition from lawmakers who warned of a risk to civil liberties, and from Twitter users who derided it by posting absurd statements under the hashtag #InventYourFakeNews.
""The judge will be there and he will judge,"" Culture Minister Francoise Nyssen told Reuters, in response to a question on how Macron's plan to counteract fake news online would work in practice.
Pressed to address concerns about whether the law would allow the authorities to muzzle opposition, Nyssen brushed aside such fears by saying that the proposed new powers would not be in the hands of the executive.
""On the one hand you have the CSA and on the other judges. So it's not the executive that will be getting involved,"" Nyssen told Reuters in an interview during a visit to London.
Macron strongly criticized Russian state-backed media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik during a visit to France by Russian President Vladimir Putin last year, denouncing them as ""agents of influence and propaganda"" who spread lies about him.
Without naming any particular media, Nyssen said that under the proposed new rules the CSA would be empowered to quickly remove broadcasting rights from any outlet that was deemed to be largely untrue and aimed at destabilizing French democracy.
""We are talking about media backed by foreign money who broadcast in a nefarious way information to destabilize, information that is false,"" said Nyssen.
""We have to think about how to extend the CSA's powers so that it could step in, not at the moment of the granting of broadcasting rights but further down the line, based on the reality of what is happening with such outlets.""
She was at pains to say that the new powers to crack down on fake news were only part of the strategy, and that it was also crucial to work on educating everyone in society to better judge what constituted reliable news and what did not. She said lots of work was under way to further that agenda.

Nyssen was in London to meet with BBC executives to discuss the British public broadcaster's own thinking on the issue of how to tackle fake news.

The key figures in the scheme, Huang Dingfang and Cai Keyi, were convicted on Monday at the Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court, according to a statement on the court's website.
Nineteen others involved were given sentences of up to 12 years, the court in the eastern Chinese city said.
Huang set up Longyan E-commerce Co Ltd in January 2015 and worked with another firm owned by Cai to swindle over 200,000 investors out of more than 15.6 billion yuan, the court said.
They promised annual returns of more than 250 percent to investors who paid in 4,000 yuan each. They then set up a third firm to sell shares, saying it would go public in the United States.
The court said it had ordered the 21 defendants to return over 5.7 billion yuan to more than 170,000 investors.  
China has launched a campaign to stamp out pyramid schemes which typically promise people they can get rich by joining and then recruiting new investors.
Cases investigated by Chinese police in the first nine months of 2017 involved nearly 30 billion yuan, the official Xinhua News Agency said in October.

HARARE (Reuters) - If Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai were to stand down - as he has hinted - the party he founded would face immediate instability and could even split, handing a gift to new President Emmerson Mnangagwa in an election this year.
The most visible opposition figure in the southern African nation since independence from Britain in 1980, Tsvangirai said on Monday it was time for the older generation to make way for younger leaders in the party.
Mnangagwa, 75, rose to power last November after Robert Mugabe stood down following a de facto coup, ending a 37-year reign marked by economic mismanagement, corruption and vote rigging allegations.
Investors and Western governments who cheered the end of Mugabe's rule will be closely watching the election for evidence Mnangagwa can run a free and fair vote and turn a new page in Zimbabwe's history.
It was expected that Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) would pose a robust challenge to Mnangagwa's ruling ZANU-PF.
But that prospect may now be in jeopardy.
Tsvangirai, who has been battling cancer for several years and looked frail at a meeting with Mnangagwa last week, did not explicitly say he would stand down and his spokesman said he could not comment further.
Tsvangirai, 65, has three deputies, one who was elected and two others he handpicked in 2016 to help him run the party, a move that still irks some MDC members.
The MDC has known division twice before, in 2005 and in 2014 following a heavy election defeat to the ZANU-PF. And, though analysts said it was good in the long term for Tsvangirai to relinquish the MDC leadership after nearly 20 years in charge, the succession had to be handled carefully.
""Behind the scenes, the three party vice presidents are gladiating to take over from Tsvangirai,"" said Eldred Masunungure, a political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe. 
""It should be a democratic process and not an autocratic change of power. If Tsvangirai takes that route it will tear the party asunder. It will be a sad day if Tsvangirai's departure means the death of the MDC."" 
""CRITICAL MOMENT""
The MDC has weakened progressively since 2008, when Tsvangirai defeated Mugabe in the first round of voting. 
After opting out of the run-off alleging violence by the army against its supporters, the MDC formed a unity government with ZANU-PF that helped stabilize the economy until Tsvangirai was defeated in a 2013 presidential election by Mugabe. 
A senior MDC official said Tsvangirai was still considering whether to call for a special leadership congress or have the party appoint a new presidential candidate who he could help campaign ahead of elections.
""The MDC is at a very critical moment and the issue of transitioning to a new leader has been weighing heavily on president Tsvangirai,"" the MDC executive told Reuters, asking for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Tsvangirai, 65, the self-taught son of a bricklayer who worked in a rural mine to support his family, cut his political teeth in the labor movement as a mine foreman, later becoming a top trade unionist.
In 1999 he was elected founding MDC president and built his political career as a one of the only people willing to stand up to Mugabe, making him difficult to replace.
He will have to juggle regional, tribal and gender considerations in looking for a successor.

""Those are salient issues that the MDC cannot run away from,"" said Masunungure.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian historian whose exposure of Soviet leader Josef Stalin's crimes angered state officials is due to begin enforced psychiatric testing this week amid fears he will be falsely declared insane, his lawyer said on Tuesday. 
Yuri Dmitriev, 61, is on trial in northwest Russia on charges brought by state prosecutors of involving his adopted daughter, then 11, in child pornography, of illegally possessing ""the main elements of"" a firearm, and of depravity involving a minor.
Some of Russia's leading cultural figures say Dmitriev was framed because his focus on Stalin's crimes - he found a mass grave with up to 9,000 bodies dating from the Soviet dictator's Great Terror in the 1930s - jars with the latter-day Kremlin narrative that Russia must not be ashamed of its past.
The narrative has taken on added importance ahead of a March presidential election which polls show incumbent Vladimir Putin, who uses his country's World War Two victory when Stalin was in charge to bolster national pride, is on track to win. 
Putin asserted last year that what he called an ""excessive demonization of Stalin"" was being used to undermine Russia.
Dmitriev faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the charges, which he denies. 
A previous psychiatric evaluation declared him to be of sound mind and a court-sanctioned expert group found no pornographic content in nine photographs of his daughter that are at the center of the case against him, overturning the earlier findings of other experts commissioned by prosecutors. 
But on Dec. 27, in an unexpected twist, the court ordered that the same nine photos be re-examined by experts for a third time. It also granted the prosecution's request that Dmitriev undergo enforced psychiatric testing to determine whether he has ""sexual deviations.""
However, the court declined a prosecution request to extend his detention beyond Jan. 28.
SOVIET HANGOVER 
Dmitriev's lawyer, Viktor Anufriev, told Reuters on Tuesday he had written to the supreme court of Karelia, the region where his client is being tried, to appeal against the court order.
""He's already been through one (psychiatric) test. The conclusions were fine, no evidence of deviance was found, and the results were not contested by prosecutors,"" said Anufriev.
""This (latest testing) was ordered illegally."" 
Dmitriev was flown to Moscow at the end of last year to be evaluated at a psychiatric clinic, the Serbsky Centre, that was infamous in Soviet times for providing false testimony to allow the authorities to lock up dissidents in psychiatric facilities.
Anufriev said he expected a doctor to be appointed to handle his client's psychiatric case later on Tuesday.
He said he hoped the evaluation, which could last for up to a month, would be objective, but was concerned that state security officials in Karelia might pressure doctors.
He did not specify which officials he was referring to.
State TV broadcast last year what it billed as an expose of Dmitriev and of Memorial, the organization for which he worked, complaining that foreign money was being used to provide a distorted and overly negative version of Russian history.
The Kremlin has told Reuters it does not get involved in cases like Dmitriev's, while the Investigative Committee of Karelia, whose investigators submitted the original case for prosecution, did not respond to Reuters' questions about whether there was a political side to the trial. They said only that there had been enough evidence to open a criminal case. 
Anufriev, Dmitriev's lawyer, said he was worried.

""Perhaps if they can't convict him (of child pornography) they need to declare him insane,"" the lawyer said. ""It's a purely Soviet procedure. Make accusations and then end things by locking someone up in a psychiatric facility.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korea on Tuesday agreed on negotiations to resolve problems and military talks aimed at averting accidental conflict, after their first official dialogue in more than two years, as Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program fuels tension. 
In a joint statement after the 11-hour talks, the North pledged to send a large delegation to next month's Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the South, but made a 'strong complaint' after Seoul proposed talks to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
South Korea asked its neighbor to halt hostile acts that stoke tension on the peninsula, and in return, the North agreed that peace should be guaranteed in the region, the South's unification ministry said in a separate statement.
The talks had been closely watched by world leaders keen for any sign of a reduction in tension, as fears grow over the North's missile launches and development of nuclear weapons, in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions. 
Earlier on Tuesday, Seoul said it was prepared to lift some sanctions temporarily so North Korean officials could visit the South for the Games. The North said its delegation would comprise athletes, high-ranking officials, a cheering squad, art performers as well as reporters and spectators. 
South Korea has unilaterally banned several North Korean officials from entry in response to Pyongyang's ramped-up missile and nuclear tests, held despite international pressure.
However, some South Korean officials have said they see the Olympics as a possible opportunity for easing tension. 
Foreign ministry spokesman Roh Kyu-deok said Seoul would consider whether it needed to take ""prior steps"", together with the U.N. Security Council and other relevant countries, to help the North Koreans visit for the Olympics. 
Working talks will be held soon to work out the details of bringing the North Koreans to the Olympics, the statement said, with the exact schedule to be decided via documented exchanges.
(For an interactive graphic on inter-Korean talks click http://tmsnrt.rs/2t8i6no) 
FAMILY REUNION
At Tuesday's talks, the first since December 2015, Seoul proposed inter-Korean military discussions to reduce tension on the peninsula and a reunion of family members in time for February's Lunar New Year holiday, but the joint statement made no mention of the reunions.
The North has finished technical work to restore a military hotline with South Korea, Seoul said, with normal communications set to resume on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear what information would be transferred along the hotline.
The North cut communications in February 2016, following the South's decision to shut down a jointly run industrial park in the North.
North Korea also responded 'positively' to the South's proposal for athletes from both sides to march together at the Games' opening ceremony and other joint activities during the Winter Olympics, Seoul said.
Athletes of the two sides have not paraded together at international sports events since the 2007 Asian Winter Games in China, after relations chilled under nearly a decade of conservative rule in the South.
The United States, which has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War, initially responded coolly to the idea of inter-Korean meetings, but U.S. President Donald Trump later called them ""a good thing"".
Trump has said he would like to see talks go beyond the Olympics. ""At the appropriate time, we'll get involved,"" he said.

On Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said it was happy to see talks between North and South Korea and welcomed all positive steps. Russia echoed the sentiment, with a Kremlin spokesman saying, ""This is exactly the kind of dialogue that we said was necessary.""

104,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Suspected Bosnian Serb war criminal arrested in Munich,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Tuesday they had arrested a Bosnian Serb man on suspicion of detaining and murdering Bosnian Muslims during the wars that broke up former Yugoslavia almost a quarter of a century ago.
Police said Milorad Obradovic was arrested at Munich airport after Bosnian authorities issued a warrant for his arrest. 
The 51-year-old is suspected of taking part in the illegal detention of around 120 Bosnian Muslim civilians in the village of Miska Glava, near the northwestern town of Prijedor, in July 1992, and their summary execution in nearby Ljubija.
""Milorad Obradovic was arrested for the purpose of extradition,"" said Joachim Ettenhofer, spokesperson for Munich prosecutors, adding that Bosnian authorities had 14 days to submit a detailed extradition request.
Police were unable to say why Obradovic was in Munich.
Boris Grubesic, a spokesman for Bosnia's state prosecutor, told Reuters Obradovic is also suspected of killing three Bosnian Muslim, or Bosniak, civilians at a local soccer stadium. 
Bosnian authorities have been looking for Obradovic for months, he said, adding that another suspect in this case was recently arrested in neighbouring Montenegro.
The Prijedor region was a stronghold of ultra-nationalist Serbs who sought during the war to drive out Bosnian Muslim and Croat inhabitants to create an ethnically Serb territory. Nearly 3,500 people went missing from Prijedor town alone.
The U.N.'s pioneering war crimes tribunal in The Hague, which finally closed its doors last year, sentenced 16 Bosnian Serbs to a total of 230 years in prison for atrocities in the Prijedor area.
The Bosnian war, during which ethnic Serbs and Croats fought to carve an ethnically pure state out of multi-ethnic Bosnia, was part of a wider Balkan conflagration in which Yugoslavia broke up into seven successor states. A series of wars there cost some 140,000 lives and lasted most of the 1990s.

ROME (Reuters) - The leader of Italy's far-right Northern League ruled out on Tuesday any future government role for party moderate Roberto Maroni, who has been touted as a possible prime minister if the center-right bloc wins the March election.
Maroni, a former interior minister, unexpectedly announced at the weekend that he would not seek re-election this year as president of the wealthy Lombardy region, which is centered on Italy's business capital Milan.
He told reporters he was standing aside for unspecified ""personal reasons"", but said he would be ready to help his allies in future, adding: ""I know what it means to govern.""
With the center-right bloc leading in opinion polls ahead of the March 4 ballot, Italian newspapers interpreted Maroni's words as meaning that he wanted to return to central government, perhaps as prime minister.
Northern League leader Matteo Salvini, who has pushed the group to the far right during his four years at the helm, was caught off-guard by Maroni's announcement and moved quickly to temper the political ambitions of the popular party veteran.
Asked by Radio 24 if Maroni might have a future government role, Salvini said: ""If you leave Lombardy ... which is worth much more than many ministries, if you feel you have reached the end of the road there, then obviously no"".
Salvini has aligned the League with hard-right parties across Europe, including France's National Front and the anti-Islam Freedom Party in the Netherlands. He wants Italy to exit the euro and promises zero tolerance on illegal immigration.
PREMIER CANDIDATE
Berlusconi has repeatedly told reporters that the League is a moderate party, saying Salvini is talking tough for electoral purposes. But Forza Italia officials in private acknowledge they find it much easier to work with League stalwart Maroni.
""We have worked very well with Maroni in Lombardy and this is the model we would expect to reproduce at a national level if we win power,"" said a Forza Italia lawmaker, who was not authorized to talk to the press and declined to be named.
In the event of a center-right victory, Berlusconi and Salvini have agreed that the party that takes more votes will decide who to put forward as prime minister. Salvini says he is the League's candidate for premier, while Berlusconi, who cannot return to high office because of a 2013 conviction for tax fraud, has yet to decide on a name.
Latest polls put Forza Italia roughly one percentage point ahead of the League. All surveys suggest the center-right bloc will not win enough seats to claim an overall majority, meaning they will need external allies to govern.
Salvini has ruled out any deals with the center-left but shown a willingness to work with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. Marking a major difference between the two parties, Berlusconi has said his main enemy is 5-Star and Maroni echoed his sentiments in a news conference on Monday.

""The equilibrium between the two main center-right allies will be solid up to the elections, but afterwards it could prove to be more fragile than it seems,"" Italy's top-selling broadsheet Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote on Tuesday.

The ad was widely criticized for being racist, including by Canadian pop star The Weeknd, who collaborated with H&M, the world's second-largest clothing group, on two collections in 2017. He said he would not do so again after seeing the advertisement.
""woke up this morning shocked and embarrassed by this photo. i’m deeply offended and will not be working with @hm anymore...,"" The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, said in a tweet late on Monday.
The word 'monkey' has long been used by some as a racial slur.

His family had left their home in the village of Kafr Batna on Monday for a market in a nearby village, seeking food for their malnourished children, but a mortar shell landed close to them, instantly killing the boy. 
""My child died hungry. We wanted to feed him. He was crying from hunger when we left the house,"" said the mother, Heba Amouri. Emir is the second child she has lost since the war began six years ago.
Eastern Ghouta is the last big stronghold of rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad near the capital Damascus and has been besieged for years. 
The United Nations estimates it is home to 400,000 civilians and says food and medical supplies have run low. The army and its allies - Russia and Iran-backed militias - bombard it daily. Rebels there shell government-held Damascus. 
After Emir's death, Amouri tried to quiet her surviving baby, a hungry two-month-old girl, by placing her finger in her mouth at the medical center. Malnutrition means she is unable to breastfeed, she said. 
On Saturday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was alarmed by the ongoing violence in eastern Ghouta and the growing number of civilian casualties and displacement since the start of the year. 
""Now I lost my second child. My baby daughter is the only surviving child,"" Mahmoud al-Bash, 27, Emir's father said. A year ago, the family lost another son to the bombardment. 
The United Nations children's agency UNICEF said in November that 11.9 percent of children under five in eastern Ghouta suffered acute malnourishment. 
Mothers of infants had reduced breastfeeding or stopped it altogether because of their own poor nutrition, it said.
On Monday evening, Emir's father carried Emir's tiny body wrapped in bright white cloth, marked with a big blood stain, to the village's cemetery. 
""May God protect the children, and everyone, and take the life of Bashar (al-Assad),"" he said, fixing his eyes on his child as he bid him a last farewell.

BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - Strong winds, high waves and toxic gases are hindering dozens of rescue boats struggling to locate missing sailors from a stricken oil tanker in the East China Sea and to extinguish a fire that has burned for the past three days on the ship.
The poor conditions, with rain and waves as high as 3 meters (10 feet), frustrated efforts to tame the fire and search for the 31 remaining tanker crew members, China's Ministry of Transport said in a statement on Tuesday.
The flames were forcing the South Korean Coast Guard's search and rescue team to stay as far as 3 miles (4.8 km) away from the tanker, two South Korean officials told Reuters.
The Chinese government said late on Tuesday it had not found a ""large-scale"" oil leak, and the ultra light oil, known as condensate, was burning off or evaporating so quickly it would leave little residue - less than 1 percent - within five hours of a spill. That reduces the chances of a crude-style oil slick.
Still, condensate is highly volatile when exposed to air and water and concerns were growing the tanker could explode and sink while a flotilla of 13 search and rescue vessels comb a 900-square-nautical-mile (3,100 sq km) area for the crew. 
The tanker Sanchi (IMO:9356608), run by Iran's top oil shipping operator, National Iranian Tanker Co, collided on Saturday with the CF Crystal (IMO:9497050), carrying grain from the United States, about 160 nautical miles (300 km) off China's coast near Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta.
The Sanchi was carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate to South Korea, equivalent to about 1 million barrels and worth about $60 million.
Chinese state media CCTV showed footage on Monday of boats dousing the flames with water as plumes of thick dark smoke continued to billow from the tanker. 
The size of the oil spill from the ship and the extent of the environmental harm were not known, but the disaster has the potential to be the worst since 1991 when 260,000 tonnes of oil leaked off the Angolan coast.
""We can't grasp the level of oil contamination at this moment. The cargo is still on fire, so it is hard to figure out if oil is being spilled,"" Park Sung-dong, an official from South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, told Reuters.
The body of a crew member was found on Monday in the water near the tanker, China's transport ministry said. It had been handed over to the civil affairs bureau.
The crew of the Sanchi are all Iranian nationals except for two Bangladeshi citizens. 
TANKER ON THE MOVE
Satellite imagery of the ship showed the blaze has weakened since the weekend, although the strong winds are dragging the tanker away from the Chinese coast, according to Greenpeace.
Between Sunday and Monday, the floating inferno traveled some 50 kilometers (31 miles) south east, according to Rashid Kang, campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia.
Another major concern is damage to the region's rich fish reserves. The Zhoushan fishing ground where the crash occurred is known as one of the biggest in the East China Sea, particularly for mackerel and croaker, according to Greenpeace.
FISHERMEN TO THE RESCUE
The CF Crystal suffered limited damage and the 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, were rescued by a passing fishing trawler on Saturday night, according to a report posted by state-owned Xinhua News to its Twitter account on Tuesday.
""The fire was so fierce. It kept exploding like bombs. So loud,"" said Zhu Tingwen, a sailor on the fishing boat.
The trawler from Zhejiang province scoured for survivors on the tanker, but could not get close enough because of the fire, Xinhua said.
""Anyone will go for a rescue in this case,"" said the fishing boat captain Zheng Lei. ""It just happened to be me.""
The freighter has been taken to a port near Shanghai where investigators will start work on assessing the cause of the disaster, the government said. 
China's transport ministry warned toxic gas from the tanker was harmful to the rescue workers and that protective clothing and gas testing equipment was being dispatched to the emergency teams. 
Trying to contain a spill of condensate, which is extremely low in density, highly toxic and much more explosive than normal crude oil, may be difficult.

""We're not going to see a slick like with crude, but it's soluble, toxic and flammable, which is why we're seeing the fire. A lot of it is burning off or evaporating,"" said Greenpeace's Kang.

111,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",British Brexit minister complains about EU's planning for no-deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit minister David Davis has complained in a letter to the prime minister that Brussels is damaging British interests by talking up the threat to companies if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal. 
The letter showed that Davis had sought legal advice over whether Brussels was breaching Britain's rights as a member state by advising companies of the risk to trading in the event of a ""no deal"". It was first published by the Financial Times and confirmed as genuine by the Brexit department.
""The EU has adopted a number of measures that put agreements or contracts at risk of being terminated in the event of a 'no deal' scenario and/or would require UK companies to relocate to another Member State,"" the letter said. 
An aide from the Department for Exiting the EU confirmed that the letter, dated December 2017, from Davis to Prime Minister Theresa May was genuine. 
""It's clear there have been a number of instances where the (European Commission), by treating the UK differently despite still being a member of the EU, have not acted in good faith,"" the aide said.
""It should be no surprise that if the commission attempt to stoke fears about worst-case scenarios we will correct them and reassure our firms.""
Examples given by Davis included EU agencies advising business that the UK would become a third country when it leaves the EU in March 2019 without referring to Britain's aim to agree a transition period and future trading deal first.
The advice, Davis said, also implied companies would need to be based in the EU or European Economic Area in order to maintain compliance with regulatory rules. 
Britain and the EU struck a divorce deal in December that paved the way for talks on the future trade ties which are likely to prove more difficult. 
May's government has said it is preparing for any outcome, including the chance that Britain could crash out of the bloc, and has set aside an extra 3 billion pounds ($4.1 billion)to prepare for the move. 
Europe's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has repeatedly warned that a no-deal scenario would have a damaging impact on people, companies and trade. 
British opposition politicians attacked Davis' stance. 
Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, who campaigned to stay in the EU, said the letter was extraordinary. 
""A government intent on leaving EU & continually talking about prospect of ‘no deal’ moaning about EU preparing to treat UK as a non member and for the possibility of ‘no deal’. Unbelievable - or rather, increasingly believable from this inept UK government,"" she said on Twitter.
Davis said in the letter that legal and policy advice suggested the chances of a successful legal challenge were slim. He said he had instructed his department to increase its engagement with the Commission - the EU's executive -- and companies to reassure them.

LONDON (Reuters) - The author of the satirical memoir ""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People"" became the latest figure to embarrass British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday, resigning from a watchdog for British universities over a history of misogynist tweets.
Toby Young quit his post on the board of the Office for Students, which is meant to help uphold standards in higher education, less than two days after May said he could keep it.
His resignation came amid a cabinet reshuffle meant to stamp May's authority on the government but derided in newspapers as a shambles, after one senior minister quit rather than take a new job and another talked May out of changing his role.
Young, whose memoir of a failed stint as a showbiz reporter was made into a 2008 movie, had reinvented himself as an education reform advocate, helping found a school in London run by parents under a program introduced by May's Conservatives.
But his appointment to the universities body was met by a barrage of criticism because of a history of sexist and inappropriate remarks in articles and on social media. A petition calling for his dismissal gathered more than 220,000 signatures.
In 2012, he criticized the ""ghastly"" need for schools to meet accessibility requirements for the disabled. He has also said women who ""display a lot of cleavage shouldn't then complain when men notice them"", described himself as a self-confessed pornography addict, and joked about being sexually aroused by images of hungry African children. 
He has apologized for such comments, which he said dated to a career as a ""journalistic provocateur"" and did not reflect his commitment to education.
""My appointment has become a distraction from (the Office for Students') vital work of broadening access to higher education and defending academic freedom,"" Young said in a statement on the website of the Spectator magazine.
Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of parliament's education committee, told BBC radio on Tuesday that Young's appointment had been a mistake. His appointment ""hadn't possibly been considered with due diligence and I thought it was the wrong decision"", Halfon said.
On Sunday, May said Young should be allowed to continue serving even though she condemned offensive comments he had made in the past. But the issue had damaged her attempts to rebrand her Conservative party as more inclusive during the ministerial reshuffle, which began on Monday and is aimed at promoting more women, black and younger lawmakers.
The reshuffle was triggered by the resignation of May's top ally in the cabinet, Damian Green, who was forced to quit after giving misleading statements about pornography on his laptop.
May, who lost her majority in parliament last year after calling a snap election that she expected to win in a landslide, has struggled to restore her authority over a party divided between supporters and opponents of a hard break with the EU.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian rebels under siege near Damascus have resorted to talks with the government's ally Russia, sometimes meeting in no-man's land, as they seek to hang on to their enclave.
The meetings on eastern Ghouta - the only major rebel bastion around the capital - underline Moscow's deepening role in trying to shape Syria's future after the conflict, which broke out in 2011.
The rebels have won almost nothing from the negotiations so far, but they say they have little choice.
They believe the Russians, whose air force all but won the war for the government, will have the final say on Syria's fate. 
The two main rebel forces in the suburbs signed ceasefires with Russia in the summer, but fighting has carried on. Both said they have been talking to Russian officials regularly for several months.
""It's better to negotiate with the one calling the shots, which is Russia, than with the regime,"" said Wael Olwan, spokesman for the Failaq al-Rahman insurgents. ""So the factions are forced to sit down with them. This is the reality.""
The Russian defense and foreign ministries did not respond to requests for comment on the talks. Moscow says the reconciliation center at its air base in Syria routinely holds peace talks with armed factions across the country. 
The Syrian government's minister for national reconciliation has said the state intends to get all militants out of eastern Ghouta and restore its full control. 
But the insurgents want their enemies to observe the truce, which they say includes lifting the siege, opening crossings, and letting dying patients out. It would also involve evacuating the few hundred fighters of al Qaeda's former Syria branch. 
Both factions accuse Moscow of not honoring the deals, or turning a blind eye to Syrian army violations.
Damascus and Moscow say they only target militants. 
""We send them documentation of how the aircraft drops missiles on residential areas,"" said Hamza Birqdar, a military spokesman for the Jaish al-Islam rebels. 
""Either there is silence ... or baseless excuses,"" he said. ""They say government authorities denied bombing. Then these planes flying over the Ghouta, who do they belong to?""

TRUCE PROCESS
The conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world's worst refugee crisis. Monitors and opposition activists blame Russian bombing for thousands of civilian deaths and much of the destruction - allegations Moscow denies.
After turning the war in favor of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia has seized the reins of international diplomacy in the past year. It has sought to build a political process outside of failed U.N. peace talks in Geneva. 
Other countries including the United States, meanwhile, have wound down support for the array of mostly Sunni rebels.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who first sent warplanes to help Assad in 2015, is pushing for a congress of national dialogue between Syria's many combatants.
With the map of Syria's conflict redrawn, Russia wants to convert military gains into a settlement that stabilizes the shattered nation and secures its interests in the region. 
To this end, Moscow has been negotiating behind the scenes with armed factions across Syria.
""We communicate exclusively with them,"" said Birqdar. ""Because in reality, when it comes to Assad and his government, they have become toys in the hands of the Russians. They make no decisions ... except under Russian orders."" 
With official and secret talks, Russia has built ties to local groups partly to gain influence on the ground, said Yury Barmin, an expert with the Russian International Affairs Council, a think-tank close to the foreign ministry. 
""There's one goal. Their inclusion in the truce process,"" he said. ""All this is done with the aim of populating these Russian processes, ones led by Russia, with such opposition groups."" 
NO MAN'S LAND
Since 2013, Syrian government forces and their allies have blockaded eastern Ghouta, a densely populated pocket of satellite towns and farms. 
The military has suppressed opposition enclaves across western Syria, with the help of Russian air power and Iran-backed Shi'ite militias. Nearly seven years into the war, Assad has repeatedly vowed to take back every inch of Syria. 
The Ghouta remains the only big rebel enclave near the heavily fortified capital. 
""Our communications with the Russian side are through (their) official in Damascus in charge of this file, by phone and in meetings,"" said Yasser Delwan, a local Jaish al-Islam political official. 
They meet Russian forces in no-man's land, the abandoned farmland between rebel and government territory, at the edge of the nearby Wafideen camp.
""We talk about the deal we signed ... implementing it from paper into something practical,"" he said. 
Both rebel forces said Russia instigated the talks. They said Russian officials sometimes blame Iran-backed forces for breaking the truce or use jihadists as a pretext for attacks against the Ghouta.
Failaq al-Rahman only negotiates with Russian officials outside Syria, said Olwan, their spokesman.
""In reality, Russia has never been honest in its support of the political track,"" he said. ""But with the failure of the international community ... the factions were forced to negotiate with the enemy.""
DE-ESCALATION DEALS 
Eastern Ghouta falls under ceasefire plans for rebel territory that Russia has brokered across Syria in the past year, with help from Turkey and Iran. 
When the insurgents signed the ""de-escalation"" deal with Russia last summer, residents and aid workers hoped food would flow into the suburbs, home to around 400,000 people. But they say it has brought no relief. [nL8N1OQ1ZD] 
Despite lulls in air strikes, the siege got harsher. In some frontline districts, fierce battles rage on. Food, fuel, and medicine have dwindled, especially after the shutdown of smuggling tunnels. 
A Syrian official in Damascus said the army has only retaliated to militants in the suburbs shelling districts of the capital. ""As for the Russian allies, every action takes place on Syrian land in full and total coordination with the Syrian government,"" the official said. ""They have a big role."" 
The Ghouta's rebel factions, which have long been at odds, say they have no direct contacts with Assad's government.
""In its communications, Russia has always tried to present itself as the solution,"" Olwan said. ""We don't see them as mediators. We see them as the final commander in the regime's ranks.""

The Damascus government mostly does not play a role in the talks, said Barmin, the Russia analyst. ""Damascus is presented with a fait accompli and must either accept it or not.""

Turkey has been fiercely opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during his country's six-year-old civil war but has recently been working with his allies Russia and Iran for a political resolution to the conflict.
The three countries agreed last year to establish a ""de-escalation zone"" in the opposition-held Idlib province and surrounding region, which borders Turkey, but Syrian forces have since launched an offensive in the area. 
""Regime forces are hitting the moderate opposition with the excuse that they are fighting Nusra (Islamist militants). This attitude scuppers the political solution process,"" state-run Anadolu news agency quoted Cavusoglu as telling reporters. 
""The groups who will come together in Sochi should not do this,"" he said, referring to the Russian city where a Syrian congress of national dialogue is set to be held at the end of this month.
The main rebel force in the northwestern province of Idlib is Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria that was known as Nusra Front. 
A Turkish security source said Ankara was watching developments in northern Syria closely but added that the areas that the Syrian army had recaptured lay ""mostly outside the de-escalation zones"". 
Turkey says it has deployed troops to observation points in northern Idlib province, about 60 km (40 miles) north of the Syrian army offensive.
While Ankara has toned down its criticism of Assad since it started cooperating with Russia, President Tayyip Erdogan last month called Assad a terrorist and said it was impossible for Syrian peace efforts to continue with him.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African tribal leader has agreed to a more transparent structure for a 175 million rand ($14 million) community trust funded by  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Platinum (Amplats), a move that aims to curb unrest around the firm's most profitable mine.
The changes relate to the Mapela Trust, which was set up to fund development projects in communities around Amplats' Mogalakwena operation, the world's largest open-pit platinum mine and the Anglo American unit's main cash spinner.
The structure of the fund has proved a flashpoint, with local communities saying the way cash was spent has not transparent and too much authority was given to the local chief, known as Kgoshi, to determine where money was invested.
Protests over two years ago temporarily closed the mine and community leaders had threatened more action to demand changes.
Lawyers representing local communities told Reuters a deal between Amplats and the tribal chief had been reached. ""There is a significant dilution of the chief's power across the board,"" Johan Lorenzen, one of the lawyers, said.
Amplats confirmed this. ""We have signed the agreement. The issues have been resolved,"" spokeswoman Mpumi Sithole said.
Under the new structure, four of the Mapela Trust's nine trustees will be elected directly by local communities instead of just two that were picked by the chief to represent them.
The other trustees include an independent chairperson, the Kgoshi, a member of a traditional council, a member elected by village chiefs and a senior Amplats representative.
Amplats' Sithole said the community would elect their representatives before any cash was allocated to local projects.
Protests over the fund that erupted more than two years ago prompted the temporary closure of the Mogalakwena mine, leading to the loss of 8,600 ounces of its annual 200,000-plus ounces of production.
Local communities had hired prominent South African human rights lawyer Richard Spoor to spearhead their case.
Other South African mining companies have also been cutting deals with tribal leaders who have royal titles and feudal-style control over their former homelands, often islands of rural poverty where most blacks were confined under apartheid.
The bulk of the platinum reserves in South Africa, the world's top producer of the precious metal, lie in or near these tribal areas.
Impala Platinum and Lonmin have also had operations disrupted by community protests linked to deals with tribal chiefs.
Social and labor violence, alongside soaring costs and depressed world platinum prices, have made two-thirds of South Africa's platinum operations unprofitable at current prices, according to the country's Chamber of Mines.

Grace, whose efforts to take over the leadership of the ruling ZANU-PF party prompted a de facto military coup against her husband, then-president Robert Mugabe, in November, graduated in 2014, just months after she had registered to study at the University of Zimbabwe.
Up to now, her dissertation for the doctorate has not been published and is not available in the university library, as such academic qualifications usually are.
""We indeed received a report from the sociology department at the university on how Grace Mugabe received her doctorate and that is what we are investigating,"" said Goodson Nguni, the head of investigations at the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission.
Local media reports say the sociology department told the commission that Grace's doctorate was ""suspicious"" and needed to be investigated.
Grace, who was called ""Dr Amai"" - or ""learned mother of the nation"" - by adulating followers, has previously defended her academic record and last September told a ZANU-PF rally that she had earned her doctorate even though her detractors thought otherwise.
Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was on the receiving end of vicious attacks by Grace last year, succeeded 93-year-old Mugabe as president in November.

Grace has not appeared in public since Nov. 15, when army tanks rolled into the capital and confined Mugabe and his family at his luxurious mansion in Harare.

Police in West Java province said three boys, as young as seven, who figured in the videos are now in the care of social workers.
At least seven people have been arrested, including the mothers of two of the boys, on suspicion of violating child protection and pornography laws and could face up to 15 years in prison. 
""Results of the preliminary investigation show that the director sold the videos to someone in Russia and Canada,"" said regional police spokesman Yusri Yunus, adding that the motive of those involved was to make money. 
""We are still investigating and coordinating with the national cyber crime unit.""
The director received 31 million rupiah ($2,307) to make the videos, media have said.
Indonesia has been vulnerable to child pornography and sexual abuse of minors because of poverty and lax enforcement of laws in the past.
Authorities stopped 92 convicted Australian pedophiles from entering the country last year, based on immigration data.
In a case that shocked Southeast Asia, a British court handed Richard Huckle 22 life sentences in 2016 for abusing up to 200 babies and children, mostly in Malaysia, and sharing images of his crimes on the dark web.
UNICEF says the Philippines is the number one global source of child pornography.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, known for his temperamental outbursts, has adopted a unique tactic to avoid tricky questions from reporters -- leave a cardboard cutout of himself for reporters to quiz.
But the gesture has been criticized by Human Rights Watch which said it shows the military junta chief's ""contempt of media criticism"" in a country yet to restore democracy since a 2014 coup.
Seventeen life-sized cutouts of Prayuth have been set up around the government compound ahead of Children's Day on Saturday. They show Prayuth in various outfits including sportswear, work suits and traditional Thai attire.
On Monday, Prayuth spoke briefly at Government House before a cutout of Prayuth in a suit and tie was brought out. Prayuth, who is known for his abstruse sense of humor, then told journalists to refer any questions to the cardboard cutout.
""Ask this guy,"" he said.
Reaction to the bizarre gesture was largely muted on social media on Tuesday but Human Rights Watch said it added to a ""long list of his bizarre and bullying reactions to reporters"".
""Thailand's junta leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha continues to show contempt of media criticism and scrutiny,"" Sunai Phasuk, senior Thailand researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.
The general is known for going off-script and for his public outbursts which are sometimes dismissed as mildly amusing even by his staunchest critics. His comments have also been menacing. 
In 2015 he warned journalists that he had the power to execute them. In another, separate incident he threw a banana peel at a reporter.
Prayuth's government has announced it will hold a general election in November 2018 after repeatedly delaying the vote. 
However, it has yet to lift a ban on political campaigning despite pressure from groups of all political stripes.
""Even when the junta promises to hold an election, there is no open space for media freedom,"" said Sunai.
Children's Day is celebrated annually in Thailand on the second Saturday of January. On the day, armed forces open up military barracks to children to let them pose with weapons and tanks. Children are also invited to sit at the prime minister's work desk inside Government House.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan said on Tuesday it can ""by no means"" accept South Korea's call for more steps to help ""comfort women"", a euphemism for girls and women forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels, a divisive issue that Japan says was resolved with a 2015 deal.
Japan and South Korea share a bitter history that includes Japan's 1910-45 colonization but the U.S. allies are central to efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
A South Korean investigation appointed by the government concluded last month the dispute over the women could not be ""fundamentally resolved"" because the victims' demand for legal compensation had not been met.
Japan responded by saying any attempt by South Korea to revise the 2015 deal, struck by a conservative South Korean government, would make relations ""unmanageable"".
South Korea would not seek to renegotiate the 2015 agreement, even though it failed to meet victims' needs and resolve the feud, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said on Tuesday.
But she added that she hoped Japan would make further efforts to help the women ""regain honor and dignity and heal wounds in their hearts"".
Japan rejected any suggestion it take steps to augment the 2015 deal, under which Japan apologized to the victims and provided 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) to a fund to support them. 
""We can by no means accept South Korea's demands for additional measures,"" Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono told reporters in Tokyo.
Kono said the 2015 settlement was a ""final and irreversible resolution"".
""At a time when we are confronting the threat from North Korea, the Japan-South Korean agreement is an indispensable base for Japan-South Korean cooperation in various fields and the creation of a future-oriented relationship,"" Kono said.
South Korea's Kang did not elaborate on what additional steps South Korea was seeking but a senior foreign ministry official told Reuters it wanted a ""voluntary, sincere apology rather than money"".
South Korean activists estimate there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean women forced to work in the brothels.
There are 31 surviving women registered with the government, a foreign ministry official said.
In 2015, when there were 47, 36 accepted the settlement, a the official said. But others rejected it, and some have been protesting regularly in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. 
Those opposed to the 2015 deal want Japan to take legal responsibility and provide due compensation.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in won an election last year after promises on the campaign trail to renegotiate the deal.
But he has also vowed to ""normalize"" ties with Japan.
The comfort women issue has been a regular cause for contention between Japan and neighbors China and North and South Korea since the war. 
Japan colonized the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 and occupied parts of China before and after the war.
Japan says the matter of compensation for the women was settled under a 1965 treaty. It says that in 2015, it agreed to provide the funds to help them heal ""psychological wounds"".

MANILA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of devotees in the Philippines, many of them barefooted, joined a chaotic procession on Tuesday that featured a black statue of Jesus Christ, one of the biggest annual festivals in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation.
The faithful gathered in downtown Manila to follow a carriage bearing the statue called the Black Nazarene, believed to have healing powers, in a parade that began at dawn and may last until evening or even longer.
Some of them jostled and climbed onto the carriage as it was pushed and pulled by dozens of men holding ropes, while the crowd waved towels and handkerchiefs in a sign of praise to the kneeling life-sized image that carried a cross on one shoulder. 
Processions and other religious rites were also held elsewhere in the country of 105 million people to celebrate the feast.
Citing police estimates, media said this year's festivities may draw 17 million devotees nationwide, some seeking healing for illnesses and forgiveness for sins and others offering thanks for blessings.
Rogelio Lim said all his wishes had come true since he became a Black Nazarene devotee in 1977.
""My child is now a medicine graduate,"" he told Reuters. ""I have been spared diseases. I have been blessed with a house. Everything we wished for. A good job. Everything. This is why I am here, to thank Him.""
The Philippine Red Cross said it had assisted more than 700 devotees who were feeling unwell, or suffered injuries amid the parade's growing crowds, many of whom clamored to reach toward the icon.
Alvin Carlos said he felt stronger after touching the Black Nazarene.
""Rain or shine, I gained the strength to continue because of my strong faith in Him,"" he said.

More than 4,000 police and soldiers were deployed to ensure the Manila procession would be peaceful, said Oscar Albayalde, the capital's police chief.

The League's leader, Matteo Salvini, has given mixed signals about the euro - which many Italians blame for the moribund state of their economy. He ridiculed the idea of a referendum proposed by the rival 5-Star movement, but as late as last week pledged to rectify the ""error"" of the single currency.
Berlusconi - who hopes to lead the center-right back to power in March - said the common currency should be continued to be handled in the manner that European Central Bank head Mario Draghi has done.
""Salvini is no longer of the idea that we should leave the euro,"" Berlusconi said. ""He has understood that it would be unsustainable for our economy.""
Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia party, the Northern League and a second far-right party, Brothers of Italy, look set to win the March 4 election but with less than an absolute majority.
Hostility to the euro is a prominent issue in campaigning for the election and the prospect that anti-establishment parties could try to pull the country out of the single currency has rattled financial markets.

Berlusconi and others say the euro was introduced to Italy with too high of an exchange rate to the old Italian lira.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The last North Korean to cross this heavily militarized border was shot by his own comrades, and barely escaped with his life.
But when a hefty man proudly sporting lapel pins with the beaming faces of late North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il led a delegation of about 20 North Korean officials over the tense border dividing the two Koreas on Tuesday, they did so to praise from both countries.
The visit - part of the first official talks between the two Koreas in two years - was in stark contrast to the past year of spiraling tensions, punctuated by the dramatic defection of a North Korean soldier in November. It was just meters away from where the diplomatic delegations sipped cups of red ginseng tea on Tuesday.
(For an interactive graphic on inter-Korean talks click http://tmsnrt.rs/2t8i6no) 
Arriving in only Western-style business suits despite sub-zero weather and snow piled on the ground, the head of the North Korean delegation referenced the increased tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.
""This winter has seen more snowstorms than ever, and rivers and mountains across the country are frozen,"" said Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland.
""It would not be an exaggeration to say that inter-Korean ties were even more frozen, but public yearning for improved relations was so strong that today’s precious event was brought about,"" he quipped.
""We came to this meeting with the thought of giving our brethren, who have high hopes for this dialogue, invaluable results as the first present of the year,"" he continued in opening remarks, as his officials opened brown paper folders.
Despite scepticism from allies in the United States and Japan, officials in South Korea hope the talks lead to more than just friendly photo ops, including substantive improvements in relations between Seoul and Pyongyang.
Just before Seoul's delegation drove into the demilitarized zone, some 20 South Koreans were seen holding up a banner that read: ""We wish the success of the high-ranking inter-Korean talks"". One man was spotted waving a flag with a unified Korean peninsula.
MARCHING TOGETHER, LUNCHING SEPARATELY
The rare meeting come after a year of ramped up North Korean missile launches, its sixth and most powerful nuclear test and an exchange of threats and insults between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, which raised fears of a fresh conflict on the Korean peninsula.
""There is so much focus on our high-ranking talks today, and considering the high hopes, we were thinking about opening up these talks to the general public,"" Ri suggested. ""I see many reporters here, how would you feel if we just opened this up?""
Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said it would be better to stick to practice and brief reporters as often as possible. 
Cameras and microphones installed in the meeting rooms usually enable government officials to monitor the meetings in real time.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in is being kept up to date on all developments as they occur, according to a Blue House spokesman, but he declined to confirm if Moon is monitoring the talks in real-time. ""It's impossible for Moon to be glued to a screen all day anyway. He's got his own schedule.""
The officials from the two Koreas sat before bottles of 'Pyeongchang Water' and red ginseng tea, provided by a subsidiary of Lotte Group, a massive South Korean conglomerate that suffered major setbacks in China after it handed over land for a controversial anti-missile system in South Korea.
After two meetings in the morning, Ri and his team returned over the border to lunch at Tongilgak, the North's building in the truce village of Panmunjom.
The two Koreas usually do not eat together during inter-Korean talks as these breaks are used as opportunities for officials to go over what was discussed and also consult with other government authorities in Seoul and Pyongyang, respectively.
North Korea pledged to send a delegation of high-ranking officials, athletes and a cheering squad to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea next month, South Korea's vice unification minister Chun Hae-sung said.
Seoul also proposed a number of other measures designed to reduce tensions between the two countries. But Chun cautioned that Tuesday's meeting would only be the beginning.

""Starting is half the trip, but we can't expect to be full with just the first spoonful,"" he said.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 03:21AM ET</span>",Philippines to protest to China over apparent airbase on manmade island,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines will make a diplomatic protest to China, which the southeast Asian nation's defense minister described as having reneged on a promise not to militarize artificial islands in the busy South China Sea waterway.
The United States has criticized China's build-up of military facilities on the artificial islands and is concerned they could be used to restrict free movement along the key trade route.
Philippine Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana's comment followed a Dec. 30 broadcast of aerial footage by the official China Central Television (CCTV) showing Fiery Cross Reef, which appeared to have been transformed into an airbase.
""The Chinese government said some time ago that they were not going to militarize those reclaimed islands,"" Lorenzana told reporters, adding that the protest would be made through the foreign ministry. 
""If it is true and we can prove that they have been putting soldiers and even weapons systems, that will be a violation of what they said.""
Asked about the protest, China's foreign ministry spokesman said the construction was on the country's territory and was intended to aid peace in the region, as well as maritime safety and disaster prevention.
""Of course, China also needs to construct necessary defense equipment for its territory,"" the spokesman, Lu Kang, told a regular briefing on Tuesday. ""The relevant equipment is not directed at any particular country."" 
China and the Philippines have long sparred over the South China Sea, but relations have improved considerably under President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been courting Beijing in hopes of winning business and investment. 
China has assured the Philippines it will not occupy new features or territory in the South China Sea, under a new ""status quo"" brokered by Manila as both sides try to strengthen their relations.
Reports about China militarizing reclaimed islands were not new, presidential spokesman Harry Roque told a regular news briefing. 
""We have always been against the militarization of the area,"" he added. ""It is certainly not OK, because it constitutes a further threat to peace and security in area.""
China is holding to a commitment not to reclaim more islands, Roque added, however.
""There is still no breach of the good faith obligation for as long as China has not embarked on new reclamation,"" he said, when asked about the situation on the reef.
China has denied U.S. charges that it is militarizing the South China Sea, which also is claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
The reef has a hospital with more than 50 doctors, high-speed mobile connections and an airport with a runway of 3,160 meters (3,456 yards) to serve what Beijing calls a ""weather station"" equipped with radar, Chinese state media say. 

In the last 27 years, China's navy has sent more than 1,000 soldiers to guard the reef, state media have said.

Israel then fired ground-to-ground rockets from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, but the Syrian defenses brought the missiles down, the Syrian army said.

The bill, passed by a 58-to-57 vote, affords Israel's interior minister the right to cancel municipal by-laws that local councils may wish to enact to allow the opening of shops and restaurants in their areas during the Sabbath.
Most, but not all, Jewish-run shops and supermarkets have traditionally remained closed in Israel during the Sabbath, which runs from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday. The number of open establishments varies according to the religious nature of the area.
The legislation, promoted by Interior Minister Aryeh Deri of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, would affect new establishments wishing to open their doors during the Sabbath, but current norms would not be influenced. 
Shas and another ultra-Orthodox party have angered Israel's secular Jewish majority by trying to limit Saturday trading and threatened to leave Netanyahu's coalition, which could have caused it to collapse had the legislation failed.
The successful vote was the latest of several motions brought by right-wing coalition members who feel able to pressure Netanyahu's brittle government, which has a slim parliamentary majority, to enact hard-line legislation.
Netanyahu told his Likud faction in parliament on Monday that any vote against the legislation would be a vote of no-confidence in the government. The Israeli leader is also beset by two corruption investigations, in which he denies wrongdoing.
At least one member of his own Likud party refused to vote for the motion and was threatened with expulsion. Members of other coalition factions also refused to vote for it.

Defence Minister Avigdor Liberman, leader of the ultra-nationalist and secularist Yisrael Beitenu faction, said his party would not back the motion and he called the bill ""absurd"".

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Eleven men were charged in a Singapore court on Tuesday over their part in an alleged oil theft at Shell's biggest refinery, court documents showed.
Police in the island-state, Asia's main oil trading hub, said earlier on Tuesday they had detained 17 men and seized millions of dollars in cash and a small tanker during their investigations into a theft at the Pulau Bukom industrial site. 
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, which first reported the theft to authorities in August, said in a news release that the arrests included ""a limited number of Shell employees"" and that it anticipated ""a short delay in the supply operations at Bukom."" 
Nine Singaporeans were charged over the theft and two Vietnamese nationals were charged with receiving stolen goods, transferred from Pulau Bukom to a small oil tanker named Prime South (IMO: 9452804), charge sheets showed.
Shipping data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed the Prime South was shipping fuel between Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and Singapore for the past 30 days. 
Those arrested by police during raids on Sunday, all men, ranged in age from 30 to 63. Police said the six who had not been charged were still under investigation.
The court documents seen so far allege three incidents of gasoil theft: on Nov. 21, 2017, of more than 2,322 tonnes valued at S$1.277 million; and on Jan. 5 and 7 this year of a combined 2,062 tonnes of gasoil valued at S$1.126 million.
Both Vietnamese nationals were charged with receiving gasoil on Jan. 7, at wharf 5 on Bukom island, the documents show.
Police said they also seized S$3.05 million ($2.29 million) in cash and the 12,000-deadweight-tonne tanker.
They have also frozen the suspects' bank accounts, the police said.
Bukom is the largest wholly owned Shell refinery in the world in terms of crude distillation capacity, according to the company's website.
Shell declined to say how much oil had been stolen. The charge sheets specified gasoil as the stolen commodity and listed varying amounts for each man charged. 
Shipping and oil refining have contributed significantly to Singapore's rising wealth during the past decades.
The Southeast Asian city-state is one of the world's most important oil trading hubs, with most of the Middle East's crude oil passing through Singapore before being delivered to the huge consumers in China, Japan and South Korea.
Singapore is also Southeast Asia's main refinery hub and the world's biggest marine refueling station.
Shell is one of the biggest and longest established foreign investors in Singapore. Its oil refinery on Bukom island, situated 5.5 km to the southwest of Singapore, is the company's biggest such facility in the world, with a processing capacity of 500,000 barrels per day.
Southeast Asia is a hotspot of illegal oil trading. In some cases, oil has been illegally siphoned from storage tanks, but there have also been thefts at sea.
The Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) says that siphoning of fuel and oil at sea in Asia, including through armed robbery and piracy, saw sharp increases between 2011 and 2015.
There has been a modest decline since then, although the organisation said in a quarterly report that oil theft was still “of concern,” especially in the South China Sea, off the east coast of Malaysia.
The stolen fuel is generally sold across Southeast Asia, offloaded directly into trucks or tanks at small harbors away from oil terminals.

China is the world's largest importer and end user of elephant tusks. Wildlife activists called the ban, implemented at the end of 2017, a vital step toward reducing the slaughter of the endangered animals.
Hong Kong trader Lau Sai Yuan was fined HK$8,000 for illegal ivory possession after pleading guilty in Hong Kong's Eastern Magistrates' Court. Another trader, Huen Kwok Leung, pleaded not guilty and his trial was postponed to April.
The maximum penalty under current laws is two years in jail. 
Hong Kong lawmakers are considering a significant increase in penalties, with a fine of up to HK$10 million and imprisonment of 10 years.
Hong Kong, a Chinese special administrative region of China, has lagged behind mainland China in the crackdown on illegal ivory trading and only set a timetable for a ban last year, with a phase-out time of five years.
The former British colony is a prime transit and consumption hub with more than 90 percent of consumers from mainland China. It has the largest retail market for ivory, which it has traded for more than 150 years.
Hong Kong adheres to regulations set by The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which started to regulate the international trade of ivory in the 1970s and has banned such trade since 1990.
Only ""pre-Convention ivory"" is allowed to be traded when the ivory is accompanied by a pre-convention certificate.
A Hong Kong government-led operation to combat illegal ivory trading in June 2017 found two ivory traders had sold ivory chopsticks with ivory obtained after the 1990 ban. 
Those two traders were fined HK$6,000 and HK$8,000.
China has made a big push to eradicate ivory sales and demand has fallen since early 2014 because of a crackdown on corruption and slower economic growth.
Trade in pre-convention ivory had been thriving in China and Hong Kong since 1975. Environmental activists have long asserted that it has led to an increase in laundering ivory and remains a prime obstacle in eradicating the illegal poaching trade.
WildAid, a wildlife non-government organization, estimates up to 30,000 elephants are killed illegally every year.

His comments come after two photographs purporting to be of Yingluck were widely shared on social media.
One shows Yingluck posing with a woman wearing a red coat accompanied by a caption saying that the picture was taken outside London's Harrods department store. The other is allegedly of Yingluck at London's Westfield shopping mall.
Thai police said they have verified the photograph of Yingluck with a woman in a red coat and have confirmed Yingluck's identity. They have yet to confirm the identity of the woman in the photograph allegedly taken at Westfield.
Reuters has not independently verified either photo.
Yingluck was sentenced in September in absentia to five years in prison for mismanaging the rice scheme.
She has not commented publicly since fleeing Thailand in August ahead of a verdict in a criminal negligence case against her and her location has been the source of intense speculation.
Yingluck and her brother, ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, have been at the center of a power struggle that has dominated Thai politics for more than a decade. The crisis broadly pits the country's traditional elite, including the military, against the Shinawatra family and its supporters.
Thailand's Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai told reporters in Bangkok on Tuesday that Yingluck was in London and that Thai authorities were in touch with their British counterparts to try to locate her.
""We knew about this since September. Britain's foreign minister told us Yingluck was in London, England,"" Don told reporters. ""We have communicated consistently but we haven't found her.""
He declined to comment specifically on whether Thailand would seek Yingluck's extradition. Thailand and the United Kingdom have an extradition treaty.

""It was just magical,"" Diana Ribeiro told Special Broadcasting Service television, after her minute-past-midnight marriage in Melbourne to her wife Deanne Ribeiro was solemnized before about 60 cheering guests.
""For me Deanne's always been my wife, always been the love of my life and today's not going to change that, it's just about equality really, and being able to finally be legal in Australia,"" she said.
Australian's parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage in December after a nationwide postal survey returned an overwhelming majority in favor of the unions.
The survey result prompted relief, then celebration among campaigners who had for decades pushed for change, and later cheers and singing on the floor of parliament when the law passed. Some Australian states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago.
Because a month's notice is required for the state to recognize a marriage, the Rieberos' wedding and several other same-sex marriages reported in the local press were among the first to be recognized under the new laws.
Several same-sex couples already wed in December after the notice period was waived for reasons such as one member of the couple falling gravely ill, or to allow a legal wedding to go ahead when a non-binding ceremony was already planned.
Religious organizations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition to same-sex marriage and pressed unsuccessfully for broad protections for religious objectors, which would have allowed florists and bankers to refuse service to same-sex couples if the unions were legalized.

The emergency landing, coming just days after a similar mishap, was the latest in a series of incidents involving U.S. military aircraft in Okinawa that have further fueled public opposition to the U.S. presence there.
Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera told a news conference that in a morning telephone call with U.S. counterpart James Mattis he had called on the United States to prevent any recurrences.
""We are asking the United States to take thorough measures,"" he said, adding that he intended to repeat the message when he meets U.S. Pacific Commander Harry Harris later this week.
Japanese media reported that Mattis had apologized for the latest incident, but Onodera made no reference to this, although he said he felt Mattis is ""thoroughly aware"" of the issue.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga echoed Onodera's concerns, telling a news conference that while U.S.-Japanese deterrence was important in an increasingly fraught regional security situation, the understanding and cooperation of Japanese locals was essential for the U.S. military to carry out its duties well.
""These accidents, which create fear on the part of local residents, must not happen,"" he added. 
Resentment has simmered among residents of the southern Japanese island who bemoan what they see as an unfair burden in supporting the U.S. military presence in Japan.
Among recent incidents, a USMC transport helicopter made an emergency landing on an Okinawan beach on Saturday because of a faulty rotor. Earlier, a window fell from a military aircraft onto a school playground.
Located strategically at the edge of the East China Sea, Okinawa, which was under U.S. occupation until 1972, hosts some 30,000 military personnel living and working on bases that cover a fifth of the island.

The Reuters journalists, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained on Dec. 12. They are being investigated on suspicion of breaching the Official Secrets Act, a little-used law that dates from the days of British colonial rule.
They had worked on coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where a military crackdown that followed militant attacks on security forces in August led to an exodus of more than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to refugee camps in Bangladesh. 
The two are due to appear in court on Wednesday. It will be their second appearance in court and the prosecutor could request that charges are filed against them.
""This situation amounts to a serious intimidation against journalists in general and from Reuters in particular,"" said Kristian Schmidt, representative in Yangon of the EU's 28 states, said in the letter dated Jan. 8.
""Journalists should ... be able to work in a free and enabling environment without fear of intimidation or undue arrest or prosecution,"" he said. 
""We therefore call on your government to provide the necessary legal protection for these two journalists, to ensure the full respect of their fundamental rights and to release them immediately.""
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were detained after they were invited to meet police for dinner in Yangon. 
The Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying they were ""arrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces"". It said they had ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"".
Government officials from some of the world's major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for their release.
Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of the two.
""As they near their hearing date, it remains entirely clear that they are innocent of any wrongdoing,"" Adler said in a statement on Monday.
Authorities have blocked access to media seeking to cover the military crackdown in the north of Rakhine State. The United Nations has condemned the military campaign there as ethnic cleansing, a charge Buddhist-majority Myanmar has rejected.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 08:52PM ET</span>",Mexico governor says federal funding withheld in graft probe dispute,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A Mexican state governor on Monday accused the finance ministry of withholding federal funds to punish his administration for launching an investigation into alleged corruption that has embarrassed the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
Chihuahua Governor Javier Corral, of the center-right opposition National Action Party (PAN), said the ministry was pressuring the northern border state because of its probe into the administration of his PRI predecessor Cesar Duarte.
Corral said that after he announced last month the arrest by state and federal authorities of Alejandro Gutierrez, a former top PRI finance official, the ministry failed to transfer to the state more than 700 million pesos ($36.5 million) it was due.
""This is an attempt to strangle the government of Chihuahua economically,"" Corral told a news conference in Mexico City.
The finance ministry said it had met all the required payments, and that Chihuahua had received more funds in 2017 than originally budgeted due to higher federal revenue.
Deputy finance minister Miguel Messmacher rejected the suggestion the ministry was seeking to punish Chihuahua and told Mexican radio that the Chihuahua state government had asked for additional ""extraordinary"" funds at the end of last year.
Such funds are conditional on the federal government's budgetary room for maneuver and were ultimately not paid to Chihuahua, or to a number of other states, Messmacher said.
""But they're not funds they have a right to,"" he said.
The dispute risks keeping attention focused on alleged PRI graft in the run-up to a presidential election in July. Tackling corruption promises to be a key campaign issue, and the PRI faces an uphill struggle to hold on to power.
After noticing the holdup in federal transfers, Corral said, he and aides held a meeting with top ministry officials in Mexico City on the evening of Jan. 4 to discuss the impasse.
There, Corral added, the Chihuahua delegation was told that his state's investigation into alleged corruption had called ""into question the mechanism of how funds are transferred,"" for which reason the ministry decided to withhold the money.
Prosecutors in Chihuahua accuse Gutierrez of participating in a scheme to divert public funds worth 250 million pesos into PRI coffers during the 2016 election season, in which Cesar Duarte's successor was chosen. Gutierrez has denied the charge.
A Mexican judge issued an arrest warrant for Duarte last March. Corral says his predecessor is in the United States.

TUNIS (Reuters) - One person was killed on Monday during clashes between security forces and protesters in a Tunisian town, a security official and residents said, as demonstrations over rising prices and tax increases spread in the North African country.
A man was killed during a demonstration against government austerity measures in Tebourba, 40 km (25 miles) west of Tunis, the security official said, without giving details.
The protest had turned violent when security forces tried stopping some youths from burning down a government building, witnesses said. Five people were wounded and taken to a hospital, state news agency TAP said. 
Tunisia, widely seen in the West as the only democratic success among nations where ""Arab Spring"" revolts took place in 2011, is suffering increasing economic hardship.
Anger has been building up since the government said that from Jan. 1, it would increase the price of gasoil, some goods and taxes on cars, phone calls, the internet, hotel accommodation and other items, part of austerity measures agreed with its foreign lenders. 
The 2018 budget also raises customs taxes on some products imported from abroad, such as cosmetics, and some agricultural products.
The economy has been in crisis since a 2011 uprising unseated the government and two major militant attacks in 2015 damaged tourism, which comprises 8 percent of GDP. Tunisia is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to speed up policy changes and help the economy recover from the attacks.
Violent protests spread in the evening to at least 10 towns with police and crowds clashing in Fernaneh, Bouhajla, Ouslatia, Moulouche, Sabitla, Gtar and Kef.
There was also a protest turning violent in Ettadamen district in the capital, residents said. Security forces had already dispersed small protests in Tunis late on Sunday.
On Monday, about 300 people also took to the streets in the central Tunisian town of Sidi Bouzid, cradle of the country's Arab Spring revolution, carrying banners aloft with slogans denouncing high prices.
A lack of tourists and new foreign investors pushed the trade deficit up by 23.5 percent year-on-year in the first 11 months of 2017 to a record high $5.8 billion, official data showed at the end of December.
Concerns about the rising deficit have hurt the dinar, sending it to 3.011 versus the euro on Monday, breaking the psychologically important 3 dinar mark for the first time, traders said.
The currency is likely to weaken further, said Tunisian financial risk expert Mourad Hattab.
""The sharp decline of the dinar threatens to deepen the trade deficit and make debt service payments tighter, which will increase Tunisia's financial difficulties,"" he said.
Hattab said the dinar may fall to 3.3 versus the euro in the coming months because of high demand for foreign currency and little expectation of intervention from the authorities.
Last year, former Finance Minister Lamia Zribi said the central bank would reduce its interventions so that the dinar steadily declined in value, but it would prevent any dramatic slide.
The central bank has denied any plans to liberalise the currency but Hattab said Monday's decline showed there was an ""undeclared float"" of the dinar.
A weaker currency could further drive up the cost of imported food after the annual inflation rate rose to 6.4 percent in December, its highest rate since July 2014, from 6.3 percent in November, data showed on Monday.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 05:56PM ET</span>","U.S. moves toward expelling 200,000 Salvadorans","By Yeganeh Torbati
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some 200,000 Salvadoran immigrants allowed to live and work in the United States since 2001 will lose their right to remain in the country in 2019, officials said on Monday, marking the Trump administration's latest move to tighten immigration enforcement. 
The United States will end the Salvadorans' temporary protected status (TPS) on Sept. 9, 2019, giving them 18 months to leave or seek lawful residency, and for El Salvador to prepare for their return, administration officials said. The status was granted in the wake of two devastating 2001 earthquakes in El Salvador that left hundreds of thousands in the country homeless.
The decision to end TPS for Salvadorans is part of the administration's broader push to tighten immigration laws and expel those living in the United States illegally. The move was heavily criticized by immigrant advocates who said it ignored violence in El Salvador and gave the Salvadorans few options but to leave the United States or remain illegally.
The Trump administration has faced a series of deadlines over the past year to decide whether to end the protected status of immigrants in the United States whose home countries have been affected by disasters. 
Salvadorans are by far the largest group under TPS, a program administration officials said is supposed to provide a temporary haven for victims, not a permanent right to remain in the United States.
Critics have complained TPS has allowed participants to repeatedly extend their stays in 6-month to 18-month increments.
Patricia Hernandez, 53, arrived in the United States in 2000 and applied for TPS after the 2001 earthquakes. She has lived in North Carolina for 18 years and runs a subcontracting construction business with her Honduran husband. The couple have two U.S.-born teenage sons.
""This is a real blow for everyone,"" said Hernandez by telephone. ""Most of us pay taxes, we're not living off the government, we're not criminals.""
The family will move to Honduras with their children and the couple do not intend to return north, she said, though they worry about violence and political instability in central America.
Trump administration changes to the TPS program mean that over the next two years approximately 250,000 people who previously had permission to live and work in the United States will be subject to deportation if they remain.
Haitians and Nicaraguans will lose their protected status in 2019 and Hondurans, the second largest group in the program, could lose their rights later this year. 
""The past practice of allowing foreign nationals to remain in the United States long after an initial emergency in their home countries has ended has undermined the integrity of the program and essentially made the 'temporary' protected status a front operation for backdoor permanent immigration,"" said Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, which favors less immigration overall.
VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR
Advocates of the program say long-term resident Salvadorans and their children should not be sent back to El Salvador, a country struggling with a weak economy and gang violence that has given it one of the world's highest murder rates.
""Our (U.S) government is complicit in breaking up families — nearly 275,000 U.S.-born children have a parent who is a TPS holder — and further destabilizing our neighboring countries,"" said Oscar Chacon, executive director of Alianza Americas, an immigrant advocacy group.
There are approximately 1.35 million Salvadorans of any status living in the United States, according to U.S. Census Bureau data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank.
A senior administration official briefing reporters on the decision said it was based on the status of El Salvador's recovery from the 2001 earthquakes. The country has received millions of dollars in aid and rebuilt schools, homes and hospitals, the official said.
In the past two years, the United States has repatriated 39,000 Salvadorans, showing the ability of El Salvador to absorb an influx, the official said.
The government of El Salvador said on Monday that it was glad the administration decided to at least leave the program in place until September 2019. 
""El Salvador's Foreign Ministry lobbied heavily for the interests of our fellow citizens,"" the government said in a statement, adding that it would continue to search for alternatives and seek action by the U.S. Congress to protect the migrants. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce had urged the government to extend TPS protections for Salvadorans, Haitians and Hondurans, saying ""the loss of employment authorization for these populations would adversely impact several key industries,"" including ""construction, food processing, hospitality, and home healthcare services.""
Congressional Democrats on Monday expressed support for finding a permanent solution to help Salvadorans in the United States. But that will be politically difficult at a time when there are rival immigration priorities, including providing permanent protection for ""Dreamers"" - undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.
That effort has been weighed down by demands from conservatives in Congress to couple any such move with new efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration, especially from Mexico and Central America.

Enio Cubillo, the director of the civil aviation agency, said last week that it could take months to determine the cause of a plane crash.
He said experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, along with representatives from Cessna, the company that made the plane, are assisting with the probe.

Investigators are focusing on the weather conditions at the time of the crash, possible mechanical failures and human error.

142,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 03:57PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Trump to call on Pentagon, diplomats to play bigger arms sales role - sources","By Mike Stone and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is nearing completion of a new ""Buy American"" plan that calls for U.S. military attaches and diplomats to help drum up billions of dollars more in business overseas for the U.S. weapons industry, going beyond the limited assistance they currently provide, officials said.
President Donald Trump is expected to announce a ""whole of government"" approach that will also ease export rules on U.S. military exports and give greater weight to the economic benefits for American manufacturers in a decision-making process that has long focused heavily on human rights considerations, according to people familiar with the plan.
The initiative, which will encompass everything from fighter jets and drones to warships and artillery, is expected to be launched as early as February, senior officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A key policy change would call for embassy staffers around the world to act essentially as a sales force for defense contractors, actively advocating on their behalf. It was unclear, however, what specific guidelines would be established.
But under this more proactive approach, embassy staffers would engage more aggressively with foreign counterparts to push for U.S. arms sales and brief visiting senior U.S. officials so they can help advance pending deals, according to a person familiar with the matter. One senior administration official described the proposal as a ""180-degree shift"" in the current arms-length approach to foreign weapons sales.
Trump is seeking to fulfill a 2016 election campaign promise to create jobs in the United States by selling more goods and services abroad to bring down the U.S. trade deficit from a six-year high of $50 billion.
The administration is also under pressure from U.S. defense contractors facing growing competition from foreign rivals such as China and Russia. But any loosening of the restrictions on weapons sales would be in defiance of human rights and arms control advocates who said there was too great a risk of fueling violence in regions such as the Middle East and South Asia or arms being diverted to be used in terrorist attacks.
ARMS REGULATIONS
Besides greater use of a network of military and commercial attaches already stationed at U.S. embassies in foreign capitals, senior officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said another thrust of the plan will be to set in motion a realignment of the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR). It is a central policy governing arms exports since 1976 and has not been fully revamped in more than three decades.
This expanded government effort on behalf of American arms makers, together with looser restrictions on weapons exports and more favorable treatment of sales to non-NATO allies and partners, could bring additional billions of dollars in deals and more jobs, the senior U.S. official said, without providing specifics.
The strategy of having the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department take a more active role in securing foreign arms deals could especially benefit major defense contractors such as  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA).
""We want to see those guys, the commercial and military attaches, unfettered to be salesmen for this stuff, to be promoters,"" said the senior administration official, who is close to the internal deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.
A State Department official, asked to confirm details of the coming new policy, said the revamped approach ""gives our partners a greater capacity to help share the burden of international security, benefits the defense industrial base and will provide more good jobs for American workers.""
The White House and Pentagon declined official comment.
Defense industry officials and lobbyists have privately welcomed what they expect will be a more sales-friendly approach.
Trump, a Republican, has the legal authority to direct government embassy ""security assistance officers,"" both military personnel and civilians, to do more to help drive arms sales.
Administration officials see this group, which until now has had more limited duties such as helping to manage U.S. military aid overseas and providing some information to foreign governments for buying U.S. arms, as underutilized by previous presidents.
Graphic on U.S. arms sales: http://tmsnrt.rs/2CZkZMB
'BACK SEAT' FOR HUMAN RIGHTS?
One national security analyst said that easing export restrictions to allow defense contractors to reap greater profits internationally would increase the danger of top-of-the-line U.S. weapons going to governments with poor human rights records or being used by militants.
""This administration has demonstrated from the very beginning that human rights have taken a back seat to economic concerns,"" said Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center in Washington. ""And the short-sightedness of a new arms export policy could have serious long-term implications."" 
The administration officials said human rights and regional security concerns would remain part of the formula for arms sales decisions. But they said such reviews would now afford greater weight than before to whether a deal would be good for the U.S. economy and strengthen America's defense industrial base, in which case red tape would be cut accordingly. 
Rules to make it easier to sell U.S.-made military drones overseas and compete against fast-growing Chinese and Israeli rivals are also expected to be in the Trump plan, officials said.
Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also sought to make it easier to sell to America's most trusted allies but in a more cautious approach that his administration billed as a way to boost American business while keeping strict controls against more dangerous arms proliferation. Foreign weapons sales soared during his tenure, with the United States retaining its position as the world's top arms supplier.
Shares of the five biggest U.S. defense contractors, including Lockheed, Boeing,  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN), General Dynamics Corp (N:GD) and  Northrop Grumman  (N:NOC) have more than tripled over the last five years and currently trade at or near all-time highs. 
Foreign military sales in fiscal 2017, comprising much of Trump's first year in office and the final months of Obama's term, climbed to $42 billion, compared to $31 billion in the prior year, according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency. 
The Trump administration has already moved forward on several controversial sales. Those include a push for $7 billion in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia despite concerns they have contributed to civilian deaths in the Saudi campaign in Yemen's civil war and the unblocking of $3 billion in arms to Bahrain, which was also held up by human rights concerns under Obama.
Similar concerns have been raised over the administration's preparations to make it easier for American gun makers to sell small arms, including assault rifles and ammunition, to foreign buyers.
A draft of the overall policy recently finished by teams of State, Defense and Commerce Department officials coordinated by Trump's National Security Council must now be approved by a senior cabinet members before being sent to his desk, the government sources said.

Once Trump announces an extensive framework of the plan, there will be a 60-day public comment period. After that, the administration is expected to unveil further details. Some of the changes are expected to take the form of what is formally known as a presidential ""National Security Decision Directive,"" two of the sources said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - United Nations agencies began on Monday delivering aid for the first time in six months to some 60,000 Syrian refugees stranded in a desolate area near where Syria's border meets the Jordanian and Iraqi frontiers, aid agencies and Jordanian officials said.
Foreign Ministry sources said Jordan had agreed with U.N. agencies to allow a one-off aid delivery after receiving assurances all future provisions would come from U.N. stores inside Syria. 
The aid was dropped onto Syrian soil using a crane based on the Jordanian side of the frontier, the absence of direct contact signaling Jordan bears no responsibility for the camp.
The kingdom suspended regular aid deliveries to the camp after an Islamic State suicide bomber in June 2016 drove an explosive-laden car from the Syrian side and rammed it into a Jordanian military border post, killing seven guards.
The delivery of food and other items covers the needs of around 10,000 households in the makeshift Rubkan camp, where conditions are described as desperate, a senior U.N. source involved in the operation told Reuters. The operation wold take a few days to complete.
Rukban lies within a 55 km so-called deconfliction zone set by the U.S. Pentagon designed to ensure the safety of a U.S. garrison near the Syrian town of Tanf close to the Iraqi-Syrian border.
Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said recently the country, already burdened with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war-torn Syria, could not be made responsible for delivering aid to the camp.
""This is a Syrian international problem and not Jordanian. The inhabitants of the area are Syrians present on Syrian territory and the U.N. can meet their demands from inside Syria,"" Safadi said. 
The kingdom wants the U.N. and global powers to put pressure on Damascus to give the written authorizations needed to allow supplies into Rukban, where the eastern border area leading to the camp is now in government hands.
""The only impediment now to supplies being delivered is the Syrian regime and pressure should be applied on it to help its own people,"" a Jordanian diplomatic official who asked not to be named told Reuters.
Washington also assured Amman conditions on the ground were no obstruction to delivery of aid into the ""deconfliction"" zone from Syria with Russian consent. 
In the last two years tens of thousands of people seeking shelter in the camp had fled Russian and coalition airstrikes against former Islamic State-held areas in central and eastern Syria. They trekked south across the desert to the Jordanian border, according to U.N. aid workers.
King Abdullah had said there were militants among them and Jordan refused to allow them to enter on security grounds.

When arrested Mohammed already had two of the ingredients needed to make the highly unstable TATP, known as the ""mother of Satan"", which was used by a suicide bomber in an attack on a pop concert at the Manchester Arena last May, killing 22 children and adults, one of four deadly attacks in Britain last year.
Prosecutors said the couple had met on internet dating site, singlemuslim.com. 
""I am looking for a man I can vibe with on a spiritual and intellectual level. Someone who can teach me new things and inspire me,"" El-Hassan wrote on her dating profile.
She sent messages to him on the WhatsApp messaging service with links to websites with details on making ricin. He sent back her graphic videos of IS beheadings, shootings and killing prisoners using explosives.
When police arrested him in Dec. 2016, Mohammed, who worked in a food factory making meals for supermarkets, possessed instruction manuals on mobile phone detonators, ricin and how to make explosives, prosecutors said.
He had also contacted an IS commander via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and offered to carry out a ""lone actor"" mission. 
Mohammed, who the BBC reported was Eritrean-born and had come to Britain from Sudan as an asylum seeker, and El-Hassan were both found guilty of preparing for act of terrorism at London's Old Bailey court and will be sentenced next month.

148,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 12:16PM ET</span>",Sisi under spotlight as Egypt sets late March election date,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt will hold a presidential election in late March, authorities said on Monday, starting the countdown toward a likely second term in office for incumbent Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
Sisi has yet to announce his candidacy for the ballot, which was scheduled for March 26-28.
But he is widely expected to run, having won a landslide victory in the previous election in 2014, the year after - as a military commander - he led the overthrow of elected president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood.
The national election commission said candidates must register between Jan 20-29 and that, in the event of no single participant winning a majority first time around, a run-off would be held on April 24-26.
The election will be Egypt's third since the 2011 uprising that ended strongman Hosni Mubarak's long rule.
Former prime minister Ahmed Shafik, who was seen as the most serious potential challenger to Sisi's rule, said on Sunday he was no longer considering running.
Shafik returned to Egypt from the United Arab Emirates in December after announcing his intention to run, setting off a firestorm of criticism from state-aligned media and speculation that he was being held by authorities in a Cairo hotel.
Sisi's critics say his popularity has been dimmed by austerity reforms, security problems and a crackdown on dissidents.
His allies dismiss accusations of rights abuses, saying his measures are needed for security in the face of an Islamist insurgency in the North Sinai region that has expanded to include civilian targets.
Another presidential hopeful, rights lawyer Khaled Ali, faces a potential three-month prison sentence handed down in September for public indecency over an alleged rude hand gesture he made outside a courthouse last year.
He may be disqualified from standing if he loses his appeal on March 7.
Ali gained prominence in January last year when he won a case that nullified a government transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, a deal that had prompted mass protests.
Lasheen Ibrahim, the judge heading the commission, told a news conference it would ""spare no effort in running elections in accordance with the highest standards of fairness and international transparency.""

First round results will be announced on April 2 and, in the event of a run-off, final ones on May 1.

Pence will hold talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Jordan's King Abdullah and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said in a statement.
Pence, a strong supporter of Trump's decision on Jerusalem, will also visit the city's Western Wall and give a speech at the Israeli parliament, it said.
Trump's decision on Jerusalem and announcement in December that the United States would start the process of moving its embassy from Tel Aviv led to uproar and protest in the region.
""At President Trump's direction, the vice president is traveling to the Middle East to reaffirm our commitment to work with the U.S.'s allies in the region to defeat radicalism that threatens future generations,"" said Alyssa Farah, a spokeswoman for Pence.
He plans to discuss with the three leaders ""ways to work together to fight terrorism and improve our national security,"" she added.
The status of Jerusalem, which is home to Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites, is one of the thorniest obstacles to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who were furious over Trump's move and have declined to meet with Pence. The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the full city.
Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal capital, while Palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city’s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.

Pence postponed a planned visit to Egypt and Israel last month to stay in Washington for a congressional vote on Trump's tax overhaul plan.

LONDON (Reuters) - In a swipe at his hardline rivals, President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday young Iranian protesters were unhappy about far more than just the economy and they would no longer defer to the views and lifestyle of an aging revolutionary elite.
The pragmatic cleric, who defeated anti-Western hardliners to win re-election last year, also called for the lifting of curbs on social media used by anti-government protesters in the most sustained challenge to conservative authorities since 2009.
""It would be a misrepresentation (of events) and also an insult to Iranian people to say they only had economic demands,"" Rouhani was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.
""People had economic, political and social demands.""
Rouhani, 69, suggested there was a generational element to the unrest, which appears to have been spearheaded by under-25s.
""We cannot pick a lifestyle and tell two generations after us to live like that. It is impossible... The views of the young generation about life and the world is different than ours,"" he said.
The Revolutionary Guards, Iran's security backbone since the 1979 revolution that created the Islamic Republic, said on Sunday the security forces had put an end to a week of unrest fomented by what it called foreign enemies.
The protests, which began over economic hardships suffered by the young and working class, spread to more than 80 cities and towns and has resulted in 22 deaths and more than 1,000 arrests, according to Iranian officials.
Hamid Shahriari, the deputy head of the Judiciary said that all ringleaders of the protests had been identified and arrested, and they would be firmly punished and might face capital punishment.
Two Iranian lawmakers said on Monday that a 22-year-old detainee has died in prison.
The director of the Prisons Organization, Mostafa Mohebbi, confirmed the death on the judiciary's official website and said ""Sina Ghanbari has hanged himself in a toilet on Saturday"".
Many of the protesters questioned Iran’s foreign policy in the Middle East, where it has intervened in Syria and Iraq in a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia.
IRANIANS CAN CRITICIZE ""EVERYONE""
The country’s financial support for Palestinians and the Lebanese Shi‘ite group Hezbollah also angered Iranians, who want their government to focus on domestic economic problems instead.
Rouhani won re-election last year by promising more jobs for Iran’s youth through more foreign investment, as well as more social justice, individual freedom and political tolerance - aims questioned by his main challenger in the contest.
Echoing some of his campaign rhetoric, Rouhani said on Monday people should be allowed to criticize all Iranian officials, with no exception.
Demonstrators initially vented their anger over high prices and alleged corruption, but the protests took on a rare political dimension, with a growing number of people calling on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 78, to step down. 
The Supreme Leader is commander-in-chief of the armed forces and appoints the heads of the judiciary. Key ministers are selected with his agreement and he has the ultimate say on Iran’s foreign policy. By comparison, the president has little power.
""No one is innocent and people are allowed to criticize everyone,"" said Rouhani.
Rouhani also dismissed calls from hardline clerics who had asked the government to permanently block access social media and messaging apps.
As protests have ebbed, the government has lifted restrictions it imposed on Instagram, one of the social media tools used to mobilize protesters. But access to a more widely used messaging app, Telegram, was still blocked. The government has said the restrictions would be temporary.
""People's access to social media should not permanently be restricted. We cannot be indifferent to people's life and business,"" Rouhani said.
Morteza Mousavian, head of information technology in the ministry of culture, was quoted as saying by Donya-e-Eqtesad Daily on Sunday that 9,000 business entities have been affected by the ban on Telegram.
Half of Iran's 80 million population use Telegram.
State television showed live pictures of more pro-government rallies in several cities, including Sanandaj in western Iran, and Sari in north, as marchers carried posters of Ayatollah Khamenei and chanted slogans in his support.
Iranian Vice-President Masoumeh Ebtekar tweeted on Monday that Rouhani has insisted that all detained students should be released.
Mohammad Bathaei, the education minister said on Monday there were many school children among the detainees and he was asking for their release before exam season.

Amnesty International said last week that more than 1,000 Iranians had been arrested and detained in jails ""notorious for torture and other ill-treatment over the past seven days"", with many being denied access to families and lawyers.

The charges are for crimes prosecutors said occurred in Canada after Boyle and his family returned to the country last October. Boyle and his wife Caitlan Coleman were kidnapped in October 2012 while backpacking in Afghanistan.
Boyle, 34, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, appeared briefly by video link in an Ottawa court room on Monday. He is due to make his next appearance on Monday Jan. 15 at 0930 ET (1430 GMT).
When they returned to Canada with three children born in captivity, Boyle said a fourth child had been murdered and his spouse raped after their capture by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network. The Taliban denied the accusations of rape and murder.

The court has imposed a publication ban that prevents media from reporting on information that could identify any victims or witnesses. The ban also prohibits reporting on the details of the bail hearing.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese decision that part of a Hong Kong train station would be subject to Chinese law and enforcement was a blow against the city's independent legal system, the city's bar association chief said on Monday. 
China's parliament voted to allow Chinese immigration checks and the enforcement of mainland Chinese laws in part of the station, so that after boarding the train in Hong Kong passengers would not need to get off the train for immigration checks at the Hong Kong-mainland border.
Critics say the ""co-location"" arrangement, also known as ""one land, two checks"" in Chinese, sets a dangerous precedent because it violates the city’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, in which article 18 explicitly states national laws, with a few exceptions, do not apply in Hong Kong.
The remarks by Paul Lam, the head of the bar association, marked its strongest warning yet about the impact of the move in December by China's parliament, the National People's Congress. 
Hong Kong's legal system is a cornerstone of the extensive autonomy it was promised after Britain handed its former colony back to China in 1997, under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that guarantees freedoms not found on the mainland.
Beijing had interpreted Hong Kong's Basic Law, its mini-constitution, in a manner that was ""unconvincing and difficult to comprehend,"" Lam told the annual Hong Kong’s top judges, lawyers and legal officials.
""On this occasion, it is regrettable and unfortunate that an earthquake has occurred,"" he said. ""The shockwave caused by the earthquake is distinctly felt ... (but) I firmly believe that the rule of law in Hong Kong is strong enough to survive the aftermath.""
The gathering, which included diplomats and Chinese officials, showed the two systems in sharp relief, with judges and counsel in Britain's traditional ceremonial horsehair wigs, gowns and stockings.
""The rule of law is the cornerstone of our legal system, which in turn is the cornerstone of our society,"" Teresa Cheng, the city's new secretary for justice, said in a separate speech. She stressed that politics can have ""no role"" in any legal decisions.
Cheng added that while she couldn't agree Hong Kong's rule of law had been compromised, she said it was possible that it was being ""tested"". 
Hong Kong's judicial independence has been ranked first in Asia for the past three years, according to the Global Competitive Reporters of the World Economic Forum, Cheng said. 
And in rare public comments, Hong Kong's top judge, Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma, also acknowledged pressures and challenges on the system, but he repeatedly insisted its independence and integrity remained intact. Neither Cheng nor Ma directly commented on Beijing's decision.
""It is in everyone's interest that the rule of law remains strong, respected and visible,"" he said.

Ultimately, the biggest pressure faced by Hong Kong judges remained ""getting it (the law) right"", he told reporters.

Jobbik, which entered parliament in 2010 on a radical far-right agenda, is now projecting a centrist image in a bid to unseat Orban at an election due in April, where his Fidesz looks well-placed to retain power.
Confirming the findings of a preliminary report, Hungary's State Audit Office (ASZ) said Jobbik had been fined for running an advertising campaign at below market prices.
The ASZ gave Jobbik 15 days to pay the fine, equal to the price advantage the party received illegally for the campaign, which accused Orban and some of his associates of corruption.
The fine amounted to more than two-thirds of Jobbik's annual state subsidy of 475.8 million forints, and the party said the ""court-martial"" levy could cripple its election campaign. Jobbik has denied wrongdoing.
Jobbik's subsidy should also be cut by the same amount as the fine, ASZ spokesman Balint Horvath said. Jobbik used billboards owned by tycoon Lajos Simicska, an estranged Orban ally who has since become a supporter of the far right.
Orban says Simicska hijacked Jobbik. Both the party and the tycoon deny this.
Officials at the State Treasury and at Jobbik were not immediately available for comment. 
Jobbik received public funds worth nearly a billion forints in 2015 and 2016. The ASZ said Jobbik's finances over that period were not sufficiently transparent.
The ASZ, which is led by ex-Fidesz lawmaker Laszlo Domokos, has rejected accusations of politicking against Orban's foes. It said the investigation was part of a regular biennial review of parties that receive public funding.
A rally last month against the crackdown drew about a thousand Jobbik supporters, though the turnout fell well short of similar demonstrations over the past year.

Fidesz commanded 39 percent of all voters in November, according to a survey by pollster Median published in the weekly HVG. Jobbik was backed by 11 percent, while the Socialists were a distant third with 7 percent.

Eighty six people were plucked from the stricken rubber dinghy on Saturday and eight bodies, all women, were recovered. However, the boat had been carrying 150 migrants, survivors said, with many of the dead vanishing beneath the waves.
""Among them there were many children who are believed to have drowned at sea,"" said Doctors Without Borders Sea on Twitter. ""Among the survivors was a three-year-old child who has lost her mother and arrived alone, and a family of 11 now a family of three,"" it added.
The Italian coastguard said the migrants had been spotted on Saturday morning by a plane patrolling the seas on behalf of a European anti-smuggling operation. Rescuers believe their dinghy deflated following a puncture.
Such boats are regularly crammed with migrants by people smugglers operating from Libya and were never built to withstand crossing the Mediterranean Sea.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated that 2,832 migrants died last year trying to reach Italy from North Africa, down from 4,581 in 2016. Some 119,310 people made it alive to Italy in 2017 against 181,436 the year before.
The majority of the migrants are Africans fleeing war and poverty back home. Italy is working with various groups and authorities in Libya to slow the flow of newcomers.

The two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, are being investigated on suspicion of breaching the Official Secrets Act, a little-used law that has been on the books from the days of British colonial rule.
They had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a military crackdown that followed militant attacks on security forces.
The two are due to appear in court on Wednesday. It will be their second appearance in court and the prosecutor could request that charges are filed against them.
Twelve reporters based in Myanmar’s capital, Naypyitaw, said they had made their request to the interior ministry for more information about the case in accordance with the media law.
""The government hasn’t given a proper enough explanation to the country,"" Nyan Hlaing Lynn, Naypyitaw bureau chief for the Frontier Myanmar magazine told Reuters.
""We're worried that this will set a bad example of what happens when someone gives information to the media.”
CALLS FOR THEIR RELEASE
The two Reuters reporters were arrested on Dec. 12, after they were invited to meet police for dinner in Yangon.
The Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying the two journalists were ""arrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces"". It said they had ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"".
Government officials from some of the world's major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for the release of the journalists.
Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of the two.
""As they near their hearing date, it remains entirely clear that they are innocent of any wrongdoing,"" Adler said in a statement on Monday.
Aung Myo Min, reporter for the Mizzima magazine, said he and the others who wrote the letter were concerned about the implications for their work.
""We hope they'll give reasonable answers to our questions. We feel it could happen to us,"" Aung Myo Min told Reuters. ""This case is a threat to the security of us journalists.""
The 12 journalists had tried to present their written request to the Ministry of Home Affairs but officials there had told them to send it through the post, they said. They also published a copy online.
Authorities have blocked most media access to the north of Rakhine State, where Rohingya militant attacks on the security forces on Aug. 25 sparked the military crackdown.
The United Nations has condemned the Myanmar military campaign as ethnic cleansing. Buddhist-majority Myanmar has rejected that.
    The U.S. and British embassies condemned on Monday a rare attack by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army insurgents on the Myanmar security forces last week in which several members of the armed forces were wounded.
    ""This act of violence only serves to further undermine peace and security,"" the U.S. embassy said.

The U.S. and British missions both called for all sides to work to ensure safe conditions for the refugees to return home.

Tsvangirai, a former trade union leader who has been at the helm of the MDC since its formation in 1999, disclosed in June 2016 that he had cancer. Last year, he spent weeks in a South African hospital receiving treatment.
Pictures of a frail Tsvangirai meeting President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded Robert Mugabe in November after he was eased from office by a de facto military coup, have increased calls that he consider giving way to a new opposition leader.
""I am looking at the imminent prospects of us as the older generation leaving the levers of leadership to allow the younger generation to take forward this huge task that we started together so many years ago with our full blessing and support,"" Tsvangirai said in a statement.
""We must recognize the imperative that new hands, with the full blessing of the people, must take this struggle and this country forward.""
Tsvangirai, 65, has been the opposition torch bearer since 2000 and his bitter rivalry with 93-year-old Mugabe, who ruled for 37 years, was often punctuated by violence against opposition supporters.
Last year in August, Tsvangirai reunited with former allies to a forge a coalition to challenge the ruling ZANU-PF party in presidential and parliamentary elections due later this year.

Malong, who had led President Salva Kiir's campaign against rebels, has been under house arrest since May after Kiir sacked him following a string of military resignations by senior generals alleging abuses and ethnic bias.
Malong initially fled the capital Juba for his home state of Aweil following his dismissal, raising the possibility he might join opposition forces, before returning to Juba.
Malong loyalists started joining rebels and in November, Kiir released Malong to exile in Kenya.
South Sudan, which became the world's newest country after splitting from Sudan in 2011, plunged into war in late 2013 after Kiir sacked his deputy, Riek Machar.
The dispute erupted into fighting that spread across the country, largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to Kiir and Machar.
Kiir's spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny said Malong was ordering his commanders in South Sudan to attack the government. He cited an audio recording obtained by its intelligence services.
""Malong is a former chief of staff of the army but in accordance with the tape, he's a rebel. The government and the security committee will come with an appropriate response,"" he told a news conference. 
Lucy Ayak, Malong's wife, said the accusations were baseless.
""This audio is a fake audio recording,"" she told Reuters by phone from Nairobi. ""Every time government is accusing him that he wants to launch an attack, which is not true.
Last week, clashes broke out near Juba between government troops and rebels, the latest violation of a ceasefire signed in December.

The deal reached in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa between Kiir's government and a myriad of opposition groups had aimed to end the four-year-old war in which tens of thousands of people have been killed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday it might reconsider its cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog if the United States failed to respect its commitments in the nuclear deal Tehran struck with world powers in 2015. 
U.S. President Donald Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports under the terms of the nuclear pact that eased economic pressure on Tehran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.
In October, Trump refused to certify that Iran was complying with the deal, also known by its acronym JCPOA, even though the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was. 
""If the United States does not meet its commitment in the JCPOA, the Islamic Republic of Iran would take decisions that might affect its current cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),"" Iran's nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, was quoted as telling IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano in a phone call.
The IAEA is an international organization that seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and is scrutinizing Iran's compliance with the agreement. 
Supporters of the deal insist that strong international monitoring will prevent Iran from developing nuclear bombs. Iran has denied that it is seeking nuclear weapons.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said on Monday that Tehran ""would not prejudge the decision that America would take on January 13,"" but said it was ready for all possible outcomes and ""all options were on the table"".
Deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said world powers should be ready for a possible U.S. withdrawal from the deal. 
""The international community might come to this conclusion that the United States will withdraw from the JCPOA in the next few days,"" Araghchi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.
""The international community must be ready for this development,"" Araghchi added, warning that such a decision would affect stability in the region.
Trump is weighing whether the pact serves U.S. security interests, while the other world powers that negotiated it - France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China - still strongly support it.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in September that the United States should consider staying in the Iran deal unless it were proven that Tehran was not abiding by the agreement or that it was not in the U.S. national interest to do so.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's new prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, will reshuffle the two-year-old conservative government on Tuesday before flying to Brussels to discuss controversial judicial reforms.
The long-expected shake-up will probably involve naming a new finance, foreign, environment and health minister, several sources close to the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party have told Reuters.
""The swearing-in should take place around noon,"" Morawiecki's spokeswoman Joanna Kopcinska said on Monday. 
Teresa Czerwinska, a deputy finance minister responsible for budget affairs, is the most likely to succeed Morawiecki himself as finance minister, two sources said.
Two other sources said that either President Andrzej Duda's top foreign policy adviser, Krzysztof Szczerski, or Adam Bielan, a deputy speaker of the upper house of parliament, would replace Witold Waszczykowski as foreign minister. 
""Szczerski has long been the top candidate but Bielan's candidacy is also strong,"" a government source said. 
Morawiecki stepped up from finance minister to replace Beata Szydlo as premier last month, at the midpoint of the parliamentary term, as PiS gears up for local elections in late 2018 and parliamentary and presidential elections in 2019 and 2020.
Czerwinska is seen as loyal to Morawiecki and likely to continue his economic policy with little change of emphasis.
But it remains to be seen whether Morawiecki will improve Warsaw's relations with Brussels. Poland, once a champion of democratic changes after the fall of Communism, is now at loggerheads with the European Union over sweeping changes to state institutions that critics say have undermined democracy and the rule of law.
Morawiecki is due to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Tuesday.
The EU executive launched an unprecedented action against Poland in December, calling on other member states to prepare sanctions if Warsaw fails to reverse a series of judicial reforms.

The PiS government says the reforms will speed up slow and inefficient courts and sweep away a lingering communist era-mentality. Brussels says they politicize the judiciary, and are at odds with core EU values.

Katja Schlenkermann-Pitts, a senior prosecutor in Aachen, said authorities were investigating the incident as an attempted homicide, but said her office could not confirm Naki's concerns. She said prosecutors were looking ""in all directions.""
The Interior Ministry had no information on the case, spokesman Johannes Dimroth told a regular government news conference. He said he had no doubt that Naki's statements would be addressed by prosecutors as part of the investigation.
The incident occurred around 11 p.m. on the A4 highway near the town of Dueren, where Naki grew up, as he was returning home after visiting a friend. 
It comes as the German and Turkish foreign ministers are trying to improve difficult relations following Ankara's crackdown after an abortive coup attempt in 2016 and the arrests of German citizens in Turkey.
Turkey has repeatedly accused Germany of failing to crack down on supporters of PKK - which it calls a ""terrorist organisation"" -in Germany, which is home to about three million people of Turkish descent. Germany, for its part, is investigating possible spying by Turkish intelligence agents. 
Hundreds of militants, security force members and civilians have been killed in Turkey since the collapse of a ceasefire between the Turkish army and PKK in 2015, reviving a conflict that has killed 40,000 since 1984.
""I could have died,"" Naki told the newspaper. ""It was so close. I was scared to death."" He said the shots were fired from a black station wagon that was diagonally behind him, and two bullets struck his car.Naki, who said he frequently received menacing messages on social media, vowed not to let the shooting incident stop him from speaking out against the Turkish government. He said he had not received any specific threats in recent weeks.
Naki, a former national youth soccer player for Germany, now plays for a Kurdish team in Turkey.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May named immigration minister Brandon Lewis chairman of her Conservative Party on Monday at the start of a reshuffle she hopes will re-energize an agenda hurt by divisions over Brexit and an ill-judged election.
May, weakened by the loss of the Conservative Party's majority in an election gamble last June, moved to reshuffle her team of top ministers after ending last year with a deal to shift talks with the European Union to a second phase.
She is expected to keep her team's 'big beasts' - her finance, Brexit, foreign and interior ministers - but may promote women, black and younger lawmakers to challenge critics who call her party ""male, pale and stale"".
The reshuffle, which will last for most of Monday, is part of the 61-year-old's attempts to reassert her authority over not only her party, but also parliament, where she depends on the support of a small Northern Irish party to pass laws, especially those needed for Britain's departure from the EU bloc.
""I'm not a quitter. I'm in this for the long term,"" May told the BBC on Sunday, a new mantra from a prime minister who has been mocked in the local media as a 'Maybot' for her dogged repetition of catchphrases and policy statements.
Despite winning agreement from the EU to push Brexit talks to a discussion of future trade relations and a transitional deal, May has been criticized at home for her approach to healthcare, housing and transport among other issues.
In an early blow, her minister for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, stepped down because of ill-health. He had been trying to help officials form a power-sharing government to avoid any return to violence between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists that scarred the province for decades. [nL9N1IW02G]
But the biggest change so far was the appointment of Lewis to head the Conservative Party whose membership is plummeting after what many members acknowledge was a disastrous election campaign in June.
His appointment was almost derailed after the party was forced to delete a tweet congratulating transport minister Chris Grayling to the position, which members say has become increasingly important. [nL9N1IW02H]
The main opposition Labour Party, under the leadership of leftist lawmaker Jeremy Corbyn, is enjoying some of the highest numbers of support in its history.
It will now fall to the 46-year-old Lewis to provide the leadership needed to attract younger voters and those in northern England if the governing party is to have a chance to win the next election in 2022.

Lewis, who is popular in the party and was a supporter of May's leadership bid last year, will take over from veteran minister Patrick McLoughlin, who had been criticized by some members for failing to broaden the appeal of the party.

165,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>",France registers record asylum requests in 2017,"PARIS (Reuters) - France registered a record number of asylum requests in 2017, when Albanians topped the list despite far slimmer prospects of obtaining refugee status than people from war-torn places such as Syria or Afghanistan.
A more than two-year long migration crisis has caused immigration to become a major political issue in many European countries, including France. Official asylum requests rose 17 percent to exceed 100,000, the highest ""in at least four decades"", according to Pascal Brice, head of France's refugee office (Ofpra).
""This is not a massive inflow and we are capable of handling the situation,"" Brice told CNews television on Monday.
The number is sensitive after an election where President Emmanuel Macron faced off against Marine Le Pen of the anti-immigrant National Front.
Macron, who won power in May, has promised to slash the time it takes French officials take to rule on asylum requests - to two months maximum from what Brice said was now about three months on average.
Asylum requests from Albanians rose 66 percent from 2016 but the acceptance rate was low, at just 6.5 percent, Ofpra figures showed.
By comparison, the acceptance rate was 95 percent for Syrians, 85 percent for Afghans and 59 percent in the case of people from Sudan, Ofpra said.
Brice called the surge in Albanian requests ""a cyclical phenomenon"". Albanians rose from third place in 2016 to the front of the queue of asylum-requesters in 2017, ahead of Afghanistan and Sudan, with Syria further down the line.
The new French number -- precisely 100,412 asylum requests in 2017 - compares to 140,000 asylum requests recorded in the first nine months of 2017 in neighboring Germany, where limits on the inflow are one key issue in talks where Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking to forge a governing coalition.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Change of guard for Germany's Greens as 'Jamaica' leaders bow out,"By Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's environmentalist Greens, still reeling from the collapse of coalition negotiations last year, are set for a shake-up at the top after their leaders both said they would not stand for re-election.
The reshuffle follows the failure in November of three-way ""Jamaica"" talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP). The ""Jamaica"" moniker came from the official colors of the three parties that combine to make up that country's flag.
The Greens, who got 8.9 percent in September's vote, still have an outside chance of getting into government - either in a two-way tie-up with the conservatives or in a Jamaica coalition, if current talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) fail.
Cem Ozdemir, a 52-year-old politician of Turkish origin who was touted as a potential foreign minister if the Jamaica talks succeeded, said he did not stand a chance in a leadership vote so he would not attempt to extend his tenure.
""Ultimately it became clear to me that what I offer didn't have enough support in the parliamentary fraction at the moment - I obviously don't have a majority and I must accept that,"" he told newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
His co-leader, 52-year-old Simone Peter - who belongs to the party's leftist wing, also said she would not run for re-election after Anja Piel, another leftist member, said she would stand.
Other candidates include 48-year-old Robert Habeck, a popular regional environment minister, and 37-year-old Annalena Baerbock, a member of the national parliament. Both of them are considered to be in the party's pragmatic wing.
The Greens tend to choose a man and a woman as co-leaders, with one coming from the pragmatic wing while the other comes from the ""fundamentalist"" leftist wing.
Ozdemir and Peter were largely responsible for leading the Jamaica coalition negotiations for the Greens - talks which met with widespread scepticism among the party's grassroots.
The Greens, which once styled themselves as an ""anti-party party"", have disappointed some voters by shifting towards the centre, with some complaining they have become too normal and boring. Their environmentalist agenda becoming mainstream has deprived them of a unique selling point.
In an opinion piece, the daily Die Welt wrote that the leadership turnover would inject some life into what was ""until half a year ago considered the topsy-turvy house of German politics that was fit for demolition"".

But it suggested the outlook was not bright. ""Past experience shows that vibrancy in the Greens rapidly leads to arguments.""

The helicopter crew landed the aircraft because a warning light had come on, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, which showed the helicopter resting on its skids on the ground. No injuries were reported.
Representatives of the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in Okinawa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Resentment has simmered among residents of the southern island who bemoan what they see as an unfair burden in supporting the U.S. military presence in Japan.
Among recent incidents, a USMC transport helicopter made an emergency landing on an Okinawan beach on Saturday because of a faulty rotor. Earlier, a window fell from a military aircraft onto a school playground.
Such accidents, as well as occasional incidents of crime committed by U.S. service personnel, have fueled opposition to the U.S. presence on the island. 
Located strategically at the edge of the East China Sea, Okinawa, which was under U.S. occupation until 1972, hosts some 30,000 military personnel living and working on bases that cover a fifth of the island.

169,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Turkey's nationalist opposition to back Erdogan in 2019 election,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's nationalist opposition said on Monday it would back President Tayyip Erdogan in the 2019 election, signaling continued right-wing support crucial to his narrow victory in a constitutional referendum last year.
The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), the smallest of parliament's four factions, backed the vote to grant Erdogan sweeping executive powers, helping it squeak by with a margin of 51.4 percent. 
""The MHP will not submit a presidential candidate,"" MHP leader Devlet Bahceli told a news conference. ""The MHP will take a decision to support Erdogan in the presidential elections."" Turks will vote for both president and parliament next year.
Bahceli has said he wants a reduction in the minimum 10 percent vote required for a party to enter parliament.
Over the past two decades he has brought the MHP more toward the mainstream and away from its early reputation for ties to rightist street gangs.
The party is now looking to fend off a challenge from Meral Aksener, an ex-interior minister and prominent nationalist who last year founded her own party after breaking with the MHP.
One recent poll suggested that Aksener's party could eclipse the MHP and deprive it of the 10 percent threshold.
Bahceli said the MHP would consider an alliance with Erdogan's AK Party if such a request came from the AKP.
The MHP won as much as 18 percent in the 1999 parliamentary election but slipped below the threshold with 9.5 percent in 2002. It has exceeded 10 percent in elections since and took 11.9 percent in the November 2015 vote.
Founded by an ex-colonel involved in a 1960 military coup, the MHP espouses a mix of Turkish nationalism and scepticism toward the West. It is virulently opposed to autonomy for Turkey's Kurdish minority.

The MHP support base once included sympathizers of the ""Grey Wolves"", a nationalist youth group that fought street battles with leftists in the 1970s. Mehmet Ali Agca, who tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981, was a group member.

170,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Germany expects return of over 100 children of Islamist fighters,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German security officials are preparing for the arrival of over 100 infants and children of people who left the country to fight for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, amid concerns about the radicalization of minors. 
Nearly a thousand people are believed to have left Germany to join up with the Islamist militants. As the group's presence in the Middle East crumbles, some are returning with family members, while German authorities are trying to secure the release of children whose parents have been detained.
In a document addressed to a lawmaker and seen by Reuters on Monday, Interior Ministry State Secretary Emily Haber said it was difficult to estimate the exact number of children set to arrive since it was unclear how many babies were born while their parents were in Iraq or Syria.
But security officials had information indicating that ""a low three-digit number of minors is expected,"" with the majority believed to be babies or toddlers, Haber said in a reply to a formal parliamentary query by Greens lawmaker Irene Mihalic.
Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency, had warned in October that children of returning Islamists could pose a threat after being ""socialised and indoctrinated in the battlefield areas.""
The radicalization of children has been in the spotlight given that three of five Islamist attacks in Germany in 2016 were carried out by minors, and a 12-year-old boy was also detained after trying to bomb a Christmas market in Ludwigshafen.
The German government says it has evidence that more than 960 people left Germany for Iraq and Syria through November 2017 to fight for the Islamic State jihadist group, of which about a third are believed to have returned to Germany. Another 150 likely died in combat, according to government data.
State Secretary Haber said there was no evidence of a big increase in the return of people from Iraq and Syria in recent months despite military setbacks for Islamic State.
The German foreign ministry was providing consular services to German citizens and their children who had been detained or imprisoned in Iraq, and was seeking the return of children that were now imprisoned with their parents in Iraq, Haber said.
""No timeline can be given for the return of these children since this is largely dependent on the cooperation of the Iraqi authorities,"" she wrote.
Given Germany's decentralized federal structure, state officials had the main responsibility for deradicalization of those who returned from Iraq and Syria, including those were convicted and incarcerated, Haber said.
But she said the federal government was supporting those efforts through a number of initiatives, including support for families of those who left Germany to fight for Islamic State.
New federally-funded programs were planned in 2018 to educate and deradicalize returning foreign fighters, and the federal government was also funding programs in each of the 16 states to prevent further radicalization in prison, Haber said.

The killing comes only a few days after Bulgaria, the European Union's poorest and most corrupt country, assumed the six-month, rotating presidency of the EU for the first time since it joined in 2007.
Petar Hristov, 49, was shot dead while getting in his car in Manastirski Livadi, a high-end district of the capital, Sofia, early on Monday.
Hristov, an influential businessmen in central Bulgaria with interests in construction, real estate and tourism, was taken to hospital, where he died from his wounds about 30 minutes later. 
Hristov was also close to senior officials from the ruling center-right GERB party, according to Bulgarian media.
""The investigation is ongoing,"" Sofia police commissioner Ivaylo Ivanov said. ""The person is a 49-year-old Bulgarian citizen, a businessman, this is what I can say at the moment.""
The killing of Hristov comes amidst close scrutiny from Brussels, which has criticized Bulgaria for doing too little to fight criminal gangs and official corruption. Three weeks ago, a senior tax official was shot in his car in Sofia downtown.
According to Transparency International, Bulgaria is the EU's most corrupt country. But a week before Hristov was shot, President Rumen Radev vetoed anti-graft legislation, saying the bill failed to offer the means to effectively investigate corruption networks.

Since monitoring of the outbreak began last January, 720 laboratory-confirmed cases of food poisoning due to the disease, also known as listeriosis, have been reported, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) said.
That was up from 557 in December, since when recorded deaths had risen to 61 from 36.
A food microbiologist said the ""alarming"" outbreak appeared to be the biggest ever recorded and could spread further if it was not tackled urgently. 
""Of the documented outbreaks globally that we know of... our numbers are way above any of those other cases,"" said Dr Lucia Anelich, who runs her own food safety consultancy.
The Department of Health said it had closed a poultry abattoir operated by Sovereign Foods in the capital Pretoria after detecting listeria there, and had banned it from preparing food.
The department said it did not yet know whether this abattoir was the source of the outbreak, which the NICD said was still unknown.
No-one at Sovereign Foods, which delisted from the Johannesburg stock exchange in November, was immediately available for comment.
Listeria food poisoning is a bacterial infection that can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed in time. The bacteria can be found in animal products including cold cut meats, poultry and unpasteurised milk, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables.
The disease can cause flu-like symptoms and diarrhoea, and in more severe cases spread from the intestine to the blood, causing bloodstream infections, or to the central nervous system, causing meningitis.
Anelich said a listeriosis strain known as ST6 had been identified in nine out of 10 of the South African cases.
That should make tracing the source easier, ""because now we know that it probably originates from one processing facility"".
A health department official said the strain was not drug-resistant and that the deaths were due to delays in diagnosis, meaning cases were not treated in time.

The killings endanger efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari to bring security and stability to Nigeria - a key campaign pledge when he ran for election in 2015.
Muslim herdsmen, mainly of the Fulani ethnic group, and Christian farmers often clash over the use of land in remote areas of the Middle Belt region.
Terve Akase, chief press secretary to the governor of Benue state, attributed 71 deaths from Dec. 31 to Jan. 6 to killings by the Fulani. Reuters was unable to verify the figures.
""The attacks happened in very remote villages,"" said Akase. ""Now, with security operatives on the ground, villagers have been going about the bush to pick up more corpses.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The new leader of South Africa's African National Congress (ANC) Cyril Ramaphosa called for unity on Monday as factions within the party become increasingly divided over the future of President Jacob Zuma.
There is widespread speculation that Ramaphosa and his allies are lobbying ANC members to oust Zuma as head of state within weeks. Ramaphosa, who is also the country's deputy president, publicly supports Zuma.
Markets have rallied since Ramaphosa narrowly defeated Zuma's ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in an ANC leadership contest last month as investors bet he will tackle rampant political corruption and implement economic reforms.
Zuma's term doesn't officially end until 2019 when national elections will be held but he could be removed early through a motion of no confidence in parliament or at meeting of the ANC's national executive committee (NEC). The NEC will meet this week.
Zuma himself orchestrated the removal of former president Thabo Mbeki in 2008 once he had succeeded Mbeki as ANC leader.
Ramaphosa used Dlamini-Zuma's own words as he called on the ANC to end its differences ahead of the 2019 vote.
""We must rid ourselves of factionalism. We do not want a divided African National Congress,"" Ramaphosa told ANC leaders at a celebration of the party's 106th birthday in Kwa-Zulu Natal, the home province of Zuma and Dlamini-Zuma.
""One of the things Comrade Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said was: 'divided we fall, united we stand'. That has a great deal of meaning,"" he said, as a stony-faced Dlamini-Zuma looked on.
Ramaphosa tried to balance the priorities of both factions within the ANC, reiterating his anti-graft stance but also blunting Dlamini-Zuma by pledging to redistribute land from the white-minority to the black-majority, her main campaign promise.
Though Ramaphosa says he supports land redistribution without compensations, a popular policy among poor black voters, he has promised he will not do it at the expense of the economy.
The ANC's public support has declined under Zuma's leadership as voters have become increasingly disillusioned with a raft of corruption scandals, weak economic growth and an unemployment rate that has risen to nearly 28 percent.

Many analysts say the 2019 election is the first realistic chance of the ANC losing power since the party swept to power under Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid in 1994.

Concerns were growing that the tanker, which hit a freight ship on Saturday night in the East China Sea and burst into flames, may explode and sink, the official China Central Television (CCTV) said on Monday, citing experts on the rescue team.
Poor weather continued to hamper the rescue work, Lu Kang, a spokesman at China's foreign ministry, told a regular news briefing.
The size of the oil spill from the ship and the extent of the environmental harm were not known, but the disaster has the potential to be the worst since 1991 when 260,000 tonnes of oil leaked off the Angolan coast.
The remains of one of the 32 mariners on board was found on Monday afternoon, Iranian and Chinese officials confirmed. 
Mohammad Rastad, head of Iran's Ports and Maritime Organisation, was quoted by the ISNA news agency as saying that the body had been sent to Shanghai for identification. The fate of the remaining 31 sailors is not known.
The Sanchi tanker (IMO:9356608) run by Iran's top oil shipping operator, National Iranian Tanker Co, collided with the CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) on Saturday evening about 160 nautical miles off China's coast near Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta.
Chinese state media CCTV showed footage on Monday of a flotilla of boats dousing the flames with water as plumes of thick dark smoke continued to billow from the tanker.
One portion appeared to show the fire had been extinguished, although this could not be independently confirmed. China's Ministry of Transport and Maritime Safety would not comment when asked if the fire was out.
""The Chinese government takes maritime accidents like this very seriously, and has already dispatched many search and rescue teams to the scene to carry out search and rescue,"" said the foreign ministry's Lu said.
China sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to the site, South Korea dispatched a ship and a helicopter, while a U.S. Navy military aircraft searched an area of about 3,600 square nautical miles (12,350 sq km) for crew members.
The Panama-registered tanker was sailing from Iran to South Korea, carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate, an ultra-light and highly volatile crude. That is equivalent to just under 1 million barrels, worth about $60 million, based on global crude oil prices.
Ship tracking data shows the collision occurred in waters not frequently used by large vessels like tankers, dry-bulk carriers or container ships. Most ships travel either closer to the Chinese coast in the west or more nearby to Japan in the east.
The freight ship, which was carrying U.S. grain, suffered limited damage and the 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, were rescued.
China's transport ministry said the CF Crystal were being taken to the port of Luhuashan, just south of Shanghai, where authorities will start an investigation into the cause of the incident.

COLORLESS, ODORLESS AND HARMFUL
Lu said it was too soon to discuss how victims of the disaster may be compensated, and that compensation and other questions would be addressed after an investigation into the accident is complete.
Bad weather made it hard for the rescue crews to get access to the tanker, but toxic gas from the burning oil posed a major risk.
When condensate meets water, it evaporates quickly and can cause large-scale explosion as it reacts with air and turns into a flammable gas, the transportation ministry said on Monday.
Trying to contain a spill of condensate, which is extremely low in density, highly toxic and much more explosive than normal crude oil, may be difficult.
When liquid, most condensate is colorless and virtually odorless. Surface spills of condensate are therefore difficult to detect visually, making them hard to manage and contain.
Tankers also carry shipping fuel, known as bunker, which is extremely heavy and toxic when spilled, though much less explosive.
The Shanghai Maritime Bureau's navigation department said the collision did not affect traffic in and out of Shanghai, one of the world's busiest and biggest ports, or ports along the Yangtze river. 
A spokesman for South Korea's Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co Ltd [SMCHE.UL], which was due to receive the cargo, said it would use its own stockpiles to replace the lost cargo.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis called on Monday for all nations to support dialogue to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula and to work for a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons.
In an annual speech to diplomats that has come to be known as his ""State of the World"" address, Francis also repeated his call for the ""status quo"" of Jerusalem to remain intact following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize the city as Israel's capital.
Francis also addressed climate change, calling for countries to remain committed to the 2015 Paris accord on reducing carbon emissions. Trump has announced that the United States will withdraw from the agreement.
""It is of paramount importance to support every effort at dialogue on the Korean peninsula, in order to find new ways of overcoming the current disputes, increasing mutual trust and ensuring a peaceful future for the Korean people and the entire world,"" Francis said.
The pope addressed diplomats a day before North Korea and South Korea are due to hold talks expected to address North Korea's participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Earlier this month, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un asserted that he had a nuclear button at the ready, Trump tweeted that the U.S. button at his disposal was bigger and more powerful.
""Nuclear weapons must be banned,"" Francis said, quoting a document issued by Pope John XXIII at the height of the Cold War and adding that there is ""no denying that the conflagration could be started by some chance and unforeseen circumstance"".

He noted that the Holy See was among 122 states that last year agreed to a United Nations treaty to ban nuclear weapons. The United States, Britain, France and others boycotted the talks that led to the treaty, instead pledging commitment to a decades-old Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Tax relief was an election promise by Merkel's conservatives, and the initial agreement to raise the bar for a top income tax rate to an annual income of 60,000 euros indicates that the SPD are willing to compromise.
Sealing a deal with the SPD on renewing the coalition with the conservatives that has governed Germany since 2013 is Merkel's best chance at securing a fourth term in office after an election in September that weakened both parties.
The compromise on taxation is only a small step in the talks between the would-be partners who have to bridge major differences on immigration, the future of the European Union and the economy.
The source said the SPD, Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Christian Social Union (CSU) Bavarian allies want to raise a top tax rate of 42 percent that at the moment applies for those who earn 53,700 euros and above ($64,375.56) annually.
SECOND TIME LUCKY?
Merkel, who in November failed to form a coalition with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), said on Sunday at the start of five days of talks with the SPD that the negotiations could succeed.
Members of her conservative party sounded similarly upbeat on Monday.
""Yesterday, we worked very factually and we did well,"" said Julia Kloeckner, a senior member of the CDU. ""We are aware of the fiscal limitations and we are optimistic.""
SPD leader Martin Schulz has vowed to put any agreement with the conservatives up for a vote by party members, many of whom are opposed to a so-called 'grand coalition' of the two largest parties in parliament.
The SPD want to improve the right of workers and scrap Germany's dual healthcare system of premium private care and more widely accessible public care to replace it with a single ""citizen's insurance"".

They also oppose a plan by the conservatives to extend a ban that expires in March on family reunifications for some asylum seekers.

An appeals court in Athens upheld a request by the Greek government to freeze the asylum status granted by an independent asylum council on Dec. 29. The same council had rejected asylum requests filed by the seven other soldiers.
The court said it was granting the order 'for reasons of public interest' until a formal court hearing is scheduled against the asylum board's decision on Feb. 15.
Turkey has demanded the extradition of the soldiers, which it has branded as traitors.

The asylum board's decision exposed tense relations between the two countries which have long been at odds over a host of regional issues. On filing its appeal, the Greek government said it thought matters of such political importance should be determined by the courts.

BELFAST (Reuters) - Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein has summoned one of its lawmakers to explain an ""indefensible"" tweet on the anniversary of the day 10 Protestant textile workers were shot dead in 1976, which police blamed on the IRA.
Sinn Fein, which wants to enter government in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, has struggled to distance itself from the violent legacy of the Provisional IRA, its former military wing, which fought a 30-year insurgency against British rule in Northern Ireland until 1998.
Barry McElduff, who was last year elected to the British parliament, posted a video on Twitter on Friday, the anniversary of the massacre near the village of Kingsmill in which he balanced a loaf of Kingsmill brand bread on his head. He later deleted the tweet. 
Alan Black, the only survivor of the massacre in which Irish nationalist gunmen forced workers from a minibus and shot them dead at close range, told the BBC the video was ""depraved"" and designed to hurt relatives of the victims. 
No one has ever been convicted for the crime, which an inquiry said was carried out by the IRA who targeted the men because of their religion. The IRA denied involvement.
A spokesman for Sinn Fein said McElduff had been summoned to meet with the party's leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O'Neill. 
""What has happened is inexcusable, it's indefensible and the party is taking this matter very seriously,"" party Chairman Declan Kearney told Irish state broadcaster RTE, declining to comment on whether McElduff might be asked to resign. 
McElduff on Saturday apologized for the tweet, saying it was not his intention to cause offense and that he had not ""imagined for a second"" a possible link between the brand and the massacre. 
The Police Service of Northern Ireland said on Saturday it was making inquiries following complaints about the tweet. 
The 1976 massacre was one of a series of tit-for-tat attacks by Protestant paramilitaries who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom and Catholic Irish nationalists who wanted a united Ireland.
The 1998 peace agreement paved the way for a power-sharing government and mostly ended the cycle of violence, though some small armed groups remain.

The king's father, the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whose reign spanned seven decades, was cremated in Bangkok in October.
The late king, who died in October 2016, commanded the devotion of millions and helped shape Thailand for decades after World War Two. King Vajiralongkorn does not have the same level of devotion.
The festival, which will take place at the Royal Plaza, a public square in Bangkok, from February 8 to March 11, will feature exhibitions showcasing the life and work of his late father King Bhumibol and his great grandfather, King Chulalongkorn, who reigned from 1868 to 1910.
The festival will include gardens, fountains, and historic-looking structures.
""The king wants Thai people to be happy by reminiscing about the past, that's why the festival has a historical theme,"" government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd told Reuters on Monday.
He added that the public will be encouraged to wear traditional Thai clothes and 19th century Thai fashions.
King Vajiralongkorn, who ascended the throne after his father's death, quickly asserted his authority by requiring changes to a new constitution to make his powers clear and he also set about reorganizing the palace.
He has issued a number of royal decrees in recent months pertaining to the promotion and dismissal of palace officials.
He has also been given full control of the agency that manages the multi-billion dollar holdings of the monarchy.
Outside of the palace, the king has ordered the organization of public events such as weekend music concerts aimed at ""bringing happiness to the people"".
King Vajiralongkorn's formal coronation is expected to take place later this year and could signal the start of politics following a year of mourning and the late king's funeral.

Thai laws protecting members of the royal family from insult limit what all news organizations, including Reuters, can report from Thailand.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam began the trial on Monday of 22 executives charged over losses totaling hundreds of millions of dollars at the state oil firm, PetroVietnam, with the most serious offences potentially carrying the death penalty.
The defendants included the communist state's first politburo member to face trial in decades and a businessman who Germany says was kidnapped by Vietnamese agents from a Berlin park.
The trial is part of a widespread crackdown on fraud and mismanagement in the energy and banking sectors that intensified after the security establishment gained greater influence in the ruling party last year.
The PetroVietnam trial in Hanoi was taking place simultaneously with a separate trial in the commercial capital Ho Chi Minh City, where a fraud case involving Vietnam's Construction Bank was being heard.
The 46 defendants include the bank's ex-chairman Pham Cong Danh, who is accused of causing losses of 6.1 trillion dong ($268.62 million), according to the government's news website.
Total losses caused by fraud at the bank amounted to 15.5 trillion Vietnam dong ($682.55 million), a previous report said. 
The PetroVietnam case at the Hanoi People's Court was not open to the public and security was tight.
Photographs released by the Vietnam News Agency, the official state news provider, showed defendants handcuffed as they were led to the courtroom. 
Of the 22 executives on trial, 12 are accused of ""violation of state regulations on economic management causing serious consequences"". Eight are accused of embezzlement, according to the government's official news website. Two are accused of both.
The most senior former executive on trial is Dinh La Thang, who was arrested last month. He is a former politburo member who was dismissed from his post over the losses at PetroVietnam and then stripped of his role as party head of Ho Chi Minh City.
Also on trial is Trinh Xuan Thanh, who Germany says was kidnapped last year and taken home against his will to face accusations over losses of more than $150 million at a subsidiary of PetroVietnam.
Thanh is accused of both corruption and breaking state rules on economic management. A Reuters reporter saw the bespectacled Thanh arrive under police escort at the court on Monday.
Thanh appeared on state television in August and said he had decided to return home to turn himself in.
Neither Thang nor Thanh made any comment at the court and Reuters was unable to contact the lawyers representing them.
The maximum jail term for deliberate violation of state regulations is 20 years in prison, state television VTV1 reported in a news bulletin on Monday. 
Government critics have voiced suspicions that the corruption crackdown is politically motivated, at least in part, and aimed against those close to former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung, who lost out in an internal power struggle in 2016.
The trial is due to last until Jan. 21.
In a separate case linked to the corruption crackdown, a fugitive Vietnamese tycoon was arrested in Hanoi on Thursday after being sent home from Singapore, where he was accused of immigration offences.
Phan Van Anh Vu, 42, told his lawyers he was also a senior officer in Vietnam's secret police and was trying to get to Germany and could have details of the operation in which Thanh was spirited home from Berlin last year.

Emirates and Etihad, backed by their state owners, have competed almost head-to-head developing global networks from their respective hubs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi that are just 128 kilometers apart.
Emirates is owned by the government of Dubai, and Etihad is owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. 
Monday's memorandum of understanding involves Emirates unit Emirates Group Security and Etihad parent Etihad Aviation Group working ""together on operational areas both within and outside the UAE,"" according to an Emirates statement.
The agreement was signed by Emirates President Tim Clark and Etihad's new Group Chief Executive Tony Douglas.
Clark told Reuters on Oct. 11 that Emirates was open to working with Etihad, including on procurement. 
""I think there is value to be had working more closely with them,"" Clark said in October.
Emirates and Etihad face common challenges; a lobbying campaign in the United States to investigate accusations that they are unfairly state subsidized, which they both deny, as well as overcapacity, security concerns, and a drop in regional business travel.
Under Monday's agreement, Emirates Group Security will provide security and training programs to Etihad, and help develop their security escort capability. 
Emirates is the largest Middle East airline, and the younger Etihad had unsuccessfully spent billions trying to catch up by buying stakes in more than half a dozen operators around the world. Its most high-profile investments, Air Berlin and Italy's Alitalia, filed for administration last year and contributed to Etihad falling into the red in 2016 for the first time since 2010.

Emirates started developing closer ties with fellow Dubai state-owned carrier flydubai last year.

KABUL (Reuters) - In a country not short of problems, a looming pensions crisis that could cripple Afghanistan's budget in coming years is a new headache for a government dependent on increasingly war-weary foreign donors.
Pension liabilities - set to swallow the equivalent of a third of the current $5 billion budget within 15 years unless something is done - typify accumulated problems the government is now trying to tackle.
""Previously, they kicked the can down the road and it's snowballing right now and needs to be fixed,"" said Deputy Finance Minister Khalid Payenda.
Many countries face pension problems but it is especially unwelcome in Afghanistan, struggling to restore an economy shattered by four decades of war.
Provisions that award government workers with service of 40 years benefits equivalent to full final salary were originally introduced to compensate for low pay.
Many pensioners, who complain that actual benefits are meager and often paid late, would be surprised to hear the system described as generous.
But with no separate pension fund to generate investment income and benefits paid directly from the Treasury, payments are set to spiral out of control as more of almost 900,000 government workers retire over coming years.
""The economics of it doesn't work. It's not sustainable and at a certain point it will explode,"" Payenda said from his office in the ministry, where he is overseeing a drive to make the budget more transparent and spending more efficient.
""It's the start of a process but it will take a few years,"" he said, adding that it was vital that foreign donors showed ""understanding"" and do not cut off funds abruptly.
'LEAKAGES, BLOATED STRUCTURES'
Although down since most international troops withdrew in 2014, foreign aid still accounts for 54 percent of the budget. But donor willingness is not eternal and most funding pledges run only to 2020.
While progress has been made in increasing revenues, preparing for a reduction in aid is urgent, especially given likely disruption around presidential elections next year.
As in each of the past eight years, parliament is wrangling over budget approval, an opaque process that has encouraged backroom deals, waste and corruption.
""There are leakages, bloated structures and there is unnecessary expenditure on conspicuous items,"" Payenda said. ""We want to see where there are problems and fix them.""
As long as security accounts for 40 percent of spending, Afghanistan's public finances will be unbalanced and the room for investment to boost revenue in areas like mining or agriculture limited.
But there are many areas where improvements are possible.
Due to weak administrative capacity, funds assigned to ministries are often not fully used, with unspent amounts carried over to following years, reducing accountability and making it harder to track real spending. In future, the government plans a ""use it or lose it"" approach.
On pensions, a special fund will need to be set up to separate contributions and benefits from regular Treasury funds. Both benefits and government contributions may have to be cut, a process fraught with political risk.

But more open processes to allocate funds are key, Payenda said. ""Reasonable people will listen and unreasonable ones can't shout at you because of what the others will think.""

China opened several disputed air routes last week, including a northbound M503 route in the Taiwan Strait, without informing Taiwan, contravening what the democratic government in Taipei said is a 2015 deal to first discuss such flight paths. 
Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, after meeting with ministry heads to assess the situation on Sunday, said the move ""not only seriously affects aviation safety, but also damages the current situation in the Taiwan strait. 
""This kind of unilateral changing of the situation, this practice that harms regional stability, is not something that will be viewed favorably by the international community,"" Tsai said in a statement.
Tsai, who also said during her meeting with officials that China's increased military activities in the region were threatening stability, called on Beijing to give priority to restore technical discussions on the flight paths.
Beijing's move comes as China has pressed ahead with a military modernization program that includes building aircraft carriers and stealth fighters to give it the ability to project power far from its shores, and stepped up what it calls ""island encirclement patrols"" near Taiwan. 
Last Thursday, China's civil aviation authority said in a statement announcing the new routes that planes ""will strictly follow the announced flight path"". 
""In recent years, the scheduled flights for the strait's west coast airspace have quickly increased, and the delays are becoming more critical. Using the northbound M503 and related routes will effectively ease the currently existing air route's traffic pressure,"" it said. 
China considers Taiwan a wayward province, and broke off official communication with the Taiwan government after Tsai's independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won power in 2016. 

China suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence though, she has said she wants to maintain the status quo with China and is committed to ensuring peace.

XIAN, China (Reuters) - Never let it be said diplomacy amounts to more than horse-trading.
French President Emmanuel Macron went out of his way to win the heart of the Chinese leader on the first day of his state visit on Monday, offering him a horse of the elite French Republican Guard.
Macron is on a three-day tour of China starting with a stop in Xian, an eastern departure point of the ancient Silk Road where he visited the Terracotta Army with his wife Brigitte and will talk of past and future Sino-French relations.
An adept of soft diplomacy and symbols, Macron picked an 8-year old brown gelding named Vesuvius from the presidential cavalry corps and braved stringent Chinese quarantine checks to offer it to President Xi Jinping.
The choice of the gift, an ""unprecedented diplomatic gesture"" according to the French presidency, was made after the Chinese president expressed his fascination for the 104 horsemen who escorted him during his last visit to Paris in 2014.
It is the first time France has offered one of the elite cavalry corps' horses and is also a response to China's ""panda diplomacy"", after Macron's wife Brigitte became the godmother of a Chinese panda lent by Beijing to a zoo near Paris.
""It mattered a lot for the president, even if it was very complicated to import a horse for sanitary reasons. It's a symbol of French excellence,"" an Elysee official said.
Since his election last May, France's youngest leader since Napoleon has shown his willingness to use symbols and history to win over his global counterparts.
Macron flattered Russian President Vladimir Putin in May with a meeting at the sumptuous palace of France's former monarchy, built in Versailles by Louis XIV - the ""Sun King"" - to symbolize absolute power. 
He also invited U.S. President Donald Trump to watch a military parade on the grandest avenue of Paris on Bastille Day last July to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War One. 
Trump later said Macron was doing a ""terrific job"".
In Xian, Macron decided at the last minute to visit the Wild Goose Pagoda, a virtually unknown landmark in the West compared with the terracotta soldiers but well-known by Chinese people as a historic site for Buddhism.

The 40-year old French president is keen to gain more access for French companies to often protected Chinese markets and is traveling with a delegation of about 50 businessmen.

The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which runs the world's largest biometric identity card scheme called ""Aadhaar"", started investigating a report last week by The Tribune newspaper which said access to the identity database of more than 1 billion citizens was being sold for just 500 rupees, or $8, on social media.
UIDAI on Sunday said four people were named in its complaint to police in New Delhi to investigate the incident, including the reporter, and also her newspaper, which is based in the north Indian city of Chandigarh. 
The Editors Guild of India condemned UIDAI's action, saying it was designed to ""browbeat a journalist."" 
""It is unfair, unjustified and a direct attack on the freedom of the press,"" the Guild said in a statement on Sunday.
The UIDAI said in a statement on Sunday that it respects freedom of press, adding that it was duty bound to name everyone involved in the incident, including the reporter.
""It does not mean that those who are named in the report are necessarily guilty,"" the authority said. 
The Tribune newspaper said it regretted the decision of the authorities.
India last year slipped three places to 136th in the World Press Freedom Index of 180 nations, compiled by Reporters Without Borders.
Journalists in India have increasingly become targets of online smear campaigns, with prosecutorial actions being used to gag journalists who are overly critical of the government, the group said.
The Tribune newspaper last week reported that it was able to buy login credentials to the government's Aadhaar database, allowing it to acquire information such as the names, telephone numbers and home addresses of millions of people.
The alleged breach is the latest in the Aadhaar program which is facing increasing scrutiny over privacy concerns. 
After the report was published, the UIDAI said the ""case appears to be an instance of misuse.""

The Aadhaar scheme was introduced in 2009 to streamline welfare payments and reduce wastage in public spending. Since then, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been keen to mandate the use of Aadhaar for everything from filing income taxes to the registration of mobile phone numbers and booking railway tickets.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' vice president has joined a chorus of opposition to a possible cancellation of mid-term elections and extensions to terms in office, including that of the president, amid a renewed push for a shift to federalism.
President Rodrigo Duterte is keen to follow through on his election campaign promise to introduce federalism, saying it would be more equitable for Filipinos and would bring peace and development, especially in the country's restive south.
House Speaker and Duterte ally Pantaleon Alvarez has said it was possible May 2019 mid-term elections would be canceled if proposed constitutional amendments, to introduce federalism, pass a plebiscite this year.
But the no-election scenario has not sat well among Duterte's critics, who also expressed concern that changing the constitution could see him prolong his stay in power beyond the end of his term in 2022. Philippine presidents are allowed to serve one term only, lasting six years.
Vice President Leni Robredo, who was not Duterte's running mate, comes from an opposition party and has clashed with him on numerous occasions, said it was ""self-serving"" if moves were made to extend terms of incumbent executives.
""We are very much against this no-election proposal because holding elections sums up democracy,"" she said during her weekly radio program on Sunday.
""This is the only way for ordinary Filipinos to participate in the process of choosing who should lead them.""
Filipinos are due to elect 12 senators, about 300 congressmen and thousands of local government officials in next year's elections.
Speaker Alvarez said the house planned to convene as a constituent assembly early this year to tackle constitutional amendments, including the shift to federalism. 
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte has no intention to prolong his stay in power and is even willing to cut short his term.
""He's willing to let go because he's not keen really on staying (longer) as president. That's the truth,"" Roque told CNN Philippines on Monday.
But lawyer Christian Monsod, one of those who helped design the 1987 Constitution, questioned motives of the pro-Duterte camp in Congress.
""Is it really necessary to change the constitution?,"" he told news channel ANC.

""My bet is it would be amended, revised to suit the interests of the clans and dynasties in Congress.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Flooding from a water main break forced the temporary suspension of some flights at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Sunday, adding to the misery of travelers after a winter storm canceled or delayed hundreds of flights in recent days.
Water poured from the ceiling onto a check-in counter and covered large areas of the floor of Terminal 4, video on CNN showed. The disruption occurred while the U.S. Northeast continued to endure bone-chilling weather with the New York temperature at 17 degrees Fahrenheit (-8 Celsius).
International flights to Terminal 4 were temporarily suspended and passengers who had already arrived there were diverted to other terminals, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport.
The Port Authority said the water pipe break appears to be weather related. Flights later resumed but with delays, it said.
""What happened at JFK Airport is unacceptable, and travelers expect and deserve better,"" Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton said in a statement.
The authority said a water pipe that feeds the terminal’s sprinkler system broke, which caused flooding and a led to a temporary power cut in some areas as a safety measure.
The airport on Twitter advised travelers to check with their airlines before arriving.
There were about 3 inches (7.5 cm) of water inside the west end of Terminal 4, Scott Ladd, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said in an email.
The flooding hit just as the airport was crawling back to normal after a winter storm labeled a ""bomb cyclone"" forced the airport to close on Thursday.
When operations resumed on Friday, the backlog led to hundreds more delays or cancellations, crowding the terminals with stranded passengers.
More than 500 flights into or out of JFK were canceled and nearly 1,400 delayed from Friday morning to Sunday afternoon, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.
The extreme cold and recovery from Thursday's snow storm created a ""cascading series of issues for the airlines and terminal operators,"" the Port Authority said.

Equipment froze and baggage handling was delayed, which was compounded by staff shortages and heavier than normal passenger loads, the Port Authority said. The backlog left passengers stuck on planes for long stretches while waiting for other aircraft to get in and out of gates.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's rightist parties agreed on Sunday to the outlines of a joint manifesto for the country's March national election, including pledges to slash taxes, crack down on migrants and reverse planned increases to the retirement age.
Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, and its two allies, the far-right Northern League and Brothers of Italy, look set to win the March 4 vote, but are expected to fall short of an absolute majority.
The leaders of the three groups, who have an often testy relationship, gathered on Sunday for their first campaign strategy meeting, putting out a brief statement to highlight their shared policy priorities.
""Less taxes, less bureaucracy, less binds from Europe, more help for those who need it, more security for everyone,"" said the statement, released after four hours of talks in one of Berlusconi's luxury villas.
One of their main early goals if they win power would be to eliminate the ""damaging effects"" of 2011 legislation, named after then-Welfare Minister Elsa Fornero, which called for staggered increases in the retirement age.
Italy still spends more than 16 percent of its gross domestic product on state pensions, the second highest percentage in Europe after Greece. Economists warn that undoing the law would cost billions of euros and alarm financial markets.
But the law is highly unpopular with Italians and the Northern League, led by Matteo Salvini, has made its repeal its number one priority. ""Cancelling the Fornero Law (is) in the center-right program. Mission accomplished,"" Salvini wrote on Twitter on Sunday.
He also said that the three parties had agreed to expel all illegal migrants and ""take control"" of the country's borders, which are currently covered by the EU free-travel Schengen zone.
Sunday's statement made no reference to another League proposal - exiting the euro currency - but did commit the conservative bloc to introducing an unspecified flat tax.
The Northern League has called for a 15 percent flat tax, while Berlusconi has proposed a flat rate of between 20 and 25 percent. Income tax bands currently run from 23 to 43 percent.
The bloc has given no indication of how it intends to pay for its program, saying only that by lowering the tax rate, more people will pay up, raising the overall tax take.
Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told Corriere della Sera newspaper on Sunday that the proposed flat tax was ""not sustainable"".
With the election less than two months away, all Italian parties are looking to win votes with eye-catching ideas.

The exchange of gunfire took place in the farming community of La Concepcion, just south of Acapulco, after elements of the community police detailed a young man for disorderly conduct during town festivities early Sunday morning.
Eight local residents were killed in that exchange.
After Army soldiers and state police later moved into the town, three members of the community police were shot dead after resisting them, Roberto Alvarez, a state security official, told reporters.
Another 30 members of the local police, which had been authorized by state officials to operate in the small town, were arrested in the operation. 
Acapulco is the biggest city in the southern state of Guerrero, one of Mexico's most lawless and a center of opium poppy production.
Violence in the state has also been fed by turf wars over the distribution of drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine.
The beach resort is one of Mexico's most famous and for decades served as a playground for Hollywood stars. 
In recent years, however, Acapulco has been roiled by vicious gang warfare and is now ranked one of the most murderous cities in the world.

Trond Giske, 51, who held several cabinet posts in Labour governments, has apologized for what he said was unsuitable behavior, but has rejected the most severe allegations as false and unfounded.
Few details of the allegation have been made public, but party leader Jonas Gahr Stoere said last month several women had accused his deputy of ""unwanted encounters of a sexual nature"".
Giske, who has been suspended from his post since Jan. 1, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that he had decided to step down as deputy leader, and that he would also resign his post as Labour's chief spokesman on economic policy if requested by the party.
""The main reason I'm doing this, is that it's impossible for me and my family to withstand the pressure we've been under in recent weeks,"" he said, while adding he looked forward to present his own version of the cases.
Gahr Stoere said in a statement he had advised Giske, one of two deputy leaders of the party, to resign. Giske, who had been seen as a contender to lead the party in the future, remains a member of Norway's parliament.
The next parliamentary election is not due until 2021.
A number of figures from politics, corporate life and entertainment in several countries have quit or been fired in recent weeks as women have come forward with accusations of abuse and harassment.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Russian government has launched a sophisticated campaign to influence Mexico's 2018 presidential election and stir up division, a senior White House official said in a video clip published by Mexican newspaper Reforma.
U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said in a speech last month to the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation that there was already evidence of Russian meddling in Mexican elections set for July.
""We've seen that this is really a sophisticated effort to polarize democratic societies and pit communities within those societies against each other,"" said McMaster in a previously unreported video clip from Dec. 15 that was posted on Twitter by a reporter with Mexican daily newspaper Reforma on Saturday.
""You've seen, actually, initial signs of it in the Mexican presidential campaign already,"" said McMaster, a former Army general. He did not elaborate in the clip on how Russia was seeking to influence the election.
Reforma published a story on Saturday on the comments, which have since been shared many times on social media.
President Donald Trump's senior national security aide added in the clip that the U.S. government was concerned by Russia's use of advanced cyber tools to push propaganda and disinformation.
A request for comment sent to McMaster's office at the White House and a request for comment from the Russian government in Moscow were not immediately returned on Sunday.
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied accusations by U.S. intelligence officials and others of interfering in foreign elections.
In July, Mexico will elect a new president to succeed Enrique Pena Nieto, who is barred by law from seeking a second six-year term. Congressional seats plus some governors' races will also be up for grabs.
According to opinion polls, the frontrunner in the presidential contest is the leftist former mayor of Mexico City, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is running on an anti-corruption platform. 
Lopez Obrador, a two-time runner-up for the presidency and a divisive figure in Mexican politics for over a decade, is seen by some analysts as the Kremlin's favorite, given the positive coverage he has received from government-funded media outlets like Sputnik and Russia Today.
Both China and Russia are taking an increasing interest in Latin America as the United States, under Trump, has adopted a more protectionist stance and the future of the North America Free Trade Agreement looks uncertain.
Lopez Obrador has been a fierce critic of Pena Nieto's sweeping energy overhaul, which was favored by U.S. officials and oil companies. He has said he would seek friendly relations with the U.S. government but would demand respect.
In 2016, Russia Today's Spanish-language YouTube channel began running a weekly video blog entitled ""The Battle for Mexico,"" hosted by a prominent supporter of Lopez Obrador, according to David Salvo at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, who has written about Russian attempts to influence politics in Latin America.
Pena Nieto's office and the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McMaster's statement.
Some Mexican political commentators said that there was little reason yet to fear Russian involvement in the election. 
""The point is that Washington hasn't provided any solid proof for this,"" said Marco Cancino, head of Mexico City-based consultancy Inteligencia Publica.

""So far, it's just speculation.""

One of the boats sank and the other was badly overcrowded, coastguard officials said.
Survivors said that several dozen migrants were unaccounted for and were feared to have drowned. 
The boats were at sea near Garabulli, where departures have become more common since local armed groups began preventing boats from leaving from the coast to the west of Tripoli last summer.
Slightly fewer than half as many migrants reached Europe by sea in 2017 than 2016, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), largely because of a drop in crossings between Libya and Italy. 
The IOM said that nearly 120,000 migrants docked in Italy over the course of last year, out of a total of more than 171,500 who arrived in Europe by sea, mostly fleeing war in the Middle East and poverty in Africa.

The U.S. Northeast will endure at least one more day of sub-freezing temperatures before the arrival of a thaw that could help residents in some areas of New England recover from a foot (30 cm) or more of snow dumped by Friday's blizzard.
Much of the central part of the country was due for snow, ice and rain on Sunday, forecasters said. 
Temperatures are finally expected to climb above freezing on Monday.
""A warm-up is in store for next week,"" the U.S. National Weather Service said, adding that temperatures would return to seasonal norms or warmer. 
Boston and New York awakened on Sunday morning to Fahrenheit temperatures in the single digits. Washington and Chicago were slightly warmer but still well below freezing. 
In the central United States, a wintry mix was seen developing over eastern Kansas and spreading eastward across southern Iowa, Missouri, Illinois and far western Indiana on Sunday, AccuWeather said in a forecast. The Tennessee and Ohio valleys could expect similar conditions into Sunday night.
The snow and cold have brought parts of the Northeast to a standstill and were blamed for at least 18 deaths over the past several days.
New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport closed from Thursday to Friday morning when snow created white-out conditions, and on Saturday set an all-time low for Jan. 6 at 8 F (minus 13 Celsius), the U.S. Weather Prediction Center said.
The East Coast's first snowstorm of 2018 was energized by a rapid drop in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a bomb cyclone. 
The phenomenon gave rise to gusts of more than 70 miles (113 km) per hour and produced snowfall totals of 22 inches (56 cm) in parts of Maine and 17 inches (43 cm) in parts of Massachusetts, the weather service said.

The cold snap dropped snow into sub-tropical Florida, where numerous people posted social media pictures of iguanas that had fallen from trees in recent days. Zoologists warned people not to assume they were dead as the cold-blooded reptiles were capable of springing back to life after warming up.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the explosion targeted the headquarters of a minor rebel faction in Idlib. 
The nature of the attack was not immediately clear. The monitor said there were conflicting accounts, attributing the explosion that shook the Thalatheen district of the city to either a car bomb or a drone attack.
Ambulances were deployed to the explosion site and rescue teams were continuing efforts to recover bodies and the injured from the rubble of the targeted building and neighboring houses, the monitor added.
The majority of the deaths were fighters from the rebel group, in addition to seven civilians, with several people still unaccounted for, it said.
Idlib province is a stronghold of rebels in Syria and is situated on the border with Turkey, one of the main backers of rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad.
The Syrian army and its allies launched an offensive in October to recapture the provinces of Idlib and Hama, and it has since been making swift advances.
The main rebel force in Idlib is Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria previously called Nusra Front.
The Syrian army lost Idlib to insurgents when the provincial capital fell in 2015. It became the only province fully under opposition control.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Protests over rising bread prices broke out across Sudan on Sunday, leading to the death of a student and the arrest of a prominent opposition leader as authorities confiscated newspapers and looked to clamp down on growing unrest.
The demonstrations followed a similar protest in the southeastern city of Sennar on Saturday after bread prices doubled following the government's announcement late last month that it was eliminating subsidies in its 2018 budget.
In the southeastern city of al-Damazin, police fired tear gas on Sunday as about 400 demonstrators chanted ""No, no to price rises!"" and some burned tyres, a local resident told Reuters. 
The removal of subsidies is part of austerity measures as the country struggles in the face of inflation running at about 25 percent and an acute shortage of hard currency that has sapped import activity.
Austerity measures in Sudan have sparked sporadic public protests in the past few years. Amnesty International says that up to 185 people may have been killed in 2013 when thousands took to the streets in demonstrations against fuel price increases.
Protests have since been much smaller and the main opposition parties have called for peaceful demonstrations against the bread price rises. 
On Sunday protests spread to downtown Khartoum and three cities to the south; the southwestern cities of Nyala and Geneina as well as al-Damazin, residents in these areas told Reuters.
A high school student was killed and six others wounded in Geneina during the protests, a statement from the Geneina governor said. It did not give a reason for the death but said the incident would be investigated.
Authorities arrested Omar Al-Dageir, the president of one of the country's largest opposition groups, the Sudanese Congress Party, members of the party said. 
Authorities also blocked the sale of six daily newspapers carrying critical coverage of the subsidy cut and price rises, editors of the papers told Reuters.
Minister of State for the Interior Ministry, Babkar Daqna, denied demonstrations were in response to price rises and said that destructive protesters will be ""dealt with forcefully"" state news agency SUNA reported. 
Sudan has begun a series of economic reforms in line with International Monetary Fund recommendations to try to bolster the economy, months after a U.S. decision to lift sanctions raised hopes that badly needed investment may return.
This month Sudan devalued its pound currency to 18 per U.S. dollar, more than double its previous peg of 6.7 pounds to the dollar. The rate on the black market hit about 29 pounds to the dollar last week.

Athens has blocked the ex-Yugoslav republic's attempts to join NATO and objects to its EU membership bid because it says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over Greece's own northerly region of that name.
""I believe that it is possible to reach an agreement by the end of the first half of 2018"", Zoran Zaev said in an interview with Greek Alpha TV without giving more details.
Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias said on Thursday that his country wants to settle a decades-old row this year over the name of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, responding to Zaev's call in November.
Kotzias will meet Deputy Prime Minister of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bujar Osmani, in Athens on Tuesday to discuss the issue.
The small republic of about 2 million people declared independence in 1991, avoiding the violence that accompanied much of the breakup of Yugoslavia.
But Greece is withholding support for Macedonia's further integration into international bodies, including NATO, until it agrees to change its name.
""Our future is within EU and Nato"", Zaev added.

Athens has only agreed that the country can be referred to in international venues as the ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"", as an interim measure until the dispute is resolved.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior aide to U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday assailed a new book rattling the White House, called his boss a genius and launched an attack on news coverage before a TV anchor urged him to calm down and cut off their interview. 
Senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told Jake Tapper on CNN'S ""State of the Union"" that the book ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House"" by journalist Michael Wolff was a ""grotesque work of fiction.""
Miller accused CNN of ""anti-Trump hysterical coverage"" following the Friday release of the book, which portrays Trump, a former reality TV start who took office nearly a year ago, as mentally unstable and unfit for the demands of his job.
""The reality is that the president is a political genius,"" Miller said and accused Tapper of being ""condescending"" and ""snide.""
""I have no idea why you're attacking me,"" Tapper responded, saying Miller was being ""obsequious"" and asking him to ""calm down"" before cutting the interview short.
""I think we have wasted enough of my viewers' time,"" Tapper said, ending the interview.
The White House has been on the defensive since excerpts of the book were published last week with the president and his aides scrambling to discredit both its portrayal of Trump and the author's methods.
Its publication prompted Trump to post on Twitter on Saturday that he is a ""very stable genius."" The president attacked the book again on Sunday.
Wolff was granted unusually wide access to the White House during much of Trump's first year at the behest of former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who advised the president during his first months in office and during his presidential campaign.
Wolff has said the book was based on White House access, conversations with Trump and interviews with senior staffers, including Bannon. 
""It is tragic and unfortunate that Steve would make these grotesque comments,"" Miller said on CNN.
Wolff appeared on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday and defended his portrayal of Trump in the book, along with his reporting methods.

CAMP DAVID, Md. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would ""absolutely"" be willing to talk on the phone to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and that he hopes a positive development results from talks between North Korea and South Korea.
North Korea agreed on Friday to hold official talks with South Korea next week, the first in more than two years, hours after Washington and Seoul delayed a military exercise amid a standoff over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs.
Trump, answering questions from reporters at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, expressed a willingness to talk to Kim but not without preconditions.
""Absolutely, I would do that,"" Trump said. ""I have no problem with that at all.""
Trump and Kim have exchanged insults ever since Trump took office, with Trump repeatedly calling Kim ""rocket man"" for testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Earlier this week Trump dismissed Kim's taunt that the North Korean leader has a nuclear button on his desk, saying he has a bigger button.
The talks between North Korea and South Korea are expected to cover the Winter Olympics, to be held in South Korea next month, and inter-Korean relations.
Trump suggested the talks might lead to an easing of tensions and took credit for the diplomatic breakthrough, saying it was a result of his steady pressure.
""Look, right now they're talking Olympics. It's a start, it's big start. If I weren't involved they wouldn't be talking at all right now,"" he said.
Kim ""knows I'm not messing around. I'm not messing around. Not even a little bit, not even one percent. He understands that,"" said Trump.
""If something can come out of those talks, that would be a great thing for all of humanity, that would be a great thing for the world,"" he said.
On Sunday, North Korea announced a list of five officials who will represent Pyongyang, a day after South Korea confirmed its representatives, the South's unification ministry said.

The North's delegation will be led by Ri Son Gwon, head of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland that is usually tasked with dealing with South Korean affairs.

Journalists Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained on Dec. 12. They had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.
The two are due to appear in court on Wednesday. It will be their second appearance in court and the prosecutor could request that charges are filed against them.
""We miss him and want him to be free,"" said Thant Zin Soe, among a group of about a dozen of Wa Lone's friends who knelt beneath the Sule Pagoda's towering golden stupa, hands clasped before then, to chant a special Buddhist mantra.

Questions have arisen over where the loyalty of the General People's Congress (GPC) fighters lay after Saleh was killed in a roadside attack after switching sides, abandoning the Houthis in favor of a Saudi-led coalition.
Sunday's announcement condemned the Saudi ""aggression"" and said the party would keep resisting, but did not mention the Houthis. It said Sadeq Amin Abou Rass, a former agriculture minister, had succeeded Saleh.
Saleh's exiled son Ahmed Ali Saleh, had vowed to lead a campaign against the Houthi movement after his was killed, but the statement on Sunday did not mention his name either.
Yemen’s war, pitting the Houthis who control the capital Sanaa against the Saudi-led military alliance backing a different government based in the south, has resulted in what the United Nations calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. 
""What happened (Saleh's killing) will not prompt us to make peace with the aggressors against the sovereignty, the dignity and the freedom of our great Yemeni people,"" the statement said.
It also called for releasing all the party's prisoners, including Saleh's family members and employees of his TV channel Yemen al-Yawm, detained by the Houthis - held after Saleh switched sides. 
The statement said the party remained open to all Yemeni factions and national reconciliation. 
The Saudi-led coalition has called on party members to join the internationally recognized government and offered an amnesty to its fighters. 

For months, the Houthis have retaliated with attacks on Saudi Arabia from its mountainous strongholds in northern Yemen and has launched around a dozen ballistic missiles at the kingdom, all of which were intercepted.

Shafik was seen as the most serious potential challenger to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in an election due early in the year, though Sisi has yet to officially announce his candidacy.
Shafik returned to Egypt from the United Arab Emirates in December after announcing his intention to run, setting off a firestorm of criticism from state-aligned media and speculation that he was being held by authorities in a Cairo hotel.
The 76-year-old, an ex-air force commander and former aviation minister, narrowly lost a presidential election to Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Mursi in 2012 before fleeing for the United Arab Emirates, where he has lived since.
Shafik said on Sunday that his time back in Egypt has led him to reconsider the decision.
""My absence of more than five years perhaps distanced me from being able to very closely follow what is going on in our nation in terms of developments and achievements despite the difficulty of the conditions,"" the statement said.

""I have seen that I will not be the ideal person to lead the state's affairs during the coming period. Thus I have decided not to run in the upcoming 2018 presidential elections.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin trod carefully on Sunday around a threatened U.S. aid cut to Palestinians, stopping short of backing a funding halt as he repeated calls for a U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees to be dismantled.
Netanyahu's public comments appeared to reflect a desire to show support for a major ally, but also concern that choking off funds would deepen Palestinian hardship and could put Israel and militants on a course for war.
With Palestinians seething over U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition last month of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, he threatened on Tuesday to withhold aid money, accusing them of being ""no longer willing to talk peace"".
On Friday, in a report denied by a State Department official, the Axios news site said Washington had frozen $125 million in funding for UNRWA. The U.N. agency, founded in 1949 to aid Palestinian refugees, is a main provider of educational and health services in the Gaza Strip.
Netanyahu said UNRWA was ""an organization that perpetuates the Palestinian problem.""
""It also enshrines the narrative of the so-called 'right of return'. Therefore, UNRWA should pass from the world,"" he told a weekly cabinet meeting.
Netanyahu made almost identical comments about dismantling UNRWA in June - a message he said at the time he had conveyed to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
Praising Trump's ""critical approach"" on the aid issue, Netanyahu steered clear of advocating a suspension of funding for the Palestinians. He said U.N. money for them should be transferred gradually to its global refugee agency UNHCR ""with clear criteria for supporting genuine refugees and not fictitious ones, as is happening today under UNRWA.""
Chris Gunness, an UNRWA spokesman, said the refugee crisis was being perpetuated by ""failure of the parties to deal with the issue...""
""UNRWA is mandated by the General Assembly to continue with its services until a just and lasting solution is found for the Palestine refugees,"" Gunness said in a statement.
Palestinian officials have said Trump's declaration on Jerusalem, overturning decades of U.S. policy, meant he could not serve as an honest broker in peace negotiations that Washington has been trying to revive, and they condemned his remarks on a funding halt as blackmail.
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The United States is the largest donor to UNRWA, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to the organization's website. Gunness said the agency had not been ""informed directly of a formal decision either way by the U.S. administration"" on cuts.

In addition to its services in Gaza, UNRWA operates in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

During a three-day killing spree in January 2015, gunmen killed reporters and illustrators at satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, police officers and shoppers at a Jewish supermarket. 
Sunday's commemoration started at the former premises of Charlie Hebdo, where two brothers armed with assault rifles shot and killed 11, including most of the notoriously irreverent publication's cartoonists and writers.

Homage was then paid at the nearby site where a policeman was shot dead at point-blank range by one of the gunmen.

The Charlie Hebdo attack was carried out by brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, who died in a police assault two days later.

Police declined to confirm that report, for which the newspaper named no sources.
""There is obviously something that has exploded strongly ...But we will have to wait for the technical investigation,"" the spokesman said, adding that a murder investigation had been launched.
There was no reason to believe the event was linked to terrorism, he said.
A second person was injured in the explosion, which occurred at the Varby Gard station in the south of the city. It and an adjacent square were closed while police carried out checks.

The winning numbers drawn were 12, 29, 30, 33, 61 and Powerball 26.
The identity of the winner or winners was not immediately released.
If the winner selects the lump-sum option, the onetime payout would total an estimated $358 million, before taxes.
The odds of a single ticket hitting all six numbers in the Powerball are 292 million to 1, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.
Saturday's winning Powerball ticket is the second large lottery grand prize drawn in as many days.
On Friday, one winning Mega Millions ticket, worth an estimated $450 million, was sold in Florida. That lump-sum payout is $281.[L1N1P106E]
With no jackpot winning tickets sold in either game since October, combined the two lottery grand prizes topped $1 billion, the third-largest total in the history of the games.
The largest Powerball jackpot was a $1.6-billion payout split among winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. The largest Mega Millions jackpot of $656 million was won in 2012.

Powerball tickets are sold in 44 states, and Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's Revolutionary Guards said on Sunday the country's people and security forces had put an end to unrest fomented by foreign enemies, as parliament and security officials met to discuss the boldest challenge to the clerical establishment since 2009.
There has been more than a week of unrest in Iran in which 22 people have died and more than 1,000 arrested, according to Iranian officials. The protests spread to more than 80 cities and rural towns as thousands of young and working-class Iranians expressed their anger at graft, unemployment and a deepening gap between rich and poor. 
Residents contacted by Reuters in various cities have said the protests had subsided after the government intensified a crackdown by dispatching Revolutionary Guards forces to several provinces.
""Iran's revolutionary people along with tens of thousands of Basij forces, police and the Intelligence Ministry have broken down the chain (of unrest),"" the Guards said in a statement on their Sepahnews website. The Guards said the unrest had been ""created ... by the United States, Britain, the Zionist regime (Israel), Saudi Arabia, the hypocrites (Mujahideen) and monarchists."" 
Parliament met on Sunday to discuss the week of unrest with the ministers of interior and intelligence, Iran's police chief and the deputy commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards, state television said.
Late on Saturday, videos on social media showed a heavy police presence in cities, including Khorramabad in southwestern Iran where on Wednesday evening social media posts showed protesters throwing stones at riot police.
As protests have ebbed, the government has lifted restrictions it imposed on Instagram, one of the social media tools used to mobilize protesters. But access to a more widely used messaging app, Telegram, was still blocked, suggesting authorities remained uneasy about the possibility of further protests.
Parliament spokesman Behrouz Nemati said MPs and security officials had decided that Telegram restrictions should be lifted only after the app committed to ban ""hostile, anti-Iranian channels that promote unrest"", state television reported.
Telegram, with 40 million users in Iran, in late December shut down a channel that Iran had accused of encouraging violence, but declined to block other channels and this prompted Tehran to block access to the app.
Many Iranians access Telegram by using virtual private networks (VPNs) and other tools to bypass government filtering of the Internet, residents say. 
Thousands of government supporters have staged rallies in a backlash against the anti-government protests which are the biggest since widespread unrest in 2009 over alleged election fraud.
State television showed live pictures of rallies in several cities, including central Shahr-e Kord where hundreds, many clutching umbrellas, had gathered despite heavy snowfall.
""Death to America"", ""Death to Israel"", ""Death to Britain"" ""Death to seditionists"", the demonstrators chanted.
The anti-government protests have attracted largely young people and workers as well as members of the educated middle-class that formed the backbone of a pro-reform revolt almost a decade ago. 
A police spokesman said most of those arrested were ""duped"" into joining the unrest and had been freed on bail, the state news agency IRNA reported. ""But, the leaders of the unrest are held by the judiciary in prison.""
CONCERNS ABOUT STUDENT ARRESTS 
Several parliament members and university officials have expressed concern over the fate of students arrested during the protests. Tehran University Vice-President Majid Sarsangi has said the university had set up a committee to track them.
Parliament spokesman Nemati said MPs had asked security officials for a report about the detained students during Sunday's closed session. 
""One of the issues addressed by deputies and the parliament speaker was that of detained students, and it was decided that the Intelligence Ministry would vigorously pursue this and submit a report by next week,"" said Nemati, quoted by IRNA.
A member of parliament said earlier about 90 students were detained, 10 of whom were still not accounted for. 
Iran has several parallel security bodies and residents say arrests are often not immediately announced.
Videos on social media in the past few days showed relatives of detainees gathering outside prisons seeking information about the fate of their loved ones.

The Revolutionary Guards and their affiliated Basij militia suppressed unrest in 2009, in which dozens of pro-reform Iranians were killed.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2018 07:57AM ET</span>",South Africa's parliament to review rules on removing president,"By Joe Brock
JOHANNESBURG, (Reuters) - South Africa’s parliament said on Sunday it would review its rules relating to removing the country's president, after the constitutional court said on Dec. 29 that lawmakers had previously failed to hold President Jacob Zuma to account.
The court ruling has piled pressure on Zuma and his allies as his opponents within the ruling African National Congress (ANC) are pushing for him to be removed as head of state before his term ends in 2019, when national elections will be held.
Zuma is in a weakened position after Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was elected leader of the ANC last month, narrowly beating Zuma's ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
There is widespread local media speculation that Ramaphosa's faction in the ANC will push for Zuma to be removed as the country's president in the coming weeks, although Zuma still has allies at the top layer of the party.
A parliamentary subcommittee will meet this week to discuss a draft procedure on the section of the constitution relating to the removal of a president and the draft will then be debated in the house, the National Assembly said in a statement.
The national assembly's subcommittee will review a draft procedure drawn up in April 2016 that was never finalised and a 2015 study of impeachment proceedings of seven other parliaments around the world, the statement said.
Zuma, 75, has survived several no confidence votes in parliament over recent years, mostly relating to a string of corruption allegations. He denies any wrongdoing.
The constitutional court gave parliament six months to put in place a mechanism for removing a president after it said lawmakers failed to hold Zuma to account for a scandal relating to state-funded upgrades to his home. 

The constitutional court ruled in 2016 that Zuma pay back some of the roughly $15 million in state money spent on 'security upgrades' on his sprawling country compound, which included a cattle pen, chicken run and a swimming pool.

Forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad have stepped up the offensive in the southern province of Idlib in recent days, advancing toward the Abu al-Duhur airport, which rebels captured from the president's troops in September 2015.
The Syrian army and its allies ""have gained control over the town of Sinjar,"" 14 kms (nine miles) from Abu al-Duhur, and three villages to the west, the media unit run by Assad ally Hezbollah reported.
Supported by Iran-backed militias and Russian air power, Assad's forces have since late October taken back rebel-held territory in Idlib and the northeastern province of Hama.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday the army had taken more than 95 villages in Hama and Idlib since Oct. 22, including around 60 in Idlib alone during the past 14 days.
""Battles have shifted now to the northwest of Sinjar after the Syrian army and its allies have controlled the town,"" the Britain-based monitor reported.
The main rebel force in Idlib is Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria previously called Nusra Front.
The Syrian army lost Idlib, which borders Turkey, to insurgents when the provincial capital fell in 2015. It became the only province fully under opposition control.
The largest population gathering is in Eastern Idlib, the monitor said, expressing fears from further intensive civilian displacement in the coming few days due to the ongoing fighting.
Tens of thousands of rebels and civilians took refuge in Idlib after abandoning their homes in other parts of western Syria that the government and its foreign allies have retaken.
The fighting and air strikes have forced more than 60,000 people to leave their homes since Nov. 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

The United Nations said the civilians newly displaced by the fighting in Idlib were in a ""dire"" situation.

MILAN (Reuters) - A coalition between Italy's main left- and right-wing parties cannot be ruled out if no clear winner emerges from the upcoming general election, the country's economy minister was quoted on Sunday as saying.
Italy will vote on March 4 in an election expected to produce a hung parliament, feeding instability in a country made vulnerable by the world's third-largest public debt and weak growth potential. 
In an interview with Sunday's Corriere della Sera, Pier Carlo Padoan said he expected that none of the three main parties - the left-wing Partito Democratico (PD), right-wing Forza Italia (FI) and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement - would be able to govern alone.
While the center-right is seen winning most seats in March, opinion polls suggest it will not gain an absolute majority.
Asked if the PD and FI parties could form a government, Padoan said: ""In a context of high uncertainty nothing can be ruled out.
""Such uncertainty is already being perceived. Financial markets are rather nervous it seems to me: when parliament dissolved the (German-Italian 10-year bond yield) spread widened.""
Left and right parties in have supported each other in power previously.
Boosted in recent years by the European Central Bank's ultra-loose monetary policy, Italian government bonds are seen vulnerable to political risks as the ECB started scaling down its bond purchases.
Parties across the spectrum are pledging to voters that they will change or abolish European Union budget rules, cut taxes and spend more to boost the economy which is slowly picking up steam.
PD, the party of former prime minister Matteo Renzi, and FI, led by 81-year-old,four-times prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, hold the most moderate positions.
Asked about proposals to introduce a single income tax rate, Padoan said the 15 percent rates suggested by the regional and sometimes secessionist Northern League was not sustainable, while Berlusconi's 20 percent suggestion was ""less unsustainable.""
""I would explore a tax reform that would simplify the tax rates reducing them to one or, better, two. But we should avoid benefitting disproportionately higher income earners.""

Padoan, a former economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development who joined Renzi's government in 2014, said he would consider running for parliament at the next election if he were asked to do so.

Parts of highways connecting Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces were blocked. In northern Shanxi province, greenhouses for vegetables collapsed under the weight of snow, footage on state television showed on Sunday.
""More than 45,000 acres of fruit trees, tea farms as well as greenhouses for vegetable have been damaged by freezing rains and snow,"" the Ministry of Agriculture said, adding that wheat planting could be delayed due to the cold weather.
The city of Hefei, the capital of Anhui province, will give residents discounts on vegetables for seven days after prices increased, state radio said on Sunday, citing the city's pricing regulator.
State radio said prices of vegetables like cabbages and lettuce more than doubled in the past week in eastern Anhui province due to transport curbs and damage to crops.
China warned of a second wave of snow and sleet hitting northern, central and eastern parts on Friday after record snowfall paralyzed parts of the country in the most severe weather this winter.

224,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2018 06:19AM ET</span>",Cornered Merkel upbeat as starts government talks with center-left,"By Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday she was optimistic her conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) could agree to join forces as they embarked on five days of talks about reviving the 'grand coalition' that has governed Germany since 2013.
Persuading the SPD to team up with her is Merkel's best bet of forming a stable government in Europe's largest economy and extending her 12 years in office, after her attempt to form an alliance with two smaller parties failed last year.
Arriving at SPD headquarters for talks more than three months after a national election, Merkel said the parties had a lot of work to get through in the coming days but intended to tackle it quickly, adding: ""I think it can succeed.""
The SPD, which had said it would go into opposition after its worst election showing since 1933, reconsidered when Germany's president intervened.
But the centre-left party, among whose membership opposition to a 'grand coalition' re-run remains strong, has been playing hard-to-get.
A group called ""NoGroKo"", meaning ""no grand coalition"", has formed within its ranks to campaign against working with Merkel again, saying that would cost the SPD votes and make the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) the leading opposition party.
SPD leader Martin Schulz said that, while the outcome of the talks was unclear, his party would enter them constructively.
""We won't draw any red lines - rather we want to push through as much red politics as possible in Germany,"" Schulz said, referring to the party's color.
Schulz said five days should suffice to find out whether the parties had enough common ground to launch full-blown coalition talks. The SPD leadership is due to recommend on Friday whether or not to start talks, and it is then up to an SPD party congress on Jan. 21 to make a decision.
NOT SO GRAND?
A coalition between Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance - which lost ground to the AfD in September's ballot - and the SPD has governed Germany for eight of the last 12 years.
But it has tended to be viewed as a last resort by both politicians and voters as it leaves the opposition weak.
A poll for broadcaster ARD showed more than half of the electorate - 52 percent - are skeptical about reviving it, while 45 percent are in favor.
Not natural allies, the two camps are likely to clash on immigration, tax, healthcare and Europe - and expectations among other leading figures in the parties were mixed as the preliminary talks got under way.
Norbert Roemer, SPD head in the regional assembly of North Rhine-Westphalia, told the RND newspaper group no lawmakers in his state caucus favored a grand coalition - unlike five years ago - with past experience meaning they no longer trusted Merkel.
Volker Bouffier, a senior member of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), told Rheinische Post newspaper his party intended to form a grand coalition but that it could not come at any price.
Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's CDU - said he was going into the talks in ""high spirits"" and participants needed to come to an agreement.
The potential partners have agreed on a news blackout during the exploratory talks, which are due to finish on Thursday.
If they find enough common ground and the SPD gets backing from its members in a vote, the parties will proceed to full-blown coalition talks. The consensus among politicians and observers expect those would last until at least March.

But if the discussions fail, Germany could either face fresh elections or, for the first time in the post-war era, a minority government run by Merkel.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A tanker carrying Iranian oil and run by the country's top oil shipping operator was ablaze and spewing its cargo into the East China Sea on Sunday after colliding with a Chinese bulk ship, the Chinese government said.
The Sanchi tanker , registered in Panama, collided with the CF Crystal  about 160 nautical miles off the coast near Shanghai on Saturday, the Ministry of Transportation said in statement. 
The tanker's 32 crew members were missing.
It was sailing from Iran to South Korea, carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate, an ultra light crude. That is equivalent to just under 1 million barrels, worth about $60 million, based on global crude oil prices.
""Sanchi is floating and burning as of now,"" the ministry said. ""There is an oil slick and we are pushing forward with rescue efforts.""
It had sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to site by 9 a.m. (0100 GMT), it added. 
South Korea has also sent a ship and helicopter to help. A Korean Coast Guard official confirmed the tanker was still on fire at 1 p.m. (0500 GMT). He declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.
State media CCTV showed pictures of the tanker ablaze and billowing plumes of thick dark smoke.
The Chinese government gave no details of the size of the spill. The Foreign Ministry said in a separate statement the cause of the incident was under investigation. 
Reuters ship tracking data shows Sanchi was built in 2008 and was managed by the National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC). Its registered owner is Bright Shipping Ltd.
It was due to arrive at Daesan in South Korea from Kharg Island in Iran on Sunday, according to Reuters ship tracking.
The Sanchi tanker, leased by Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co Ltd [SMCHE.UL], had ""valid foreign insurance"", Iranian oil ministry spokesman Kasra Nouri told Iran's state television. 
Hanwha Total was not immediately available for comment.
Sanchi collided with CF Crystal, registered in Hong Kong, which was carrying 64,000 tonnes of grain from the United States to China's southern province of Guangdong, the government said. 
CF Crystal's 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, have been rescued. It was due to arrive on Jan. 10, according to Reuters ship tracking data.
CF Crystal, which was built in 2011, suffered ""non-critical"" damage, China's transport ministry said.
The incident marked the first major maritime incident involving an Iranian tanker since the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in January 2016.
There was a collision involving an NITC-operated supertanker in the Singapore Strait in August 2016, but there was no loss of life or pollution.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Malaysia's opposition alliance names 92-year old Mahathir as PM candidate,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's opposition coalition on Sunday named 92-year old former premier Mahathir Mohamad as its prime ministerial candidate for a general election that must be called by August.
With the country's most popular opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim in jail, Mahathir is seen as the biggest threat for Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is engulfed in a corruption scandal.
Mahathir, who earned a reputation during his 22-year tenure as prime minister of being a no-nonsense authoritarian with little time for dissenters promoting liberal values, stands to become the world's oldest leader if the opposition wins.
A victory could also potentially pave the way for former Mahathir foe Anwar to become the prime minister.
Mahathir and Anwar's wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail will be the Pakatan Harapan coalition's candidates for the premier and deputy prime ministerial posts respectively, secretary general Saifuddin Abdullah said at the alliance's convention. 
If the opposition wins, the component parties have agreed to immediately commence the legal processes to obtain a royal pardon for Anwar, Saifuddin said.
""...So that Anwar could immediately play a role in the federal government and subsequently be proposed as a candidate for the eighth prime minister,"" he said. 
The Mahathir-Anwar coalition and their endorsement of each other is a turnaround from their bitter feud that has shaped Malaysia's political landscape for nearly two decades. 
Anwar was once a protege of Mahathir, and the rising star of Malaysian politics, but they had a falling-out in the late 1990s. Soon afterwards, Anwar was jailed on charges of sodomy and graft, after being sacked as the deputy prime minister. He denied the charges, dismissing them as politically motivated.
Anwar later led an opposition alliance to stunning electoral gains in 2013. Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition lost the popular vote in that election, but managed to stay in power after winning a majority of the seats in parliament.
But Anwar was convicted and jailed again in 2013 for sodomizing a former aide, a charge he and his supporters describe as an attempt to end his career. 
The sodomy conviction disqualifies Anwar from political office and from contesting the next election. A royal pardon, however, would let him contest.
Opposition to Prime Minister Najib has brought Anwar and Mahathir back together, with their parties now working in the opposition coalition.
Najib has been embroiled in a corruption scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). In civil lawsuits, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged that about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB.

The fund has denied any wrongdoing and Najib, who founded 1MDB, has denied all allegations of corruption against him and was cleared of wrongdoing by Malaysia's attorney-general.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A shroud of bone-chilling arctic air covered the U.S. East Coast and Midwest on Saturday, creating dangerous conditions as tens of millions of people struggled to clean up from a blizzard that dumped deep, drifting snow in many areas earlier this week. 
Wind chill and freeze warnings stretched from New England to Ohio and Pennsylvania, while the National Weather Service warned of freezing rain in Missouri and areas to the northeast. 
In some of those places, exposed skin could freeze within 30 minutes, said meteorologist Dan Petersen of the National Weather Service's Maryland-based Weather Prediction Center.
At the Whoopie Pie Cafe in Bangor, Maine, business was slow because of the cold, cashier and waiter Liz Gallagher, 58, said by phone. ""Nobody goes out when it's really cold, at least I wouldn't,"" said the life-long Bangor resident.
The cold snap complicated efforts by crews to clear snow and ice from roadways after the blizzard, which clobbered the Northeast after sprinkling snow in areas as far south as Savannah, Georgia and Tallahassee, Florida.
In New England and the Middle Atlantic states, the storm forced hundreds of schools to close and commuter rail services to suspend or reduce service. 
Cold and snowy weather was blamed for at least 18 deaths in the past few days, including four in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas. 
""The magnitude of the cold and the area of coverage of the cold is really what's impressive to me,"" said meteorologist Ed Vallee, owner of Vallee Weather Consulting.
Killington, the famous Vermont ski resort, closed on Saturday even though snow conditions were excellent, saying wind chill on the slopes was at least minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 46 degrees Celsius).
""It's just too cold to put folks out there,"" the resort said on its website.
In neighboring New Hampshire, the ambient air temperature on Mount Washington plunged to -36 F (minus 38C), two degrees short of a record low for Jan. 6. But sustained winds of 99 miles per hour (159 km/h) and gusts of up to 112 mph (180 km/h) atop the 6,200-foot (1,990-metre) peak made it feel more like minus 92 F (minus 69 Celsius), the NWS said.
The brutal cold in parts of the East Coast and Midwest shows no sign of abating this weekend, but a thaw should begin on Monday, said meteorologist Bob Oravec of the Weather Prediction Center. Before then, conditions will probably worsen.
Overnight, more than 30 cities from New England to the mid-Atlantic states could experience record cold, Petersen said. New York and Boston are among the big cities where records could fall.
Among the coldest places in the country on Saturday afternoon were the small Minnesota towns of Cotton and Embarrass, where the mercury plummeted to minus 39F (minus 39C), the NWS said.
""The air hurt my face,"" Charlie Jessen, 25, an employee at the Superamerica gas station in Cotton, 36 miles (58 km) northwest of Duluth, said by phone.
Even so, temperatures for those hamlets in the northeastern corner of Minnesota fell short of a record low for the area, where sub-zero readings are not unusual in January. 
In the more populous Northeast, New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport set an all-time low for Jan. 6 at 8 F (minus 13C), Oravec said.
The airport had closed from Thursday to Friday morning when snow created white-out conditions. Some passengers endured more delays on Saturday after the wing of a China Southern plane clipped the tail of a Kuwait Airlines jet on the tarmac. 

The East Coast's first snowstorm of 2018 was energized by a rapid drop in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a ""bomb cyclone."" The phenomenon gave rise to gusts of more than 70 mph (113 km/h) and produced snowfall totals of 22 inches (56 cm) in parts of Maine and 17 inches (43 cm) in parts of Massachusetts, the NWS said.

YANGON (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslim insurgents said on Sunday they have no option but to fight what they called Myanmar state-sponsored terrorism to defend the Rohingya community, and they demanded that the Rohingya be consulted on all decisions affecting their future.
The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launched raids on the Myanmar security forces on Aug. 25, which sparked sweeping counter-insurgency operations in the Muslim-majority north of Rakhine State that led to widespread violence and arson and an exodus of some 650,000 Rohingya villagers to Bangladesh.
The United Nations condemned the Myanmar military campaign as ethnic cleansing. Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejected that. 
But since the August raids, the small insurgent group has launched few if any attacks until Friday, when its fighters ambushed a Myanmar military truck, wounding several members of the security forces.
""ARSA has ... no other option but to combat 'Burmese state-sponsored terrorism' against the Rohingya population for the purpose of defending, salvaging and protecting the Rohingya community,"" the group said in a statement signed by leader Ata Ullah and posted on Twitter.
""Rohingya people must be consulted in all decision-making that affects their humanitarian needs and political future.""
The ARSA claimed responsibility for the Friday ambush but gave no details of the clash.
A Myanmar government spokesman said the insurgents were trying to delay the repatriation of refugees from Bangladesh under a plan the two governments have been working on.
""ARSA aims to frighten those who are considering returning, to show the region doesn't have peace,"" Zaw Htay said.
Myanmar and Bangladesh have been discussing a plan to repatriate the refugees but more insecurity in Myanmar is likely to raise even more doubts about how quickly that might happen.
The refugees complain that they have not been consulted on the plan.
FIGHT TO THE END
Details of the repatriation plan have yet to be finalised and many questions remain, not only about security but also about the terms refugees will return under, and whether they will be able to go back to their homes or be resettled in camps.
Rohingya have for years been denied citizenship, freedom of movement and access to services such as healthcare. Myanmar regards them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. 
Zaw Htay rejected the ARSA call for the Rohingya to be consulted saying the government was already negotiating with leaders of both the Buddhist and Muslim communities.
""We will not accept terrorism and fight against them until the end,"" the spokesman said, adding that no one should offer any support to the group.
The ARSA dismisses any links to Islamist militant groups and says it is fighting to end the oppression of the Rohingya people. 
A military spokesman declined to make any immediate comment about the security situation in the north of Rakhine State.
The area is largely off-limits to reporters.
Serious communal violence between Rohingya and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists erupted in 2012 and sporadic unrest followed.
The violence that began in August and the refugee crisis it caused has drawn international condemnation and raised doubts about Myanmar's transition to democracy after nearly 50 years of military rule.

ARSA did not say where leader Ata Ullah was but Myanmar suspects the insurgents flee into Bangladesh then slip back into Myanmar to launch attacks.

Noor, a leader in the Jamiat-i Islami party and governor of the strategic province of Balkh, is defying Ghani, denouncing the ""weak, lazy and corrupt"" Kabul government in daily rallies with thousands of supporters and warning the government against trying to remove him by force.
The deadlock, which has alarmed Western embassies and sparked fears of civil violence, has highlighted a fractious political climate that threatens to undermine recent battlefield successes from the sharp increase in U.S. air strikes last year.
Noor accuses Ghani of trying to remove a potential rival and divide Jamiat ahead of a presidential election likely to be shaped by the ethnic faultlines that dominate Afghan politics, notably between Pashtuns and Persian-speaking Tajiks.
""This is about the 2019 presidential election,"" he told Reuters in an interview at his office in the provincial capital Mazar-i Sharif, where his portrait adorns streets and buildings across the city. ""They have no grassroots support among the people and they are afraid of public figures who do.""
Ghani has not explained an announcement last month that he had accepted a letter of resignation from Noor, signed earlier last year during negotiations over a possible national role for the governor who has ruled Balkh for more than a decade.
But Noor says the letter, which has not been made public, was conditional on steps that Ghani has not taken and has refused to go.
Ghani has not said anything publicly about the stand-off. His spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment.
Noor, a former commander in the anti-Soviet Mujahiddin considered one of the richest men in Afghanistan, has faced repeated accusations of corruption, which he denies. In 2015 Human Rights Watch said there was ""strong evidence that he controls and funds local militias implicated in serious abuse"".
But Balkh, which sits on vital trade routes into central Asia, is also one of Afghanistan's most stable and prosperous provinces, with a much smaller Taliban and Islamic State presence than in other northern regions. 
Noor enjoys strong support, notably from a business community that has done well out of the lucrative transit trade through Hairatan, the border crossing into Uzbekistan that handles hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods a year.
""People have been very unhappy about the problems between the president and the governor,"" said Khairuddin Mayel, who runs a large cooking oil and foods business. ""The governor has been very successful and people don't want this province to become like the others. They do not want to lose this governor.""
DISPUTED ELECTION
As the stand-off in Balkh has continued it has become a national issue, with Noor now demanding wider concessions, including what Jamiat sees as proper implementation of the accord underpinning Ghani's national unity government.
Like many of the political problems of the past three years, the crisis stems from the fraud-marred presidential election in 2014 that left no agreed winner. 
Under a U.S.-brokered deal, Ghani, an ethnic Pashtun, was appointed president while his rival Abdullah Abdullah, from Jamiat, was given the specially created post of chief executive.
Ever since, Jamiat supporters have bitterly resented what they see as Ghani's betrayal of the deal and favoritism toward Pashtuns, traditionally the strongest group in Afghan politics.
While Noor has been angry with Ghani, he has also been incensed by Abdullah, his long-time party rival, whom he describes as a ""snake"".
""Jamiat will never trust Dr Abdullah,"" he said. ""He has shown he is weak and a partner in the incompetence and crimes of the government.""
Abdullah has confirmed he had approved the decision to oust the governor, but has had little to say about Noor's reaction.
The dispute has also highlighted the role of a clutch of regional leaders, of whom Noor is one of the most prominent, whose strong local support have made them difficult for the central government to control.
Over recent months, Ghani has sidelined several of them, forcing ethnic Uzbek vice-President Rashid Dostum into exile following a torture scandal.
He has also clashed with General Abdul Raziq, a powerful police commander whose successes against the Taliban in the southern province of Kandahar have given him a growing national profile.
In June, Noor joined Dostum, currently in Turkey, in forming a ""Coalition for the Salvation of Afghanistan"", uniting figures from the Tajik, Hazara and Uzbek communities. Pictures of the two, together with Hazara leader Mohammad Mohaqiq, are on prominent display in Mazar.
Noor said they, and other regional leaders, represented a reality that could not be ignored.

""We have powerful political parties, influential figures, those who have grassroots support among the people,"" said Noor. ""They will remain in Afghanistan and will fight against terrorism as they fought in the past.""

232,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2018 02:51AM ET</span>",Iraq returning displaced civilians from camps to unsafe areas,"By Ahmed Aboulenein
AMRIYAT AL-FALLUJA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces are forcibly returning civilians from refugee camps to unsafe areas in the predominantly Sunni Anbar province, exposing them to death from booby-traps or acts of vigilantism, refugees and aid workers say.
Managing more than two million Iraqis displaced by the war against Islamic State is one of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's most daunting tasks. But critics say he is more interested in winning elections in May than alleviating the suffering of displaced Iraqis and returning them safely home.
Authorities are sending back people against their will, refugees and aid workers say, to ensure that the election takes place on time. People must be in their area of origin to vote and if they do not get home, this could delay the election.
Abadi is riding a wave of popularity after defeating Islamic State in Iraq and is anxious the election should not be held up.
His strategy is not without its hazards. Abadi risks alienating Sunni voters if displaced Sunnis are seen to be suffering from being sent home to dangerous areas.
Abadi is seeking a second term in which he plans to fight corruption and maintain national unity in the face of Kurdish separatism. He will need all the votes he can muster to face down a challenge from candidates linked to Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias.
MILITARY TRUCKS
Interviews with aid workers and dozens of displaced people at camps in the town of Amriyat al-Falluja, located in the Sunni heartland of Anbar province, 40 km (25 miles) from Baghdad, as well as with several families who were returned to other areas in the province, reveal that many were forced to go home and several suffered death or injury.
Aid workers said military trucks arrive at camps unannounced and commanders read out lists of people, who have one hour to pack their belongings and go.
The aid workers, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated that between 2,400 and 5,000 people were forcibly returned between Nov. 21 and Jan. 2.
""These returns are not safe,"" said one aid worker. ""Even those who don't openly resist really have no other choice. They cannot really say no to a bunch of people with guns.""
'THEY GAVE HIM A TENT'
An Iraqi military spokesman said the claim that the military forced displaced civilians to return against their will was an exaggeration.
""Our primary concern is the safety of our citizens, our job is to protect people,"" Iraqi Joint Operations Command Spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Rasool told Reuters.
However, ""citizens have to go home"" now that Islamic State had been defeated, he said.
Some aid workers said local military commanders told them the orders came from Abadi's office. The prime minister's spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
On Nov. 25, security forces arrived at a camp in Amriyat al-Falluja and told Saleh Ahmed, 37, and his family to return to their home town of Betaya, his father, Mahdi Ahmed, said.
They refused because contacts at home told them the area was filled with booby-traps left by retreating Islamic State fighters and their houses had been destroyed.
A local commander assured them the area was safe, saying it was ""better to go live in a tent in your home town than live in a tent in the camp"".
Saleh reluctantly took his wife and some of his children and got on the truck. Mahdi Ahmed, 72, remained at the camp with his sick wife, another son, and some of Saleh's children as their names were not on the list.
""They gave him a tent. He went back to our destroyed house and tried to pitch it in our yard,"" Mahdi Ahmed told Reuters at the camp in Amriyat al-Falluja.
An explosive went off. Saleh's wife was killed instantly and his daughter sustained full body burns. Saleh lost one eye and was seriously injured in the other, according to one of his sons, who witnessed the incident.
CANNOT AFFORD TO RETURN
The Ahmeds' case is not unique. Abdallah, 17, told Reuters his family was forced to return to the town of Jweibeh on Nov. 26
A week later masked men arrived at the family home at 2 a.m. demanding to speak to the father. When he refused to open the door, they burst in and started shooting. Abdallah's father suffered leg injuries and his mother lost a finger.
The family do not know what the men wanted.
""It's not that we don't want to return but it has to be safe,"" said Abdallah, who is now the family breadwinner, working at a shop in the city of Falluja.
For many it is not economically viable to leave the camps, where they can set up barber shops or fruit stands at makeshift markets, making about $50 a month. 
That sum would not be possible back home where jobs, basic services, and schools are nonexistent.
""I can't afford to return,"" said camp resident Alaa Hussein.
One man whose father suffers from kidney failure said leaving means losing access to the camp's dialysis machine. His village, 450 km (280 miles) from the camp, does not have one.
""I will return once there are adequate health services there, but why should I go before then?"" said Jassem Ali, 37.
Five camp residents told Reuters separately they were forced to leave but had to turn back because checkpoints manned by Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias were demanding bribes of up to $400 to let people through, a sum none could afford.
They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Reuters was unable to independently verify the claim.
LIFE RUINED
A U.S. diplomat in Baghdad said she had heard reports of forced returns, which the embassy had brought to the attention of the Iraqi government.
She said the government had stressed its commitment to safe and voluntary returns but also said that ""there is a real desire to get people home as quickly as possible"".
The United Nations says more than half of displaced Iraqis have already returned. More than 3.2 million people were back home at the end of December, with 2.6 million still displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration.
For Mahdi Ahmed, the government has achieved the reverse of what it intended. 
""They are doing this because of the election, but if I go back and see my house destroyed, my money gone, and my life ruined, why would I vote for them?"" he asked.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A remote island volcano in Papua New Guinea has begun spewing ash into the air, forcing the evacuation of more than 500 residents, media and non-profit groups have said.
Kadovar Island, a 365-metre (1,197-ft) -tall volcano on the north coast of PNG, was thought to be dormant until it began erupting on January 5.
""It's just a continuous emission of volcanic ash at the moment,"" Cheyne O’Brien, a forecaster at the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, told Reuters by telephone on Sunday.
The ash clouds have been thrown up steadily to a height of 2,133 meters (7,000 feet), forming a plume that is traveling west-northwest, he added.
The plume does not yet pose a hazard to aviation, but a change in wind direction could hit operations at PNG's Wewak airport, O'Brien said.
All residents of the island have been evacuated with no loss of life, U.S.-based charity Samaritan Aviation, which operates seaplanes to remote areas of PNG, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""We do not have any details yet as to where all of the families have gone and hope to have further information in the near future,"" the non-profit added.
Reuters could not immediately reach authorities in Papua New Guinea by telephone for comment.
The population of the island ranges from at least 500 to more than 600, media have estimated.
The eruption may become explosive, bringing a risk of tsunamis and landslides, domestic online media Loop PNG quoted the Rabaul Volcanological Observatory as saying.
There are no confirmed records of a previous eruption of Kadovar, said Chris Firth, a vulcanologist at Macquarie University, but scientists speculate it could have been one of two ""burning islands"" mentioned in the journals of a 17th-century English pirate and maritime adventurer, William Dampier.
Dampier may have recorded the last eruption of Kadovar during a voyage in search of ""Terra Australis"", the southern continent once thought to be mythical, Firth said.
Vulcanologists are interested to observe its behavior now, Firth added.
""It's hard to predict what might happen, as there's nothing to compare it to.""

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Thousands of Cambodian survivors of the Khmer Rouge on Sunday marked 39 years since the fall of the brutal regime that killed an estimated 1.7 million people.
Up to 40,000 people attended an event in the capital Phnom Penh, organized by the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Prime Minister Hun Sen, installed by the Vietnamese who invaded Cambodia on January 7, 1979 and put and end to the regime.
""The January 7 victory saved the lives of people who survived the killings and brought back to the Cambodian people rights lost under the regime of Pol Pot,"" Hun Sen said at the ceremony.
Most of the victims of the regime died of torture, starvation, exhaustion or disease in labor camps or were beaten to death during mass executions in the ""killing fields"".
The day is controversial in Cambodia, with Hun Sen's party celebrating it as a day of liberation while others mourn it as the start of a 10-year occupation by their hated Vietnamese neighbors.
The rise and fall of the genocidal Khmer Rouge was initiated by Vietnam to ""divide and weaken"" Cambodia to keep it under Vietnamese control, former opposition leader Sam Rainsy said in a post on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
The day marks Cambodia's journey toward a brighter future, the United States said.
""We also celebrate the ingenuity, courage, and perseverance with which the Cambodian people have emerged from this period of darkness, rebuilt their country, and carried forward the process of national reconciliation,"" the U.S. embassy said in a statement.
The anniversary comes amid an opposition crackdown by Hun Sen's government ahead of a July general election.
The United States and the European Union withdrew support for the vote following the dissolution of the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party last year but China, Cambodia's biggest foreign backer, said on Thursday it believes the election this year will be fair.
Pol Pot's three top surviving henchmen are serving life sentences on convictions by a joint Cambodian-United Nations tribunal for various crimes, including crimes against humanity. 

Those in custody are former Khmer Rouge S-21 prison chief Kaing Guek Eav, 'Brother Number Two' Nuon Chea and former President Khieu Samphan.

ABUJA/DAKAR (Reuters) - A leading member of a separatist movement in Cameroon has been taken into custody in the capital of neighboring Nigeria with his aides, sources and secessionists said on Saturday. 
The once-fringe Anglophone movement in majority Francophone Cameroon has gathered pace in the last few months following a military crackdown on protests. It represents the gravest challenge yet to the 35-year rule of President Paul Biya who will seek re-election this year.
Julius Ayuk Tabe, the Nigeria-based chairman of the Governing Council of Ambazonia separatist movement, was taken into custody alongside six others at a hotel in Abuja on Friday, said an official in the west African country and a member of the separatist group in Cameroon.
Bilateral relations have been strained by a separatist movement in Cameroon that has clashed with the Cameroonian army and forced thousands to flee violence by traveling across the border to Nigeria.
Cameroonian troops last month crossed into Nigeria in pursuit of rebels without seeking Nigerian authorization, causing diplomatic wrangling behind the scenes.
Separatists, including armed radical elements, seek an independent state for the nation's Anglophone regions they call Ambazonia.
A Nigerian official said Tabe and six of his supporters were placed in custody at around 7 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Friday. ""They were having a meeting at Nera Hotels in Abuja,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.
The official did not know who rounded up the separatists. 
A member of the separatist group based in Cameroon, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the people were taken into custody.
The separatist group later issued a statement saying that Tabe and six others were taken from Nera Hotels by Cameroonian gunmen in an ""illegal abduction."" Reuters was unable to independently verify the allegation. 
The unrest in Cameroon began in November, when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon, frustrated with having to work in French, took to the streets calling for reforms and greater autonomy.
French is the official language for most of Cameroon but English is spoken in two regions that border Nigeria.
Protests by separatists prompted a violent crackdown by Cameroon's military last year in which troops opened fire on demonstrators.

The mass, on the eve of Coptic Christmas which is celebrated on Jan. 7, was the first to be held in the newly-built cathedral and took place amid tight security. Sisi was cheered by worshippers as he entered the building.
The new Egyptian capital, announced in March 2015, is intended partly to reduce crowding in Cairo.
Some 45 km (28 miles) east of Cairo, the city, which has not yet been given a name, will be home to government ministries, housing and an airport.
The celebrations were held days after attacks on a Coptic church and another Christian-owned shop that left more than 10 people dead.

Egypt's large Christian minority has increasingly been targeted in recent years by Islamist militants including Islamic State, which is waging an insurgency in the north of the remote Sinai Peninsula.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - One of New Zealand's senior political figures, former deputy prime minister James Patrick Anderton, has died in a Christchurch hospital, aged 79.
The idealistic former president of New Zealand's progressive Labour Party became disillusioned with the organization's direction in 1989 so he broke away to create the NewLabour Party and, later, the Alliance Party to pursue full employment and the retention of public assets.
As Alliance Party leader, he served as deputy prime minister in a coalition government with Labour under prime minister Helen Clark from 1999 to 2002.
Born on 21 January 1938, Anderton died just two weeks before his 80th birthday.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Sunday that Anderton had been a towering figure in the Labour movement for decades. He built a powerful campaigning organization, selected candidates who became ministers and prime minister and was an innovative fundraiser, she said in an emailed announcement.
""He will be remembered as someone who stood up for his principles and for the people he represented. His integrity during difficult times marked him out as a true leader.""
""We mourn his loss, and extend our heartfelt sympathies to Jim’s wife Carole, his family and friends.""
Anderton devoted much of his life to public service and used his retirement to campaign for the restoration of Canterbury Cathedral, severely damaged in an earthquake.

The Sunday Times said the reshuffle was aimed at bringing younger women and non-white lawmakers into the cabinet in attempt to appeal to voters who dealt May a setback in an election last year.
May is also expected to announce a new first secretary of state, effectively her number two, after long-standing ally Damian Green was forced to resign from the post last month, the newspaper said.
May, who became prime minister shortly after the Brexit vote in mid-2016, has been widely expected to rejig her ministerial team after a damaging 2017 when she called a snap election only to lose her parliamentary majority.
May's Conservative Party is running neck and neck with the left-wing Labour Party in opinion polls and has been split by differences about what kind of relationship Britain should seek with the European Union after it leaves the bloc in 2019.
The foreign, finance, interior and Brexit ministries are run by Boris Johnson, Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd and David Davis.
The Sunday Times said the ministers who were expected to lose their jobs or move to different roles included Conservative Party chairman Patrick McLoughlin, education minister Justine Greening, business minister Greg Clark and Andrea Leadsom, the government's leader in the lower house of parliament.

LIMA (Reuters) - Recently pardoned former president Alberto Fujimori called for Peruvians on Saturday to set aside their ""grudges"" in order to unite against violence and crime, appealing to his right-wing political base two days after being freed from prison by a presidential pardon.
In his first comments since being released from a hospital for blood pressure and heart problems on Thursday, Fujimori took to Twitter to reflect on the new chapter in his life following a decade in prison serving a 25-year prison sentence for graft and human rights crimes.
""I'm constantly invaded by dreams and want to share them,"" Fujimori said, describing a nation free of ""grudges"" in a jab at his opponents.
""We'll be in a country in which security is regained and violence eliminated. We can only achieve these goals by setting aside special interests and opportunism. UNITED WE CAN DO IT!""
Fujimori's remarks were the first sign that he would play a more active role in Peruvian politics, potentially supporting President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski following a series of political resignations that have shaken his center-right government.
Kuczynski, 79, a former Wall Street banker, has struggled to govern alongside a Congress ruled by Fujimori's supporters, and pardoned Fujimori on Christmas Eve, three days after Fujimori asked his loyalists to help Kuczynski survive an impeachment bid in Congress. The decision ignited protests and a backlash against the political establishment.
Critics of the pardon have slammed it as a blow to the global fight against impunity and efforts to heal the wounds of a conflict between leftist insurgents and Fujimori's 1990-2000 government that killed an estimated 69,000 people.
But many in Peru admire Fujimori as a proponent for the poor and say he was unfairly punished for his government's heavy-handed counterinsurgency campaign against rebels.
While Peru has enjoyed nearly two decades of peace and commodities-fueled growth since Fujimori's authoritarian government ended in a graft scandal, street crime has been a top concern for voters throughout the presidencies of Fujimori's four successors, including Kuczynski.
""Some might think that Kuczynski was tweeting from the wrong account,"" Peruvian political analyst Diethell Colombus said on Twitter, referring to Fujimori's post. ""It's clear that who was once a politician will always be a politician.""
Kuczynski has yet to reveal a new Cabinet since promising an announcement ""very soon"" more than a week ago.

Representatives for Kuczynski and Fujimori have denied that the pardon was part of a political pact, defending it on medical and humanitarian grounds.

It was not clear who was responsible or what the motive was for the attack on a group of civilians searching for firewood near the town of Borofaye and about 10 km (six miles) from the Guinea Bissau border, said army spokesman Abdoul Ndiaye. 
The area is home to separatist rebels who in 1982 formed what is now one of Africa's oldest rebellions in their search for independence from northern Senegal.
The Movement of Democratic Forces for Casamance (MFDC) is active in the area of southern Senegal, which is separated from the more affluent north by Gambia. 
The movement has been largely dormant since a ceasefire in 2014. However, many areas remain off-limits because of land mines and arms stockpiles.

Six Arab foreign ministers met in Amman on Saturday to follow up on earlier decisions taken by the Arab League to counter U.S. President Donald Trump's move in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a decision that overturned decades of U.S. policy on the Middle East.
A committee made up of Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Palestinians and headed by Jordan was set up after an emergency meeting of the Arab League in Cairo shortly after Trump's decision that called on Washington to abandon its decision.
The Arab League said at the time the move would spur violence throughout the region and described Trump’s announcement as a ""dangerous violation of international law"" which had no legal impact.
Safadi said the ministers would recommend a series of moves to a full ministerial meeting of the Arab League due later this month. 
""We will confront the decision by seeking a (U.N.) resolution, an international one, to recognize a Palestinian state on 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital,"" said Safadi.
He did not elaborate on the timing of the diplomatic moves nor say whether he was referring to a U.N. Security Council or General Assembly resolution.
Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the ministerial meeting would also discuss Washington's role in future Arab-Israeli peacemaking that members states said was now jeopardized by what they see as U.S. bias towards Israel.
""We want to lessen any losses on the Palestinian side and lessen the Israeli gains,"" Aboul Gheit added.
Arab states would also discuss whether to convene an extraordinary summit of their leaders or wait until a scheduled summit in the Saudi capital Riyadh at the end of March, he added. 
Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem has infuriated the Arab world and upset Western allies, who say it is a blow to peace efforts and risks sparking more violence in the region.
Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. Israel regards Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital.
Most countries consider East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it from Jordan in a 1967 war, to be occupied territory, and say the status of the city should be decided at future Israeli-Palestinian talks.
On Dec. 18, the United States blocked a United Nations Security Council call for Trump's declaration on Jerusalem to be withdrawn.
Three days later, more than 120 countries defied Trump and voted in favor of a United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

In 2012, the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine in a resolution that said the status of Jerusalem should be resolved through negotiations.

RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian authorities have detained 11 princes after they gathered at a royal palace in Riyadh in a rare protest against the government suspending payment of their utility bills, the public prosecutor said on Saturday.
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, has introduced reforms that include reducing energy subsidies, introducing value-added tax and cutting some perks to royal family members to try to cope with a drop in crude prices that has caused a budget deficit estimated at 195 billion riyals ($52 billion) in 2018.
The princes had gathered on Thursday at Qasr al-Hokm palace demanding the cancellation of a recent decree that halted state payment of water and electricity bills for royal family members and seeking compensation for a death sentence implemented in 2016 against one of their cousins, Prince Turki bin Saud al-Kabeer.
""Despite being informed that their demands are not lawful, the 11 princes refused to leave the area, disrupting public peace and order. Members of a security services stepped in to restore order and the princes were arrested,"" the public prosecutor's statement said, without identifying the princes.
""Following their arrest, they have been charged on a number of counts in relation to these offences. They are detained at Al-Hayer prison south of the capital pending their trial.""
News website Sabq earlier identified the leader of the group of princes by the initials S.A.S. The Saud al-Kabeer branch of the House of Saud descend from a cousin of late King Abdulaziz, who founded the modern kingdom.
The meteoric rise of 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the king's favored son, and his ambitious, sometimes aggressive, policies have caused rare tensions within the royal family, which for decades favored rule by consensus.
Dozens of prices, high officials and senior businessmen were rounded up in November in a crackdown on graft that has boosted Prince Mohammed's power.
They have been held at the five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh while government officials negotiate financial settlements, asking them to hand over assets and cash in return for their freedom.
The round-up followed a meticulously planned palace coup in June through which Prince Mohammed ousted his elder cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as heir to the throne.

243,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2018 03:46PM ET</span>","John Young, 'most experienced' U.S. astronaut, dies at 87","By Will Dunham
(Reuters) - U.S. astronaut John Young, who walked on the moon in 1972 and even smuggled a corned beef sandwich into orbit during a career that made him the only person to fly with three NASA space programs, has died at age 87, officials said on Saturday. 
Young, who went to space six times, died on Friday night at his home in Houston following complications from pneumonia, National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman Allard Beutel said in an email. 
The former U.S. Navy test pilot was the ninth person to set foot on the moon, an experience shared by three others after Young. He eventually became one of the most accomplished astronauts in the history of the U.S. space program.
He flew into space twice during NASA's Gemini program in the mid-1960s, twice on the Apollo lunar missions and twice on space shuttles in the 1980s. He was the only person to fly on all three types of programs.
""Astronaut John Young's storied career spanned three generations of spaceflight. We will stand on his shoulders as we look toward the next human frontier,"" NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot said in a statement.
Young, described in a NASA tweet as ""our most experienced astronaut,"" retired in 2004 after 42 years with the U.S. space agency.
The Apollo 16 mission in April 1972, his fourth space flight, took Young to the lunar surface.
As mission commander, he and crewmate Charles Duke explored the moon's Descartes Highlands region, gathering 200 pounds (90 kg) of rock and soil samples and driving more than 16 miles (26 km) in the lunar rover to sites such as Spook Crater.
Recalling his lunar exploits, Young told the Houston Chronicle in 2004: ""One-sixth gravity on the surface of the moon is just delightful. It's not like being in zero gravity, you know. You can drop a pencil in zero gravity and look for it for three days. In one-sixth gravity, you just look down and there it is.""
Young's first time in space came in 1965 with the Gemini 3 mission that took him and astronaut Gus Grissom into Earth orbit in the first two-person U.S. space jaunt.
It was on this mission that Young pulled his sandwich stunt, which did not make NASA brass happy but certainly pleased Grissom, the recipient of the snack.
Astronaut Wally Schirra, who was not flying on the mission, bought the corned beef sandwich on rye bread from a delicatessen in Cocoa Beach, Florida, and asked Young to give it to Grissom in space. During the flight, as they discussed the food provided for the mission, Young handed Grissom the sandwich.
NASA later rebuked Young for the antics, which generated criticism from lawmakers and the media, but his career did not suffer.
His May 1969 Apollo 10 mission served as a ""dress rehearsal"" for the historic Apollo 11 mission two months later in which Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon. Young and his crew undertook each aspect of that subsequent mission except for an actual moon landing.
Young's fifth space mission was as commander of the inaugural flight of NASA's first space shuttle, Columbia, in 1981. He became the first person to fly six space missions in 1983, when he commanded Columbia on the first Spacelab trek, with the crew performing more than 70 scientific experiments.
He never went to space again. Young had been due to command a 1986 flight that was canceled after the explosion of the shuttle Challenger earlier that year. 
""John was more than a good friend,"" former President George H.W. Bush said in a statement. ""He was a fearless patriot whose courage and commitment to duty helped our nation push back the horizon of discovery at a critical time.""

Young was born on Sept. 24, 1930, in San Francisco and grew up in Orlando, Florida. After receiving a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1952, he entered the Navy and graduated from its test pilot school. NASA picked him in 1962 for its astronaut program.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Nigeria is starting flights to evacuate thousands of its citizens from Libya which will continue until all those wanting to return home have done so, its foreign minister said on Saturday. 
Nigerians have recently been the largest national group among African migrants traveling to Libya and trying to cross from there to Italy by sea.
Since local armed factions and Libya's coastguard began blocking more migrants from leaving in July last year, large numbers have been trapped in Libya, where they often face dire conditions and abuse, including forced labor.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has in recent months accelerated a ""voluntary returns"" program to repatriate migrants from a number of countries. Nigeria now joins Niger in organizing bilateral returns. 
""The main objective, and we're very focused on that objective, is to get these Nigerian citizens back home as quickly as possible,"" Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyema told reporters during a visit to Tripoli.
""Our president has made available all the resources necessary to repatriate all the Nigerians here.
""We have two planes arriving today and God willing we are hoping to evacuate anything up to 800 Nigerians today."" 
Nigeria had been expecting to fly back about 5,500 migrants, Onyema said, but the situation on the ground made the actual number hard to ascertain.
""Some of the difficulties with getting precise numbers is that some are within the control of the central government in camps, some are clearly outside the camps, some are also in less accessible areas where there might not be full central government control and authority,"" he said.
Facilitating voluntary returns could also be complicated by lack of access, Onyema said. Criminals involved in smuggling and trafficking migrants ""also (have) an interest that a number of them should not be repatriated, because these represent economic assets for them"".
Libya has been in turmoil since a 2011 uprising, with rival governments and armed factions vying for power. Onyema was hosted by the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, which has struggled to assert its authority on the ground.
Slightly fewer than half as many migrants reached Europe by sea in 2017 than 2016, the IOM said on Friday, largely due to a drop in numbers crossing from Libya.

Trump threatened earlier this week to withhold future aid payments to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) over what he called the Palestinians' unwillingness to talk peace with Israel.
The idea, condemned as blackmail by Palestinians, was initially met with mixed reactions in Israel, with some officials warning of the dangers in cutting off financial assistance to the Palestinians.
""Prime Minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) supports a gradual cut to UNRWA,"" said the senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Axios news website reported on Friday that the United States had frozen $125 million in funding for UNRWA, but a State Department official said no decision had been made.
Netanyahu's office said in a brief statement that the premier ""supports President Trump's critical approach and believes that practical steps should be taken to change the situation in which UNRWA is perpetuating the Palestinian refugee problem rather than resolving it.""
UNRWA supports much of the population in the Gaza Strip and a cut to its budget could ramp up tensions with Israel, a main conduit for aid into the territory.

The United States is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA's website.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Humanitarian workers and journalists should be given free access to Myanmar's Rakhine State, where violence has prompted some 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh, the head of a new international advisory panel on the crisis said.
Surakiart Sathirathai, a former Thai foreign minister, also expressed concern at the arrest of two Reuters reporters in Myanmar last month and said he hoped the case did not lead to broader restrictions on the international media.
""I think press and humanitarian access to Rakhine are important issues as well as free access to other stakeholders,"" said Surakiart in an interview in Bangkok. ""Legitimate press coverage is something that should be enhanced.""
Myanmar has severely curtailed access to Rakhine, where an army operation in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents has been condemned by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing - an accusation rejected by the Buddhist majority country.
Surakiart, 59, was chosen last year by Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi to head a 10-member board that will advise on how to implement the recommendations of an earlier commission headed by former U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan.
Allowing free media coverage was one of the specific recommendations in the 63-page report from Annan's commission, which was appointed by Suu Kyi in 2016 to investigate how to solve Rakhine's long-standing ethnic and religious tensions.
Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who had worked on coverage of the crisis in the western state, were arrested in Yangon on Dec. 12 on suspicion of violating Myanmar's Official Secrets Act.
Surakiart said he had raised concerns about their case with Suu Kyi's national security advisor Thaung Tun. He said he had asked for the case to be dealt with transparently and been assured that proper legal procedures would be followed.
""I hope that this would not snowball in adverse directions for both the international press and the Myanmar government,"" Surakiart added. ""I hope the case will not lead to the Myanmar government not welcoming the international press. I want this to be a specific case and hope for a quick resolution to it.""
BRIDGING THE GAP
The Annan-led panel delivered its recommendations - which also included a review of a law that links citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most Rohingya stateless - just before insurgent attacks on security posts on Aug. 25 triggered the latest crisis.
Surakiart said there were concerns over the repatriation of those who had since fled to Bangladesh and that the advisory board would need to find an approach to ensure people could return without fear, even if they were not recognized by existing law as Myanmar citizens.
Suu Kyi has faced international criticism for perceived inaction over the crisis in Rakhine, but Surakiart said she was constrained by domestic politics.
Buddhist nationalism has surged in Myanmar in recent years, and the army campaign has wide support.
""Aung San Suu Kyi tried to address the issue by trying to build consensus from within rather than finger-pointing,"" said Surakiart.
""There is a big gap between domestic and international interpretations of the situation in Rakhine. If we can't bridge this gap then it will be an obstacle for all of us who want to improve the situation.""
The former Thai foreign minister also said his advisory board would seek to engage with all groups in Rakhine, including the military.
""The advisory board is not a mouthpiece to anyone,"" Surakiart said. ""We are not a spokesperson for Myanmar or the international community.""
The board, which is made up of five members from Myanmar and five international appointees including veteran former U.S. politician and diplomat Bill Richardson, will meet the Myanmar government on Jan. 22 in the capital Naypyitaw before making its first trip to Rakhine on Jan. 24.

""I do not want the advisory board to be just a talking shop,"" Surakiart said. ""We want to help bring about tangible progress.""

The Greek Orthodox church is one of the biggest private landowners in the Holy Land and in recent years has stirred controversy both among Israelis and Palestinians by trying to sell prime assets to private investors.
Hundreds of Palestinians blocked Patriarch Theophilos III's convoy as he drove to a church in Bethlehem to attend an Orthodox Christmas mass.
Protestors threw stones and water bottles and pounded his car with their fists, chanting ""traitor, traitor,"" before Palestinian security forces pushed them away. Three cars in the convoy, but not the Patriarch's vehicle, had their windows smashed.
Demonstrator Elyeef Sayegh said: ""What happened today is a message to the Palestinian Authority and to Jordan that we will not allow this traitor to stay in the Church.""
Israeli media have reported that the controversial deals include properties in East and West Jerusalem, as well as in the port cities of Caesarea and Jaffa. They identified some Jewish and Israeli investors as potential buyers.
Church officials have said they need to sell land in order to pay back debt that has accumulated over the years. Until now the church has been leasing out the land to residents on long-term contracts.
Some Israeli lawmakers are trying to block the deals that they fear could lead to large increases in real estate prices. Palestinians oppose the sale of land to Jewish and Israeli groups and consider it an act of treason.

The demonstrators were Christians from Bethlehem, Nazareth and other cities inside Israel.

State media blamed Friday's crash, near Luxor, on poor weather conditions.
High winds and sandstorms swept the country on Friday, clouding the skies at Cairo's main airport and forcing the closure of a number of Red Sea ports.
MENA did not say if charges had been brought against the four men, who include the pilot. Judicial sources said an initial investigation suggested that negligence could have contributed to the crash.
A South African man died and an Argentinian and two French tourists were being treated in hospital. A number of other tourists were also taken to Luxor International Hospital but released after a few hours.
Luxor, a city surrounded by ancient tombs and other historic sites, is one of the main focuses of Egypt's tourism industry - a key revenue-earner that the government has been trying to revive after years of political turmoil. 
Nineteen people, most of them Asian and European tourists, died near Luxor in 2013 when a hot air balloon caught fire and crashed after a mid-air gas explosion.

(Reuters) - Dozens of passengers were evacuated from an aircraft at Toronto's  Pearson  (LON:PSON) Airport late on Friday after a plane under tow struck an arriving jet that was waiting to park, sparking a small fire, the airport authority said.
Fire and emergency services responded to the collision between the two planes from Sunwing Airlines and Westjet Airlines (TO:WJA), which happened at 6:19 p.m. (2319 GMT), the Greater Toronto Airport Authority said in a statement.
Calgary-based Westjet said it had unconfirmed reports of ""minor injuries"" in the incident, but that all 168 passengers and six crew members on board its plane were safe and accounted for.
The jet, a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800, had just arrived in Toronto from the resort of Cancun, Mexico, and was waiting to proceed to the gate at the time of the collision, Westjet said. 
Sunwing, part of the privately held Sunwing Travel Group, said there were no passengers or crew onboard its plane at the time of the collision and that the aircraft was being towed by ground handler Swissport International Ltd.
A spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board, Canada's transportation regulator, said a team was headed to the airport to investigate.
Swissport, a provider of ground and cargo handling services for the aviation industry, confirmed late on Friday that one of its employees was involved in the collision and said it would cooperate in the investigation. 

""The incident occurred when our employee was pushing back the plane from the gate,"" Pierre Payette, Swissport Canada Handling Inc vice president of operations for Toronto, said in a statement emailed to Reuters. ""The impact caused a small fire in the empty aircraft’s exterior generator, which was quickly extinguished by the Fire Department.""

Meeting in an ornate imperial palace in central Germany, the pair said they were keen to make amends after falling out as Ankara rounded up suspected supporters of a failed 2016 coup, a comedian mocked Turkey's president and a German-Turkish journalist was detained without charge.
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel pointed to historic links between the countries including the role Turkish guest workers played in rebuilding Germany after World War Two, Turkey's hospitality in taking in German refugees during the Nazi era and the 3 million-strong Turkish community here.
""We've both made it our business to do everything we can to overcome the difficulties there have been in German-Turkish relations and to find more common ground in the future by remembering everything that binds us together,"" Gabriel said.
German politicians have been outspoken critics of Turkey's post-coup crackdown, in which some 50,000 people have been arrested pending trial and 150,000, including teachers, judges and soldiers, have been sacked or suspended from their jobs.
Turkey says the crackdown, targeting alleged supporters of a Muslim network it blames for the coup, is necessary on security grounds. Ankara has criticized Germany's refusal to hand over asylum seekers it says were involved in the failed putsch. 
Adding to the tension, the German government believes seven Germans, of whom four have dual citizenship, are being held in prison in Turkey for political reasons.
But in a sign of recovering relations, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the NATO allies believed they could overcome recent escalations in tension through dialogue. 
Cavusoglu said Turkey and Germany shared similar views on conflict-hit Middle East countries and they were cooperating on humanitarian issues like migration.
During a working lunch on Saturday, he and Gabriel would discuss steps they can take together in future, Cavusoglu said.
THORNY ISSUES
But the pair acknowledged areas of disagreement. Cavusoglu said one bone of contention was whether Turkey should be allowed to join the European Union - a move that Germany opposes - but he sounded a conciliatory note.
""There is benefit in pushing our disagreements aside and continuing on our path. We should focus on issues that serve as win-win for our countries, like the Customs Union,"" he said.
One of the disputes between Berlin and Ankara centers around the arrest of Deniz Yucel, a reporter for German newspaper Die Welt. Turkish authorities accuse him of spreading propaganda for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). He denies the charge.
Gabriel said he had discussed thorny issues including Yucel's case with Cavusoglu but did not give details.
Germany is Turkey's biggest trade partner but exports from Europe's largest economy to Turkey dropped by 5.9 percent year-on-year in the first nine months of 2017.
Gabriel told magazine Der Spiegel on Friday Germany had refused to authorize ""a large number of arms exports"" to Turkey and that would remain the case until Yucel's case was resolved.
But on Saturday he said the German government would consider whether to deliver mine protection gear for armored vehicles in Turkey, an issue not linked to arrests, he said.

Saturday's show of support came a day after Iran's foreign minister said a United Nations Security Council meeting called by the United States to discuss the protests had proved a ""blunder"" by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.
State television showed rallies in cities including Amol, Semnan and Shadegan waving Iranian flags and chanting ""Death to America"", ""Death to Israel"" and ""Death to Britain"".
More than a week of unrest has seen 22 people die and more than 1,000 arrested, according to Iranian officials, in the biggest anti-government protests for nearly a decade. 
Unrest spread to more than 80 cities and rural towns as thousands of young and working class Iranians voiced anger at graft, unemployment and a deepening gap between rich and poor. 
Residents contacted by Reuters in various cities on Friday said the protests had shown sign of abating, after the government intensified a crackdown on protesters by dispatching Revolutionary Guards forces to several provinces.
The provincial governor in northeastern Mashhad, where the protests started, was quoted as saying on Saturday that 85 percent of detainees there had been released after signing a pledge not to re-offend.
""Those with a criminal record, or those charged with sabotage such a setting fire to motorcycles or damaging public buildings have been referred to judicial authorities,"" governor Alireza Rashidian told the ISNA news agency.
Tehran University Vice-President Majid Sarsangi said the university had set up a committee to track the fate of students arrested during the unrest.
""Our efforts at the university are aimed at cooperating with the relevant authorities to create the conditions for the return of the detained students to the university and their families in the shortest possible time,"" Sarsangi told ISNA.
Separately, a member of parliament said about 90 students were detained, 10 of whom were still not accounted for.
""It seems that the total number of detainees is around 90. Ten students from universities in Tehran and some other cities are in an uncertain position, and ... it is still unknown which body has detained them,"" the labor news agency ILNA quoted reformist politician Mahmoud Sadeghi as saying.
Iran has several parallel security bodies and residents say arrests are often not immediately announced.
Videos that appeared on social media in recent days showed relatives of detainees gathering outside prisons to seek information about the fate of their loved ones.
A United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday to discuss the protests turned into criticism of the United States for requesting to meet on what some member states said was an internal issue for Iran.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted: ""The UNSC rebuffed the U.S.'s naked attempt to hijack its mandate ... Another FP (foreign policy) blunder for the Trump administration.""

Mugabe, 93, stood down in November after 37 years in power following a de facto military coup, making way for his former deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa to take over.
When the military seized power they arrested key allies of Mugabe and his wife, Grace, who was vying with Mnangagwa to succeed her husband.

Undenge is accused of issuing a $12,650 contract without due tender to a company that did no work, according to a charge sheet seen by Reuters. 
Mzembi and Undenge were both granted bail on Saturday, asked to surrender their passports and remanded until Jan. 22 when their cases will be heard.
""We are going to make an application for an exception to the charge because the charges that my client is facing are ridiculous,"" Job Sikhala, Mzembi's lawyer, told reporters outside the court.

Saudi activists and media reported that Saleh al-Shehi, a columnist for Arabic-language daily al-Watan, was detained on Wednesday over various articles and television appearances, including one in which he accused the royal court of corruption in distributing land.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has launched reforms over the past two years to foster economic diversity and cultural openness, ordered the arrest of more than 200 people, including princes, ministers and billionaires, last year. He said he was going after corruption but critics saw the move as a consolidation of power.
Resistance to his economic agenda and assertive foreign policy has been treated harshly, according to civil liberties monitors, who say freedom of expression is increasingly constrained.

Days after President Donald Trump threatened to withhold future aid payments to Palestinians, Axios said the funding was frozen until the U.S. government finishes its review of aid to the Palestinian Authority.
The sum, a third of the annual U.S. donation to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, was supposed to be delivered by Jan. 1, Axios said, citing three unidentified Western diplomats.
The State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ""That (Axios) story is very misleading. Just because they were expecting the money on the first, and they did not get it at that time, does not mean it was suspended or canceled. Deliberations are ongoing, and we have until mid-January to make a final decision.""
Asked if any preliminary decision had been made, the official replied: ""No. And reports to that effect are false.""
UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness said the agency had not been ""informed directly of a formal decision either way by the U.S. administration.""
Trump said on Tuesday he would withhold money from the Palestinians, accusing them of being “no longer willing to talk peace” with Israel.
""We pay HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?” Trump said on Twitter.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",U.S. weighs Pakistani blowback as it piles pressure on Islamabad,"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is examining ways to mitigate any Pakistani retaliation as it piles pressure on Islamabad to crack down on militants, a senior U.S. official said on Friday, cautioning that U.S. action could extend beyond a new freeze in aid.
Pakistan is a crucial gateway for U.S. military supplies destined for U.S. and other troops fighting a 16-year-old war in neighboring, landlocked Afghanistan. 
So far, the Pentagon says Pakistan has not given any indication that it would close its airspace or roads to military supplies and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis played down concerns on Friday. 
But Washington has only just begun to work through its new plan to suspend up to roughly $2 billion in U.S. security assistance, announced on Thursday. It came days after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that Pakistan had rewarded past U.S. aid with ""nothing but lies & deceit."" 
The senior Trump administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Washington hoped that the aid suspension would be enough to communicate its concern to Islamabad.
But the official cautioned that the freeze was also not the only tool that America had to pressure the country -- suggesting it might resort to other measures, if needed.
""We are considering many different things, not just the (financial) assistance issue,"" the official said.
""We are also looking at Pakistan's potential response ... and we are looking at ways to deal with that and to mitigate the risks to the relationship.""
The official declined to detail what steps were under consideration, including whether that might include possible unilateral U.S. military action against militants in Pakistan.
But as Trump allow the U.S. military to again ramp up its war effort in Afghanistan, including with the deployment of more U.S. troops alongside Afghan forces, the official acknowledged a sense of urgency.
The United States has long blamed the militant safehavens in Pakistan for prolonging the war in Afghanistan, giving insurgents, including from the Haqqani network, a place to plot attacks and rebuild its forces. 
""We believe we owe it to the Americans in harms' way in Afghanistan. We simply can't ignore the sanctuaries if we are going to make progress in Afghanistan,"" the official said. 
MATTIS PLAYS DOWN CONCERNS 
Mattis, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, said he was not concerned about America's ability to use Pakistan as a gateway to resupply U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
""I'm not concerned, no,"" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon, adding he had not gotten any indication from Pakistan that it might cut off those routes. Mattis traveled to Pakistan last month.
""We're still working with Pakistan and we would restore the aid if we see decisive movements against the terrorists -- who are as much a threat against Pakistan as they are to us.""
The United States has also said some of the frozen aid could be released on a case-by-case basis, and none of it will be spent elsewhere -- leaving the door open to full reconciliation.
The Pakistani reaction has so far been limited to harsh rhetoric, with Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif saying the United States was behaving toward Pakistan as ""a friend who always betrays.""
But opposition leader Imran Khan, a former cricket star tipped as the next Pakistani prime minister, said it was time for Pakistan to ""delink"" from the United States.
The senior Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity acknowledged that a Pakistani cut-off would greatly complicate U.S. resupply efforts in Afghanistan. 
The official said the administration was developing ""risk mitigation plans,"" but acknowledged that examination of a northern network of alternative routes used in the past was ""still at a very broad level.""
""If something were to happen to the ground lines of communication or air lines of communication through Pakistan, certainly that would be very difficult for the U.S. and we would have to look for alternatives,"" the official said.

""And it would not be easy.""

The official said Brigadier General Taher al-Aqeeli suffered minor injuries in the explosion, which happened on Friday while he was inspecting government positions in Khub wa al-Sha'af, the largest district in al-Jouf province.
Forces loyal to exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government captured most of the district in heavy fighting with the Houthis last month.
Anti-Houthi forces, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, have intensified an offensive against the Iran-aligned group that controls most of northern Yemen since former President Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed after he switched sides in Yemen's nearly three-year-old civil war.
The Houthis, who killed Saleh after they surrounded his compound in Sanaa, accused the former president of trying to sow sedition in the country. Saleh's General People's Congress party accused the Houthis of trying to monopolize running the country.
The Houthis said Aqeeli and several of his aides were injured in the blast, describing Aqeeli's injuries as serious.
Hadi appointed Aqeeli last September, replacing Major General Mohammed al-Maqdeshi, who was appointed as a presidential adviser.
The United Arab Emirates news agency WAM reported earlier this week that local Yemeni fighters in the southwest, backed by Emirati forces, killed dozens of armed Houthi group members and cut one of their main supply routes to the country's third largest city of Taiz.
The Houthis, who have swept across Yemen since 2014 and overthrew Hadi's internationally-recognized government in 2015, hold the capital Sanaa and much of northern Yemen, where most of the country's 25 million people live. 
The conflict - widely seen as a proxy war between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran - has displaced more than 2 million people, caused a cholera epidemic and pushed the country to the brink of famine. At least 10,000 people have been killed.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2018 02:52AM ET</span>","One winning ticket in Florida for Mega Millions jackpot, Powerball up next","By Chris Kenning
CHICAGO (Reuters) - One ticket matching all six numbers was sold in Florida in the Mega Millions lottery jackpot of an estimated $450 million, the fourth largest in the game's history, the lottery said after Friday's drawing.
The numbers drawn were 28, 30, 39, 59, 70 and 10.
The identity of the ticket holder or holders was not announced by lottery officials. The Mega Millions drawing has a $281-million payout if the winner selects a lump-sum payment. 
U.S. lottery players will get another shot at becoming super rich on Saturday night, when numbers are drawn for the Powerball jackpot of an estimated $570 million, the fifth largest in the game's history.
The two jackpots together topped $1 billion after going months without a winner.
Saturday's 10:59 p.m. EST Powerball drawing has an estimated $358.5-million lump-sum payment, according to organizers.
The total of the two lotteries is the third largest in the history of the games.
Long odds have not halted the spread of ""lottery fever"", with people lining up to buy the $2-tickets at retailers, said Jeff Lenard, spokesman for the National Association of Convenience Stores, whose members sell about 60 percent of the nation's lottery tickets.
""There's definitely more traffic,"" Lenard said.
Americans spent $80.5 billion on lottery games last year, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.
Powerball tickets are sold in 44 states, and Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Mega Millions tickets are offered in the same locations, excluding Puerto Rico.
The largest Powerball jackpot was a $1.6-billion payout split among winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016, the association said. The largest Mega Millions jackpot of $656 million was won in 2012.
The totals have ballooned as no one has hit either jackpot since October. On Wednesday, there was no winner of the Powerball jackpot, worth an estimated $460 million. A day earlier, no one had matched all six numbers in a Mega Millions drawing, lottery officials said. 
The estimated totals are before tax.
The odds of a single ticket hitting all six numbers in the Powerball are 292 million to 1, the Multi-State Lottery Association says. The odds of picking the right six numbers for the Mega Millions jackpot are 303 million to 1, the game said.

""When the jackpots reach these levels, everyone starts to daydream about what they would do if they won,"" Gordon Medenica, Mega Millions lead director, said in a statement.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Bushfires in Australia destroyed buildings and threatened lives on Saturday as a heatwave in three states brought temperatures strong enough to melt the bitumen on a highway. 
A fire raging out of control set several structures ablaze on the outskirts of Melbourne, the country's second largest city, and the capital of the southeastern state of Victoria.
The state's emergency management commissioner, Craig Lapsley, said hot temperatures had combined with dry weather, strong winds and a wind change to create dangerous conditions.
""It's exactly what the forecast indicated and when we have fires running that's obviously a problem for us,"" he told a news conference.
About 400 homes lost power and 50 fires were reported across Victoria on Saturday, although many were small and were extinguished. 
Emergency warnings were issued both in Victoria and in the nearby state of South Australia, where authorities advised residents of a rural area to seek shelter in buildings from an out-of-control fire.
Experts consider such a move to be safer than running the risk of getting trapped in the open if the fire suddenly changes direction.
Total fire bans took effect from midnight as Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania braced for dangerous fire conditions caused by temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104°F).
The heat was strong enough to melt the bitumen on a 10-km (6-mile) stretch of freeway in Victoria, national broadcaster ABC News reported.
Australia is prone to deadly blazes, thanks to its combination of remote terrain, high summer temperatures and flammable eucalyptus bush.
In 2009, the worst bushfires on record destroyed thousands of homes in Victoria, killing 173 people and injuring 414 on a day the media dubbed ""Black Saturday"".

Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement on Friday.
Dmitry Titov of Russia, a former U.N. assistant secretary-general, has been appointed to lead the probe, which will examine the circumstances surrounding the attack, evaluate the peacekeeping mission's preparedness and provide recommendations for prevention of future attacks, the statement said.
In addition to U.N. officials, the investigation team will include two Tanzanian military officers, it said.
U.N. officials said they suspected Ugandan rebels from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) carried out the Dec. 7 assault on the base in the town of Semuliki in Congo's North Kivu province. The ADF is an Islamist rebel group that has been active in the area.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian police have requested that President Michel Temer answers 50 questions as part of an investigation into alleged corruption involving a decree regulating the country's ports, a government spokesman said on Friday.
Police are investigating whether Temer took bribes in exchange for shaping the decree in a way that would benefit logistics firm Rodrimar SA, which operates some services in the Port of Santos, Latin America's busiest container port. 
The decree, published in May, lengthened the deadline for contracts governing port concessions, benefiting current operators.
The investigation adds to several graft allegations that have hammered Temer's presidency, though he has so far managed to avoid a trial with the backing of Congress.
Temer has denied any role in the corruption scandals.
Temer's attorney Antonio Mariz told Reuters on Friday he would answer the questions even though he is not legally obliged to do so. 
The spokesman declined to expand on the content of the list of questions.

According to local magazine Época, police have asked whether Temer was offered campaign donations by representatives from the Port of Santos in exchange for fulfilling their demands, among other questions.

State prosecutor Javier Olea said the young men had been arrested by Chilpancingo police last Saturday after a brawl at a Christmas fair and officers were suspected of later murdering them. Their bodies were found on Thursday. At least one other young man has disappeared. 
State and federal police and military forces took over security operations in Chilpancingo on Thursday after more than 100 local police officers were suspended and put under investigation in the case, a state police spokesman said on Friday. 
A growing number of criminal groups in Guerrero are battling over territory used to grow opium poppies for heroin production. Guerrero is one of the most violent states in Mexico. It is not uncommon for state, federal and military forces to replace local security forces suspected of corruption and ties to Mexico's powerful gangs.
On Thursday, protests were held against local police and relatives of two missing youths told reporters they suspected police were involved in their disappearance. 
In the nearby city of Iguala in 2014, 43 Mexican students were rounded up by corrupt police, who handed them over to a gang that burnt them in a nearby dump, according to a federal investigation.
Clashes between rival drug gangs contributed to a record high number of murders in Mexico last year. President Enrique Pena Nieto has pledged to get violence under control ahead of national elections this summer.

266,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 07:35PM ET</span>",North Korea agrees to talk to South after U.S.-South Korea postpone drills,"By Christine Kim and David Brunnstrom
SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea agreed on Friday to hold official talks with South Korea next week, the first in more than two years, hours after Washington and Seoul delayed a military exercise amid a standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told U.S. media it was too early to tell if the inter-Korea meeting could open the way for future talks involving the United States, but he stressed that if such talks came about they would have to be aimed at North Korean denuclearization. 
South Korea said North Korea had sent its consent for the talks to be held next Tuesday at the border truce village of Panmunjom. The last time the two Koreas engaged in official talks was in December 2015.
The two sides are expected to discuss the Winter Olympics, to be held in South Korea next month, and inter-Korean relations, South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told reporters.
North Korea asked for further negotiations about the meeting to be carried out via documented exchanges, Baik said.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened the way for talks with South Korea in a New Year's Day speech in which he called for reduced tensions and flagged the North's possible participation in the Winter Olympics.
But Kim remained steadfast on the issue of nuclear weapons, saying the North would mass-produce nuclear missiles for operational deployment and warned he would launch a nuclear strike if his country was threatened.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called the proposed inter-Korean talks a ""good thing,"" and he and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in announced that annual large-scale military drills would now take place after the Olympics.
The North sees the drills as preparations for invasion and justification for its weapons programs that it conducts in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.
Trump, who hurled fresh insults at the North Korean leader this week, took credit for any dialogue that takes place.
""Does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn't firm, strong and willing to commit our total 'might' against the North,"" Trump tweeted.
TILLERSON WARNING
Speaking to CNN, Tillerson made clear that Washington was also open to talks with North Korea, but warned that while it aimed to resolve the crisis diplomatically, ""those diplomatic efforts are backed by a strong military option if necessary.""
Tillerson said future talks involving the United States could allow North Korea to ""chart a way for themselves to a more secure future, a more prosperous future."" He added: ""They do know how to reach us if and when they are ready to engage with us as well.""
Tillerson said how such talks might begin had yet to be determined, but North Korea would have to signal it understood that they would be aimed at ""final, full denuclearization.""
He told the Associated Press it remained to be seen whether the North Koreans would want to talk about more than the Olympics next week.
The meeting could be a “vehicle through which they would like to tell us that they would like to have some discussions,” the AP quoted Tillerson as saying. 
“It could be meaningful, it could be important. It could be a meeting about the Olympics and nothing else happens.”
North Korea says its weapons are necessary to counter U.S. aggression, and it regularly threatens to destroy the United States and its two key Asia allies, Japan and South Korea.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang welcomed North and South Korea ""taking positive steps to improve ties,"" and said the postponement of the exercises was ""without doubt a good thing.""
China's Commerce Ministry said it would limit exports of crude oil, refined oil products, steel and other metals to North Korea, in line with tough new sanctions imposed by the United Nations.
Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera sounded a note of caution about the proposed talks.
""I think what is important is to maintain a firm defense posture,"" he told reporters. ""North Korea goes through phases of apparent dialogue and provocation, but either way, North Korea is continuing its nuclear and missile development. We have no intention of weakening our warning and surveillance.""
Earlier this week, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington had heard reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile.
South Korea's Defence Ministry has said it had yet to see any evidence of an imminent missile launch.
Analysts with the website 38 North, which tracks North Korea, reported Pyongyang may be preparing to test a rocket engine at a facility in Sohae, North Pyongan province, where all of the North's satellite launches have taken place since 2012.

Commercial satellite imagery from Dec. 25 showed a rail-mounted environment shelter had been moved away from a test stand, indicating that an engine test may be in the near future, the website said, rather than a new rocket launch suspected in recent media reports.

267,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 07:34PM ET</span>",Trump meets Republican leaders to set strategy for 2018,"By Jeff Mason and Richard Cowan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Following a tumultuous start to 2018, President Donald Trump and top Republicans began a two-day retreat in Maryland on Friday to lay out legislative priorities for the year and discuss strategy for pivotal November congressional elections.
Trump and party leaders, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, face a Jan. 19 deadline on passing legislation to prevent a government shutdown. They also were due to discuss broader issues to highlight ahead of midterm elections in which Republicans will battle to keep control of Congress.
""We have a lot of things to work on, a lot of things to accomplish,"" Trump told reporters as he left for the talks being held at the Camp David presidential retreat.
The meeting comes on the heels of explosive comments by Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, contained in a new book that put the White House on the defensive.
Trump is seeking more legislative wins after cementing the first major victory of his presidency in December with a tax overhaul long sought by his party and its supporters.
The White House has said its next top priorities are a plan to invest in roads, bridges and other infrastructure, and an overhaul of welfare programs. Also on the agenda is immigration policy including addressing protections for hundreds of thousands of young adults who were brought to the United States illegally as children.
While Trump and McConnell want to work on infrastructure first, Ryan is more interested in tackling so-called entitlement programs such as welfare. A White House official said the timing of legislation would be discussed, as well as the November election.
All 435 members of the House and a third of the 100 members of the Senate will be up for re-election. A Democratic takeover of one or both chambers could stifle Trump's agenda.
CHANGING THE SUBJECT
The Camp David strategy session will provide an opportunity to switch subjects after the furor over the book, which went on sale on Friday, that describes an inept Trump White House.
Trump broke with Bannon on Wednesday after comments attributed to his former advisor about his son Donald Trump Jr. were revealed in author Michael Wolff's ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House."" Trump said Bannon had ""lost his mind.""
""The White House doesn't mind the optics after a few days of the president unloading on Bannon and making our views clear on the book. The president sits down and charts the course forward ... with the actual leaders of the Republican Party,"" a White House official said.
The White House said healthcare, the fiscal 2019 budget, the opioid crisis and the effort to win Senate confirmation of Trump's nominees for various government posts would be discussed at the retreat, which will also be attended by Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise.
Cabinet members including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt will also attend, along with a handful of senior White House advisers.
The Republicans also are expected to talk about raising the budget caps for defense. Democrats have demanded any increase on defense spending be accompanied by higher caps for non-defense spending.

Talks with Democrats are expected to resume on Tuesday, when leaders from both parties are slated to meet with Trump at the White House to discuss immigration.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of government supporters rallied across Iran on Friday, swearing allegiance to the clerical establishment and accusing arch-enemy the United States of instigating the biggest anti-government protests for nearly a decade, state TV reported.
Tehran's Friday prayer leader called on authorities to deal ""firmly"" with those responsible for igniting over a week of demonstrations, in which 22 people have died and more than 1,000 have been arrested, according to Iranian officials. 
(For graphic on Iranian protests, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2CXDYXZ) 
""But those ordinary Iranians who were deceived by these American-backed rioters should be dealt with based on Islamic clemency,"" cleric Ahmad Khatami told worshippers at Tehran university, TV reported.
Khatami also called on the government to ""pay more attention to people's economic problems.""
Protests erupted on Dec. 28 in the holy Shi'ite city of Mashhad after the government announced plans to raise fuel prices and cut monthly cash handouts to lower-income Iranians.
Unrest spread to more than 80 cities and rural towns as thousands of young and working class Iranians voiced anger at graft, unemployment and a deepening gap between rich and poor. 
Some 42,000 people took part in the unrest across the country, Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli was quoted as saying by state TV. 
To try to allay tensions, the government suspended its planned fuel price hikes and cash handout cuts. Ali Rabiei, Iran's minister of cooperatives, labor and social welfare, said the government had plans to create over 900,000 jobs by March 2019, the state news agency IRNA reported on Friday.
Iranian officials said the protests were the result of foreign instigation and mocked U.S. President Donald Trump's support of protesters against what he called a “brutal and corrupt” establishment. 
The authorities have produced no evidence of any U.S. role in the demonstrations, which have lacked a unifying leader.
GUARDS QUELLED UNREST
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Iran's statements that external influences fomented the unrest were not groundless and that Washington used any possible method to destabilize governments it disliked.
He added that U.S. calls for an extraordinary meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss the turmoil in Iran interfered with the country's sovereignty, news agency Interfax said. The Council met on Friday to discuss Iran.
Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Gholamali Khoshroo told the U.N. Security Council meeting that the United States had abused its power as a permanent member of the Council by calling for a meeting on the turmoil in Iran.
He added that Iran had “hard evidence” that recent protests in Iran were “very clearly directed from abroad”.
But U.S. Ambassador to U.N. Nikki Haley said the United States stood ""unapologetically with those in Iran who seek freedom for themselves, prosperity for their families, and dignity for their nation"".
""We will not be quiet. No dishonest attempt to call protesters 'puppets of foreign powers' will change that. The Iranian people know the truth. And we know the truth,"" she told the U.N. meeting on Iran. 
Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif wrote on his Twitter account that the meeting was ""another foreign policy blunder of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration"".
Residents contacted by Reuters in various cities said the protests had shown sign of abating since Thursday, after the establishment intensified a crackdown on the protesters by dispatching Revolutionary Guards forces to several provinces.
Iran's elite Guards and its affiliated Basij militia suppressed the country's 2009 unrest over alleged election fraud, in which dozens of pro-reform Iranians were killed. 
UNITED FRONT
On Friday rallies, protesters chanted ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"", carrying pictures of Iran's top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and waved Iranian flags.
Television footage of rallies in several cities showed people chanting ""We support Imam Khamenei ... We will not leave him alone in his fight against enemies"". 
""Demonstrators demand the punishment of those behind foreign-linked riots which insulted religion and our authorities,"" state television reported, referring to unrest in which social media footage showed protesters tearing down pictures of Khamenei.
Hardliner Khatami said the government should take more notice of Iranians' economic problems. 
""There are workers who say they have not received their salaries for months ... These problems should be resolved,"" Khatami said, according to state TV.
Fearing that further unrest could undermine the Islamic republic altogether, Iran's faction-ridden political elite has displayed a united front.
But Khamenei and his hardline allies have criticized Iranian President Hassan Rouhani for failing to revive the economy after most sanctions on Iran were lifted in 2016 under a deal reached between Tehran and major powers aimed at curbing the country's nuclear program. 

Rouhani secured the deal in 2015, raising hopes of better economic times among many Iranians, but discontent has since risen over the lack of broad improvement in living standards.

In a royal decree published by state news media, the king also ordered the payment of 5,000 riyals to military personnel serving at the front lines with Yemen where the kingdom is fighting a nearly three-year-old war.
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, roughly doubled gasoline prices on Monday as part of a broad reform initiative aimed at diversifying its economy. A 5 percent VAT on a broad range of goods and services came into effect the same day.
The new payment orders were an acknowledgment of ""the increased burdens for some segments of the population following from the necessary measures which the state took to restructure the economy,"" according to the decree.
King Salman directed the state to bear the burden of VAT in some situations, including special health and education services as well as the first purchase of a house that is valued up to 850,000 riyals ($226,660). Allowances for students, retirees and social security recipients were also boosted.

Saudi Arabia will slow plans to eliminate subsidies for a wide range of energy products, according to a new long-term fiscal plan in the 2018 state budget.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Street crews dug out snow-clogged roads across the U.S. Northeast on Friday after a powerful blizzard, with temperatures set to plunge further during a brutal cold spell that has already killed at least 18 people.
From Baltimore to Caribou, Maine, workers battled to clear snow and ice as wind chills were forecast to fall as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius) in some areas after sundown, according to the National Weather Service. 
In the latest fatality blamed on the harsh conditions, a driver slid off an icy road, killing a pedestrian, early on Friday in North Charleston, South Carolina, city officials said.
""THE DANGERS ARE REAL,"" the officials warned in a Twitter message. ""Huge patches of ice all over the city. Stay at home.""
The 17-year-old driver was arrested on charges of going too fast for the conditions and driving without a license, police spokesman Spencer Pryor said in an email.
The fierce cold will reach from New England to the Midwest and down to the Carolinas, forecasters warned, adding that low-temperature records could be broken across the region over the coming days.
In much of New England on Friday, the highs reached only into the single digits or teens Fahrenheit, with intense wind chills, said Dan Pydynowski, a meteorologist with private forecasting service AccuWeather.
""It can be very dangerous,"" Pydynowski said. ""Any kind of exposed skin can freeze in a couple of minutes."" Wind chill describes the combined effect of wind and low temperatures on bare skin.
There were noticeably fewer tourists on Friday afternoon in New York City's Times Square (NYSE:SQ), which is usually thronged with visitors from countries around the world.
Arjun Shah, a 22-year-old Briton, studies in Indiana but had never visited the U.S. East Coast before. He flew in to New York City, where temperatures have been below freezing since Christmas Day, just 24 hours before the blizzard struck.
""Oh it's so bad! It's not this bad in London,"" Shah said, shivering while taking a break from snapping photos of the square. ""It's my first time experiencing minus 10 degrees C."" (14F).
FROZEN MONUMENTS
In Washington, bundled-up tourists ventured onto the frozen Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial before being shooed away by a National Park Service ranger. 
The memorial, also normally busy with visitors, was mostly vacant with temperatures in the teens and bone-chilling winds that sent American flags whipping straight out from their poles.
""I don't think I've felt this cold, ever,"" exclaimed Zoie Irwin, a 19-year-old student from San Francisco State University as she huddled with friends.
At the nearby National World War II Memorial, Varun Solipuram, a 31-year-old native of Hyderabad, India, who studies in California, said he was taken aback by the spectacle of the snow in the bright winter sun.
""It's really beautiful,"" Solipuram said. ""This is something exciting for me.""
The storm that swept in on Thursday with gusts of more than 70 miles per hour (113 km per hour), dumped a foot (30 cm) or more of snow throughout the region, including Boston and parts of New Jersey and Maine, before ending early Friday.
The harsh conditions were powered by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a ""bomb cyclone.""
The weather has been blamed for at least 18 deaths in the past few days, including four in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas.
The frigid spell also had some unusual effects: cold-shocked iguanas fell out of trees in Florida, while wildlife officials in the state said they had rescued more than 200 stunned sea turtles from freezing waters.
Children in Boston and Baltimore enjoyed a second day of canceled classes, while New York schools stayed open. Schools in Newark, New Jersey, opened two hours later than normal.
Commuters riding the railways serving New York and Boston's suburbs endured extensive delays as crews worked to repair frozen equipment and clear snow-covered tracks.
New York's John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports resumed flights on Friday after closing during whiteout conditions the day before. More than 1,300 U.S. flights were canceled by Friday afternoon, most of them at the New York area's three major airports and Boston Logan International Airport. 

Nearly 500 members of the National Guard were activated to assist with the emergency response along the East Coast, including 200 in New York state, authorities said.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",FBI agent describes grisly warehouse in start of body broker's trial,"By Steve Friess and John Shiffman
DETROIT (Reuters) - The warehouse of a Michigan man who sold donated body parts to researchers was littered with dead flies, dog bowls and human remains “frozen together in flesh-on-flesh chunks,” a federal agent testified Friday.
The grisly description came during the opening day in the federal trial of businessman Arthur Rathburn, who sold or leased donated body parts, including human heads, to medical researchers for two decades.
The buying and selling of body parts for research and education is legal under U.S. law, which does not govern the industry. Current regulations only cover body parts intended for transplant, such as hearts and livers. 
Rathburn, however, is charged with defrauding customers by selling them body parts infected with hepatitis and HIV, and with lying to federal agents about shipments.
During opening statements, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Neal told jurors that human remains were stored so haphazardly that Rathburn needed a crowbar to separate frozen parts. Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Leslie Larson testified that during the 2013 search of Rathburn’s warehouse, officials found a filthy scene, with no running water or heat.
“Body parts were out in the open, in coolers,” Larson testified. “Some of the freezers had heads and torsos, some had arms and legs. Many were frozen together in flesh-on-flesh chunks.” 
Rathburn’s lawyer, James Howarth, urged the jury to focus on the documents in the case, not gruesome photographs. He said that Rathburn’s ex-wife, Elizabeth, is “most responsible” for any wrongdoing. She has pleaded guilty to one count of fraud and is expected to testify for the government.
“This case is so sensitive because the nature of the evidence is going to make us all cringe, make us all uneasy,” Howarth told the jury. “There’s nothing particularly pretty about a deceased body that has been separated into parts, but I would hope no one would have bad feelings toward Mr. Rathburn because of that.”
The government’s failure to stop Rathburn sooner, despite a decade of warning signs, was one in a series of stories Reuters reported last year about the largely unregulated body broker industry.
As part of the news agency’s examination of the industry, a Reuters reporter was able to purchase two human heads and a cervical spine from a body broker in Tennessee. The deals were struck after just a few emails, at a cost of $900 plus shipping.
The series also profiled two Phoenix brokers - one who earned at least $12 million from the sale or use of donated body parts and another who regularly supplied Rathburn. The broker who sold Rathburn body parts, Steve Gore, pleaded guilty to defrauding customers and is expected to testify against Rathburn. 
Last month, Reuters reported that federal agents discovered four preserved fetuses during the search of Rathburn’s warehouse. According to government photographs obtained by the news agency, the fetuses appear to have been in their second trimester.

The fetus photographs are not cited in any court filings and it is unclear if they will be presented at trial.

Political turmoil was triggered in 2015 when opposition parties accused then prime minister Nikola Gruevski and his counter-intelligence chief of orchestrating the wiretapping of more than 20,000 people.
The EU, which Macedonia aspires to join, brokered an agreement in which parties agreed to hold early elections and establish the office of a special prosecutor to investigate the content of the wiretaps.
The two Macedonians, aged 51 and 35, were accused by Macedonian authorities of destroying machines used in wiretapping.
They were arrested in October at an airport in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki carrying fake Bulgarian passports.

Israel said on Wednesday it would pay thousands of African migrants living illegally in the country to go home or to ""third countries"", threatening them with jail if they are caught after the end of March.
The Israeli government did not say where the refugees should go. But rights groups including Hotline for Refugees and Migrants have said Uganda and Rwanda had agreed to take in migrants from Israel in the past. 
""#Rwanda has no deal whatsoever with #Israel to host any African migrant from that country,"" Rwanda's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Olivier Nduhungirehe, tweeted on Friday.
His Ugandan counterpart, Okello Oryem, echoed the message.
""There is no written agreement or any form of agreement between the government of Uganda and Israeli government to accept refugees from Israel,"" Oryem told Reuters.
Any suggestion to the contrary was ""fake news ... absolute rubbish,"" he added.
The vast majority of migrants in Israel came from Eritrea and Sudan and many say they fled war and persecution as well as economic hardship, but Israel treats them as economic migrants.

Rights groups have accused Israel of being slow to process African migrants' asylum requests as a matter of policy and denying legitimate claims to the status.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - An Israeli citizen accused of involvement in a human organ trafficking scandal in Kosovo a decade ago has been arrested in Cyprus and the authorities in Pristina have requested his extradition to face trial, police said on Friday.
Police accuse Israeli Moshe Harel of seeking out people in need of kidney transplants and of luring donors to Kosovo from Turkey and the ex-Soviet Union with the promise of up to 12,000 euros ($14,500) in payment.
Recipients, mainly Israelis, paid between 80,000 and 100,000 euros for the organs. Some donors never received any money.
""Based on an international arrest warrant the suspect M.H. was arrested a few days ago in Cyprus. He has been a wanted person since 2010,"" police spokesman Baki Kelani told Reuters.
Russia has also issued an international arrest warrant for Harel.
Cypriot authorities were not immediately available for comment on the case.
Harel was arrested in 2012 in Israel in connection with a parallel investigation, but was not extradited to Kosovo, which has no diplomatic relations with Israel.
The organ scandal came to light in 2008 when a Turkish man was stopped at Pristina airport, visibly in pain having had his kidney removed. The trafficking ring acted out of the Medicus clinic on a residential road on the outskirts of Pristina. 
The director of the clinic, urologist Lutfi Dervishi, was sentenced to eight years in jail for organized crime and human trafficking and his son Arban for seven years in 2013, though both men went into hiding and have not served their sentences.
In 2016 a Kosovo court ordered a retrial of doctors and officials convicted of involvement in the case and that trial is still ongoing. They have all denied any wrongdoing.
Police said Lutfi Dervishi had been recaptured last year and was among those now being retried. His son and another suspect in the case, Turkish doctor Yusuf Sonmez, are still at large. 
In a separate case, attention over the trafficking allegations has grown since Council of Europe envoy Dick Marty in 2010 accused Kosovo Albanian guerrilla fighters of harvesting organs from captives, mainly Serbs, during the 1998-99 Kosovo war.
A special court with international prosecutors and judges but under Kosovo law was set up to tackle Marty’s allegations but no indictments have yet been filed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A nephew of former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pleaded guilty on Friday to U.S. charges that he took part in a scheme to bribe an official at a sovereign wealth fund in order to sell a building complex in Vietnam.
Joo Hyun ""Dennis"" Bahn, 39, pleaded guilty to violating a U.S. foreign corruption law and to conspiracy before U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan.
Bahn admitted that in 2014 and 2015, he tried to arrange a bribe to secure the sale of Hanoi's Landmark 72 building complex, owned by Korean construction company Keangnam Enterprises Co Ltd. Bahn's father, Ban Ki-sang, was an executive at the company.
Bahn said he believed he was paying a $500,000 bribe to an official at Qatar's sovereign wealth fund through a middleman, New York fashion designer and blogger Malcolm Harris. In reality, Bahn said, Harris had no connection with any Qatari official and kept the money.
Prosecutors have said that Bahn agreed to pay another $2 million upon closing of the sale.
""I knew what I was doing was a bad act,"" Bahn said on Friday.
Bahn is scheduled to be sentenced on June 29. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years, though prosecutors have agreed that an appropriate sentence would be up to about seven years, according to Bahn's written plea deal.
Bahn, a South Korean citizen who lives in New Jersey and has worked as a real estate broker in Manhattan, said on Friday that he understood he would face deportation after serving his sentence.
U.S. prosecutors have also charged Ban Ki-sang, who remains at large. Prosecutors have said he enlisted his son to arrange the Landmark 72 sale to help Keangnam deal with a liquidity crisis.
Ban Ki-moon was long expected to make a bid for the presidency of South Korea, but announced in February 2017 that he would not run, decrying ""fake news"" about him and his family.
Harris pleaded guilty to money laundering and wire fraud in June, and was sentenced to three and a half years in prison in October.
Another man, Andrew Simon, was charged in October with taking part in the attempted bribery scheme. According to a criminal complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Simon met with Bahn and another person in April 2014 to discuss the bribe payment.

A lawyer for Simon could not immediately be reached for comment.

278,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",Pakistani minister decries U.S. as 'friend who always betrays',"By Drazen Jorgic and Mubasher Bukhari
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE (Reuters) - Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said the United States was behaving towards Pakistan as ""a friend who always betrays"" after Washington suspended aid and President Donald Trump accused Islamabad of lies and deceit over many years.
Opposition leader Imran Khan, a former cricket star tipped as the next prime minister, said it was time for Pakistan to ""delink"" from the United states and run down U.S. diplomatic and intelligence presence in what is a sensitive strategic area.
Washington accuses Pakistan of playing a ""double game"" by assisting Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network militants causing chaos in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies this and accuses the United States of disrespecting its vast sacrifices - casualties have numbered in the tens of thousands - in fighting terrorism.
Anti-American sentiment and tense U.S.-Pakistan ties are some way off their recent nadir in 2011, when Osama bin Laden was killed in a secret U.S. raid inside Pakistan, but the harsh rhetoric is likely to make it harder to mend future ties.
""The U.S. behavior is neither that of an ally nor of a friend,"" Asif told local Capital TV late on Thursday. ""It is a friend who always betrays.""
Small groups of students chanting ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Trump"" burnt American flags and torched photos of Trump after Friday prayers in capital Islamabad and the eastern city of Lahore. The organized protests ended swiftly.
Worsening ties may push Pakistan further into the arms of long-time ally China, which backed Islamabad after the fallout from Trump's tweet. Beijing's diplomatic and financial support has also strengthened Pakistan's hand, analysts say.
On Friday, Pakistan's foreign office criticized what it called ""shifting goalposts"" after the U.S. confirmed it would suspend all security assistance, believed to total at least $900 million, until Pakistan stopped assisting militants.
Other official government statements in response to Trump's tweet have been measured but Foreign Minister Asif and several other prominent politicians have lashed out repeatedly.
Opposition leader Khan said Trump's tweet and other U.S. comments were part of ""deliberate attempts to humiliate and insult the Pakistani nation"" and called for retaliation.
""It is time for Pakistan to delink from the US,"" Khan said in a statement, which called for an immediate removal of ""excessive US diplomatic, non-diplomatic and intelligence personnel from Pakistan"".
Khan also called for a suspension of land and air transport routes through Pakistan that the U.S. uses to resupply NATO troops in Afghanistan, a move Pakistani officials privately say is unlikely unless relations drastically deteriorate.
U.S. aid suspension was announced days after Trump tweeted that United States had foolishly given Pakistan $33 billion in aid over 15 years and were rewarded with ""nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools"".
The aid suspension was largely expected by Islamabad but Pakistani officials were taken aback by Trump's withering tweet and the tone of U.S. announcements.
""The FBI, his political opponents, African-American football players are used to Trump criticizing them like this on Twitter -- we are not used to it,"" said one Pakistani government minister.
""We were seriously shocked.""
Politicians such as Asif and Khan have been delivering anti-American statements partly to placate domestic audiences, analysts say, with one eye on general elections due in mid-2018.
""This is the election period and for the first time in Pakistan’s history, anti-Americanism will become an issue in an election campaign,"" said Pakistani writer and analyst Zahid Hussain.
""READY TO EAT GRASS""
There is a long history of anti-Americanism in Pakistan and after the Osama bin Laden raid, which many Pakistanis saw as violation of the country's sovereignty, relations neared breaking point in 2011.
That year, NATO forces bombed a Pakistani army checkpoint, killing 24 soldiers, and CIA contractor Raymond Davis shot dead two Pakistanis in Lahore.
In the north-western city of Peshawar, many Pakistanis cited the aid suspensions as another reason for Pakistan to sever ties with Washington.
""We are ready to eat grass, but only if our leaders become honest and make bold decisions against the Americans,"" said Jalal Noor Khan, 48, a food merchant.
The flag burnings in Lahore and Islamabad were organized by student organizations with links to hardline religious groups. About 60 students were protesting in Islamabad and another 100 in Lahore.
""The U.S. flag and Trump's photos are under our feet. It's a message to them that they will face the same if they did anything wrong against Pakistan,"" said Rana Zeeshan, one of the student organizers of the Lahore protest.

""We will erase the U.S. from the world's map.""

279,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Syrian govt. presses Idlib offensive as people flee homes in the cold,"By Lisa Barrington and Ellen Francis
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Rapid advances by the Syrian army into rebels' largest remaining stronghold, Idlib province, have brought it closer to a key insurgent-held military airport and displaced tens of thousands of people struggling to find shelter in winter weather. 
Supported by Iran-backed militias and Russian air power, President Bashar al-Assad's forces have taken territory in northeastern Hama and southern Idlib provinces since beginning an offensive in late October.
The fighting and air strikes have forced more than 60,000 people to leave their homes since Nov. 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). 
In recent days the offensive has escalated, with forces progressing towards the strategic Abu al-Duhur military airport, to which rebels laid siege in 2012 before completely ousting Assad's forces in September 2015. 
A commander in a military alliance fighting in support of Damascus has said the army and its allies intend to capture the air base.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Friday the Syrian army and its allies had taken around 84 villages since Oct. 22, including at least 14 in the past 24 hours.
The Britain-based war monitor said the rapid advance this week was made possible by intense air strikes which caused rebels to withdraw.
The Syrian army lost Idlib province, which borders Turkey, to insurgents when the provincial capital fell to insurgents in 2015. It became the only province fully under opposition control. 
Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al-Qaeda's former branch in Syria formerly called the Nusra Front, is the main rebel force in the province. 
A Syrian military source said the Nusra Front and its allies are the target of the military operation in northeast Hama and southeast Idlib provinces.
""The army's operations there are continuing and the army is achieving advances. The terrorists (are facing) big losses in the area,"" he told Reuters.
Idlib is part of Russian-engineered ""de-escalation zones"" meant to reduce fighting in western Syria. Turkish troops are also present in northern Idlib under the de-escalation deal struck with Assad's allies Russia and Iran.
""De-escalation zones do not cover the Nusra Front at all, and the Nusra Front is in reality the one fully controlling Idlib,"" the military source said.
Tahrir al-Sham is simultaneously under attack from Islamic State, which has been expanding a small pocket of territory in northeastern Hama on the edge of the Idlib enclave since the Syrian army ousted it from central Syria in October last year. 
Mustafa al-Haj Yousef, head of Idlib's Civil Defence, rescuers who work in opposition-controlled areas of Syria, said: ""If martyrs, the displaced, the injured, are on the rise, collapsing the houses, striking civilians, targeting civilians? It's as if there's no de-escalation.""
DE-ESCALATION?
The United Nations said the situation of civilians newly displaced by the fighting in Idlib was ""dire"", with humanitarian agencies struggling to meet their needs.
Yousef, of the Civil Defence, said that even after fleeing heavy frontline air strikes and shelling, people face an air campaign deeper inside the province. 
He said there are not enough camps to cope with the flows, warning that if the army pushes up to Abu al-Duhur and beyond, ""the displacement will double, it will multiply"". 
""Most of them are sleeping on the ground, in tents that can't protect from the rain or the cold. Some people are able to rent, but the rent prices have also been very high.""
Idlib has been a haven for tens of thousands of rebels and civilians forced to abandon their homes in other parts of western Syria that the government and its foreign military allies have recaptured. 
It has also been the target of intensive Russian and Syrian air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians and destroyed hospitals and civil defense centers.
Communities and camps, already hosting thousands of displaced, are struggling to absorb new arrivals. 
U.N. OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said that in Idlib province 55 percent of communities are overburdened. In around 10 percent of these communities, internally displaced persons make up more than 70 percent of the total population.
OCHA also said the fighting had forced some humanitarian organizations to stop work in parts of southern Idlib. 
""The greatest need we're seeing among people struggling to survive in this part of Syria is for food. Having been displaced repeatedly by conflict, they've exhausted their resources and are left with few choices, none of them good,"" said Christy Delafield of Mercy Corps, one of the largest organizations delivering aid in Syria.
""It doesn't look to us like things will get easier any time soon.""

The U.S. Treasury said in a statement that it had put the former food minister, Rodolfo Marco, who is also a former finance minister appointed by President Nicolas Maduro, on its Venezuela sanctions list.
It also listed Francisco Rangel, a former governor of Bolivar state; Fabio Zavarse Pabon, a commander in the national armed forces; and Gerardo Izquierdo Torres, a state minister.
The Treasury action freezes any assets the men have under U.S. jurisdiction and bars U.S. citizens from dealing with them.
Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
The move is Washington's latest action targeting individual politicians and security figures for what U.S. President Donald Trump has called an erosion of democracy. Venezuela is reeling from an economic crisis, with millions struggling with food and medicine shortages. 
""President Maduro and his inner circle continue to put their own interests above those of the Venezuelan people,"" U.S Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in a statement.
""This action underscores the United States’ resolve to hold Maduro and others engaged in corruption in Venezuela accountable.""

Maduro regularly laughs off Washington's disapproval and blames the U.S. ""empire"" for Venezuela's economic woes.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Slightly fewer than half as many migrants reached Europe by sea in 2017 than 2016, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Friday, with curbs finally cutting traffic on the deadly route from Libya to Italy.
Two years after more than a million people entered the EU, mostly fleeing war in the Middle East and poverty in Africa, the IOM recorded 171,635 arrivals by boat in 2017. The 2016 figure was 363,504.
The biggest influx of refugees and migrants in Europe since World War Two caused a political and humanitarian crisis two years ago.
Since then, the main Eastern Mediterranean route between Turkey and Greece has largely been shut by a deal between the EU and Ankara.
Reducing traffic has been slower on the other main route, across the central Mediterranean from North Africa to Italy, where thousands of people have died at sea. But numbers finally started coming down sharply in the second half of last year.
Arrivals by boat in Italy accounted for most of the 2017 arrivals: 119,310 in total, down by a third compared to the previous year, the Italian Interior Ministry said on Dec 31.
""We can tell you with confidence that the numbers from North Africa to Italy this year are under 120,000...That's the lowest in the last four years for arrivals in Italy,"" IOM spokesman Joel Millman told a news briefing.
""The same can be said for the arrivals in Greece with 29,595 for 2017, absolutely the lowest in the four years we have been keeping numbers on Greece,"" he said. In 2016, some 173,614 migrants arrived by sea in Greece, according to IOM figures.
Some 21,663 migrants arrived in Spain as of Dec. 28 last year, while 1,067 landed in Cyprus, preliminary figures show.
More patrols and rescues off the coast of Libya, as well as fighting between smuggling groups, contributed to the overall drop, Millman said.
The number of migrant deaths at sea has not been finalised, but stands at 3,116, compared to 5,143 recorded in 2016, Millman said.
""We think of those as extremely positive developments,"" he said.
African migrants in Libya continue to depart for Europe from the coast, where the IOM is monitoring rescues, he said, adding: ""Boats are still rescuing in the hundreds every day, depending on the day, sub-Saharan Africans who have come through Libya.""
Nearly 20,000 Africans went home last year under IOM's voluntary repatriation program from Libya, including 7,000 since an African Union - European Union agreement reached in Abidjan on Nov. 29, Millman said.

The United Nations agency aims to repatriate a further 15,000 migrants from Libya by the end of January, he told Reuters.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>","As Macron embarks on China tour, reciprocity is the word","By Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron's visit to China next week will be the first by a major European leader since the Communist party's recent leadership congress, and he will use it to try to secure greater access for French companies and forge a yet-to-be-defined Asia policy.
In his first official visit to the world's second-largest economy since his election last May, Macron is expected to push for a more level playing field in trade relations, as France tries to cut a 30 billion-euro trade deficit with China.
""There's an ambition to rebalance, get more reciprocity in access to Chinese markets and fairer competition conditions,"" an advisor to Macron said on condition of anonymity.
By reciprocity, French officials mean easier access for foreign companies to regulated or protected sectors of the Chinese economy. Chinese officials say that concept is ""relative"" in an emerging economy.
Like other Westerners, the French have long complained about China's rules for foreign investments and its demands for technology transfers and compulsory joint-ventures with local rivals.
French carmakers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Peugeot-Citroen in particular have had to set up partnerships with domestic companies but have had only limited success in gaining a slice of the world's biggest auto market.
French officials hope the emergence of a prosperous Chinese middle-class will give French companies, which tend to specialize in consumer products, an edge over German rivals more focused on machinery and equipment.
But besides the usual race for market share, Macron's advisors say he will also defend a common European Union line for freer trade between the blocs, in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric.
As an economy minister in the previous Socialist government, Macron led the fight to toughen EU anti-dumping rules imports of cheap Chinese steel surged. 
In June, he also urged the Commission to build a system for screening investments in strategic sectors from outside the bloc, which drew criticism from Beijing.
""Even if on the surface the trip goes smoothly and faux-pas are avoided because the two presidents are smart and it's the first state visit, I think on substance each will firmly defend their own priorities,"" Alice Ekman of the Paris-based think tank IFRI told Reuters.
A delegation of 50 company executives, from nuclear giants EDF (PA:EDF) and Areva, planemaker Airbus and hotels group  Accor  (PA:ACCP), as well as representatives of the French beef, pork and milk lobbies are expected to travel with Macron.
Airbus is in talks to sell 100 or more jetliners to China during the visit, sources said.
DEFINING FRANCE'S ASIA POLICY
The trip will also be an opportunity for the 40-year-old president, who has mostly focused on Europe and its neighborhood since his election, to define his country's role in Asia.
The two countries are expected to discuss security issues such as North Korea, after Pyongyang agreed to hold talks with the South next week amid a standoff over its nuclear and missile programs.
French officials have touted the fight against climate change as another key issue for cooperation with China, now that Trump has announced he would pull out of the Paris climate accord signed in 2015.

History and symbols will also feature on the trip, as they did with Trump and Putin, whom Macron received in grandiose settings such as the Champs-Elysees and the Palace of Versailles. Macron is expected to visit cultural landmarks such as the ancient Terracotta Army in the former capital of Xian and the Forbidden City in Beijing, the ancient home of China's emperors.

A wave of attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents on the security posts on Aug. 25 sparked sweeping army counter-insurgency operations in the Muslim-majority north of the state that led to widespread violence and arson and an exodus of some 650,000 Rohingya villagers to Bangladesh.
The United Nations condemned the Myanmar military campaign as ethnic cleansing. Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejected that.
But since Aug. 25, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgents, who claimed responsibility for the coordinated raids on 30 security posts, have mounted only a few sporadic attacks.
The government did not identify the insurgents involved in the Friday attack on a vehicle taking someone to hospital but the military said in a statement they were ""extremist Bengali terrorists ARSA”.
""A vehicle ... was attacked by 20 insurgents from the mountain using homemade mines and small arms,"" the government said. The military said there were about 10 attackers.
An ARSA spokesman was not available for comment. There was no mention of any incident on a Twitter account that routinely carries statements from the group.
The Yangon-based Frontier Myanmar magazine quoted a resident of a nearby village as saying sporadic gunfire had been heard at the time of the ambush.
The area is largely off-limits to reporters.
Myanmar and Bangladesh have been discussing a plan to repatriate the Rohingya refugees but more insecurity in Myanmar is likely to raise doubts about how quickly that might take place.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Georgian ex-president sentenced in absentia for abuse of power,"TBILISI (Reuters) - A Georgian court sentenced former leader Mikheil Saakashvili in absentia to three years in prison on Friday for seeking to cover up evidence about the murder of a Georgian banker when he was president - a verdict which he denounced as illegal.
Georgia said it would seek the extradition of Saakashvili, who was president from 2004-2013, from Ukraine where he is an active opposition figure and has had violent brushes with authorities.
A court in the Georgian capital Tbilisi found Saakashvili guilty of abusing his presidential powers by trying to cover up evidence about the 2006 murder of banker Sandro Girgvliani and pardoning four men convicted of the killing.
Saakashvili called the verdict illegal.
""The 'verdict' of the Georgian court ... against me is completely illegal and contradicts all international, national norms and common sense,"" Saakashvili wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Friday.
Ukraine said it would consider Georgia's extradition request though legal procedures would have to be followed.
""Prosecutors are in the process of arranging a date for Saakashvili's questioning due to Georgia's request to extradite him,"" Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian prosecutor general, told Reuters by phone in Kiev.
The 50-year-old Saakashvili, a mercurial figure, moved to Ukraine in 2014.
His support for Ukraine's pro-Europe Maidan movement, which forced a Russian-backed president to flee the country, won him favor from incoming President Petro Poroshenko who appointed him governor of the Black Sea Odessa region.
But he has fallen out badly with his former patron in Ukraine after accusing him of corruption and is under suspicion of assisting a criminal organization, which he denies.

He attracts big crowds to rallies in Ukraine and there have been occasional violent clashes between his supporters and police in Kiev.

287,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Clashes break out near South Sudan capital in truce violation,"JUBA (Reuters) - Clashes have broken out near South Sudan's capital Juba between government troops and rebels, officials said on Friday, the latest violation of a ceasefire signed last month.
The deal reached in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa between the government of President Salva Kiir and a myriad of opposition groups had aimed to end a four-year-old war in which tens of thousands of people have been killed.
But several violations have since taken place, for which all sides have been blamed.
On Friday, the army's spokesman Lul Ruai Koang said several people were killed after rebel troops attempted to seize a military outpost west of Juba held by Kiir's Sudan People's Liberation Army.
""At about 10:30 p.m. last night, bandits under the direct command of Lieutenant Colonel Chan Garang attacked the SPLA's position at the north of Kapur,"" he told a news conference, referring to a high-ranking officer who defected from the government last year.
Koang did not give details on how many had died, but said fighting was going on.
Rebels under former vice president Riek Machar, whose sacking in mid-2013 amid a power struggle triggered the civil war months later, denied the charges.
""That was not us, we never attack Juba,"" said Lam Paul Gabriel, the group's deputy spokesperson. ""It is government propaganda (meant) to accuse us of violations."" 
The conflict in the world's youngest country has been fought largely along ethnic lines, pitting forces loyal to Kiir - an ethnic Dinka - and Machar, who is Nuer.
The war has forced a third of South Sudan's 12 million-strong population to flee their homes.
The ceasefire is intended to revive a 2015 peace deal that collapsed in 2016 after heavy fighting erupted in Juba, with talks on a new power-sharing arrangement and a new date for polls scheduled to follow.
It is also designed to allow humanitarian groups access to civilians caught in the fighting.
Neighboring countries who brokered that agreement have warned the warring sides that they would back punitive measures if violations persisted.

Zimbabwe is due to hold elections in 2018 in the first big test of Mnangagwa's legitimacy after he rose to power in November last year following a de facto military coup which saw veteran leader Robert Mugabe reluctantly cede power.
Mnangagwa has previously indicated polls could be held as early as March, and is under pressure from civil society, would-be investors and opposition parties to implement political reforms following Mugabe's 37-year grip on power. 
""Currently there is no need,"" Mnangagwa told reporters, referring to the possibility of forming a coalition with Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).
Mnangagwa's ZANU-PF party and the MDC were partners in a government of national unity for five years until 2013, eventually breaking down as acrimony between the parties re-emerged. 
Tsvangirai, who is due to challenge Mnangagwa in national elections, has been receiving treatment for colon cancer since 2016 but says he is in good health. 

""He is fine, he is recuperating very well and says he will soon again be having a medical check-up in South Africa,"" said Mnangagwa after visiting Tsvangirai at his home.

Flight MH370, carrying 239 people, disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014. Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless search in January last year. 
An email, sent from the MH Family Support Centre and seen by Reuters, said the government had accepted an offer by the company, Ocean Infinity, to resume the search on a ""no cure, no fee"" basis, meaning the company will only get paid if they find the plane.
A government spokesman declined to confirm that an email had been sent to families but said more details on the deal would be forthcoming. Ocean Infinity did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The company said on Wednesday it had moved a vessel closer to a possible search area. The vessel left Durban, South Africa, on Tuesday and was headed to Perth, Australia, Reuters shipping data showed. 
Investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the transponder of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 before diverting it over the Indian Ocean. 

Several pieces of aircraft debris have been collected from Indian Ocean islands and along Africa's east coast, with at least three being confirmed as being from the missing plane.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The two sides sit within shouting distance, but when North and South Korea this week arranged the first official talks in more than two years, liaison officials spoke using desktop telephone consoles each the size of a small refrigerator.
The inter-Korean Liaison Office at the heart of this new spurt of dialogue between the two sides, sits at the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom, the only spot along the heavily fortified demilitarized zone that divides North and South Korea where troops from both sides stand face to face.
If the telephone operators wanted to, they could step out of their office and talk to their counterparts only 80 meters (260 feet) away in a separate building across the demarcation line.
""Like what happened today (Friday), we mostly exchange what we call a 'telephone notice,' which basically means that a liaison officer calls the other side and reads a document carrying a proposal or official position on the other's proposal,"" said a senior official with South Korea's Ministry of Unification, which mans the phone and fax lines at the office. 
""But other times, say, if you need to deliver a document with official seals, you would call them to arrange a face-to-face meeting at a certain time on the demarcation line.""
That happened on a regular basis in the past, when relations were better, the official said, and now Seoul is hoping that these new high-level talks, scheduled for January 9, may bring back an era of more cordial relations between the two Koreas.
""A VERY DELICATE JOB"" 
North Korean officials had effectively not answered the phone at Panmunjom since February 2016. During that time, South Korean officials would sometimes use a bull horn to shout messages across the border.
For the first time in nearly two years, the hotline was used on Wednesday. On the orders of leader Kim Jong Un, a North Korean official called the South in a preliminary step to a formal dialogue.
Officials have released few details of that conversation and several others that have since occurred, although some were decidedly anticlimactic.
After several calls on Wednesday, a North Korean official called to check the line. When the South's officer asked if the North had anything new to say, the official on the other end of the line said ""no"" and hung up, according to the Ministry of Unification.
But by Friday, the conversations paid off, officials said, with North Korea officially accepting the South's invitation for formal, face-to-face talks next week on North Korean participation at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea next month.
The phone line used to arrange the talks dates to the 1970s, with the current phone installed in 2009, the ministry said.
Photos of the phone show a large, wood-panelled console set into a desktop.
The system features a computer screen, disk drives, and USB ports, as well as two telephone handsets, one red and one green.
No other numbers can be called - the phones use a dedicated line between rooms on the two sides.
""The red phone is for incoming calls from North Korea and South Korea uses the green phone to make outgoing calls to the North,"" a unification ministry spokeswoman said. ""We have installed two phones just in case one breaks or something.""
The Unification Ministry employees who man the phones on the South side are experts in diplomatic protocol and have in the past played roles in face-to-face talks as well.
""At first sight it may seem a very simple job,"" the senior ministry official said. ""But actually it’s a very delicate job because they are not only in charge of the Panmunjom line but when inter-Korean meetings are held, they are also dispatched to the venue as a contact point between the two sides.""
While the phone operators are discouraged from making any jokes about official issues during their conversations, they have in the past built a personal relationship with their counterparts during periods of close communication.
""As they man the position for a long time, they would talk to each other frequently and therefore naturally foster some personal rapport,"" the official said.

Less is known about the North Koreans on the other end of the line. A South Korean liaison officer who engaged in some of the recent conversations said he has never seen his counterparts' office on the other side, and referred further questions to the Unification Ministry.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 05:57AM ET</span>",'World is doomed': Erdogan denounces U.S. justice after Turkish banker trial,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Tayyip Erdogan denounced U.S. justice on Friday and suggested Turkey could rethink some bilateral agreements with Washington, after a U.S. court convicted a Turkish banker in a trial that included testimony of corruption by top Turkish officials.
In his first public comments on Wednesday's verdict, the Turkish president cast the case as American plot to undermine Turkey's government and economy - an argument likely to resonate with nationalist supporters.
""If this is the U.S. understanding of justice, then the world is doomed,"" Erdogan told a news conference before his departure to France for an official visit.
A U.S. jury convicted an executive of Turkey's majority state-owned Halkbank (IS:HALKB) of evading Iran sanctions, at the close of the trial which has strained relations between the NATO allies. Some of the court testimony implicated senior Turkish officials, including Erdogan. Ankara has said the case was based on fabricated evidence.
Without being specific, Erdogan said the case put agreements between the two countries into jeopardy: ""....The bilateral accords between us are losing their validity. I am saddened to say this, but this is how it will be from now on.""
Turkey's foreign ministry on Thursday condemned the conviction as unprecedented meddling in its internal affairs. The row has unnerved investors and weighed on the lira currency, which hit a series of record lows last year.
The court case has put pressure on relations between Washington and the biggest Muslim country in NATO, already strained since a 2016 failed coup in Turkey which Erdogan blames on followers of a cleric who lives in the United States. 
Only last week the United States and Turkey lifted all visa restrictions against each other, ending a months-long visa dispute that began when Washington suspended visa services at its Turkish missions after two local employees of the U.S. consulate were detained on suspicion of links to the coup. 
The Halkbank executive, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, was convicted on five of six counts, including bank fraud and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions law. The case was based on the testimony of a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab, who cooperated with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of leading a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.
In his testimony Zarrab implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said Erdogan, then prime minister, had personally authorised two Turkish banks to join the scheme.
Turkey says the case was based on fabricated evidence and has accused U.S. court officials of ties to the cleric Turkey blames for the coup attempt. The bank has denied any wrongdoing and said its transactions were in line with local and international regulations.

""The United States is carrying out ... a chain of plots, and these are not just legal but also economic plots,"" Erdogan said.

293,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Second time lucky? Merkel starts over with coalition talks,"By Madeline Chambers
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, weakened by an election setback in September, launches a second bid to build a coalition government on Sunday when she sits down with the Social Democrats (SPD) for exploratory talks.
A re-run of her 'grand coalition' with the SPD, in power from 2013 to 2017, appears the best option for conservative Merkel is as it would provide stability in what would be her fourth term.
But with success far from guaranteed, there are a range of other possible scenarios.
After her conservatives bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the Sept. 24 national election, Merkel saw her authority undermined two months later by the collapse of three-way coalition talks with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens.
That shifted her focus back to the SPD, but the center-left party is wary of another tie-up with Merkel after voters punished it for four years of power-sharing in the September vote, when its support slumped to its lowest level since 1933. 
The consensus among politicians and commentators is that the talks will last at least until March. 
Although the current caretaker government under Merkel is keeping things ticking over, investors fear that protracted talks will delay what they view as necessary reforms in Europe's biggest economy and the bloc as a whole.
After a flow of leaks, tweets and selfies emanating from last year's three-way coalition talks undermined trust, this time around participants have agreed to a news blackout during negotiations. 
Here are the main scenarios:
GRAND COALITION OF CONSERVATIVES, SPD
The most likely outcome, given that the two camps have ruled together for eight of the 12 years Merkel has been chancellor and broadly agree on foreign and security policy. However, with both blocs struggling to stem a fall in support, it is by no means a done deal.
They are at odds on a range of issues, from tax to healthcare and Europe. The SPD wants a wholesale reform of health insurance to end what it describes as a two-tier system. Conservatives oppose this idea and are more skeptical than the SPD on plans for deeper EU integration. 
Migrant policy is likely to be one of the trickiest issues as Germany struggles to integrate the more than 1.6 million asylum seekers who have arrived since the start of 2015. 
Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), has called for benefit cuts for asylum seekers and wants limits on family members joining refugees in Germany - anathema to the SPD. 
Offering the greatest degree of stability, this tie-up is Merkel's favored option but many SPD members are wary. The party had promised to go into opposition after its worst election result since 1933.
The SPD leadership, worried about internal splits, seems certain to make tough demands and has stressed that the outcome of talks is open. It is offering members a vote on Jan. 21 after 'exploratory' talks before leaders start official coalition negotiations. 
'KOKO' COOPERATION DEAL BETWEEN CONSERVATIVES, SPD
Mooted by skeptics of a grand coalition in the SPD, the center-left party would work with Merkel in some areas including the budget and European and foreign affairs but force her to find ad-hoc parliamentary majorities for other policies. 
While this is more palatable to many SPD members, many senior conservatives have rejected the idea outright, rendering it unlikely. 
MINORITY GOVERNMENT UNDER MERKEL
This would be a post-war first for a country that craves political stability - a result of the fragmentation in the years that preceded the rise of Hitler's Nazi party.
Nevertheless, some Social Democrats prefer this option, which would allow them to oppose Merkel's policies and force her to seek parliamentary majorities on individual laws. It would also be likely to hasten the end of her political career. 
NEW ELECTIONS 
Some conservatives, including Merkel, have said they would prefer new elections to a minority government. 
This scenario would also throw Merkel's future into doubt. She has indicated she could stand again and, while the absence of an obvious successor makes her the most likely candidate, her personal ratings are on the wane.
As far as the parties go, opinion polls indicate there have been no big swings since the September election. A GMS survey this week put the conservative bloc on 32 percent, unchanged from the previous week, the SPD was down 1 point at 20 percent and AfD up 1 point at 14 percent.
Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who would have to get involved if no coalition deal was agreed, has made clear he wants to avoid new elections if possible.
'JAMAICA' COALITION OF CONSERVATIVES, FDP, GREENS 
There is little appetite for a re-run of talks on this nationally untested three-way alliance, dubbed 'Jamaica' because the parties' colors match those of the Jamaican flag.
Divergences on policies from Europe to tax and migration were clear during the weeks of talks that descended into acrimony last year before collapsing.
However, some in the FDP - which was responsible for the breakdown of talks in November - have left the door open to another try if all other efforts at forming a government fail. 
OTHER OPTIONS
Some experts have pointed to the possibility of an alliance between the conservatives and Greens - easier to agree than a three-way deal with the FDP. This could get a degree of backing on some policies from the SPD. However, this seems an unlikely option and would be unstable.

294,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","White House, senators seek Iran measure ahead of nuclear deadline","By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators and Trump administration officials met at the White House on Thursday, hoping to hammer out compromise legislation to tighten restrictions on Iran while keeping Washington in an international nuclear deal with Tehran.
Senators Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Ben Cardin, the panel's top Democrat, had an evening meeting with President Donald Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, to discuss possible legislation, Senate and White House aides said.
The stakes have risen in the past week with anti-government protests in several Iranian cities over economic hardships and corruption, the boldest challenge to Iran's leadership in a decade.
Worrying European allies who co-signed the 2015 accord, Trump has railed against the deal to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for loosening sanctions reached under his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. In October, the Republican president announced that he would not certify that staying in the pact was in the U.S. national security interest, and threatened to pull out if lawmakers did not act to toughen it.
Members of Congress have been working since to come up with a bipartisan compromise that would give Trump enough political cover not to reimpose sanctions on Iranian oil before a deadline next week, an action that would kill the pact.
Aides said they were looking at measures including ending the requirement that Trump re-certify the agreement every 90 days and changing some of the so-called sunset provisions to allow the reimposition of U.S. sanctions, with no timetable, if Iran's nuclear program reaches certain thresholds.
Ahead of the meeting, Corker said he hoped enough progress had been made that Trump might not restore the sanctions.
""My sense is there's a little momentum right now, and it doesn't feel to me like we're in a place where the president might do that, but who knows,"" he told reporters at the Capitol.
CONCERN OVER PROTESTS
Corker said the protests in Iran made it more important that Washington not do anything to shift the focus from Iran's government. ""The last thing we need to do from my perspective would be to turn that attention to us,"" he said.
The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to meet Friday at 3 p.m. to discuss Iran, days after U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley called for an emergency session to discuss the protests.
The U.S. proposal was dismissed by Russia, another participant in the nuclear deal, as ""harmful and destructive,"" with ""no role for the United Nations Security Council in this issue.""
A procedural vote which no council member can veto could be used to stop the meeting. If nine of the 15 countries on the council vote to stop the meeting that would end the discussion. 
""This is a matter of fundamental human rights for the Iranian people, but it is also a matter of international peace and security,"" said Haley in a statement late on Thursday.
""It will be telling if any country tries to deny the Security Council from even having this discussion."" 
Separately, the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday sanctioned five Iranian-based entities it said were owned or controlled by an industrial firm responsible for developing and producing Iran's solid-propellant ballistic missiles.
""These sanctions target key entities involved in Iran’s ballistic missile program, which the Iranian regime prioritizes over the economic well-being of the Iranian people,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
The department said the sanctioned entities - the Shahid Eslami Research Center, Shahid Kharrazi Industries, Shahid Moghaddam Industries, Shahid Sanikhani Industries and Shahid Shustari Industries - were subordinated to the Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group.

The sanctions freeze any property the entities hold in the United States and prohibit Americans from dealing with them.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A powerful blizzard battered the U.S. Northeast on Thursday, knocking out power for tens of thousands of people and snarling travel amid a cold snap that has gripped much of the United States for over a week and killed more than a dozen people.
Thousands of flights were canceled, firefighters scrambled to rescue motorists from flooded streets in Boston, National Guard troops were mobilized in the Northeast and New York City's two main airports halted flights because of whiteout conditions.
""Today, I thought Manhattan was going to have the streets cleaned up, but I see not,"" said Valentine Williams, who usually operates an electric scooter to deliver food in New York City.
The snow forced Williams, 28, to make deliveries on foot. No customers complained that he was slower than usual. ""They're just surprised that I'm out here,"" he added. 
Officials feared fast-dropping temperatures after the storm passed would turn snow on roadways to ice.
Ahead of that threat, snow plows and salt trucks were dispatched along streets and highways, and schools were closed through much of the region. In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh said schools would remain closed on Friday. 
Blizzard warnings were in effect along the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine. The U.S. National Weather Service measured wind gusts of more than 70 miles per hour (113 kph), which downed power lines.
Almost 80,000 homes and businesses in the Northeast and Southeast, where the storm struck on Wednesday, were without power.
The Boston area received 12 inches of snow, with more on the way, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of New Jersey were buried under nearly a foot and a half of powder.
The storm was powered by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a ""bomb cyclone."" It brought high winds and swift, heavy snowfall.
The wintry weather has been blamed for at least 14 deaths in the past few days, including four in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas because of the cold.
Nearly 500 members of the National Guard were activated along the East Coast to assist with emergency response, including 200 in New York state, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement. 
TRAVEL WOES
More than 5,000 U.S. airline flights were canceled. At New York's John F. Kennedy (JFK) and LaGuardia airports, all flights were temporarily halted because of whiteout conditions, the Federal Aviation Administration said. LaGuardia on Thursday evening announced on Twitter that the suspension had been lifted. But the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said flights at JFK would not resume until 7 a.m. Friday. 
Passenger train operator Amtrak ran reduced service in the Northeast. Sporadic delays were reported on transit systems, including New York's Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines, as well as the Boston area's Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority system.
""Years of Band-Aid solutions create nightmare situations when storm damage occurs,"" said Joseph Schwieterman, a professor of public policy and specialist in transportation systems at DePaul University in Chicago. ""Replacement parts are tough to find and maintenance process turns into major headache.""
In New York's Fort Greene neighborhood, Mohammed Farid Khan said his morning commute took three times as long as usual because of train woes.
""There were only local trains, no express,"" Khan, 30, said as he hunched with an electric drill trying to fix the handle of his snow shovel inside the convenience store where he works. 
ICY RESCUES
A 3-foot (0.9-meter) tidal surge flooded the area around Boston's historic Long Wharf with icy seawater. Firefighters used an inflatable raft to rescue one motorist from a car submerged in water up to its door handles, Boston Fire Commissioner Joseph Finn told reporters.
The flooding tied a 40-year record, the National Weather Service said.
Boston officials briefly thought they would need to a evacuate a shelter near the flooded areas, Walsh said. 
Officials reported traffic accidents throughout the Northeast and the storm's reach extended to eastern Canada.

On Wednesday, the same storm brought historic cities in the Southeastern United States their heaviest snowfall in three decades.

Farage, who as UKIP leader convinced Prime Minister Theresa May's predecessor, David Cameron, to call the Brexit referendum and then helped lead the campaign for Brexit, has repeatedly scolded May for being too weak in the EU divorce talks.
He said in a video clip posted on Twitter that he would meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday and appealed for people to send him their questions to put to Barnier.
""I thought who is in there representing the views of the 17.4 million people? Nobody,"" Farage said. ""Well I've finally got my meeting with Mr Barnier. Its going to happen.""
In the United Kingdom's 2016 referendum, 51.9 percent, or 17.4 million people, voted to leave the EU while 48.1 percent, or 16.1 million people, voted to stay.
May has said Britain will leave the EU on March 29 at 2300GMT. The EU and Britain are discussing the terms of the divorce.
Farage, 53, casts the EU as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending.
He has dismissed speculation from opponents of Brexit such as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair that voters might change their mind about leaving the EU.

He did not specify what the step would be, but in November, Turkey signed a letter of intent with France and Italy on cooperation in joint defense projects and Turkish defense ministry sources said at the time it was looking into a missile system based on EUROSAM's SAMP-T system.
The comments come a week after Ankara signed an accord for Russia to supply Turkey with S-400 missile batteries - a move which has worried the West because they cannot be integrated into NATO's military architecture.
""We are ready to further our cooperation with France in every area, including defense industry,"" Erdogan told a news conference in Istanbul before departing for Paris where he will meet his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.
""The step we will be taking as France, Turkey and Italy on EUROSAM is important, and we will discuss it again today,"" he said.
Turkey's Defence Minister Nurettin Canikli had said in late November it aimed to finalize the EUROSAM deal by the end of 2017 at the latest.

Erdogan also told the news conference he would discuss with Macron subjects such as the status of Jerusalem, Iraq and Libya, as well as the latest developments on the divided island of Cyprus and European Union-related issues.

Five members of the Davao City fire department, who had inspected the mall and issued permits for it to operate, were relieved of duties and face administrative investigation.
Initial checks by the Bureau of Fire Protection revealed signs of fire safety lapses that may have contributed to the tragedy, since there were problems with ""exits, sprinkler systems and alarm systems"".

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori left hospital as a free man on Thursday, waving to supporters from a wheelchair and reigniting anger over a pardon he secured from President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski on Christmas Eve.
The pardon has polarized Peru, triggering anti-government protests and political resignations that have shaken Kuczynski's already-weak government. Kuczynski said last week he would unveil a new cabinet soon, but has announced no details yet.
A corrupt dictator to some and a misunderstood hero to others, Fujimori had been serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes during his 1990-2000 rightwing populist government.
""To the joy of many Peruvians, today Alberto Fujimori is free,"" his doctor, and former health minister, Alejandro Aguinaga, said on television channel Canal N, adding that Fujimori was still recovering from heart troubles. 
Fujimori, 79, was trailed by police escorts and news cameras as he arrived at a sprawling house in the upscale district of La Molina in Lima, the Peruvian capital.
In a snapshot shared by his daughter on social media, Fujimori was seen in a garden surrounded by his four adult children - a sign of unity that fueled speculation he would end a political rivalry between siblings Keiko and Kenji.
Wearing a jacket and blue shirt, a smiling Fujimori appeared alert as he waved to crowds outside the Lima hospital where he had been interned for what his doctor called life-threatening blood-pressure and heart problems on the eve of the pardon.
Kuczynski, a former investment banker who is 79, like Fujimori, cited the latter's ailing health when he pardoned him nearly two weeks ago. But the decision has been widely seen in Peru as payback after Fujimori enlisted his loyalists to help Kucyznski survive an impeachment bid following a graft scandal.
""You may have benefited improperly from an illegal pardon, but that does not take away your responsibility for the death and corruption of the 1990s,"" said human rights activist Gisela Ortiz, whose brother, a university student, was killed in a 1992 death squad massacre Fujimori had been convicted of commanding.
Earlier on Thursday, Fujimori's supporters rallied in front of Kuczynski's house to show support for the pardon, as critics warned Kuczynski that he would be beholden to Fujimori and the rightwing party led by his children Keiko and Kenji that has an absolute majority in Congress.
Fujimori signaled from his hospital bed last week that he would not use his freedom to return to politics, but his loyalists have called for him to become an adviser to Popular Force, which controls a majority of seats in Congress.

""There's nothing wrong with receiving advice from him, or counting on his support or counsel for a future presidential candidate,"" Popular Force lawmaker Maritza Garcia told Reuters last week. ""Because of his health he can't lead the party, but he can direct it from his bed or wheelchair.""

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Gale-force winds battered New Zealand's North Island on Friday, tearing off roofs, bringing down trees, cutting power and forcing residents to flee flooded seaside towns.
The storm, which began on Thursday, was easing in the upper part of the North Island but would continue to wreak havoc as it moved south and hit the capital, Wellington, forecasters said.
A tree smashed into a car in the eastern town of Rotorua, killing a woman, police said.
""We ask that people avoid low lying roads and coastal areas across Bay of Plenty as water levels are high, making conditions extremely dangerous,"" the statement added.
In Kaiaua, a seaside town south of Auckland, authorities called for residents to evacuate as strong tides submerged the coast.
""My husband said 'I think we need to go' and I looked to see where he was pointed and the sea was coming in like a tsunami. It came in real fast,"" Kaiaua resident Diana Gausden told the New Zealand Herald.
New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, was pummeled by two months' worth of rain in 24 hours, according to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, prompting authorities to shut major roads and cancel ferry services and dozens of flights. 
Winds of up to 128 kph (80 mph) an hour tore off roofs, felled trees and ripped boats from their moorings overnight, according to media.
More than 20,000 households had been left without power on Friday, including 12,000 in Auckland, according to media.
Electricity providers said they were working to fix dozens of separate power outages centering on Auckland. 
The storm was a dramatic interlude in an unusually dry summer, which has led to drought in many farming regions and curbed production of milk.

The National Meteorological Centre lifted a blizzard alert and said light to moderate snowfall was expected to sweep across much of the north between Friday and Sunday, with heavy snow in some parts and sleet in others. 
The weather bureau issued an alert on Wednesday, with snow disrupting public transport and energy supplies, damaging power lines and forcing authorities to shut down roads, airports and schools in parts of central China. 
All power in Suizhou, a small city of 2.5 million people in the north of central Hubei province, was down due to heavy snow, state broadcaster China Central Television reported. 
Temperatures in Suizhou are expected to plunge as low as minus 5 degrees Celsius (23 degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday.
Hubei, which does not have central heating infrastructure unlike northern provinces, has seen a spike in electricity consumption for heating, according to CCTV. 
In Wuhan, capital of Hubei, the local government has loosened restrictions on gas use for residents battling freezing temperatures.
On Thursday, at least three airports were shut and nine were experiencing extensive delays because of heavy snowfall.
Several high-speed trains from Shanghai and Beijing were also delayed or canceled on Thursday, and highways in the provinces of Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei have also been closed off, the China Daily reported.
The ceilings of several bus stations in Hefei, the capital of Anhui province, had collapsed as a result of snow, resulting in at least one death, the newspaper said. The province saw a record 30 cm (12 inches) of snow on Thursday.
The roof of a factory in Xiangyang, also in Hubei province, collapsed, trapping five people, and traffic in the city ground to a halt, according to the state broadcaster, China National Radio. 
CCTV footage on Friday also showed collapsed roofs of factories in Henan and Anhui provinces. 
By contrast, Beijing has been dry, with many parts of northern China experiencing little to no snowfall.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's legal chief, whose watch was marked by instances of perceived interference by China in the city's rule of law, stepped down on Friday, more than four years before the end of his term.
An independent legal system sits at the core of the wide-ranging autonomy promised after Britain handed its former colony back to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that guarantees it freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen had resigned for personal reasons, after starting his second five-year term in July.
""He has been a pillar of strength in upholding the rule of law in Hong Kong,"" Lam said.
But Yuen's time in office was punctuated by several controversies, including two rare protests by hundreds of lawyers.
Yuen, 53, was one of the key officials tasked with promoting a contentious political reform package in 2014, which later helped trigger the months-long ""Umbrella Movement"" street protests demanding, in vain, full democracy for the city.
He was targeted by demonstrators after reports last year that he had overruled several senior public prosecutors to seek jail terms for three democrats involved in those protests, including Joshua Wong, the bespectacled young activist who became the public face of the demonstrations.
He was also criticized for pushing through an immigration arrangement that would allow Chinese officials to implement mainland laws inside a downtown high-speed railway station.
Yuen and Communist Party officials in Beijing argued that parts of the station would be legally regarded as ""mainland Chinese territory"", so the city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which explicitly says national laws don't apply in Hong Kong, would not be applicable. 
The Hong Kong Bar Association called Beijing's move ""the most retrograde step to date in the implementation of the Basic Law"".
On each occasion, ""the ultimate decision was made in accordance with the law"", Yuen said on Friday, even though some people might not like the results.
Yuen also reportedly tried to dissuade Beijing from interfering in a court case against pro-independence lawmakers last year, and spoke openly about how ""matters that can be properly handled within Hong Kong's legal or judicial system should be left to be dealt with at the Hong Kong level as much as possible"".
The Chinese parliament ultimately issued an interpretation of the law, pre-empting the judge's decision, effectively barring the lawmakers from their posts. That prompted 2,000 lawyers to march in protest against what they said was the most blatant interference in the city's judicial independence.

Incoming Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng, 59, said her ""prime mission"" would be to uphold the rule of law and that she would pursue criminal prosecutions ""without any interference"".

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's opposition Conservatives kicked a lawmaker out of the party after she posted letters on her official government website that derided indigenous people and then refused to take them down from the site.
Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer said Thursday evening that he ejected Senator Lynn Beyak over the letters posted on her website. The letters claimed that indigenous Canadians were “pampered” in abusive residential schools and that they were looking for government handouts.
“Promoting this comment is offensive and unacceptable for a Conservative Parliamentarian,” Scheer said in a statement. “To suggest that indigenous Canadians are lazy compared to other Canadians is simply racist.”
Canadian Senators are appointed for life, though they can be expelled from political parties.
Some people have called for Beyak’s resignation since she last year defended residential schools. 
Some 150,000 children were taken from their families and sent to assimilationist schools where they were physically and sexually abused. A government commission that investigated the schools determined that their treatment of indigenous children amounted to “cultural genocide.” 
Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper formally apologized for the schools in 2008 and Canada has provided billions of dollars in compensation to victims. 
Aboriginal people continue to be over-represented among Canada’s poor, victims of violence and its prison population. People on reserves often lack clean drinking water and education for indigenous children is under-funded. 

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in November told the United Nations General Assembly that his government would do better to improve the lives of aboriginals and achieve reconciliation.

306,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 11:55PM ET</span>",U.S. suspends at least $900 million in security aid to Pakistan,"By Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it was suspending at least $900 million in security assistance to Pakistan until it takes action against the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network militant groups.
The U.S. State Department announced the decision, saying it reflected the Trump administration's frustration that Pakistan has not done more against the two groups, which have long used sanctuaries in Pakistan to launch attacks in neighboring Afghanistan that have killed U.S., Afghan and other forces.
The department declined to say exactly how much aid would be suspended, saying the numbers were still being calculated and included funding from both the State and Defense departments.
U.S. officials said two main categories of aid are affected: foreign military financing (FMF), which funds purchases of U.S. military hardware, training and services, and coalition support funds (CSF), which reimburse Pakistan for counter-terrorism operations. They said they could make exceptions to fund critical U.S. national security priorities.
CSF funds, which fall under Defense Department authority, are covered by the freeze, said Pentagon spokesman Commander Patrick Evans, saying Congress authorized up to $900 million in such money for Pakistan for fiscal year 2017, which ended Sept. 30. None of that money has yet been disbursed.
The freeze also covers $255 million in FMF for fiscal year 2016, which falls under State Department authority and whose suspension has already been announced, as well as unspecified amounts of FMF that went unspent in earlier fiscal years.
Briefing reporters, U.S. officials stressed the suspension did not affect civilian aid to Pakistan and that the money could go through if Islamabad took decisive action against the groups.
""Our hope is that they will see this as a further indication of this administration's immense frustration with the trajectory of our relationship and that they need to be serious about taking the steps we have asked in order to put it on more solid footing,"" a senior State Department official told reporters.
""We're hoping that Pakistan will see this as an incentive, not a punishment,"" he added.
The Trump administration briefed Congress on its decision on Wednesday.
Pakistan has long rejected accusations that it fails to tackle the militants battling the Kabul government and foreign forces from sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the border.
It is largely shrugging off the proposed U.S. aid cuts but frets that Washington could take more drastic measures to deter what it sees as Pakistan's support for the Taliban.
Tense ties between the uneasy allies nosedived on Jan. 1 when U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out on Twitter against Islamabad's ""lies and deceit"" despite $33 billion in aid and the White House warned of ""specific actions"" to pressure Pakistan.
Trump's frustrations are shared by some U.S. lawmakers, who accused Pakistan of playing a double game by allowing militant groups sanctuary - which Islamabad denies - despite promising to crack down on them.
""Pakistan is one of the most duplicitous governments I've had any involvement with,"" Senator Bob Corker, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters. ""Their, in essence, support of the Haqqani network, or ... allowing them to have safe harbor in their country when they're the greatest threat to our men and women in uniform.""
South Asia expert Christine Fair of Georgetown University voiced concern that Pakistan might retaliate for the suspension by closing the highways from the port city of Karachi on which equipment is trucked to land-locked Afghanistan and the airspace through which supplies are flown to U.S.-led international forces there.
""What is the plan if they close the GLOCs?"" she asked, using the military acronym for Ground Lines of Communications.
""What if the Pakistanis shut down the ALOCs (Air Lines of Communications). How do you keep supplying the ANSF?"" she asked, referring to the Afghan national security forces.
""Pakistan could be within their rights if they tell us you don’t have flyover rights anymore,"" she said.

HAVANA (Reuters) - The European Union's top diplomat Federica Mogherini met Cuban President Raul Castro on Thursday as she ended a two-day visit to the Communist country aimed at strengthening engagement even as the Trump administration backtracks on a fragile detente.
Cuban state-run television broadcast footage of the meeting and said it covered the favorable state of relations between the EU and Havana and international issues.
At a press conference earlier in the day, Mogherini said that EU member countries combined were now Cuba's most important economic partner and announced a series of agreements.
As the U.S.-Cuba rapprochement unfolded in 2015-2016 the EU dropped all sanctions and negotiated a political dialogue and cooperation agreement, the first between Cuba and the EU.
Mogherini told journalists before meeting Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Thursday morning that the agreement also provided new potential in trade and investment.
""The EU has become Cuba's first trade partner and was already the first in investment and development cooperation ... which means it is possible to increase the level of economic relations and investments,"" she said before meeting Castro.
Mogherini said a delegation from the European Investment Bank would visit Cuba later this month.
She said cooperation agreements in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, culture and expertise valued at 49 million euros ($59.1 million) would be signed shortly.
In February, Mogherini will preside with Rodriguez in Brussels over the first joint cooperation meeting between the EU and Cuba, she said.
During her visit she repeatedly criticized the U.S. trade embargo and said she regretted ""that the current U.S. administration has apparently changed course with Cuba.""
Diplomats said the EU appeared to sense an opportunity, with Castro expected to retire in April and market-oriented reforms already underway.
""I believe that Europe has the potential and interest to take an independent agenda in Cuba in economic and political matters for strategic purposes,"" said a senior Latin American diplomat.
""Cuba does not cost so much and is very symbolic worldwide. At the same time it balances the growing Russian and Chinese influence,"" the diplomat said.

Richard Feinberg, an economist and expert on Latin America and Cuba at the Brookings Institution, said Cuban commerce is so spread around the world today that no single country accounts for more than 20 percent of its total trade.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","Let's make up, Turkish foreign minister tells Germany","BERLIN (Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called on Friday for a fresh start in his country's rocky relationship with Germany, holding out the prospect of closer economic cooperation, particularly in transport and energy, if ties improved.
In a column written for the Funke media group of newspapers for publication on Friday ahead of a meeting with his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel, Cavusoglu called for an end to the ""current crisis spiral in our relationship"".
""Both sides have an interest in a new start in the bilateral relationship as we live in a time full of challenges,"" he wrote. ""It is not the time for bullhorn diplomacy.""
Cavusoglu said Germany needed to develop a more ""empathetic"" tone in its dealings with Turkey. Berlin did not seem to fully understand the ""trauma"" caused by a failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan in 2016.
Last month, Gabriel said Turkey's decision to release a sixth German citizen from jail gave hope that relations between the two NATO allies could improve after plumbing new lows following the coup attempt.
German politicians have been outspoken critics of Turkey's security crackdown since the coup. Tens of thousands of Turks have been jailed, including around a dozen German citizens. Germany is home to some 3 million people of Turkish heritage.
Ankara has criticized Berlin for not handing over asylum seekers it accuses of involvement in the failed coup.
Cavusoglu said an improved relationship could mean that the two countries could work more closely in areas including security and trade.
He said trade between Germany and Turkey amounted to 174 billion euros ($209.91 billion)in the last five years, with major opportunities in the coming decade from big infrastructure projects, in particular in transport and renewable energy.

He stressed the importance of Turkey's role in stemming a wave of migrants to Germany under a deal with the European Union in 2016 and said he hoped that the EU would live up to its commitments to make it easier for Turks to get visas in return.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 07:00PM ET</span>",Costa Rica plane crash probe could take months: aviation chief,"By Enrique Andres Pretel
SAN JOSE (Reuters) - It could take months to determine the cause of a plane crash in Costa Rica that killed 12 people because the aircraft was badly burned and lacked a flight data recorder, the director of the country's civil aviation agency told Reuters on Thursday. 
Enio Cubillo also said that experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board came to Costa Rica on Thursday to assist the investigation, along with staff from the Federal Aviation Administration and Cessna, which made the plane.
He added that experts are analyzing weather conditions at the time of the crash last Sunday as well as possible mechanical failures and human error.
""It doesn't necessarily have to be a single cause,"" he said. ""This could take several months.""
The accident took place near the Punta Islita beach town, about 230 km (140 miles) west of the capital of San Jose.
Because Punta Islita's small airfield lacks a control tower, the plane's status at the time of the crash was unknown, Cubillo said. It was not required to carry a black box flight data recorder because it had fewer than 19 passengers. 
Ten U.S. citizens and two Costa Rican pilots, both of whom were experienced fliers, died in the incident, Cubillo said.
The U.S. victims included a family of five from New York. 
Costa Rica's accident investigation team has begun examining the remains of the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, which crashed and ignited in a woodland roughly 1,310 feet (400 meters) from its departure point.
Remains of the plane's turbine will be sent to producer Pratt & Whitney in Canada for mechanical evaluations. 
A video obtained from the civil aviation agency showed twisted and charred chunks of metal that are being examined by investigators, including pieces of the turbine, tail rudder and wings.
The plane had passed a safety inspection about a month ago and was authorized to fly, Cubillo has previously said. Although strong winds in the morning had forced the pilots to alter their itinerary, they had flown safely to Punta Islita to pick up passengers headed to San Jose.
Cubillo added on Thursday that strong winds at the time of the crash should not have impacted the flight. 

""There were winds of some 20, 25 knots ... a speed that isn't ideal, but that should be perfectly withstood by an aircraft of this wingspan,"" he said.

WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called potential talks between North and South Korea ""a good thing"" and agreed with South Korea there would be no joint military drills, which North Korea bitterly opposes, during next month's Winter Olympics.
South Korea's Presidential Blue House said Trump told South Korea's President Moon Jae-in in a telephone call he hoped inter-Korean talks would lead to good results and that he would send a high-level delegation, including members of his family, to the Winter Olympics, which will be held in South Korea.
A senior U.S. administration official told Reuters there had been discussion about Trump's daughter Ivanka attending the games in Pyeongchang.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this but said Trump and Moon agreed ""to de-conflict the Olympics and our military exercises"" to ensure the security of the games and that a ""high-level delegation"" would attend.
At the same time, the two leaders also ""agreed to continue the campaign of maximum pressure against North Korea,"" it added.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters the joint drills, which North Korea denounces as a prelude to invasion, would now take place sometime after the Olympics and Paralympics, which run from Feb. 9-25 and March 9-18. Mattis called their delay a ""practical"" matter.
Mattis said it was too early to say if North Korea's offer to talk to South Korea was a genuine olive branch, but said it was clearly the result of international pressure. 
In a tweet earlier, Trump, who hurled fresh insults at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this week, took credit for any dialogue.
""Does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total 'might' against the North,"" Trump tweeted, adding that ""talks are a good thing!""
Washington had earlier responded coolly to Kim's suggestion of inter-Korean talks in a New Year's Day message, with the State Department saying Pyongyang ""might be trying to drive a wedge"" between Washington and Seoul.
The head of U.S. forces in South Korea warned on Thursday against raising hopes over North Korea's overture amid a war of words over Pyongyang's development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.
Trump and North Korea's Kim have exchanged bellicose comments in recent months, raising alarm across the world, with Trump at times dismissing the prospect of a diplomatic solution to a crisis in which both sides have threatened to destroy each other.
In his New Year address, Kim said he was open to dialogue with South Korea and could send a delegation to the Winter Olympics.
Kim also warned he would push ahead with ""mass producing"" nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions and warned that the entire United States was in range of North Korean nuclear missiles and a nuclear button was always on his desk.
""LITTLE ROCKET MAN"" 
Trump responded by mocking Kim as ""Little Rocket Man"" and saying that his nuclear button was bigger and more powerful and worked.
Seoul answered the North Korean talks overture by proposing high-level talks at a border village next week and on Wednesday, the two Koreas reopened a border hotline that had been closed since February 2016.
The senior administration official said that despite Trump's positive words, there was concern in the administration that South Korea could go too far in offering concessions to North Korea that could weaken the U.S. pressure campaign.
""I don’t think people view the talks as an unalloyed good, that under all circumstances North and South talking is a good thing,"" the official said.
""I think we have seen in the past that sometimes the North exploits these talks, especially when you have a left-of-center president in South Korea whose base is encouraging him to make concessions that we probably would not be comfortable with.""
""So there’s a level of wariness about that.""
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said she understood any talks would be limited to the Olympics and domestic issues and added that Washington and Seoul were in close contact.
""This is not something where (South Korea) is going to go off freelancing,"" she said. ""Could that meeting that could potentially happen ... lead to something more in the future? Perhaps it could but I don’t want to speculate.""
On Tuesday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington would not take any talks between North and South Korea seriously if they did not contribute to denuclearizing North Korea.
She also said Washington was hearing reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile and warned of even tougher steps in response if it did so.
The commander of U.S. Forces Korea, General Vincent Brooks, said the North Korean overture was a strategy to divide five countries - the United States, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia - to reach its goal of being accepted as a ""nuclear capable"" nation, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.
""We must keep our expectations at the appropriate level,"" he was quoted as saying in an address to a university in Seoul,"" he said, adding it was important for the United States and South Korea to maintain an ""ironclad and razor-sharp"" alliance.

The five countries Brooks mentioned were involved in years of on-again-off-again ""six-party talks"" with North Korea aimed at resolving the crisis, but eventually North Korea pulled out.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The left-wing frontrunner to win this year's Mexican presidential election said on Thursday that he would personally take a central role in restoring order after years of violence that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.
Sketching out his plans to end the bloodletting, former Mexico City mayor and presidential contender Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador presented a team of security advisers that drew both on previous governments and the private sector.
He said he wanted to create more opportunities for the rural population in order to disincentivize crime, adding that the military-led approach in place for the past 11 years needed to end.
""You can't fight fire with fire,"" he said.
If elected president, the 64-year old Lopez Obrador would also become Supreme Commander of Mexico's armed forces. 
Fueled by battles between rival drug gangs, murders in Mexico spiked to a record high last year, dashing President Enrique Pena Nieto's pledge to get violence under control and hitting his party's popularity.
Harking back to his experience as mayor from 2000 to 2005, Lopez Obrador said he would hold daily meetings ""from an early hour"" with the heads of the armed forces, the attorney general and interior minister to discuss security.
He did not address the contentious suggestion he has made of exploring an amnesty for criminal gangs, leaving that to aide Alfonso Durazo, who he has tapped as his head of public security.
Durazo suggested any amnesty might apply for farmers growing illicit crops rather than providing a way out for cartel bosses.
""Nobody is talking about negotiating with El Mencho, or any of the others,"" Durazo said, referring to Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as ""El Mencho,"" who allegedly heads a major cartel.
He also said Lopez Obrador would seek to root out corruption.
""We can't resolve the problem of lawlessness if we don't fix the corruption problem first, both in the federal government and particularly in the security forces,"" Durazo told reporters.
Durazo is a former aide to ex-President Vicente Fox of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), who broke the longstanding hold on power of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) with his 2000-2006 administration.
Prior to that, Durazo worked closely with the PRI and he split with Fox in 2004, then moved leftward politically.
Fox's former head of public security, Alejandro Gertz, was also among the team presented by Lopez Obrador, as was Marcos Fastlicht, a businessman and father-in-law of Emilio Azcarraga, chairman of broadcaster Grupo Televisa.

Lopez Obrador repeated pledges to create a ""national guard"" and revive the ministry of public security which the PRI scrapped in 2012. He said he would present a detailed security plan before the election.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi urged the United States and international community to support nationwide protests in Iran with political sanctions and not economic measures that could hit the general population. 
The protests, which began over economic hardships suffered by the young and working class, pose one of the most sustained challenges to the clerical rulers in almost a decade.
In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Ebadi said she supported the protests ""one hundred percent"" and urged the people of Iran to stay in the streets in peaceful protests and engage in civil disobedience.
""People should stop paying electricity, water and gas bills. They should not pay their tax. They should withdraw their money from banks,"" said Ebadi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.
Iran's army chief declared on Thursday that police had already quelled anti-government unrest that has killed 21 people but that his troops were ready to intervene if needed.
""I call on my dear children in the police forces and the Revolutionary Guards to put down their guns and do not kill their own brothers and sisters. If the country's situation improves, you would also benefit from it,"" said Ebadi, one of the exiled critics of Iran's leadership. 
Reacting to the Revolutionary Guards commander, Mohammad Ali Jafari who said on Wednesday that the protests were over, Ebadi said: ""That's his opinion. People are still in the streets. Even if they go home, their anger would remain, and the protests would resurface months or years later.""
SANCTIONS
A senior U.S. official said on Wednesday that the United States aimed to collect ""actionable information"" that could allow it to pursue sanctions against Iranian individuals and organizations involved in a crackdown on protesters.
The move is part of an effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to swiftly side with anti-government protesters who have rattled Iran’s clerical leadership.
Trump tweeted on Wednesday that United States would throw its support behind Iranian protesters at an ""appropriate time"".
Ebadi said: ""If Iranian government has the right to talk about human rights abuses in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Syria, other countries, including America, have the right to talk about human rights abuses in Iran."" 
He said the economic sanctions and U.S. visa restriction on Iranians -- that both started under Obama -- had only made life more difficult for people, not the government.
""During (the) Obama presidency, I said they should impose political sanctions on Iran, not economic ones. For example, they should ban sales of arms or any tools that can be used to suppress people,"" Ebadi said.
She also called for a restriction on Iran's dozens of radio and television stations, that she said were part of Iran's ""wrongful"" foreign policy, and ""spread hatred and lies"" in different languages.
She asked world powers to provide young Iranians with ""free and fast"" satellite internet that cannot be censored by the Iranian authorities.
It was unclear how the protests might affect Trump’s thinking about the 2015 nuclear pact that eased economic pressure on Tehran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.
Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports under the terms of the international deal.
If he reimposes sanctions on oil, it could increase the economic pain for Iran’s leaders. But analysts said it could also send the wrong message about U.S. support for Iran’s people in the middle of the boldest challenge to the leadership in a decade.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber in the Afghan capital caused dozens of casualties on Thursday after blowing himself up close to a group of security personnel who were carrying out an operation against illegal drugs and alcohol dealing, officials said.
Islamic State, which has claimed a series of attacks in Kabul over the past two years, issued a statement on its Amaq news agency saying it was responsible.
It said a suicide bomber targeting a group of police and intelligence service personnel had detonated an explosive vest, killing or wounding around 80 of them.
Wahid Majroh, a spokesman for the ministry of public health, said 11 dead and 25 wounded had been brought to city hospitals after the blast in an area of the city not far from the U.S. Embassy and other foreign missions.
As security forces arrived, a Reuters reporter saw four police vehicles carrying dead or wounded security personnel from the scene.
Police officers at the scene said the bomber had been wearing police or army uniform and had approached a group of security personnel conducting controls on illegal drugs and alcohol sellers, but there was no official confirmation.
""Kabul police forces were there to prevent a possible protest when a suicide bomber approached them and detonated his suicide vest,"" Kabul police spokesman Bashir Mujahid said.
While Afghan forces backed by U.S. air strikes have claimed some success against Taliban insurgents since the United States announced a stepped up military strategy last year, high profile attacks on civilian targets in Kabul have continued.
The attack happened days after a suicide bomber killed at least 41 people and wounded more than 80 at a Shi'ite cultural center in Kabul, underlining the precarious security situation in the Afghan capital.
That attack was also claimed by Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for a number of similar attacks in Afghanistan over the past two years.

A statement by the foreign ministry on state news agency WAM said the decision was taken in light of extensive cooperation and information received from the Tunisian side that eased the national carriers' concerns. 
The UAE had angered Tunisia by banning Tunisian women from its passenger flights in December, but Tunis later said the UAE was acting on intelligence that female jihadists returning from Iraq or Syria could try to use Tunisian passports to stage attacks. 
""In light of preventing dangers and threats that should be avoided to the largest degree, and in light of an extensive security dialogue and information received from the Tunisian side, the concerned authorities in the UAE have decided to return to normal procedures before the extraordinary circumstance,"" the statement said. 
Tunisia suspended flights from Dubai carrier Emirates to Tunis on Dec. 24 after the airline had refused to carry Tunisian women. 
The UAE had not commented publicly on the issue until Thursday, except for a tweet by its minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, which said both countries had been in contact about ""security measure information"", adding that his country valued and respected Tunisian women.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 12:55PM ET</span>",Trump administration rule would let more Americans drop Obamacare,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday proposed a rule to allow Americans who are self-employed or work for small businesses to buy health insurance that does not comply with all Obamacare requirements in an effort to unwind the 2010 healthcare law.
The rule, put forward by the Department of Labor, would allow individuals and small businesses to form an association based on geography or industry and purchase health insurance that would be exempt from some rules of the Affordable Care Act. 
The rule also allows sole proprietors to join such associations. Currently, sole proprietors can purchase individual insurance through the Obamacare individual market, created under former Democratic President Barack Obama's healthcare law.
The rule must go through a comment period but is likely to gain approval, helping to enact an executive order Republican President Donald Trump signed in October. 
Under Obamacare, all health insurance plans must cover a set of 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity and newborn care, addiction and mental health treatment and prescription drugs. The proposed rule would allow small business associations to purchase health plans that do not necessarily cover all of these benefits, which proponents say would help lower premiums.
The rule does not allow Small Business Health Plans to charge those with pre-existing conditions more or exclude employees because of their health. 
Proponents of Obamacare say the rule would undermine the individual insurance market created under the law by allowing young and healthy people to purchase cheaper insurance, leaving the sickest and most expensive patients in the Obamacare markets, driving up costs. Hospitals, insurers and medical groups criticized the rule in December and said it would make health insurance unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions.
The rule could destabilize several states' individual insurance markets because healthier people could access cheaper insurance, said Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel, adding that it is still unclear whether significant numbers of people will opt for the slimmer plans.
Republicans, who have unified control of government, have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, a top 2016 presidential campaign promise of Trump. Instead, the administration has sought to dismantle the law through administrative rules and executive orders. 
Republicans dealt their biggest blow to the healthcare program in their tax overhaul, which Trump signed into law last month. The law in 2019 repeals the individual mandate, the requirement that most Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine. Health policy experts say the mandate helps ensure a viable market.
Several business groups, including the National Restaurant Association and the National Retail Federation, on Thursday praised the proposed rule, saying it would enable millions of people to obtain more affordable health insurance.
But Democrats and medical advocacy groups blasted the rule, saying it put affordable health insurance further out of reach for many Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions.

""The Trump administration has declared open season for fraudsters selling junk insurance while those with pre-existing conditions will find healthcare further and further out of reach,"" Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said.

Roberto Borge, who governed the touristy state of Quintana Roo from 2010 to 2016, was taken under strict security from the offices of Panama's national police to an air force base, where he boarded a Mexican plane, local television footage showed.
Mexican prosecutors accuse Borge of using funds obtained illegally, embezzlement and abuse of public office. Borge has denied the allegations.
Borge was arrested in Panama City in June as he was preparing to board a flight to Paris. Panama's foreign ministry said last week that it would send Borge to Mexico.
For the PRI, the extradition is the latest reminder of corruption scandals as the party tries to rehabilitate its image ahead of a presidential election in July.
The PRI, which is trying to keep hold of power as President Enrique Pena Nieto's term ends, has faced a spate of graft allegations, and four of its former governors were arrested on such charges last year in various countries, including Borge.
Last month, Mexican authorities arrested Alejandro Gutierrez, a former high-ranking PRI official, in a corruption investigation in the northern state of Chihuahua.

322,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 11:51AM ET</span>",Iraq's Abadi in high-stakes plan to rein in Iranian-backed militias,"By Ahmed Rasheed
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Under pressure from allies in the West, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is staking his career on reining in the Shi'ite militias that helped him defeat Islamic State. 
The task will not be easy. The paramilitaries, or Popular Mobilisation Forces, are mostly trained and backed by Iran, so Abadi risks angering his most powerful regional backer.
Iraq's Shi'ite majority also see the PMF's 150,000 fighters as their saviors. Several militia commanders plan to run against Abadi in parliamentary elections in May and some have warned they will resist attempts to dismantle them.
Abadi's plan envisages taking back the militias' heavy weapons and cutting their strength by half, according to military and intelligence sources.
The army is already taking an inventory of PMF weaponry, such as the armored vehicles and tanks the government gave them to fight Islamic State.
Next, Abadi will order his military and police commanders to take back those heavy weapons under the pretext of repairing them. The defense ministry will then remove over-age or physically unfit fighters, two military sources said.
""The plan will be implemented with extreme caution and precision in order to prevent a negative backlash from the PMF commanders,"" said an army colonel who was briefed on it by his commander. ""We can't keep a second army within one state; this is the key objective of the plan.""
The plan will be closely followed by Iran and the United States. The groups are one of Iran's many levers of influence in Iraq, while for Washington they are a reminder of Tehran's growing reach in the Middle East.
Lawmakers close to Abadi and one of his political advisers say he is coming under ""tremendous pressure"" from the West and Sunni regional allies to dissolve the PMF now that Islamic State, or Daesh, is no longer a major threat.
""Prime Minister Abadi is getting messages from allies in the war against Daesh encouraging him to dismantle the PMF as a condition to keeping their support flowing in future,"" the adviser said on condition of anonymity. 
In a phone call last month, French President Emmanuel Macron encouraged Abadi to dismantle the PMF, said the adviser, who was briefed on the call.
With Islamic State crushed in Iraq, Abadi will find it harder to avoid clamping down on the militia, according to a lawmaker from his Dawa Party.
""Abadi would respond to pressure from his Western and Gulf allies to dissolve the PMF by saying he needs them to fight Daesh, but now Daesh is finished and there are no more excuses to keep the PMF,"" the lawmaker said.
In any case Abadi does not trust the Iranians, whose militia allies act like a state within a state, said a Shi'ite lawmaker close to the prime minister.
""Abadi sees the support of the West, the United States and regional Arab states as indispensable in making Iraq more stable in future,"" the lawmaker said.
But militia commanders, such as Ali al-Hussaini from the Imam Ali Brigades, say the PMF played a major part in defeating Islamic State and dismantling them would be a ""big mistake"".
""We have millions of followers who will defend our rights against any attempt to target us,"" he said.
Nonetheless, a joint committee from the army, police, and intelligence services will review the number of PMF fighters and make recommendations to Abadi, who will decide who will stay and who will be retired, said a military intelligence colonel who is close to the military chief of staff's office.
Abadi would also order his commanders to restructure their own forces.
Another army colonel said taking heavy weapons from the militias would not be easy, as they control hundreds of headquarters, arms stockpiles, camps, and even small rocket factories.
IRANIAN INFLUENCE
Disarming the militias is one of Abadi's most delicate challenges. They are generally more effective than the Iraqi security forces and often defy Baghdad with the support of Tehran.
They also have the blessing of Iraq's most influential Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.
Iraqi Shi'ite militia commanders are openly loyal to Tehran, Iranian advisers are seen on Iraqi battlefields, and Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Abadi in June against weakening the militias.
The PMF gained prominence after Sistani called on Iraqis to take up arms against Islamic State when it seized a third of the country in 2014.
Since then the militias have become more assertive, riding around cities in vehicles flying their own flags. They are accused of terrorizing minority Sunnis, which they deny.
Security sources and analysts say any attempt by Abadi to muzzle the PMF could invite a backlash from Shi'ites, who expect the militias to protect them in the event of renewed sectarian conflict in Iraq.
Any backlash could lead to the election of an alliance of Iranian-backed political parties to enough seats in parliament to end Abadi's bid for a second term.
Abadi's success against Islamic State and in quashing a Kurdish bid for independence in Iraq may tempt him into over-confidence in acting against the militias, said Jasim al-Bahadli, a Baghdad-based expert on Shi'ite armed groups.
""Playing hard with the PMF could be a double-edged sword; they have broad popularity that Abadi should not underestimate."" 
FIERY CLERIC
To counter the PMF's popularity, Abadi has turned to the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who once led an armed rebellion against U.S. occupation forces and was named the most dangerous man in Iraq by the Pentagon.
The pair held a secret meeting in the holy Shi'ite city of Karbala on Nov. 11 to discuss Sadr helping the government disarm the militias, according to aides for both men who attended the meeting.
Sadr sees the militias as a threat to his role as a kingmaker in Iraq's turbulent politics.
During their meeting, Abadi asked Sadr to support him in his bid to ""cleanse the country"" of corrupt politicians and those who might try to use armed groups to influence the election, an adviser to Sadr said.
""They talked about putting an end to the militias operating above the law, fighting corruption, and of course supporting Abadi's bid to be prime minister for a second term,"" he said.
Several lawmakers close to Abadi and sources close to Sadr said the prime minister had secured the cleric's support to stop the PMF interfering in the election.
""Sadr can put hundreds of thousands on the streets in solidarity with Abadi with one call, he would make Abadi's opponents think twice before challenging him,"" said a senior Shi'ite politician close to Sadr.
Indeed, Sadr plans to do just that in the very near future, another source close to him said.
STRONG CHALLENGER
Sources close to Sadr said he also promised to persuade Sistani to support Abadi's plans to restrain the militias. 
That could give Abadi an edge over the militias, which comprise more than 66 groups, over 40 of which are backed by Iran, according to security sources and analysts.
It would also put Abadi in a strong position against one of his main challengers, Hadi al-Amiri, who commands Iraq's largest Iranian-backed Shi'ite militia, the Badr Organisation.

""Badr will lead the PMF list in next election under the leadership of Hadi al-Amiri,"" said Ameer al-Kinani, a Sadrist adviser to Iraqi President Fuad Masum. ""This is known to all.""

Egypt passed legislation in 2016 to crack down on a growing smuggling industry along its northern seaboard. The law imposes prison terms and fines on those found guilty of smuggling potential migrants or acting as brokers or middlemen. 
It also imposes prison sentences on those who provide shelter to trafficked migrants, and gather, transport or otherwise facilitate their journey.

Hazinedar, a member of the secular main opposition Republic People Party (CHP), denies any link to Gulen. Gulen denies any involvement in the attempted coup.

Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's cabinet was sworn in on Dec. 18, two months after his conservative People's Party won the parliamentary election. It struck a coalition deal with the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO), making Austria the only western European country with a far-right party in government. 
The FPO controls the interior, foreign, defense and social affairs ministries, among others.
At the start of a two-day cabinet meeting in a castle near Slovenia, Kurz said the government would cut benefits for Austrian residents' children who live in a country where the cost of living is lower.
""It is an unfairness built into the system that, for two children who do not even live in Austria but in Romania, roughly 300 euros a month are transferred to Romania and that is almost the average income there,"" Kurz told reporters standing alongside Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache.
Payments vary depending on children's age and number but start around 114 euros ($138) a month for an only child.
""We will reach a decision in cabinet here so that child benefit payments are not made abroad to the same extent as before,"" Kurz said, adding that adjusting payments to the local cost of living would save ""more than 100 million euros (a year)"". 
That pales in comparison with the 2.5 billion euros in savings the government aims to make this year. Kurz said the move was being made so quickly because it was one of the easiest to prepare.
The plan is part of a broader government agenda that includes cutting taxes, reducing benefits for refugees and restricting new immigrants' access to many social services for five years.
Austria borders eight countries, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, where wages are significantly lower. Eastern Europeans make up a large part of its workforce in sectors including healthcare and construction.
In 2016 Austria transferred 273 million euros abroad to EU and European Economic Area countries in benefit payments for 132,000 children.
The European Commission criticized Germany last year for a similar plan to cut child benefits, which was later abandoned. It gave a guarded reaction on Thursday.
""We take note and we will examine the laws with regard to their compatibility with EU law if and once adopted,"" a Commission spokeswoman said.
Kurz said a legal paper commissioned by the government ""clearly shows that it is legally possible to take these measures"", adding: ""We have prepared this well.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's army chief declared on Thursday that police had already quelled anti-government unrest that has killed 21 people but that his troops were ready to intervene if needed, as Tehran staged more pro-government rallies.
The protests, which seem spontaneous and without a unifying leader, erupted a week ago in Iran's second city of Mashhad over economic hardships - mostly high youth unemployment, costly living standards and alleged corruption.
""Although this blind sedition was so small that a portion of the police force was able to nip it in the bud ... you can rest assured that your comrades in the Islamic Republic's army would be ready to confront the dupes of the Great Satan (United States),"" Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi was quoted in official media as saying.

Iran's vastness as well as restrictions on independent media make it hard to determine the breadth and depth of the unrest.
Semi-official labor news agency ILNA said the government on Thursday lifted restrictions on Instagram, one of the social media tools used to mobilize protesters. But access to a more widely used messaging app, Telegram, remained blocked, suggesting authorities remained uneasy about protest threats.
In the latest protests, which generally occur after nightfall, social media video showed demonstrators in Khorramabad in southwestern Iran on Wednesday evening throwing stones at riot police, who were retreating.
In other social media footage, hundreds poured into streets of the northwestern city of Orumiyeh near the Turkish border, chanting anti-government slogans.
Other videos showed protesters in Ahvaz, capital of oil-rich Khuzestan province, setting a bank on fire.
None of the videos could be authenticated by Reuters.
The student news agency ISNA quoted Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli as saying on Thursday that ""at most 42,000 people attended the protests, which is not much"" in a nation of 80 million people.
On Wednesday, the commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said the number of ""troublemakers"" did not exceed 15,000 nationwide.

RARE ANTI-GOVERNMENT OUTBURSTS
As unrest spread across Iran, mainly in smaller cities and towns, protesters said they were tired of official anti-Western rhetoric and it was time for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the government of President Hassan Rouhani to quit.
Protests have drawn largely young people and workers but have begun to take in members of the educated middle class that formed the backbone of a pro-reform revolt almost a decade ago.
After six days of demonstrations, Jafari said on Wednesday that Revolutionary Guards units had been deployed to put down protests in three provinces that have been hotbeds of unrest. That was the clearest sign yet that authorities were taking the protests seriously.
The Revolutionary Guards, the sword and shield of Iran's Shi'ite theocracy, were instrumental in suppressing an uprising over alleged election fraud in 2009 in which dozens were killed.

State television broadcast live pictures of further pro-government rallies on Thursday, including Ghaemshahr in northern Iran and Mashhad in the northeast, as well as Shahin Shahr in central Iran. Marchers were carrying posters saying, “No to riots,” “Iran is not Syria” and ""Death to seditionists"", as well as portraits of Khamenei.
State media said three Iranian security agents were killed on Wednesday near the Iraqi border in a clash that led to the dismantling of a team of ""counter-revolutionaries"" who had planned to cause explosions and provoke unrest. 
The intelligence ministry said several ""terrorists"" were killed in the clash and one was arrested. Kurdish rebels are known to be active in the area.
Few believe the protests pose an existential threat to the clerical elite, backed by pervasive security services, that has dominated Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew a U.S.-backed monarchy. 
But protesters have become increasingly bold, calling for the downfall of Khamenei, who has blamed the most sustained challenge to his 29 years in power for nearly a decade on ""seditionists"" and foreign agents.
""I don’t want to harm my country but when I see those who run this country are so corrupt, I feel like I am being suffocated. They just talk. They accuse 'the enemies' of everything,"" said protester Reza, 43, a father of three in the central city of Isfahan. 
""I am not an enemy. I am an Iranian. I love my country. Stop stealing my money, my children’s money,"" he told Reuters by telephone. 
Iranian Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi urged people to engage in civil disobedience and press on with their grievances.
The Saudi-owned pan-Arab daily Asharq Al-Awsat quoted Ebadi, Iran's most famous human rights lawyer, as saying Iranians should stay on the street and that the constitution gave them the right to hold demonstrations.
Ebadi, who lives in London, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 and is one of a number of exiled critics of Iran's leadership. She called on Iranians to stop paying water, gas and electricity bills and taxes in support of protesters.
She also urged Iranians to withdraw their money from state banks to exert economic pressure on the government to force it to stop resorting to violence and meet their demands.

""If the government has not listened to you for 38 years, your role has come to ignore what the government says to you now,"" Asharq Al-Awsat quoted Ebadi as saying in an interview.

Russia halted civilian air traffic to Egypt in October 2015 after Islamist militants detonated a bomb on a Russian Metrojet flight departing the tourist resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing all 224 people on board.
Putin's clearance for flights to resume was effective from Jan. 2, the Russian government document said, though it gave no timeline for the actual resumption of service.
Egyptian airport sources said flights would resume first between Cairo and Moscow in February, and negotiations about restoring flights to the Red Sea resorts of Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada, popular with Russian tourists, will follow in April. 
""The resumption of flights between Russia and Cairo is a very good sign, giving hope that charter flights to the Red Sea resorts will be possible soon,"" Russia's RIA news agency quoted the head of Russia's tour operators association, Maya Lomidze, as saying.
The 2015 bombing aboard the Metrojet airliner, claimed by Islamic State, and Russia's suspension flight service dealt heavy blows to Egypt's tourism industry, a major source of its hard currency reserves.

LONDON (Reuters) - Beggars need to be cleared by police from the streets of Windsor before the wedding of Prince Harry to girlfriend Meghan Markle because their ""detritus"" is presenting the picturesque English town in a poor light, the local council leader has said.
Queen Elizabeth's grandson Harry and his American actress fiancee are to tie the knot at Windsor Castle, the monarch's palace to the west of London, in May with thousands of visitors expected to visit the town to celebrate the occasion.
Simon Dudley, the leader of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead council, wrote on Twitter there had been an ""epidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy"" in the town and said he wanted police ""to focus on dealing with this before the #RoyalWedding"".
""This is creating a concerning and hostile atmosphere for our residents and the seven million tourists who come to Windsor each year,"" he wrote in a letter to the local Police and Crime Commissioner Anthony Stansfield.
""It is becoming increasingly concerning to see the quantities of bags and detritus that those begging are accumulating and leaving on our pavements, at times unattended, thus presenting a security risk.""
His remarks drew criticism from local homeless organizations and even Prime Minister Theresa May.
""I don't agree with the comments that the leader of the council has made,"" she told BBC TV.
""I think it is important that we, councils, work hard to ensure that they are proving accommodation for those people who are homeless, and where there are issues of people aggressively begging on the streets then it's important that councils work with the police to deal with that aggressive bullying.""
Windsor, the oldest inhabited castle in the world which has been a home of British monarchs for almost 1,000 years, attracts 1.3 million visitors every year, while many also visit the town to watch the regular ""Changing the Guard"" ceremony with soldiers in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats parading with an army band.
Dudley said the council had invested heavily in support services to help those in need with shelters and emergency accommodation for rough sleepers, adding there was evidence that many of those begging were not in fact homeless.
""Obviously, the level of tourist interest is set to multiply with the Royal Wedding in May 2018,"" he wrote, calling for the police to invoke powers such as the 1824 Vagrancy Act to clear the streets. ""The whole situation also presents a beautiful town in a sadly unfavorable light.""
Stansfield said he was surprised the letter had been publicly released, but added the police would be happy to investigate Dudley's concerns.
The Windsor Homelessness Project's manager Murphy James told the BBC it was ""sickening"" Dudley had cited the royal wedding as a reason for concern.

""It's absolutely abhorrent that anybody has got these views in this day and age, especially a lead councillor of the borough,"" he said. ""If somebody is sleeping out on the street, they are not there by choice, they are there because something has gone wrong.""

331,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Catalan separatist Junqueras seeks release from detention,"MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan separatist Oriol Junqueras appeared in court on Thursday to ask for his release after more than two months in detention for his role in the Spanish region's illegal push for independence.
State prosecutors asked the Supreme Court to keep Junqueras in Estremera prison, outside Madrid, court officials said, which would prevent him from swearing in at the opening session of the new Catalan parliament on Jan. 17.
A Dec. 21 regional election gave separatists a slim majority in the parliament in a blow to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who had hoped it would quash the Catalan independence movement and resolve Spain's worst political crisis in decades.
Junqueras's Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left) party emerged as the second largest separatist group, a few seats behind former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont's Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) party.
Market-friendly party Ciudadanos (Citizens) won the most seats but other unionist parties did not secure enough votes to form a majority.
Puigdemont remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels, though he has said he would return to Catalonia if the Spanish government gave him certain ""guarantees"", likely a promise not to arrest him.
Esquerra lawmakers have said Puigdemont has the right to again be Catalan president, but if he is unable to return from Brussels he should step aside for Junqueras. Esquerra and Junts per Catalunya, along with a smaller separatist party, have not yet agreed on a coalition.
Junqueras said at the Thursday hearing he was a ""man of peace"" and of ""dialogue,"" his lawyer Andreu Van Den Eynde told reporters outside the courthouse. He is in custody on allegations of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds.
The court said it would not reach a decision on Thursday.
Rajoy fired both Junqueras and Puigdemont when he imposed direct control over Catalonia after the separatist-controlled government declared independence following an Oct. 1 referendum on secession from Spain, which courts ruled illegal.
The political instability in Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy, has deterred tourists and prompted more than 3,000 companies, including the region's two biggest banks, to move their legal headquarters elsewhere in Spain.

The abduction of more than 270 students sparked international condemnation and heavy criticism of the Nigerian authorities at home along with a celebrity-backed ""Bring Back Our Girls"" campaign.
Salomi Pagu was found by troops deployed in the town of Pulka with another girl and a young child. ""They...are in the safe custody of troops and receiving medical attention,"" the military said in a statement. The second girl was not one of the abducted Chibok students.
Of the 276 girls who were originally taken, about 60 escaped soon afterwards. Around 100 are still believed to be in captivity.
Last May, Boko Haram exchanged 82 of the girls after mediation, involving a payment to the insurgents and the release of some of the group's imprisoned senior members. Before that, 24 had been released or found in 2016.
The Chibok case attracted global attention, but aid groups say Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands more adults and children, many of whose cases are neglected.

The Federal Court of Justice, rejected an appeal filed to a lower court by the transsexual woman who wanted to be registered as a second mother of the child, born in 2015. It said only the woman who gives birth can be considered the child's legal mother.
In September, the court made a similar ruling in a case concerning a transsexual man who gave birth to a baby and wanted to be registered as the legal father.
The court said in its ruling on Thursday that although the rights and duties of a transsexual person depended on their new gender, the legal relationship with his or her children remained unchanged.
In November, Germany's constitutional court ruled in favor of the introduction of a third gender category for people who do not identify as either male or female or are born with an ambiguous sexual anatomy.

Wa Lone and colleague Kyaw Soe Oo, who was also arrested, had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.
Major governments, including the United States, the European Union and Canada, and top U.N. officials, are among those demanding the release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.
In Myanmar, which is still in transition after almost half a century of strict military rule, speaking out in support of journalists and others who run afoul of the authorities is more the exception than the rule.
A relative of Kyaw Soe Oo, who is based in Rakhine State, where animosity between the Buddhist Rakhine community and Rohingya Muslims is intense, said his friends were reluctant to show support for him given the divisive atmosphere. 
Government spokesman Zaw Htay, when asked about social media support for the pair, said such a campaign should not be done while a case was being heard in court.
""During the trial, they need to prove they're right and they're innocent,"" he told Reuters.
""The complainant will accuse and the accused should defend. They should think about how their pressure will affect the court."" 
The following are some of the numerous comments about Wa Lone, who has done voluntary charity work, helping poor children.
      
Thiha Maung Maung, a former colleague of Wa Lone's at the People's Age journal.
""He speaks frankly, he has a very good attitude and always helps out friends.""
""I am very sad to see that not only the government but also some people are seeing Ko Wa Lone as a traitor,"" he said, using a Burmese honorific that means ""brother"".
""Ko Wa Lone loves the country. He is someone who serves for the benefit of the country in whatever role he can.” 
""We, friends, are waiting for the day of his release.”
    
Wi Sara, a monk who studied English with Wa Lone. 
""Wa Lone is someone who studies knowledge and who shares that knowledge.""
""As a journalist ... he goes after information that should be known and then presents it.""
""I don’t believe he tried to sell the country's secrets for dollars, which many people are accusing him of doing. I see that he tried to share information that should be known to the people. So, I wish for Lone's release.”
     
Ei Pwint Rhi Zan, a friend who Wa Lone did charity work with.
""He is very kind to people who are in trouble. He is someone who always wants to help and loves the truth.""
""He's someone we never have to worry would do something wrong. He never treated anyone badly and he has a very good attitude. He is very kind-hearted. He is strong-minded.""
    
San Naing, a member of the Benevolent Youth charity group which Wa Lone is involved with.
""He's a good volunteer worker, a real volunteer worker.""
""We can always rely on him during our donation trips ...  Whenever he's on the trip, we feel energized. He makes the kids happy.” 
    
Myat Nyein Aye, a former colleague of Wa Lone's at the Myanmar Times newspaper.
""Ko Wa Lone is always helpful to others and he loves kids a lot and wants kids to be educated.""
       
Mindy Walker, English-language teacher:
""He was an eager kid who was hoping for a better future for himself, his family and his country.""
""He brought joy everywhere he went and made everyone feel special ... Wa Lone was especially involved in making children's lives better.""
""Always smiling. Always giving. Always there to help. He doesn't belong in prison. He belongs in the community telling stories ... spreading messages of peace."" 
Despite the praise for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo expressed by their supporters, many people in Myanmar have criticized the journalists.
""Media should understand that if they sell information about the country just for dollars, things become complex,"" wrote a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) user named Linn Aung, commenting on a Myanmar news report about the two journalists.

""Myanmar citizens of foreign news agencies should be loyal to their country,” Facebook user Pinky Shine commented in response to another Myanmar media report about the pair.

A tie-up between Merkel's bloc, comprising her Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian CSU sister party, and the SPD is her best chance of securing a fourth term after efforts to form a coalition with two smaller parties failed last year.
The breakdown of those talks in November was widely blamed on politicians leaking information from meetings, eroding trust between prospective partners.
Merkel, CSU leader Horst Seehofer and SPD leader Martin Schulz have agreed that negotiators should not be allowed to give interviews or appear in television talk shows during the exploratory talks, Der Spiegel reported.
Both sides agreed that no advance word of a possible outcome should be leaked during the talks to shore up trust among the negotiators, the magazine added.
Germany's largest parties on Wednesday expressed optimism about the chances of forming a government after several hours of talks.
The parties talked of growing confidence - good news for Merkel, whose reputation as Europe's consummate consensus-builder is on the line in this second bid to form a coalition government after weeks of sniping between its would-be partners.
The exploratory talks are due to start on Sunday and could lead to official coalition negotiations in a few weeks.
To keep its rank and file on board, the SPD leadership has said it will let its members vote on Jan. 21 on going ahead with detailed coalition talks after the first phase has been completed.
Merkel's arch-conservative CSU allies meanwhile warned the SPD not to make too many demands in coalition talks but were keen to show their core voters that there would be no compromise on sensitive issues like immigration.
""We want this coalition,"" CSU leader Seehofer told a news conference ahead of a parliamentary caucus meeting. ""The project can succeed if the potential partner doesn't overbid.""
Seehofer added the CSU's proposals to tighten immigration and asylum laws were not meant to upset the SPD. ""It's not aimed against anybody. It's rather about stating our positions clearly,"" Seehofer said.
""This project (of another grand coalition) can succeed if our potential coalition partner doesn't take it too far,"" he said.
Merkel is under increasing pressure to reach a deal with the SPD, which also lost ground in the September election, but the two sides have bickered over a range of issues, notably immigration and taxation.

Athens has blocked the ex-Yugoslav republic's attempts to join NATO and objects to its EU membership bid because it says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over Greece's own northerly region of that name.
""I think 2018 will be the year when foreign policy issues that have been stuck in the mud for decades will be resolved,"" Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias told reporters after a meeting of the inner cabinet.
""We will all contribute to the wellbeing of all the Balkans,"" he said.
The small ex-Yugoslav republic of about 2 million people declared independence in 1991, avoiding the violence that accompanied much of the breakup of Yugoslavia.
But Greece is withholding support for Macedonia's further integration into international bodies, including NATO, until it agrees to change its name.
Athens has only agreed that the country can be referred to in international venues as the ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"", as an interim measure until the dispute is resolved.
""On the name issue, the government is negotiating and supports a compound name that will be comprehensively used throughout,"" Kotzias said on Thursday, without elaborating.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan is shrugging off proposed U.S. aid cuts but frets that Washington could take more drastic measures to deter what it sees as the South Asian nation's support for Taliban militants causing chaos in neighboring Afghanistan.
Washington plans to imminently slash ""security assistance"" to Pakistan, U.S. congressional aides told Reuters on Wednesday, although the type, scale and length of the cuts was unclear. A day earlier, the White House said it would suspend about $255 million in already delayed military assistance. 
Tense ties between the uneasy allies nosedived on Jan. 1 when President Donald Trump lashed out on Twitter against Islamabad's ""lies and deceit"" despite $33 billion in aid and the White House warned of ""specific actions"" to pressurize Pakistan.
A staunch U.S. Cold War ally and key player in the U.S.-backed invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Pakistan has watched warily as Washington has in recent years pivoted towards its arch-foe India. 
Over the past decade, U.S. threats to cut aid have been part and parcel of its frustrating relationship with Pakistan, a nation also seen as vital to the peace process in Afghanistan.
""Aid cuts will not hurt us,"" Miftah Ismail, Pakistan's de facto finance minister, told Reuters.
""That's not the leverage they have, because it is something they have reduced drastically over the years.""
Pakistan received about $1 billion in U.S. assistance in 2016, down from a peak of about 3.5 billion in 2011, Pakistani and U.S. officials say. 
About $550 million of the 2016 total came from the Coalition Support Fund (CSF), a U.S. Defence Department program to reimburse allies for the costs of supporting counter-terrorist and counter-insurgency operations. Pakistan was the largest recipient of such funds.
The remaining $450 million was a mix of military assistance and funds for international non-government bodies (NGOs) and other development programs, Pakistan's finance ministry says.
Analysts say there are limits to how much the U.S. can fracture relations, since Pakistan cannot be isolated or completely sidelined, because of its proximity to, and influence in, Afghanistan. 
""There is really no way forward for the United States in Afghanistan without Pakistan playing some kind of cooperative and collaborative role,"" said Huma Yusuf, a Wilson Center Global Fellow.
PART OF SOLUTION
Islamabad worries that the United States, seeking to exert greater pressure on its ally, could in future train its crosshairs on Pakistan's fragile economy and impose some sort of financial sanctions.
Pakistani officials warn economic damage would weaken the country, proving counterproductive in Washington's battle against Islamist militant groups in South Asia.
""I can’t imagine how the U.S. financially or militarily hurts us and their own war effort doesn’t get hurt,"" said Ismail, adding that it was impossible to find a solution to the Afghan conflict ""without Pakistan being part of it"".
Last year, U.S. officials said the options being discussed to push Pakistan to change its behavior included targeted sanctions of officials with ties to militant groups waging an insurgency in Afghanistan.
The U.S. officials have also suggested the Pentagon may ramp up drone strikes, driving Pakistani media to speculate if such air attacks would be widened beyond areas bordering Afghanistan. 
Islamabad could ""review its cooperation if it is not appreciated"", its United Nations representative, Maleeha Lodhi, told media this week, which many interpreted as a reference to the vital transport route ferrying supplies to U.S. troops in Afghanistan through Pakistan's territory.
Pakistan remains committed to friendly relations with the United States, its powerful army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa, told Capital TV on Wednesday, but warned Washington against ""coercion"", and vowed not to ""compromise on our self-respect"".
Pakistan supported the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s as a foil to Indian influence in Afghanistan, and analysts say its military and security services maintained ties long after the Taliban regime was toppled in 2001.
Today the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network militants are effectively an arm of Pakistan's foreign policy, U.S. officials say. Pakistan staunchly denies using proxies.
Ties with the United States are likely to stay fraught as Pakistan's strategic calculus remains unchanged, said Raoof Hassan, executive director of the Islamabad-based Regional Peace Institute.
""As long as Pakistan continues to consider the Afghan Taliban as a strategic asset, which it can use some time in the future to become more relevant and influential in Kabul, there is no meeting point,"" he said. 
""The positions are diametrically opposite.""

ATHENS (Reuters) - Athens is exploring whether eight Turkish soldiers who fled to the country after a failed coup attempt against Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan can be tried in Greece, Justice Minister Stavros Kontonis said on Thursday.
Kontonis said Turkey would first need to make an official request for such a trial, which has not looked likely so far as Turkey has twice sought their extradition to face justice at home.
""The possibility of them being tried here for crimes committed abroad is being explored,"" Kontonis told reporters during a news briefing. ""The prime minister (Alexis Tsipras) has said that they must have a fair trial.""
Kontonis said that such a trial may be possible under the Greek penal code.
The trial could be on some, but not all, of the charges brought by Turkey or new ones. The two countries have signed agreements on criminal acts such as terrorism and the penal code may apply to both Greeks and foreigners in that case, regardless of where any crimes were committed. 
The soldiers are not accused of anything by Greece. 
The eight men - three majors, three captains and two sergeant majors - flew to Greece by helicopter on July 16 in 2016, saying they feared for their lives.
Turkey, which regards the soldiers as traitors, has accused Athens of harboring coupists. Greece denies the accusations and says justice is independent. 
Kontonis' statements are the latest twist in the case which has strained relations between Athens and Ankara, the two NATO allies who are at odds over a host of issues from ethnically split Cyprus to sovereignty over airspace.
Greek courts have already rejected requests the soldiers be extradited to Turkey. 
""The extradition issue is definitely closed,"" Kontonis said. 
On Dec. 29 an asylum board granted asylum to one of the soldiers, a pilot, a decision which further angered Turkey.
The Greek government appealed against that decision and a court will look into the case again. The soldier has been released.
Since the attempted coup, Turkish authorities have jailed around 50,000 people pending trial while more than 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military, public and private sectors.

Selahattin Demirtas, who as co-chairman of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) since June 2014 took it into parliament for the first time, said he would not seek re-election at a party congress on Feb. 11.
HDP officials said Demirtas had decided to step down as his party membership may be at risk. Under Turkish law, someone convicted of terrorism cannot be a member of a political party.
""In order to continue our path with new excitement, and to improve the culture of carrying out political struggle for people and not positions, I will not run for the chairman post at our congress,"" he said in a letter to the party.
A former human rights lawyer, Demirtas, 44, has been held in jail for more than a year on terrorism charges for which the prosecutor is seeking up to 142 years of imprisonment.
Demirtas, was detained with 11 other HDP lawmakers in November 2016 as part of an investigation into supporting terrorism and Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

""Despite the government-based dirty propaganda and baseless, lawless and immoral accusations and attacks against us, we are neither separatist, nor terrorist,"" Demirtas said in the letter.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey on Thursday condemned the U.S. conviction of a Turkish banker for evading Iran sanctions as unprecedented meddling in its internal affairs, seeking to rally nationalist sentiment against a case that has implicated President Tayyip Erdogan.
Wednesday's court decision capped a trial that had strained diplomatic relations between the two countries and is likely to further aggravate tension between the NATO allies.
The case has angered Erdogan and his ministers, some of whom accuse U.S. court officials of ties to a cleric blamed for a 2016 coup attempt. Some of the testimony at the trial implicated senior officials, including Erdogan. Ankara has said the case was based on fabricated evidence.
Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey's majority state-owned Halkbank (IS:HALKB), was convicted on five of six counts in a Manhattan federal court, including bank fraud and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions law.
""The U.S. court, in a process carried out by relying on so-called 'evidence', which is fake and open to political exploitation, ... made an unprecedented interference in Turkey's internal affairs,"" Turkey's foreign ministry said.
U.S. prosecutors have charged a total of nine people in the case, including a former economy minister, Zafer Caglayan. However, only Atilla and a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab, are in U.S. custody. 
Erdogan, who has yet to comment on the decision, has previously dismissed the trial as a politically motivated attack on his government, and has attempted to use it to tap into anti-American sentiment among his supporters.
Ankara has not, however, threatened to take concrete measures.
""POLITICAL PLOT""
The U.S. case against Atilla was based on the testimony of the gold trader Zarrab, who cooperated with U.S. prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of leading a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.
In his testimony Zarrab implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said Erdogan, who has governed Turkey for nearly 15 years, personally authorized two Turkish banks to join the scheme when he was prime minister.
""The Zarrab court case is a political plot"", Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag tweeted on Thursday.
Halkbank said Atilla had the right to appeal against the decision and said it had not been a party to the U.S. case. It noted there had been no financial or administrative decision taken against it by the court.
The bank has denied any wrongdoing and said its transactions were in line with local and international regulations. Halkbank shares were up 1.6 percent at 11.09 lira in afternoon trade, after earlier advancing more than 4 percent.
The court decision is unlikely to damage Erdogan or his government at home, said Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence, a London-based consultancy.
""Domestically, I don't believe it will make any difference at all... The government has managed to cast a huge shadow on it by portraying it as a plot against Turkey and the government,"" Piccoli said. ""I think it is much more important in terms of the bilateral relations with the United States. This is a relationship that has been difficult for some time.""
Less clear was the potential fall-out for the banking sector, with some analysts seeing the possibility that one or more Turkish lenders could be hit by fines over the case.
""The whole thing is really about what the consequences will be for the relationship between Turkey and the U.S.,"" said Paul Fage of TD Securities in London.
""Obviously, the U.S. will impose fines, and the question will be how Turkey is going to respond to that, and whether this is going to escalate into some tit-for-tat thing.""
Turkey has said it will take any necessary measures to protect its banks from the potential impact of the case. ""If anything is going to happen, in this situation we will stand by the banks,"" Finance Minister Naci Agbal told Reuters last month.

""We must not allow any eventuality that would weaken our banking system.""

Earlier this week, officials at the National Health Service (NHS) in England recommended that hospitals cancel all non-urgent appointments and operations until next month.
Officials say this means about 50,000 operations may be postponed.
""I know it is difficult, I know it is frustrating, I know it is disappointing for people and I apologize,"" May told Sky News after visiting a hospital outside London. 
A flu outbreak, colder weather and high levels of respiratory illnesses have put hospitals in England under strain with many operating at or near full capacity, with long waits for treatment in emergency rooms.
The issue is potentially damaging for May, already weakened after losing a parliamentary majority in last year's election and struggling to pacify her deeply divided party as she navigates the final year of Brexit negotiations.
The NHS, which delivers free care for all and accounts for a third of government spending on public services, is typically one of the most important issues for voters during elections and one which is often regarded as a weakness for May's Conservative party.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's broadcasting watchdog has fined a TV station nearly one million lira ($266,000) over footage of young girls dancing in shorts in a talent competition after viewers complained of ""child abuse"", a board member said on Thursday.
Citing moral dangers for the children, it penalized TV8 channel for footage in the ""Yetenek Sizsiniz"" (""You Got Talent"") program which showed a group of girls, aged from 7 to 11, who peformed in shorts and tank tops, the board member who did not want to be named told Reuters.
The move by the Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTUK) is likely to further anger government critics, who accuse President Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted ruling AK Party of trying to roll back secularism and civil rights for minorities, gay people and women.
Last year, hundreds of Turkish women marched in Istanbul to protest against violence and threats from men demanding they dress more conservatively.
RTUK ruled that the footage had violated its ethical broadcast regulations and fined the channel 2 percent of its advertising revenues, amounting almost to 1 million lira.
The regulations state that ""programs which contain content that could harm the physical, mental and moral development of children and youth cannot be broadcast"".
RTUK said in a report that it had received complaints that the channel had exploited the children in an ""immoral"" show.
""There were reactions from citizens for making minor children, aged 7-8, dance half-naked for ratings, amounting to child abuse,"" the report said.
Turkey's Family and Social Policies Ministry said the children were ""dancing with clothes that were not appropriate for their age and development level.""
Hurriyet newspaper said RTUK also fined several music channels for broadcasting a music video which it described as ""one tick below an erotic film.""
The video of the ""Sifir Tolerans"" (""Zero Tolerance"") song by Belgium-born singer Hadise depicts the artist in intimate scenes with her male co-star. The video includes scenes of the singer in a bed with the male actor and in a bathtub.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 07:49AM ET</span>",Fewer family visas approved as Trump toughens vetting of immigrants: Reuters review,"By Mica Rosenberg
NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is ramping up calls on the U.S. Congress to stop legal immigrants from sponsoring extended family members who want to move to the United States, saying so-called ""chain migration"" poses a threat to national security.
Even without legislative action, however, the number of immigrants approved for family-based visas has dropped this year to the lowest level in more than a decade, a Reuters review of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data shows. The drop has not been previously reported.
For a graphic on chain migration, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2CaWNJb 
The Trump administration has taken a series of measures to more closely scrutinize legal immigration. These steps have been overshadowed by Trump's more public efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, such as his calls for a wall along the Mexican border and more arrests of people living in the country illegally. 
Lately though, Trump has increasingly been taking aim at chain migration, saying it allows a single immigrant ""to bring in dozens of increasingly distant relations,"" with ""no real selection criteria."" He said a Bangladeshi man who set off a homemade pipe bomb in a crowded New York City commuter hub in December was a prime example of the dangers of the system.
Immigration advocates counter that no one automatically qualifies for a visa because a relative is already in the United States. All immigrants undergo security vetting and can face years-long waits before they are given a green light.
The intensified focus on chain migration has been accompanied by an overall slowdown in adjudications of family-based visas, known as I-130s, the Reuters review shows.
The number of approvals dropped by nearly a quarter in the first nine months of 2017 to around 406,000 compared to the same period a year earlier when approvals were more than 530,000, despite a similar number of applications during both periods, USCIS data showed. 
The drop was even starker when looking only at I-130s approved for relatives who were not immediate family members. Those fell by 70 percent in the same period, from more than 108,000 in the first nine months of 2016 to 32,500 in the same period in 2017. 
The entire 2017 fiscal year had the lowest number of approvals for extended family visas since 2000. 
USCIS said that since there are a limited number of visas for this category, it prioritizes processing visas that are more immediately available. The agency also said there are normal year-to-year fluctuations in the number of visas that are filed and decided.  
At the core of the administration's long-term policy goal is a belief that immigration should be merit-based.
""Those people are just coming in based on connection to a family member,"" the new director of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna said in a telephone interview, referring to chain migrants. ""That lack of selectivity; it takes us away from where we want to go as a country."" 
Cissna said no specific policy guidance has been put in place at USCIS to change the way family-based visas are issued. He also said there were no plans to restrict visas for immediate family members and pointed out that approvals of visas and citizenship applications overall are still high.
He has said, however, that his agency is looking closely at all visa categories to root out fraud. USCIS said separately that closer scrutiny could lead to longer processing times.
For example, H-1B temporary work visas for high-skilled workers are facing more hurdles, and applications are receiving far more requests for evidence, slowing down the whole program, according to immigration lawyers and data provided by the government. 
USCIS has also put in place new interview requirements for U.S. citizens seeking to bring over their fiancés. In the first nine months of 2017, approvals of fiancé visas dropped by 35 percent over the same period a year earlier, the Reuters data review found.
    
'ONTO THE MAIN STAGE'
Immigration supporters said any efforts by the administration to restrict the entry of family members of migrants was shortsighted. They “bring drive and entrepreneurial spirit to the United States,” said Steve Yale-Loehr, an immigration law expert at Cornell University.  
Chain migration has long been a target of groups that favor more restrictions on legal immigration. The idea, supported by organizations like NumbersUSA, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), failed to gain much traction at the highest levels of power in Washington before Trump took office.
“We have been talking about this for a long time but we were kind of out there in the wilderness” said Ira Mehlman from FAIR. “It was never at this level of discussion before.”
Now supporters of the ideas of restricting chain migration and tightening standards for legal immigration occupy key positions in the administration. They include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who remains vocal on the issue, and his long-time aide Stephen Miller, who is now one of Trump's closest policy advisers. 
The current USCIS ombudsman Julie Kirchner was previously the executive director of FAIR.
The White House and the Department of Justice did not respond to questions about the influence of the groups, which critics say are anti-immigrant, on administration policy. 
Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at CIS, said she and her colleagues “are in fairly regular contact with various administration officials as they solicit suggestions and ideas to improve policies.” She said she had also spoken to officials in the Obama administration, but only occasionally. 
Earlier this month NumbersUSA launched a national advertising campaign against chain migration. A day later the White House posted a presentation on the same subject making many of the same points.
NumbersUSA director Roy Beck said any similarity in the points was just a coincidence. Still, he is thrilled that his group's ideas on restricting legal immigration have been ""catapulted onto the main stage in an unprecedented way,"" he said in an interview. 

In April, Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to draft new rules and guidance for the legal immigration system. In August, the White House backed the RAISE Act, proposed legislation sponsored by two Republican lawmakers, that aimed to cut legal immigration by 50 percent over 10 years.

Concerns over the dengue immunisation of nearly 734,000 children aged nine and above resulted in two Philippine congressional inquiries and a criminal investigation.
The country ordered Sanofi (PA:SASY) to stop the sale, distribution and marketing of Dengvaxia after the company last month warned the vaccine could worsen the disease in some cases.

China is Cambodia's biggest aid donor and its backing has bolstered its veteran prime minister, Hun Sen, in the face of criticism of over what his opponents say amounts to his destruction of democracy.
""China respects and supports the development path chosen by the Cambodian people, and believes Cambodia's future election can, under all sides' supervision, reflect its fairness and select a party and leader that satisfies the Cambodian people,"" Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou said.
Kong told a briefing, ahead of a visit by Premier Li Keqiang to Cambodia, that China had offered election support, but did not specify what kind.
Cambodia has said China will provide various equipment for the July election, including ballot boxes and booths.
The United States and EU canceled their planned support following a Cambodian court's dissolution of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in November at the government's request.
Kong said China was Cambodia's largest source of foreign investment, its largest trade partner, and its largest source of foreign tourists. 
Li will visit Cambodia on Jan. 10-11, and attend a regional forum there of leaders from six countries, including Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.
Cambodia and China have become increasingly close as a Cambodian government crackdown on its critics, civil society groups and independent media has drawn criticism from Western governments and human rights groups.
Critics called the ban on the CNRP an attempt to steal the election and the death knell for democracy in a country where Western donors have spent billions of dollars since 1993 trying to build a multiparty system after decades of war.
Hun Sen, whose rule of more than 30 years was under threat from the opposition at the election, has said he will stay in power for at least another decade. 
China's President Xi Jinping has vowed that China will not export its political system but it has expanded the reach of its foreign policy and military under Xi.

Hun Sen was among leaders who spoke at a forum of international political parties hosted by Xi and China's ruling Communist Party in Beijing in December.

Martha O'Donovan works for Magamba TV, which describes itself as Zimbabwe's leading producer of political satire.
She was arrested in November in a dawn raid on her home in the capital after allegedly calling Mugabe, who was ousted in a bloodless coup a few weeks later, a ""selfish and sick man"" on Twitter. 
O'Donovan was first charged with insulting and undermining the president, and subsequently with subversion, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
O'Donovan denied the accusations and had been granted bail in November by Zimbabwe's High Court, which said there was ""patent absence of facts"" in the case and that the state could only bring her back to court when it had new evidence. 
On Thursday, magistrate Rumbidzai Mugwagwa dismissed prosecutors' application to keep O'Donovan on bail.
""Further remand is denied. The State can proceed by way of summons,"" she said.
O'Donovan's lawyers said they were happy the court had honored its promise to judge the case on its merits.
Lawyer Obey Shava told journalists the court had returned computers, cellphones and other electronic devices that had been seized from O'Donovan's home.

Mugabe had been particularly uneasy about social media after activists such as pastor Evan Mawararire and his #ThisFlag movement in 2016 used social media to organize a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade.

350,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 05:18AM ET</span>",Tony Blair tells UK voters: time is running out to stop Brexit folly,"By Guy Faulconbridge and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Former British prime minister Tony Blair told voters on Thursday that time was running out to reverse Brexit, a folly that he said would torpedo Britain's remaining clout and be regretted for generations to come.
More than a year and a half since the 2016 Brexit vote, the United Kingdom remains deeply divided over the planned EU exit that Prime Minister Theresa May says will take place on March 29, 2019.
Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the divorce is Britain's most significant geopolitical move since World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the $2.5 trillion UK economy and the world's biggest trading bloc.
Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said Britain would be poorer and weaker, and he warned that May had solved none of the problems over Northern Ireland's post-Brexit status.
""We are making an error the contemporary world cannot understand and the generations of the future will not forgive,"" Blair said in an article published on his website on Thursday.
""2018 will be the last chance to secure a say on whether the new relationship proposed with Europe is better than the existing one,"" Blair, 64, said.
Leaving the European Union was once far-fetched: just over 15 years ago, British leaders such as Blair were arguing about when to join the euro, and talk of an EU exit was the reserve of skeptics on the fringes of both major parties.
But the turmoil of the euro zone crisis, fears in Britain about immigration and a series of miscalculations by former prime minister David Cameron prompted the United Kingdom to vote 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in a June 2016 referendum.
Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing other critics such as French President Emmanuel Macron and billionaire investor George Soros, who have suggested that Britain could still change its mind.
BREXIT REVERSED?
So far, opinion polls show little sign of a change of heart among voters on Brexit and it is unclear how it could be stopped if both major political parties support the divorce.
Supporters of Brexit accused Blair of undermining both Britain's negotiations with the EU and the will of the people. 
""Blair and his elitist gang are damaging our negotiating strength, thus damaging our national interest by their continuing efforts to undermine democracy,"" said Richard Tice, who helped found one of the two Leave campaign groups.
""History will not forgive them,"" Tice told Reuters.
Blair is unpopular in Britain for his decision to back then-U.S. President George W. Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq and the justification he used for going into a war that cost the deaths of 150,000 Iraqi civilians and 179 British soldiers.
Blair implored his Labour Party, which is now led by veteran leftist Jeremy Corbyn, to join the fight to stop Brexit.
""Make Brexit the Tory Brexit. Make them own it 100 percent,"" Blair said. ""If Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the Single Market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour.""
Corbyn, who voted against membership of the EU in a 1975 referendum, said he voted in 2016 to remain in the bloc, though opponents said he did not campaign strongly in the referendum.
Eight out of 10 grassroots Labour Party members want a referendum on the terms of Britain's exit from the EU, according to a survey published on Thursday.
The survey of attitudes within Britain's main political parties showed 49 percent of Labour members definitely wanted a second referendum on the exit deal and a further 29 percent said they were more in favour of the idea than against it.

The poll of more than 4,000 members of political parties was conducted shortly after last June's national election as part of a three-year academic project by the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been informing members of Congress that it will announce as soon as Wednesday plans to cut off ""security assistance"" to Pakistan, congressional aides said on Wednesday, a day after the White House warned Islamabad it would have to do more to maintain U.S. aid.
Aides in two congressional offices said the State Department called on Wednesday to inform them that it would announce on Wednesday or Thursday that aid was being cut off, although it was not clear how much, what type or for how long.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders declined to say whether an announcement was imminent. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The calls to Capitol Hill came a day after Washington accused Pakistan of playing a ""double game"" on fighting terrorism and warned Islamabad it would have to do more if it wanted to maintain U.S. aid.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Tuesday that Washington would withhold $255 million in assistance to Pakistan. Her statement followed an angry tweet from Trump on Monday that the United States had been rewarded with ""nothing but lies and deceit"" for giving Pakistan billions in aid.
Pakistan civilian and military chiefs rejected what they termed ""incomprehensible"" U.S. comments and summoned U.S. Ambassador David Hale to explain Trump's tweet.
Relations between Islamabad and Washington have been strained for years over Islamabad's alleged support for Haqqani network militants, who are allied with the Afghan Taliban.
The United States also alleges that senior Afghan Taliban commanders live on Pakistani soil and has signaled it will cut aid and take other steps if Islamabad does not stop helping or turning a blind eye to Haqqani militants crossing the border to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.

Many members of the U.S. Congress, particularly Republicans, who control both houses of the legislature, have been critical of the Pakistani government and called for cuts in military and other aid.

Thailand's lese-majeste law is the toughest in the world, and those judged guilty of breaking it face up to 15 years in jail for each count of offending the king, queen, heir or regent.
Nurhayati Masoh, 23, was found guilty after she posted on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account an article by Giles Ungpakorn, a Thai-British academic and vocal opponent of the Thai monarchy who fled Thailand after he was charged with lese majeste in 2009.
""She confessed that she posted it,"" Kaosar Aleemama, a lawyer for Nurhayati, told Reuters. ""But she did not realize it would lead to such a harsh punishment."" 
Nurhayati, who uses a computer application that helps the visually impaired to post on social media, was arrested in November and sentenced to three years in jail by a court in the southern province of Yala.
""The case against her was filed on November 28, 2017 and she has been detained since,"" an official at the Yala Provincial Court, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Nurhayati's confession led to her sentence being halved, he added.
Thailand's military, which took control of government in a May 2014 coup, has ramped up online censorship, particularly of perceived insults to the monarchy. 
Since the coup, at least 94 people have been prosecuted for lese majeste. As many as 43 people have been sentenced, says the iLaw group that monitors royal insult case, with 92 percent of them pleading guilty in hopes of receiving a shorter jail term. 
""There may be more cases that we do not know about,"" Yingcheep Atchanont, iLaw's project manager, told Reuters. 
The laws protecting members of the royal family from insult limit what all news organizations, including Reuters, can report from Thailand.
The United Nations has expressed concern over what it calls a deteriorating rights situation in Thailand, including harsh sentences for those convicted of violating the lese-majeste law, known as Article 112. 
The junta has said it needs to crack down on critics of the monarchy for the sake of national security.

Tension in the region has been rising, particularly since North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in September, and then in November, said it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach all of the U.S. mainland.
""It is not an exaggeration to say that the security environment surrounding Japan is at its severest since World War Two. I will protect the people's lives and peaceful living in any situation,"" Abe told a New Year news conference.
Abe said Japan would take new steps to strengthen its defense posture but he did not go to specifics.
The government approved a record military budget last month, with defense outlays due to rise for a sixth year, increasing by 1.3 percent to 5.19 trillion yen ($46 billion), with the biggest item 137 billion yen in reinforcing defenses against North Korean ballistic missiles.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said this week the United States was hearing reports that North Korea might be preparing to fire another missile, and she warned it not to.
""It is absolutely unacceptable that North Korea is trampling the strong desire of Japan and the rest of the international community for peaceful resolutions and continuing with its provocative behavior,"" Abe said.
Abe has said he wants to amend Japan's pacifist constitution with the aim of loosening constraints on the military, although the public is divided over changes to the charter imposed after Japan's World War Two defeat.
War-renouncing Article 9 of the constitution, if read literally, bans the existence of standing armed forces, but has long been interpreted to allow a military for exclusively defensive purposes. 
Abe said he wanted more debate on the issue.
""I would like this to be a year in which public debate over a constitutional revision will be deepened further,"" he said.

Abe's Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition retained its two-thirds ""super majority"" in parliament's lower house in an Oct. 22 election, re-energizing his push to revise the constitution.

To reduce its dependence on commodities such as coal and copper, Mongolia has ambitions to become an air freight hub for northern Asia and wants to develop tourism. 
But the new airport is unlikely to open this year as originally scheduled, Roads and Transportation Minister Jadamba Bat-Erdene said, as Mongolia negotiates a management contract with Japanese investors.
""The airport was expected to be operational this year, but plans are for it to be operational within the next year, due to management issues,"" he said on the ministry's official website.
""It is planned to set up a joint management team headed by Japan,"" he said in the statement, without elaborating. 
The new airport is intended to replace the Chinggis Khan (Genghis Khan) International Airport, and take the name of the country's 13th-century ruler, regarded as a national symbol.
Mongolia will be able to receive 3 million passengers a year by 2024 at the new airport, about 50 km (31 miles) from Ulaanbaatar, the capital. Its predecessor, a one-way runway built near a mountain range, is prone to disruptions and flight cancellations.
Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. and Chiyoda are leading construction, with Samsung (KS:005930) C&T acting as a subcontractor.
The Chinese Export-Import Bank is providing $140 million to finance a 32.2-km (20-mile) road to the airport. Now under construction, the road is set to be completed by October.
The International Monetary Fund encouraged Mongolia to diversify away from mining as part of a $5.5-billion bailout agreed last year to stabilize its crisis-hit economy.
Coal was the biggest driver of growth in 2017, but exports were hit by transport bottlenecks at the border with China, Mongolia's biggest customer.
Although the airport could generate non-mining growth, its success could depend on Mongolia allowing more airlines into the market and ending favorable treatment for the state carrier, analysts have said.

The Dec. 15 death of Ibrahim Abu Thurayeh was denounced by the Palestinians and decried by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who said the a 29-year-old amputee was shot in the head by Israeli troops close to the Gaza-Israel border fence.
The Israeli military said its own operational investigation, carried out shortly after the incident, had found that it was not possible to say what had killed Abu Thurayeh. It said no live fire had been directed at him during the dispersal of the demonstration, in which protesters hurled explosive devices and rocks and set tires alight. 
""In order to further examine the case, including information received from organizations operating in the Gaza Strip, it was decided that the circumstances of Thurayeh's death will also be examined by a Military Police investigation,"" the army said in a statement.
Trump's announcement on Jerusalem infuriated the Arab world and upset Western allies. It has sparked violent protests on a weekly basis along the Israel-Gaza border and in the occupied West Bank.
Abu Thurayeh was a regular at such demonstrations. In media interviews, he had said he had lost both his legs in a 2008 Israeli missile strike in Gaza.
The status of Jerusalem has been one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians for generations.

Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital. Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as the capital of a future independent state of their own.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's civilian president called in an Independence Day speech on Thursday for reform of a military-drafted constitution and for justice for all recognized minorities under a federal system, but made no mention of the treatment of its Rohingya Muslim people.
Amending the charter to remove a dominant political role for the military has been one of the most contentious issues facing Myanmar as it emerges from nearly half a century of strict army rule.
The debate over constitutional reform, however, has been muted since the assassination in January last year of a lawyer advising government leader Aung San Suu Kyi's ruling party on the issue.
""As we build the Democratic Federal Republic, in accordance with the results of the political dialogues, we all need to work collectively for creating a suitable constitution,"" President Htin Kyaw said in his speech marking the 70th anniversary of Myanmar's independence from Britain.
Htin Kyaw's post is largely ceremonial but he is a close ally of Suu Kyi. He did not elaborate on what he meant by suitable or spell out why he was suggesting the 2008 constitution drawn up by the military was unsuitable.
The constitution bars Suu Kyi from becoming president because it rules out candidates with a foreign spouse or child. Suu Kyi’s late husband was British as are her two sons.
It also reserves for the military one quarter of the seats in parliament and several major cabinet posts, including defense, interior and border affairs, giving it an effective veto over constitutional change and control of security affairs.
Myanmar began emerging from 49 years of military rule in 2011. Suu Kyi's party swept a 2015 election and formed a government but concern is growing that the reform program is stalling or even sliding back.
This has been compounded by attacks on press freedom, including the detention of several journalists over the past year. On Dec. 12, the authorities arrested two Reuters reporters who had covered the army crackdown that has led to the mass flight of Rohingya residents of Rakhine State across the border into Bangladesh. 
Htin Kyaw called for respect for human rights but he did not refer to the crisis over the exodus of 655,000 Rohingya people, nor to the international condemnation it has generated.
""We are working for the emergence of a democratic state based on the principles of freedom for all ethnic national races, justice, equality and right of self-determination,"" he said.
""National race"" is a term used by Myanmar referring to what it categorizes as indigenous ethnic groups. The Rohingya, who have traditionally lived in Rakhine, have been denied inclusion as authorities regard them as illegal immigrants who have crossed over from Bangladesh.
END TO CONFLICT
The Rohingya crisis erupted in late August after Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts in Rakhine triggered a fierce military response that the United Nations denounced as ethnic cleansing.
Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing saying its security forces have mounted legitimate clearance operations.
Htin Kyaw called for an end to conflict with insurgents from various ethnic minorities who have been battling for autonomy for decades.
Clashes have flared in recent weeks between the army and guerrillas in Kachin and Shan states in the north.
Myanmar's minorities have long demanded self-determination under a federal system. The army has traditionally seen itself as the only institution preventing the country's disintegration and has favored a unitary state.
Amending the constitution would not be easy.
Changes require a 76 percent majority vote in a parliament dominated by military members and their allies.
The killing of lawyer and constitutional expert Ko Ni last year has not been fully explained even though the gunman was caught at the scene. 

Many activists believe Ko Ni, who was Muslim, was targeted for his efforts to reduce the military's political role.

FOFONGA, India (Reuters) - Marzina Bibi, a Muslim woman living in India's northeastern state of Assam, is petrified she will be declared stateless.
The 26-year-old's name was not on a preliminary list of citizens that was published at midnight on Sunday, although she holds a voter identity card and had voted in state elections in 2016.
""Why are they doing this to me?"" Bibi asked, sitting beside a bamboo mat she was weaving outside her mud house in Assam's Fofonga village. ""They think I am a Bangladeshi. I was born here, my parents were born here, I am an Indian.""
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which came to power in Assam in the April, 2016 elections, vowed during the campaign to act against illegal Muslim immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh. But rights activists say the drive is also targeting Muslims who are Indian citizens.
Two national spokesmen for the BJP declined to comment.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi did not reply to e-mails and a telephone call seeking comment.
Citizenship and illegal migration are volatile issues in tea-growing and oil-rich Assam, home to more than 32 million people, about a third of whom are Muslims. Hundreds of people were killed in the 1980s in a violent protest by a native Assamese group against outsiders from the state taking the bulk of jobs and cornering resources, including land.
For the latest update of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), all residents of Assam had to produce documents proving that they or their families lived in the country before March 24, 1971, to be recognized as Indian citizens.
According to the preliminary list of the NRC, about 19 million people in Assam have now been verified as Indian citizens. More names will be added, and officials say the final list is likely to be published in July.
Reuters spoke to nearly two dozen Muslims, including Bibi, from paddy-growing villages around Fofonga who said their names were not on the preliminary list.
""I feel we are targeted because we are Muslims,"" said Bibi, who said she has already proved she was Indian - she was jailed for eight months on charges of being an illegal migrant from Bangladesh and was let off only after showing documents attesting to her nationality.
Surrounded by her neighbors in the village, she showed her voter identity card and the court order for her release from jail.
NO RELIGIOUS BIAS
The BJP has said previous governments have included many Bangladeshi immigrants on electoral rolls to buy votes.
At the local NRC office in the Muslim-majority area, only around 4,500 people had made it to the preliminary list out of nearly 11,000 who had applied. 
The government officer in charge of the center, Gautam Sharmah, said there was no religious bias against Muslims.
""That's impossible. We only look at documents,"" Sharmah said at his office, as people trickled in to look for their names on the second day of the list's publication. ""The time taken in the verification process depends on what kind of documents people submit.""
Reuters saw a tribal Hindu man leaving the NRC office with a smile after being told that the names of all six members of his family were on the list. Soon after, two Muslim women came with their infants, and left disappointed.
Hundreds of thousands of people fled to India from Muslim-majority Bangladesh after it declared independence from Pakistan on March 26, 1971, setting off a nine-month civil war. Most of them settled in Assam and the neighboring state of West Bengal, where there are similar demands to send back illegal Muslim immigrants.
The migrants include many Hindus, but the federal BJP government has said they will not be deported.
Himanta Biswa Sarma, Assam's finance minister who is also in charge of the citizenship register, told Reuters that all those whose names do not figure in the final NRC list would be segregated.
""Deportation is an issue handled by the central government,"" Sarma said.
""Hindu Bangladeshis who had faced persecution should be given shelter in India and that is the central government's stand.""
Muslims leaders have called the NRC a tool to make them stateless, likening themselves to Myanmar's persecuted Rohingya minority. They have also warned of unrest.
Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal told the Times of India daily that the ""people who are declared foreigners will be barred from all constitutional rights, including fundamental and electoral. They will have only one right — human rights as guaranteed by the U.N. that include food, shelter and clothing"".
In Fofonga, Bibi said she would challenge the list if it did not include her and her family as citizens.

""We are poor people, my husband is a laborer,"" she said, going back to weaving her mat. ""But I will go to court if we are left out.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian investigators and police hoisted the wreckage of a seaplane from the Sydney river where it sank after crashing on New Year's Eve, killing six people, including the chief executive of British catering company  Compass Group  (LON:CPG) Plc.
Richard Cousins, 58, his two sons, his fiance and her daughter and the pilot were killed when the plane hit the water shortly after takeoff on Sunday. 
The family were on a short tourist flight, operated by Sydney Seaplanes, from a waterfront restaurant on the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney, to Rose Bay in the city's east.
A preliminary report into the crash was expected in about 30 days, with a final report taking up to 12 months, according to Australian Transport Safety Bureau executive director Nat Nagy.
""We are reasonably confident that we will be able to do a thorough examination of the key components of the aircraft, to understand whether they were operating correctly at the time,"" Nagy told reporters.
Police divers wrapped slings around the fuselage and a barge fitted with a small crane slowly lifted the wreck, upside down and without wings, from about 13 meters of water near Cowan, 40 km (25 miles) north of Sydney. 
The propeller, cockpit and front section of fuselage were crumpled, and the landing floats were raised separately. The pieces were loaded on to the barge deck and covered with a tarpaulin, television pictures showed.
Air crash investigation records, first reported by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Thursday and reviewed by Reuters, show a plane with the same serial number crashed 21 years earlier, when it was being used as a crop duster.
The 1996 accident report found that the aircraft, a DHC-2 de Havilland Canada, likely stalled and that conditions were gusty when it crashed, killing the pilot.
""It was repaired after the accident and all appropriate approvals and checks were done. It was then re-registered and went back into service,"" a spokesman for Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority said in an email.
A spokesman for Sydney Seaplanes said the company had no comment while the investigation into the crash continues.

At least four bombs flattened the buildings in the town of Misraba, wounding more than 40 people, they said, while at least ten people were killed in aerial strikes in nearby towns in the last rebel stronghold near the capital.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor based in Britain, said 11 women and a child were among the dead in the strike in Misraba.
Video footage downloaded by activists on social media showed rescue workers pulling women and children from the rubble. The footage could not be independently confirmed.
Backed by Russian strikes, government forces have escalated military operations against Eastern Ghouta in recent months, seeking to tighten a siege that residents and aid workers say is a deliberate use of starvation as a weapon of war, a charge the government denies.
The rebel assault aims partly to relieve that pressure.
Jets have pounded rebel-held Harasta when rebels this week overran a major base in the heart of the enclave which residents say the army uses to pound residential areas. 
The United Nations says about 400,00 civilians besieged in the region face “complete catastrophe” because aid deliveries by the government were blocked and hundreds of people who need urgent medical evacuation have not been allowed outside the enclave.
Russia rejects opposition and rights groups' accusations that its jets have been responsible for deaths of thousands of civilians since its major intervention two years ago that turned the tide in favor of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Scores of hospitals and civil defense centers have been bombed in what the opposition said is a “scorched earth policy” to paralyze life in rebel-held areas.
Moscow says it only attacks hardline Islamists.

The national observatory put China's snow alert on its second-highest level this week, state news agency Xinhua said. Parts of the central, northern and eastern regions could see up to 30 cm (12 inches) of snow, it said.
VariFlight said Hefei Xinqiao International Airport, Fuyang Xiguan Airport in eastern Anhui province, and Jining Qufu Airport in coastal Shandong province had been shut. Some runways at other airports had been closed, causing delays, it said. 
Beijing Capital International Airport, one of China's busiest, was also experiencing some delays, it said. 
China's National Meteorological Center has also urged domestic authorities to take precautions regarding roads, railways, electricity supplies and telecommunications, according to Xinhua.
The northwestern part of central Hubei province saw its first snowfall of 2018 on Wednesday. 
Some highways were shut due to snow in central Henan province and northwestern Ningxia Autonomous Region. Snowfall in Xian, the capital of Shaanxi province, also led to the delay of many high-speed trains.
The meteorological center expects widespread rain or snow in China's central and eastern regions over the next week.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday met women who were forced to work in Japanese wartime brothels, days after their plight again cast a shadow over relations with Japan.
A South Korean panel set up to investigate a 2015 agreement with Japan on the thousands of girls and women forced to work in Japan's military brothels, euphemistically termed ""comfort women"" by Japan, said the deal failed to meet their needs. 
Moon said the 2015 deal, under which Japan apologized to victims and provided 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) to a fund to help them, was seriously flawed. Japan said any attempt to revise it could damage relations.
Eight of the women met Moon for lunch at the presidential compound, known as the Blue House, in Seoul, the president's office said in a statement.
""We told you the previous government's agreement was wrong and this issue hasn't been resolved,"" Moon told one of the women before the lunch.
""It's still not an easy situation to handle within our bilateral relationship.""
Moon wanted to gauge the women's reaction to his government's position on the deal, the Blue House said.
Moon visited one of the women, Kim Bok-dong, separately in the morning as she was ill and unable to attend the lunch.
""We survived when bullets were raining down and we'll be able to get through this,"" Kim told Moon, the Blue House said. 
The women want Japan to take legal, binding responsibility for its actions and Kim was scornful of the 2015 pay-out.
""The money should be sent back to Japan,"" she said.
South Korean activists estimate that there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean women forced to work in the brothels.
As of December, there are at least 32 surviving, according to a South Korean civic group set up to look after their rights.
It was the second time former ""comfort women"" visited the Blue House during Moon's presidency after one was invited to a dinner when U.S. President Donald Trump visited in November.
Moon's announcement on the Japanese deal last week raised consternation in Japan, where media reported said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may decide not to visit South Korea for the Winter Olympics there next month. 
South Korea's foreign ministry said on Thursday it would seek final measures on the issue as quickly as possible while one ministry official told Reuters the measures could be finalised as early as next week.
Strained ties come as the U.S. allies are trying to cooperate on security in the face of North Korea's nuclear and missile development.
But their bitter history, including Japanese colonization of the Korean peninsula and the issue of the women, has regularly been a source of rancor between them.

Moon came to power in May after the removal of his disgraced predecessor, Park Geun-hye, whose conservative government was criticized for failing to fully consult victims over the 2015 settlement.

Khaire, a former oil and gas executive, was appointed to the post by President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed last February. His government has been criticized for failing to stem attacks by al Shabaab militants.
Foreign affairs minister Yusuf Garaad Omar, interior minister Abdi Farah Said Juha and the commerce and labor minister Khadra Ahmed Duale had been relieved of their duties, the information ministry said in a statement.
They were replaced with Ahmed Ise Awad, Mohamed Abdi Sabriye and Mohamed Abdi Hayir, in the foreign affairs, interior and commerce posts respectively.
There had been a ""a dire need"" to appoint new ministers to those posts, the statement said, adding the new cabinet members would help the government tackle its heavy workload.
Last year, the defense minister and the head of military were sacked and replaced. 
The head of national security and the police commander were sacked after the country's deadliest truck bomb attack killed 512 people in October. Both posts have yet to be filled. 
With the help of African troops, Somalia's government has been battling the al Shabaab insurgents to try to restore peace in the country following decades of conflict.

The operation was focused on the central Turkish province of Konya, with police carrying out simultaneous raids at addresses across 27 provinces, state-run Anadolu news agency reported. 
Twelve of the 70 suspects had previously been expelled from the Turkish armed forces, Anadolu said.
Police operations to detain suspects accused of links to the Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen have been a near daily occurrence since the failed putsch of July 15, 2016, in which Gulen has denied any involvement.
Since then more than 50,000 people, including thousands of security personnel and civil servants, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs.
Rights groups say the crackdown has been exploited to muzzle dissent. The government says the measures have been necessary due to the security threats which Turkey has faced since the failed coup, in which 250 people were killed.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 12:06AM ET</span>","Trump breaks with Bannon, says former White House aide 'lost his mind'","By Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump blasted former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon on Wednesday as having ""lost his mind"" in the fallout over damaging comments Bannon made about Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. in excerpts from a new book.
Trump, who had continued to speak privately with Bannon after firing him in August, essentially cut ties with his former aide at least for now in a blistering statement issued after Bannon's comments came to light.
""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,"" Trump said.
Trump had relied heavily on Bannon, chairman of the right-wing Breitbart News website, for advice in the months leading up to his upset victory in the November 2016 election. 
Bannon helped Trump shape a populist, anti-establishment message and has been the president's link to his conservative base of support. It was not clear if the split would push Bannon to be even more aggressive in his campaign against the Republican establishment and whether he would now also target Trump, or would emerge much weaker.
According to excerpts from ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House"" by Michael Wolff, to be released on Tuesday, Bannon described a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York as ""treasonous"" and ""unpatriotic."" The meeting was arranged by the president's son and attended by top Trump campaign officials.
Trump has in the past praised Bannon for his friendship, but the president said in his statement on Wednesday Bannon had little to do with his election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, calling him ""a staffer who worked for me"" after he had already won the Republican nomination.
The president said Bannon was to blame for the loss of a Republican-held U.S. Senate seat in Alabama in December when Republican Roy Moore, whose campaign was derailed by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, lost to Democrat Doug Jones. Trump and Bannon backed Moore in the campaign. 
""Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans,"" Trump said.
'NIGHTMARE OF BACKSTABBING, HARASSING'
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had been upset over Trump's backing of Moore at the urging of Bannon, was clearly pleased Trump was willing to rid himself of the former aide. McConnell's campaign organization posted on Twitter an image of the normally taciturn senator with a beaming smile.
Donald Trump Jr. attacked Bannon in a tweet.
""Steve had the honor of working in the White House & serving the country. Unfortunately, he squandered that privilege & turned that opportunity into a nightmare of backstabbing, harassing, leaking, lying & undermining the President. Steve is not a strategist, he is an opportunist,"" he said.
The president, an expert at self-promotion, said Bannon was trying to promote himself by ""leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was.""
""Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books,"" said Trump, who famously values loyalty in associates and employees.
Lawyers for the president sent a cease and desist letter to Bannon on Wednesday. They said in the letter, seen by Reuters, Bannon had breached an agreement by communicating with Wolff about Trump, his family members and the campaign and made disparaging remarks about Trump and his family.
With elections looming in November that could cost Republicans control of Congress, Trump praised Republican lawmakers and candidates, words likely to be welcomed by McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan.
""Like me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down,"" Trump said.
'BRAIN TRUST'
As with much in the Trump White House, the story that triggered the harsh back-and-forth was an offshoot of the investigation into whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia to sway the election to Trump, allegations Trump and Moscow deny.
Bannon expressed derision about the June 2016 meeting in which a Russian lawyer was said to have offered damaging information about Clinton, according to the book.
The meeting was attended by Trump's son, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Bannon was also quoted as saying he was sure Trump Jr. would have taken the Russians who took part in the meeting to meet his father in Trump Tower. 
""The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn't have any lawyers,"" Bannon said in the book in excerpts seen by Reuters.
""Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately,"" he said.
When an intermediary proposed the meeting, saying the Russians were offering damaging information about Clinton, Trump Jr. responded in an email: ""I love it.""
Bannon was incredulous about the meeting shortly after it was revealed, according to the book, concluding sarcastically: ""That's the brain trust they had.""
The Wolff book, parts of which were published by New York magazine, portrayed Trump as shocked that he won the election and said his wife, Melania Trump, was in tears, and ""not of joy.""
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called the book ""trashy tabloid fiction.""

The first lady's spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said: ""The book is clearly going to be sold in the bargain fiction section. Mrs. Trump supported her husband's decision to run for President and in fact, encouraged him to do so. She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Many in Los Angeles' Iranian expatriate community, the largest in the United States, are heartened by anti-government street protests back home but want to make sure international focus stays on what they see as a struggle for democracy.
Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution and are concentrated in a neighborhood on the city's west side nicknamed ""Tehrangeles"" dotted with Persian shops and restaurants. The community is welcoming support for the protesters from political leaders of both parties in the United States.
Roozbeh Farahanipour, a leader of the 1999 student movement who was jailed three times before fleeing the country under a death sentence and winning asylum in the United States, said moral support from U.S. leaders was crucial, praising supportive tweets from both President Donald Trump and his rival in the 2016 election, Democrat Hillary Clinton. 
In 2009, Farahanipour said, some activists were disappointed when then-President Barack Obama showed support for reformers instead of those seeking regime change.
""It's exciting that this time there is no reformist movement involved. The people realize that reform is not going to work this time. They want regime change,"" he said. 
Any pro-regime Iranians with ties to the government who may live in the area have kept a low profile. 
Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards have dispatched forces to several provinces after six days of street demonstrations that began out of frustration over economic hardships suffered by youth and the working class that have left 21 people dead.
Activists in Los Angeles are planning a rally on Sunday at a federal building on the city's west side to show moral support for the uprising and draw attention to the struggle going on in their homeland.
Roxanne Ganji, a prominent Los Angeles-based pro-democracy activist whose father served as minister of education under the last Shah before his 1979 overthrow, said this generation of protesters seemed to less fearful than their predecessors.
""The youth don't have any future,"" Ganji said. ""A lot of (Iranians) come to L.A. after they finished college there and they are happier to be a waiter here. The economic situation is dire.""
The protests erupted in working-class neighborhoods over economic stagnation, high unemployment and allegations of graft within clerical and security hierarchies. They have evolved into a larger clash against the powers and privileges of a remote elite especially Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
Sid Mohasseb, an Iranian author and adjunct business professor at the University of Southern California, said U.S. media comparisons to a 2009 revolt over accusations of election fraud failed to consider that the earlier uprising was driven by middle-class Iranians who had stronger ties to the government.

""This is massive, across the country, and it started with a different class of people. This is folks that are hurting in the pocketbook,"" Mohasseb said. ""I actually think its going to go somewhere precisely because they (in the government) can't identify the leaders. If you say, 'Here is the leader,' they'll go after that leader and take him out.""

Miguel Angel Licona, 76, a former mayor of the municipality of Mixquiahuala in the state of Hidalgo, was shot dead along with his son, according to a statement from state prosecutors. 
Licona had been mayor for President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the 1990s.
The state attorney general's office said that investigators had ruled out a political motive to the murder. 
In October, another former mayor in Hidalgo was murdered but the government also ruled out any tie to politics and said the killing was the result of an armed robbery.
In recent months, about a dozen politicians, officials and candidates for elected office have been killed in states where there are struggles between criminal groups for the control of drug trafficking routes.
Mexico last year registered its highest murder total since modern records began, according to official data, dealing a blow Pena Nieto's pledge to get gang violence under control ahead of elections this year.
On July 1, Mexico will elect its next president as well as more than 600 lawmakers, while many states will also hold local elections. Concerns about rising violence and corruption have hammered Pena Nieto's popularity. 
Violence has in the past flared up during elections in areas of the country where gangs seek to influence local politics.

CHARLESTON, S.C./BOSTON (Reuters) - A rare winter storm hit the U.S. Southeast on Wednesday, dumping snow on Florida's capital for the first time in three decades and snarling travel, while New England braced for a ""bombogenesis"" blizzard forecast to bring heavy accumulations on Thursday.
The governors of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia declared states of emergency, warning residents to expect icy roads and freezing temperatures. In the northeast, work crews loaded trucks with road salt in advance of the storm.
The New York City Department of Education said it would close public schools Thursday because of severe weather. The National Weather Service predicted New York could see 5-8 inches of snow and wind gusts as high as 50 mph on Thursday.
Much of the eastern United States is in the grips of a sustained cold spell that has frozen parts of Niagara Falls on the American and Canadian sides, played havoc with public works causing pipes to freeze and water mains to burst, and impeded firefighting in places where temperatures barely broke 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
The cold has been blamed for at least nine deaths over the past few days, including two homeless people in Houston. Police in Roseville, Michigan, said on Wednesday that a 96-year-old woman, recently diagnosed with dementia, was found dead in a playground, apparently having frozen to death after wandering outside in a robe and slippers.
The National Weather Service had blizzard warnings in effect from Virginia to Maine, with areas around Boston expected to see about a foot (30 cm) of snow on Thursday. 
Snow would fall quickly during the day, at a rate of several inches per hour, with the storm intensified by the ""bombogenesis"" effect, private forecaster Accuweather warned.
""Bombogenesis,"" also known as a ""bomb cyclone,"" occurs when a storm's barometric pressure drops by 24 millibars in 24 hours, greatly strengthening the storm.
The effect is seen along the Northeastern coast every winter, but this storm will be particularly powerful, said Judah Cohen, a visiting scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
""This one is unique in how quickly the pressure is going to fall,"" Cohen said. ""The pressures could rival a Category 1 or Category 2 hurricane.""
An arctic air mass will remain entrenched over the eastern two-thirds of the United States through the end of the week. 
NOT FIT FOR MAN NOR BEAST
At a news conference, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster warned people in the eastern part of the state to stay indoors if possible and to keep pets indoors.
""If they can't get in the heat, they'll freeze to death and they'll be gone,"" McMaster said. ""And the same thing will happen to people. So you have to be careful about that.""
In the state's historic city of Charleston, the winter storm shuttered carriage-horse tour companies after a horse slipped and fell on ice during a tour on Tuesday, city spokesman Jack O'Toole said.
The wintry mix and low wind chills caused widespread power outages and icy roads, making commuting treacherous for millions of Americans from northern Florida to southern Virginia, the National Weather Service said.
The storm was starting to snarl air travel in the southern United States, with about 50 percent of flights canceled at airports in South Carolina's Charleston and Myrtle Beach and Savannah, Georgia, according to the FlightAware tracking service.
Two to 3 inches (5-8 cm) of snow were expected in northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina, weather service meteorologist Bob Oravec said. The weather service said its Tallahassee office had measured snow and sleet accumulation of 0.1 inch (2.5 mm) on its roof, the first snow in Florida's capital since 1989.
Boston Mayor Marty Walsh ordered schools closed on Thursday, warning city residents that the peak of the storm would occur during the day, making travel extremely dangerous.

""Both rush hours will be affected,"" Walsh told a news conference. ""Be patient. With the amount of snow we're getting here, we could be plowing your street and a half hour later it could look like we haven't been there.""

The United States deported 1,241 Salvadorans in 2017 for alleged connection to gangs, compared to 524 in the previous year, the government said.
Ninety of those individuals were later arrested in El Salvador, the migration authority said.
U.S. President Donald Trump implemented a crackdown on illegal immigrants that has included nationwide raids to arrest teenagers who entered the country without guardians and are suspected gang members.
The raids were a sharp departure from practices during the presidency of Barack Obama.
Under Obama, minors could only be targeted for deportation if they had been convicted of crimes, but were not arrested simply for suspected gang activity or membership.
Impoverished El Salvador has been plagued by a wave of violence attributed to the gangs, popularly known as ""maras.""
The government touted a 25 percent drop last year in homicides as a sign that its strategy to fight gangs is working, but it still has one of the highest murder rates in the world.

374,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",UK opposition party grassroots support second Brexit vote - survey,"LONDON (Reuters) - Eight out of 10 grassroots members of Britain's opposition Labour Party want a referendum on the terms of the country's exit from the European Union, according to a survey published on Thursday.
That is at odds with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's official policy which calls for parliament, not the public, to have the final say on the terms of the deal. 
It indicates a strong desire among the party's rank and file members for a chance to demand a rethink on Brexit, or even overturn the outcome of the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.
Eighteen months after voting 52 to 48 percent to withdraw from the EU, Britons remain deeply divided over leaving a bloc which has defined much of the country's laws, trade policy and international outlook over more than four decades of membership. 
Theresa May's Conservative minority government has dismissed the idea of a second referendum.
But ministers have already been forced to give parliament a greater say in the Brexit process than they initially wanted to after members of May's own party rebelled on the issue in December.
Thursday's survey of attitudes within Britain's main political parties showed 49 percent of Labour members definitely wanted a second referendum on the exit deal and a further 29 percent said they were more in favor of the idea than against it.
The poll of more than 4,000 members of political parties was conducted shortly after last June's national election as part of a three-year academic project by the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London to discover more about people who belong to political parties.
It showed even higher demand for a second vote on Brexit among members of the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party. By contrast, only 14 percent of Conservative Party members wanted a referendum on the exit deal.
Opinion polls measuring the views of the wider electorate show similar divisions over Brexit. In December, one survey showed 50 percent of voters supported a second referendum while 34 percent did not.
Labour's official stance on Brexit gained new significance after last year's general election saw them perform better than expected. 
That helped reopen a national debate about Brexit, depriving May of the unequivocal mandate she was seeking for her plan to take Britain out of the EU, its single market and the bloc's customs union.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico City residents should be free to grow marijuana for personal use, a mayoral hopeful told Reuters on Wednesday, arguing that one of the world's largest cities should lead the charge to end prohibition in a country riven by drug violence.
The proposal would bring Mexico City in line with a global trend toward legalizing cannabis use, Salomon Chertorivski said in an interview, a few days after California launched legal sales of the drug for recreational use.
""My proposal is the legalization of private cultivation for personal consumption, not for sale, in homes in Mexico City,"" said the center-left Chertorivski, a former federal health minister and Mexico City government official who is one of three candidates seeking the ticket for a left-right coalition ahead of a mayoral election.
Opinion polls show the alliance in second place behind the left-wing Morena party, which has already chosen its likely candidate for the July 1 election.
Drug use should be a public health rather than a criminal matter, the 43-year-old Chertorivski said, adding that Mexico City should take a ""step-by-step"" approach rather than follow the example of Portugal, which has decriminalized the use of hard drugs. 
Mexico City, a megalopolis whose urban sprawl comprises more than 20 million people, has been at the vanguard of a shift in Mexico to more socially liberal laws in recent years. It led the way for several Mexican states to allow same-sex marriage, and was first to offer women abortions in most cases.
""I am sure that this discussion will have the same luck,"" Chertorivski said. 
Mexico has softened its drug laws in recent years, decriminalizing possession of small amounts of several drugs, although it retains harsh penalties for larger quantities. 
Recreational marijuana is still broadly prohibited, but in 2015 the Supreme Court granted four plaintiffs the right to grow their own marijuana for personal consumption on human rights grounds. The country legalized the use of marijuana for medical and scientific needs in June.
Those milestones have helped stir debate in Mexico, where violent drug cartels have contributed to a death toll of at least 140,000 people over the past decade.
Chertorivski said legalizing cultivation would take business away from illegal gangs and keep marijuana users from drifting into criminal activity. He also proposed more than doubling the minimum wage to reduce crime.

Despite the trend toward legalization north of the border, cartels still make millions of dollars from smuggling marijuana into the United States.

HAVANA (Reuters) - The European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, arrived in Cuba on Wednesday to help strengthen member countries' economic and political ties with the Communist-run island.
Mogherini’s visit “reconfirms the strong EU-Cuban relationship,” and she will press for an “ambitious and swift joint implementation of the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement,” the EU said in a statement.
As the U.S.-Cuba rapprochement unfolded in 2015-2016 the EU dropped all sanctions and negotiated the agreement, the first accord between Cuba and the 28-nation bloc.
Signed in December 2016 and ratified in November, the EU said at the time that it hoped to position its companies for Cuba’s transition to a more open economy and allow the EU to press for political freedoms on the island.
""I was here visiting just a few days before the visit of President Obama, and I remember at the time there was much talk about Cuba strengthening relations with both the European Union and the United States,"" Mogherini said, when asked by reporters about the Trump administration’s partial rollback of a fragile detente between the old Cold War foes.
""Regardless of the changes in policy in Washington, the message I am bringing here is that the friendship and relationship with the EU is here to stay. It's solid, it's stable and it's reliable,"" she said.
Mogherini’s first official meeting on the two-day visit was with Foreign Investment and Cooperation Minister Rodrigo Malmierca.
She was also scheduled to meet with the head of the Roman Catholic Church, Archbishop Giorgio Lingua, and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Thursday.
“Cuba's weak economy has been battered by the collapse in Venezuela, making it more vulnerable and open to foreign capital. Europe is seizing the moment,” said economist Andrew Zimbalist, a Cuba expert at Smith College in the United States.
Cuba faces a host of challenges, including declining aid from socialist ally Venezuela. Last month Cuba extended the term of its current leadership to April, signaling a two-month delay in the historic handover from Raul Castro to a new president, while announcing tighter regulations on the non-state sector.
The official Juventud Rebelde newspaper reported on Wednesday that the EU is the most important exporter and second trading partner of Cuba, and also the most important donor of cooperation and foreign investment.

Macron has said he and his team were victims of fake news and a major data hack during his election campaign last year. 
Since coming to office in May 2017, he has particularly pointed the finger at Russian media, accusing TV channel RT of sowing disinformation about him via its website and social media during the campaign. 
""If we want to protect liberal democracies, we must have strong legislation,"" Macron said in a New Year's address to journalists, adding that the reform he envisaged would also change the role of France's media watchdog CSA.
""At election time, on internet platforms, the rules applying to content won't be exactly the same,"" Macron said. 
""There will be increased transparency requirements for internet platforms regarding sponsored content, with the aim of making public the identity of those who place the ads and also limiting the amount of them.""
A new emergency procedure in the event of fake news appearing would allow a judge to delete some content, close a user's account, or block access to a website, he said. 
Macron, who has cut back on the close relations his predecessor, Francois Hollande, had with the media, said the authorities must keep their distance with the press.
""The closeness which we had on occasions got used to was, I think, neither good for those in government nor for the journalists,"" he said.

""It sometimes led to more importance being given to backroom chatter than to official comments,"" he said, calling for a ""healthy distance"" to be maintained with the press.

In the single biggest loss of military hardware for Russia since it launched air strike in Syria in autumn 2015, more than 10 servicemen were wounded in the attack by ""radical Islamists"", the report said.
At least four Su-24 bombers, two Su-35S fighters and an An-72 transport plane, as well as an ammunition depot, were destroyed by the shelling, Kommersant said on its website, citing two ""military-diplomatic"" sources.

The offensive, northwest of Yemen's third largest city of Taiz, could be a major advance for the Western-backed coalition forces in nearly three years of civil war.
It would consolidate gains made last month at al-Khoukha on the Red Sea where pro-government forces, energized since the death of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh in December after he ditched his alliance with the Iran-aligned Houthis, made their biggest advance in months.
The Houthis, who swept across Yemen since 2014 overthrowing the internationally-recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in 2015, hold the capital Sanaa and much of northern Yemen, where most of the country's 25 million people live. 
The conflict - widely seen as a proxy war between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran - has displaced more than 2 million people, caused a cholera epidemic and pushed the country to the brink of famine. At least 10,000 people have been killed.
WAM said local Yemeni fighters, backed by UAE troops, raided Houthi strongholds between al-Khoukha and the town of Heys, about 25 km (15 miles) to the east to try to secure Red Sea areas captured last month.
""Emirati armed forces members and Yemeni resistance fighters managed to cut supply lines for the Houthi coup militias between Hodeidah and Taiz south of Heys city,"" WAM said, citing an Emirati army source.
It said that dozens of Houthi fighters were killed.
Residents said that Houthi forces, who control most of Taiz province and surround pro-government forces inside the provincial capital, continue to receive supplies through the adjacent Ibb province.
A spokesman for the Houthi-controlled Yemeni army could not be reached for a comment and the group's media outlets made no mention of any fighting in the area.

382,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 04:02PM ET</span>",Iran deploys Revolutionary Guards to quell 'sedition' in protest hotbeds,"By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin
LONDON (Reuters) - Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards have deployed forces to three provinces to put down anti-government unrest after six days of protests that have rattled the clerical leadership and left 21 people dead.
The protests, which began last week over economic hardships suffered by the young and working class, have evolved into a rising against the powers and privileges of a remote elite, especially supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
The unrest continued to draw sharply varied responses internationally, with Europeans expressing unease at the delighted reaction by U.S. and Israeli leaders to the display of opposition to Iran's clerical establishment.
Defying threats from the judiciary of execution if convicted of rioting, protests resumed after nightfall with hundreds hitting the streets of Malayer in Hamadan province chanting: ""People are begging, the supreme leader is acting like God!""
Videos carried by social media showed protesters in the northern town of Nowshahr shouting ""death to the dictator"".
In a sign of official concern about the resilience of the protests, the Revolutionary Guards commander, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said he had dispatched forces to Hamadan, Isfahan and Lorestan provinces to tackle ""the new sedition"". 
Most of the casualties among protesters have occurred in those regions of the sprawling Islamic Republic. 
The Revolutionary Guards, the sword and shield of Iran's Shi'ite theocracy, were instrumental in suppressing an uprising over alleged election fraud in 2009 in which dozens of mainly middle-class protesters were killed. Khamenei condemned that unrest as ""sedition"". 
In Washington, a senior Trump administration official said the United States aimed to collect ""actionable information"" that could allow it to pursue sanctions against Iranian individuals and organizations involved in the crackdown.
But in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron said the tone of comments from the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia was ""almost one that would lead us to war ... a deliberate strategy for some,"" and stressed the importance of keeping a dialogue with Tehran.
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel expressed concern about the situation escalating.
""What we urgently advise against is the attempt to abuse this internal Iranian conflict ... internationally. That is not going to ease the situation any way,"" he said.
In a state-sponsored show of force aimed at countering the outpouring of dissent, thousands of Iranians took part in pro-government rallies in several cities on Wednesday morning.
State television broadcast live footage of rallies where marchers waved Iranian flags and portraits of Khamenei, Iran's paramount leader since 1989.
Pro-government marchers chanted: ""The blood in our veins is a gift to our leader (Khamenei),"" and: ""We will not leave our leader alone."" They accused the United States, Israel and Britain of inciting protests, shouting, ""The seditionist rioters should be executed!""
In the Shi'ite holy city of Qom, demonstrators chanted ""death to American mercenaries"". On Tuesday, the 78-year-old Khamenei had accused Iran's adversaries of fomenting the protests.
Jafari, the Revolutionary Guards commander, said the pro-government rallies marked an end to protests that he said ""were a maximum of 1,500 people in each place, and the number of troublemakers did not exceed 15,000 people nationwide."" 
RARE ANTI-GOVERNMENT OUTPOURING
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has sought to isolate the Tehran leadership, reversing the conciliatory approach of predecessor Barack Obama, said Washington would throw its support behind the protesters at a suitable time.
""Such respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government. You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time!"" Trump wrote in the latest of a series of tweets on Iran's turmoil.
In contrast, the leader of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, played down the protests as economic discontent, saying they were not rooted in the political issues which spurred huge numbers to demonstrate in 2009 and would end soon. 
He described them as ""nothing to worry about"".
The protests seem to be spontaneous, without a clear leader, cropping up in working-class neighborhoods and smaller cities, but the movement seems to be gaining traction among the educated middle class and activists who took part in the 2009 protests.
More than 100 Iranian woman activists voiced support for a new uprising in a statement on Wednesday. Several prominent Iranian lawyers, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, urged Tehran to respect people's right to freedom of assembly and expression, guaranteed under the constitution.
Some labor unions as well as minority Kurdish opposition groups have also thrown their weight behind the protests.
In Geneva, the U.N. human rights chief urged Iran to rein in security forces to avoid further violence and respect the right to peaceful assembly.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, called for ""thorough, independent and impartial investigations of all acts of violence"".
Hamidreza Abolhassani, a regional judicial official, said a European citizen had been arrested for leading rioters in the Borujerd area of western Iran and was suspected of having been ""trained by European intelligence services"". The detainee's nationality was not given.
ROUHANI UNDER PRESSURE
The protests have heaped pressure on President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who championed a deal struck with world powers in 2015 to curb Iran's disputed nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions.
Many of the protesters are fuming over what they see as the failure so far of Rouhani's government to deliver on promises of more jobs and investment as a dividend of the nuclear accord.
Anger over economic stagnation and reputed graft within the clerical and security hierarchies has been building since last month. Thousands joined a hashtag campaign on Twitter and other sites to vent frustration over the dragging pace of reforms to tackle high unemployment and grant more social freedoms.
Khamenei and Rouhani have vowed to crack down on high-level corruption and create economic prosperity for all Iranians. 
But there have been few changes. The Revolutionary Guards, for example, still control a vast, lucrative economic empire. 
While more than 20 million out of 80 million Iranians live below the poverty line, the wealthy, including relatives of government officials, import tens of thousands of luxury cars every year.
Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil exports under terms of the nuclear deal he opposed. But if re-imposes sanctions, he risks worsening the economic pain of Iranians he has vowed to help.

""If the Americans’ sympathy with Iranians were real, they would have not imposed cruel sanctions on the our nation,"" Jafari, the Revolutionary Guards commander, said on Wednesday.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon lifted a years-old security cordon near its parliament on Wednesday in a move it hopes will revive central Beirut's business district and cement improved political stability after a prolonged period of upheaval.
Security forces removed metal barriers and heavy concrete slabs which had blocked all entrances to Beirut's showpiece Place d'Etoile quarter and forced most shops and restaurants in the once thriving district to shut down.
The security measures had been in place around the square for a number of years, but were significantly tightened in 2015 following large-scale protests over a garbage crisis. 
Crowds thronged the Place d'Etoile square for the first time in a decade on Sunday night to usher in the new year with fireworks, music and dancing in the streets.
The speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri, who issued Wednesday's order, said he hoped businesses, restaurants, hotels and offices in the area would now be able to resume work.
""There were many times we thought about closing, but we said 'no, maybe things will pick up',"" said Zeina Hasbini, who runs a chocolate boutique just off the square.
She and her son, who runs a small grocery store next door, said they were sure lifting the barriers would boost business as footfall and investment increased.
Though Lebanon still faces daunting challenges, it has seen some progress over the past year despite continued conflict in neighboring Syria and rising tensions elsewhere in the region.
Its squabbling politicians clinched a deal that ended a two-and-a-half-year period without a state president and installed a new government under Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. The government also approved its first budget in 12 years and awarded its first offshore oil land gas exploration licenses.
In August, Islamic State and other militants were cleared from the Lebanon-Syria border area after separate offensives by the Lebanese army and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah militia. 
The Petit Cafe overlooking Place d'Etoile reopened in mid-2017 after shutting its doors as the Syrian crisis erupted.
""The country ground to a halt: you no longer saw tourists, or people from the Gulf countries, so we closed for about 6-7 years,"" said Muhammad Faris, the restaurant manager. 
He said the new year's celebrations and the lifting of the barriers were signs that the area ""can flourish again"".
Despite such signs of hope, Lebanon remains a politically fraught country.

Tensions flared in November when Hariri unexpectedly resigned as prime minister in a shock broadcast from Saudi Arabia -- a move linked to conflict in the wider region between Riyadh and Tehran. He subsequently withdrew the resignation and the government resumed business as usual.

Israeli military courts - which handle cases involving Palestinians in the occupied West Bank - already have the power to issue the death sentence, although this has never been implemented. The only case of an execution in Israel was carried out against convicted Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1962.
The amendment to the penal code would still require three more readings if it is to become law. Currently, a death penalty can only be imposed if a panel of three military judges passes sentence unanimously. If the amendment is adopted, a majority verdict would suffice.
Wednesday's motion was brought by Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, an ultra-nationalist in the conservative coalition government, who advocates tough action against Palestinian militants. Fifty-two of parliament's 120 members voted in favor, and 49 were opposed.
Qadoura Fares, chairman of the Palestinian Prisoner Club which represents Palestinians jailed in Israel, denounced the vote as ""an expression of the state of blindness and confusion in the policies of this fascist regime (where) extremist parties race to pass racist laws.
""While the world moves toward repealing the death penalty, Israel is working to ratify this law, which is directed against the Palestinians,"" Fares told Reuters. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voted for the motion but said that such legislation required deeper discussion and that the matter would now be considered at ministerial level before further debate in the Knesset.
In remarks to lawmakers, he said: ""I think that in extreme cases, when somebody slaughters and laughs (as he kills), he should not spend the rest of his time in jail and should be executed.""
Asked by an Israeli Arab lawmaker whether he would also apply this reasoning to Jewish militants convicted of killing Palestinians, Netanyahu said: ""In principle, yes."" 

The successful vote was the latest in a number of motions brought by right-wing coalition members who feel able to pressure Netanyahu's brittle government into enacting hard-line legislation.

Then, while one kept watch, the other opened the display case and grabbed a jeweled golden brooch and a pair of earrings.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Canadian court on Wednesday postponed a bail hearing for former Taliban hostage Joshua Boyle, who was arrested on Saturday and faces criminal charges including assault, sexual assault and forcible confinement. 
The charges, filed on Monday, are for crimes prosecutors allege occurred in Canada after Boyle and his family arrived back in October, nearly five years after he and his wife were abducted in Afghanistan.
When they returned to Canada with three children born in captivity, Boyle said a fourth child had been murdered and his spouse raped after their capture by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network. The Taliban denied the accusations of rape and murder. 
Boyle, 34, appeared in an Ottawa courtroom on Wednesday via video link dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit. He confirmed his name, but did not enter a plea to the charges. 
The court imposed a publication ban that prevents media from reporting on information that could identify alleged victims or witnesses. The ban also prohibits reporting on the details of the bail hearing.  
The charges include eight counts of assault, two counts of sexual assault, two counts of forcible confinement and one count of uttering death threats.
Boyle's attorney, Eric Granger, told Reuters via email on Tuesday night that he looked forward to defending his client. 
""Mr. Boyle is presumed innocent,"" Granger said in an email. ""He's never been in trouble before."" Neither Boyle nor Granger commented on the charges.
Boyle and his wife Caitlin Coleman were kidnapped in 2012 while backpacking in Afghanistan. U.S. officials said the family spent almost all their confinement in neighboring Pakistan, which is where they were freed by Pakistani troops.

The family met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his Parliament Hill office last month. Photos released on Twitter showed Trudeau holding the youngest child in his lap.

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is widely expected to seek a second term in the presidential vote early this year, but has not yet announced his candidacy.
Ali said in November he intended to run against former military commander Sisi, who led the ousting of Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 before taking office a year later.
But a three month prison sentence passed in September for public indecency over an alleged rude hand gesture he made outside a courthouse last year might yet disqualify Ali.
Ali has appealed, denying the charges which he says are politically motivated. Wednesday's hearing at an appeals court delayed the final decision until March 7.
If the guilty verdict is upheld he will not be allowed to run, even if he is not jailed.
If the election takes place before March 7, however, Ali will be allowed to run, he and another lawyer said.
""Nothing stands in the way of my running,"" Ali told Reuters by phone.
""The (September) verdict ... has no value until it becomes final through an appeals court,"" he said.
Egypt will announce a date for the 2018 vote next week.
Ali, a socialist, ran in the 2012 election coming seventh. Mursi won that vote as Egypt's first freely elected president.
A judicial source said the appeals court had postponed its verdict while footage was examined to determine whether Ali made the alleged rude sign.
Ali gained prominence in January last year when he won a case that nullified a government transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, a deal that had prompted mass protests.
Sisi's critics say his popularity has been dimmed by austerity reforms, security problems and a crackdown on dissidents. 

His allies dismiss accusations of rights abuses, saying his measures are needed for security in the face of an Islamist insurgency in the North Sinai region that has expanded to include civilian targets.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's supporters got a boost on Wednesday when a key ally of the elderly leader announced he would head a group campaigning for him to seek re-election next year.
Buhari, 75, has not publicly said whether he will take part in the February 2019 election. Political insiders have privately questioned Buhari's willingness, or ability, to keep the top job after he spent much of the past year in Britain being treated for an undisclosed ailment that left him visibly weakened.
But Adebayo Shittu, Nigeria's minister of communications who played a prominent role in Buhari's 2015 campaign, said he would chair a group to support the re-election of the president and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.
Campaigning for the re-election of a president in Nigeria has often started with such support groups before the incumbent declares his intention to run again.
""We, his ardent supporters who appreciate his worth on behalf of millions of Nigerians, would urge him to recontest,"" Shittu told reporters in the capital Abuja after informing Buhari of his plans to head the group.
""I know he has not made up his mind but I can say that some of us can assist him in making up his mind,"" he added.
The fact that Shittu discussed campaign arrangements with Buhari and then told reporters is a sign that the president may have given his approval.
DISENCHANTMENT 
On Jan. 20 an office for the organization of the campaign will be set up in Nigeria's southwest, Shittu said.
The southwest is a key region in Nigerian elections, home to the sprawling megacity of Lagos, where widespread support for Buhari in 2015 is credited with helping him defeat the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan.
But while Buhari in 2015 rode a wave of resentment against Jonathan over endemic government corruption, a struggling economy and a failure to defeat the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast, much of public opinion has now turned against Nigeria's incumbent leader.
Many Nigerians complain that Buhari's government is also corrupt, pointing to the president's sacking of his top civil servant and the head of the National Intelligence Agency in October after highly-public graft scandals.
Others dispute how well the economy, Africa's largest, has recovered. Nigeria exited its first recession in 25 years in the second quarter of 2017, but growth remains sluggish and the country continues to depend on oil, while unemployment and underemployment have increased.
Boko Haram's deadly attacks also continue to plague the military and civilians in the northeast almost daily, despite the Buhari administration's insistence over the past two years that the insurgency has been beaten.
In a blow to the president, Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and key Buhari ally, quit the ruling All Progressives Congress and said he was prepared to run in 2019. Last month he joined the opposition People's Democratic Party.

GAZA (Reuters) - The Palestinian Authority said on Wednesday it asked Israel to fully restore Israeli electricity flows to the Gaza Strip, a move that could nearly double the daily connection time in an enclave suffering severe power shortages. 
There was no immediate word from Israel whether it would comply at a time when it says the Islamist Hamas group, which controls Gaza, bears overall responsibility for recent cross-border rocket attacks launched by smaller militant factions.
In a statement, Hussein Al-Sheikh, Palestinian minister of civil affairs, said the Palestinian Authority would again guarantee payment of Gaza's Israeli electricity bill and ask Israel to restore the 50 megawatts of power, out of a total 120 megawatts, that it had supplied to the area.
A statement issued by Prime Minister Rami Al-Hamdallah said the request was to ""alleviate the suffering of the people of Gaza and to improve living conditions.""
Gaza's two million residents now receive only three to four hours of electricity a day, with schools, factories, hospitals and households affected. A Gaza economist said restoration of power from Israel, the enclave's main electricity supplier, could raise that figure to six hours. Gaza's sole power station generates only a small amount of electricity.
In April, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced he was cancelling the guarantee, part of a bid to press Hamas to loosen its hold over the enclave, a decade after the Islamist movement seized the territory from forces loyal to him.
Prompted partly by Abbas's sanctions and fears of financial and political isolation, Hamas signed an Egyptian-brokered reconciliation agreement with his Fatah movement in October and agreed to hand over administrative control of the Gaza Strip to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority.
But both groups have failed to finalize details of the deal, which had been due to be completed on December 1. The Authority's decision to resume the electricity payments could help smooth the way towards completing the accord.
The PA's request coincides with heightened Israeli-Palestinian tensions. 
Palestinians have been mounting protests in the occupied West Bank and violence has flared along the Israel-Gaza border since U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Dec. 6 that he was recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
In the West Bank on Wednesday, Israeli troops shot dead a 17-year-old Palestinian during a confrontation with stone-throwing protesters, Palestinian medics said. An Israeli military spokeswoman said he appeared to have been holding a firearm.
His death raised to 13 the number of Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli forces since Trump's declaration, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. There have been no Israeli fatalities or serious injuries in the confrontations or as a result of the rocket strikes.
Two Hamas gunmen were killed in one Israeli retaliatory air strike in December.

Amirhossein Pourjafar, who was 16 when he was sentenced to death in September 2016, a year after the crime, is among more than 80 youths known to be on death row in the Islamic Republic.
Pourjafar, believed to be held at a prison in the city of Karaj, was already scheduled to be executed in October 2017 when the experts made a previous 11th-hour appeal. He turned 18 last month according to the Western calendar, a U.N. official said.

""The Iranian authorities must immediately halt the execution of this juvenile offender and annul the death sentence against him in compliance with their international obligations,"" they said in a joint statement.

In a draft of the report previously seen by Reuters, FATF commended efforts to clean up the Mexican banking sector after U.S. investigations in the mid-2000s showed global banks processed billions of dollars in drug gang cash. But it said tax authorities did not do enough to monitor businesses outside the financial sector used for money laundering, such as real estate.

Kotb will join Savannah Guthrie during the first two hours of the popular program, starting at 7 a.m. EST (noon GMT), and become the first pair of women to host the show along with weatherman Al Roker and Orange Room host Carson Daly. Kotb will continue co-hosting the 10 a.m. hour of ""Today"" with Kathie Lee Gifford.
""It's 2018 and we are kicking off the year right because Hoda is officially the co-anchor of Today,"" said Guthrie, 46, who announced the news during the program's opening moments. 
Kotb, 53, quickly filled in as co-host when Lauer was fired on Nov. 28 after a female colleague complained to NBC officials about a pattern of inappropriate sexual behavior that began while they were on assignment at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia, according to the network. 
At least two other women went to NBC with similar complaints against Lauer following the first allegation. None of the women has been publicly identified.
""Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I'm committed to beginning that effort,"" Lauer said after he was fired.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jurors in the U.S. trial of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey's majority state-owned Halkbank who is charged with helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions, asked in a note on Wednesday what they should do if they agree on some of the charges against Atilla but not others.
Atilla is charged with bank fraud, money laundering and four separate conspiracy charges. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said he would tell the jury in response to the note that they should continue deliberating and try to reach a verdict.
Wednesday was the jury's fourth day deliberating on the case, which has strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey.
At the center of the three-week trial was testimony from Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who pleaded guilty to charges of violating sanctions and testified for U.S. prosecutors.
Zarrab testified that Atilla helped design fraudulent transactions of gold and food that allowed Iran to spend its oil and gas revenues abroad, including through U.S. financial institutions, defying U.S. sanctions.
Zarrab also implicated Turkish officials in the scheme, including President Tayyip Erdogan.
Attempts to reach Erdogan's spokesman for comment on the allegations at the trial have been unsuccessful. Erdogan has publicly dismissed the case as a politically motivated attack on his government.
Atilla has denied all of the charges against him.
Halkbank has denied taking part in any illegal transactions.
U.S. prosecutors charged nine people in the criminal case, though only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, were arrested by U.S. authorities.

397,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>","Palestinians condemn Trump aid halt threat, mixed reaction in Israel","By Ali Sawafta
RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinians condemned as blackmail on Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to withhold future aid payments over what he called the Palestinians' unwillingness to talk peace with Israel.
Trump drew praise from a cabinet minister in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government but a warning from a former Israeli peace negotiator of the dangers in cutting off financial assistance to the Palestinians.
On Twitter on Tuesday, Trump said that Washington gives Palestinians ""HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don't even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?""
Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee, said in response: ""We will not be blackmailed.""
Palestinian anger at Trump is already high over his Dec. 6 recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a declaration that also generated outrage across the Arab world and concern among Washington's Western allies.
Commenting on Trump's tweets, Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said: ""Jerusalem is not for sale, neither for gold nor for silver.""
Abu Rdainah said the Palestinians were not opposed to returning to peace talks that collapsed in 2014, but only on the basis of establishing a state of their own along the lines that existed before Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 war.
""If the United States is keen about peace and about its interests it must abide by that,"" he said.
Israel, which withdrew troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, has called the pre-1967 war West Bank boundaries indefensible and has pledged to hold on to all of Jerusalem forever.
UNRWA FUNDING
A report prepared for the U.S. Congress in December 2016 by the U.S. Congressional Research Service said annual U.S. economic support to the West Bank and Gaza Strip has averaged around $400 million since fiscal 2008.
Much of the money has gone toward U.S. Agency for International Development-administered project assistance and the rest toward budget support for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which administers limited self-rule in the Palestinian territories under interim peace agreements.
Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, welcomed Trump's aid comments, saying on Army Radio: ""I am very satisfied ... (Trump) is saying the time has come to stop saying flattering words (to the Palestinians).""
But Tzipi Livni, an Israeli opposition politician and a former peace negotiator, said ""a responsible and serious (Israeli) government"" should quietly tell Trump that it would be in Israel's interest to prevent a ""humanitarian crisis in Gaza"" and to continue to fund Palestinian security forces cooperating with Israel.
Earlier on Tuesday, Trump's U.N. ambassador disclosed plans to stop funding a United Nations agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees.
""The president has basically said he doesn't want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table,"" Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters when asked about future U.S. funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)for Palestinian refugees.
In an emailed statement, UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness said ""UNRWA has not been informed by the United States administration of any changes in U.S. funding to the Agency"".
The United States is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA's website.

According to UNRWA's website, there are 5.9 million UNRWA refugees and other registered persons eligible for its services, which include education and health care, in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Italy's Northern League pledges to put right 'error' of euro,"By Isla Binnie
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's rightist Northern League brushed off on Wednesday suggestions it had dropped its opposition to the euro and renewed its pledge to rectify the ""error"" of the single currency.
Rising hostility to the euro in Italy is a prominent issue in campaigning for a March national election, and the prospect that anti-establishment parties could try to pull the country out of the single currency has rattled financial markets.
A coalition including the League and former premier Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) looks set to win the most votes in March, but no group is likely to achieve a clear parliamentary majority.
European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, a member of Forza Italia, said this week the League ""seemed to have abandoned the idea of a hypothetical and unfeasible exit from the euro"". League leader Matteo Salvini hit back on Wednesday.
""Free interpretations of my thinking make me laugh,"" he told la Repubblica newspaper. ""I remain convinced ... that the euro under these conditions was an error. Which we will put right.""
Allied with France's National Front in the European Parliament, the League blames the euro for rising poverty in the bloc, saying it only favors economic powerhouse Germany.
Once one of the most pro-EU nations in Europe, Italy has become more hostile towards Brussels in recent years. A survey released by the Bertelsmann Foundation last October showed 83 percent of Italians were not satisfied with the direction of the EU against an average of 66 percent across the 28-nation bloc. 
The anti-system 5-Star Movement has also seized on this disaffection, pledging a referendum on euro membership if Brussels does not agree to change the bloc's fiscal rules. [nL8N1OI4XS]
But in France, the National Front's anti-euro stance contributed to a bruising defeat at the hands of pro-EU centrist Emanuel Macron last spring. Marine Le Pen's party has since softened its position, leaving the Northern League more isolated within Europe in its push for a euro-exit. [nL8N1MM3VG] 
""Before, we had a concrete hope of creating a group of nations that could have immediately demolished the euro ... Sadly we no longer have that, so we need to approach it unilaterally,"" Claudio Borghi Aquilini, the League's head of economic policy, told Reuters. 
""Our plan is still to try to leave the euro as soon as possible, but 'as soon as possible' means being ready to do so,"" he said, giving no indication of how long it would take.
One of the League's flagship proposals is to introduce a parallel currency for domestic use, issuing small-denomination bonds to firms and individuals owed money by the state. 
Borghi said such instruments could become a sovereign currency in an emergency.
Berlusconi, who cannot run personally in the election because of a tax fraud conviction, also proposes a dual currency, but does not back abandoning the euro. [nL8N1LP4E9]
Building consensus in a center-right coalition for a radical exit will be difficult, Borghi said, partly because Italy's economy is now growing modestly. But any future intransigence from European authorities could help that cause, he added.

""If we start with the idea that we always have to say 'yes' to whatever they ask of us, because we must stay in the euro at all costs, it's over, it's worse than a military defeat,"" he said.

Titanic magazine was mocking Beatrix von Storch, a member of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, who accused police of trying ""to appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hordes of men"" by putting out a tweet in Arabic.
Twitter briefly suspended her account and prosecutors are examining if her comments amount to incitement to hatred.
Titanic magazine published its send-up late on Tuesday, in a tweet purporting to be from von Storch to the police, saying: ""The last thing that I want is mollified barbarian, Muslim, gang-raping hordes of men.""
Titanic said on Wednesday its Twitter account had been blocked over the message, which it assumed was a result of a law that came into full force on Jan. 1 that can impose fines of up to 50 million euros ($60 million) on social media sites that fail to remove hate speech promptly.
""We are shocked,"" Titanic editor Tim Wolff said on the magazine's website, adding that Chancellor Angela Merkel and Justice Minister Heiko Maas had promised that the new law would not have this kind of effect.
A Twitter spokesman said the company did not comment on individual accounts, for reasons of privacy and security.
The Association of German Journalists (DJV) said the Twitter move amounted to censorship, adding it had warned of this danger when the law was drawn up last year.
""A private company based in the United States decides the boundaries of freedom of the press and opinion in Germany,"" DJV Chairman Frank Ueberall said in a statement, calling on parliament to reverse the hate speech law.
Twitter, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other social media platforms are scrambling to adapt to the law, and its implementation is being closely watched after warnings that the threat of fines could prompt websites to block more content than necessary.
Germany has some of the world's toughest laws on defamation, incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence, with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities.
Merkel's conservatives accused the AfD of undermining the post-war democratic consensus in Germany.
""The racism that AfD lawmakers have been tweeting for days is intentionally violating, with criminal intent, the basic consensus which democrats have built up since 1949 despite all disagreements,"" Armin Laschet, party deputy of Merkel's Christian Democrats, tweeted. 
""By doing this, they want to pave the way to a totally different republic.""

BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Economics student Mutassim al-Misrati lost his leg in an RPG attack in April 2014 while fighting in Benghazi, his home city. 
Back then Misrati had joined the forces that were beginning to coalesce around Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, who weeks later would launch a campaign to take control of Benghazi, Libya's second city.
Haftar, now the dominant figure in eastern Libya and a likely candidate in elections that may happen by the end of the year, finally declared victory in Benghazi in July 2017, though fighting continued in one area of the city until last week.
The win has come at the cost of thousands of dead and many more wounded who receive little care.
Since 2014, Libya has been split between rival military factions and governments, causing an economic decline and collapse in health services that have left many veterans to fend largely for themselves.
Misrati received medical care the year he was wounded, and has a prosthetic leg that allowed him to return to studying for an economics degree and working at a fish market.
""In 2014, I received care but at the present moment in time there is neglect when it comes to all of those wounded,” Misrati said. 
He is still a supporter of Haftar, whose campaign in Benghazi, ""Operation Dignity"", battled Islamists and other opponents, some of them former rebels who had fought to topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. 
""I fought and dedicated myself to my country. Thank God, I was spared and now I am back with my work and my people,"" Misrati said.
""There are amputees who have not received prosthetic legs, though some received prosthetics. Some are able to run, just like I am able to run, and to live.""
There are no independent estimates for overall casualties from the conflict in Benghazi, though Ahmed al-Mismari, a spokesman for Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), said about 6,000 of their men had died. 
The LNA special forces, which played a leading role in the fighting, lost about 1,500 men and had some 2,500 wounded, said Colonel Milad al-Zawi, a spokesman. 
Veterans get a one-off payment of 2,000 dinars, currently the equivalent of just $225 at black market rates that set the price of many goods in Libya. Though foreign governments have flown some wounded fighters abroad for treatment, seeking medical treatment outside the country has become prohibitively expensive for most. 
In Benghazi, daily struggles with liquidity shortages and inflation have dampened hopes brought by an end to the fighting.

""Benghazi is full of the blood of martyrs,"" said Misrati. ""It wants the nation to be at rest, it wants cash, it wants uncrowded bakeries, petrol, electricity.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Young male refugees in Germany got the blame on Wednesday for most of a two-year increase in violent crime, adding fuel to the country's political debate over migrants.
Violent crime rose by about 10 percent in 2015 and 2016, a study showed. It attributed more than 90 percent of that to young male refugees.
It noted, however, that migrants settling from war-torn countries such as Syria were much less likely to commit violent crimes that those from other places who were unlikely to be given asylum.
Migration will be a key issue in forthcoming coalition talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). The arrival of more than a million migrants since mid-2015 hurt both parties in last September's election. 
The government-sponsored study showed a jump in violent crime committed by male migrants aged 14 to 30.
Christian Pfeiffer, a criminology expert and one of the study researchers, told Deutschlandfunk radio there were huge differences between various refugee groups depending on where they came from and how high their chances were of staying and gaining legal status in Germany.
Asylum seekers who are regarded as war refugees who have relatively good chances of staying in Germany tend to avoid trouble more, the study found.
Around 17 percent of violent crimes in Lower Saxony that were attributed to refugees, for example, were suspected of being committed by North African asylum seekers who made up less than 1 percent of the state's registered refugee population. North African asylum seekers have relatively slim chances of obtaining legal status in Germany.
""The situation is completely different for those who find out as soon as they arrive that they are totally undesirable here. No chance of working, of staying here,"" Pfeiffer said.
The study said reuniting refugees with their families by allowing them to come to Germany too could help to reduce violence. Such reunions look set to be a particularly contentious issue in talks about a new coalition government. 

The predominantly young male majority of refugees live in Germany without partners, mothers, sisters or other females whom the study sees as a ""violence-preventing, civilising force.""

Monson became the 16th President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the religion is officially known, in 2008. As its leader, members of the faith considered him a prophet who received divine revelations.
Monson died late on Tuesday surrounded by his family, the church said in a statement on its website.
""President Monson had all the hallmarks of an unassuming servant of the Lord,"" the church statement said.
Mormons worship Jesus, believing in a ""restored"" church, with living apostles and prophets. They believe in the Bible, as well as an additional book of scripture, the Book of Mormon. 
The church, which was formally organized in 1830 in Upstate New York, reported last year to have 15.8 million members worldwide. They include the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and actor Katherine Heigl.
Romney praised Monson on Wednesday for his work and said he would be remembered for his love and compassion for ""every one of God's children.""
""Ann and I and our family join the widows and orphans and homeless and countless others who today mourn the life of a true prophet of God and apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ,"" he said in statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Born and raised in Salt Lake City, Monson was appointed in 1963 to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the church’s second-highest governing body after the three-man First Presidency.
In May 2015, the LDS Church said Monson was ""feeling the effects of advancing age,"" according to reports from the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper, and began cutting back public appearances and addresses to preserve his energy. 
Upon death, a Mormon president is succeeded by the head of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a post currently held by the 93-year-old Russell Nelson. 
Monson's predecessor Gordon Hinckley died at 97 in late 2007. 
As well as his life-long dedication to his faith, Monson had a ""broad business background"" and led a successful career in the publishing industry, the church said on its website.

""Do something for someone else on that day to make his or her life better. Find someone who is having a hard time, or is ill, or lonely, and do something for them. That’s all I would ask,"" he said during an interview on his 81st birthday, according to the church.

None of the defendants, who include two women, were present at the reading of the verdict. They had repeatedly said the court was under the influence of politicians. 
Another 11 lawmakers face the same charges and are awaiting verdicts. 
Kosovo’s government says the border accord with Montenegro is an important condition for its citizens to eventually benefit from a visa-free travel regime with the European Union.
But Vetevendosje, which became the single biggest party in the parliament after June elections, opposes the deal. They say that by ratifying the agreement, Kosovo would hand over some 8,000 hectares (19,700 acres) of its land to Montenegro.
The party also opposes a 2013 EU-brokered deal between Serbia and Kosovo that gives more autonomy to Kosovo's Serb minority.
In November last year another party member was sentenced to eight years in jail for taking part in a grenade attack on the parliament building in 2016.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after NATO bombing drove Serb forces from the territory.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Wednesday it would pay thousands of African migrants living illegally in the country to leave, threatening them with jail if they are caught after the end of March.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in public remarks at a cabinet meeting on the payment program, said a barrier Israel completed in 2013 along its border with Egypt had effectively cut off a stream of ""illegal infiltrators"" from Africa after some 60,000 crossed the desert frontier.
The vast majority came from Eritrea and Sudan and many said they fled war and persecution as well as economic hardship, but Israel treats them as economic migrants.
The plan launched this week offers African migrants a $3,500 payment from the Israeli government and a free air ticket to return home or go to ""third countries"", which rights groups identified as Rwanda and Uganda.
""We have expelled about 20,000 and now the mission is to get the rest out,"" Netanyahu said.
An immigration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there are some 38,000 migrants living illegally in Israel, and some 1,420 are being held in two detention centers.
""Beyond the end of March, those who leave voluntarily will receive a significantly smaller payment that will shrink even more with time, and enforcement measures will begin,"" the official said, referring to incarceration. 
Some have lived for years in Israel and work in low-paying jobs that many Israelis shun. Israel has granted asylum to fewer than one percent of those who have applied and has a years-long backlog of applicants.
Rights groups have accused Israel of being slow to process African migrants' asylum requests as a matter of policy and denying legitimate claims to the status.
Netanyahu has called the migrants’ presence a threat to Israel’s social fabric and Jewish character, and one government minister has referred to them as “a cancer”.
Teklit Michael, a 29-asylum seeker from Eritrea living in Tel Aviv, said in response to the Israeli plan that paying money to other governments to take in Africans was akin to ""human trafficking and smuggling"".
""We don't know what is waiting for us (in Rwanda and Uganda),"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""They prefer now to stay in prison (in Israel) instead.""
In his remarks, Netanyahu cited the large presence of African migrants in Tel Aviv's poorer neighborhoods, where he said ""veteran residents"" - a reference to Israelis - no longer feel safe.

""So today, we are keeping our promise to restore calm, a sense of personal security and law and order to the residents of south Tel Aviv and those in many other neighborhoods,"" he said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Wednesday it had cracked a Palestinian militant cell suspected of having been recruited and handled by Iranian intelligence officers who worked out of South Africa.
Israel has long been locked in a shadow war with arch-foe Iran, which supports Islamist guerrillas in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon and whose nuclear program is widely believed to have been targeted repeatedly by Israeli saboteurs. 
Israel's Shin Bet security agency said three Palestinians from the occupied West Bank had been indicted on espionage and terrorism charges after they confessed to accepting Iranian-assigned missions, including preparation of a suicide bombing and providing their handlers with Israeli cellphone SIM cards.
In its statement, the Shin Bet said the suspects' point of contact was a Palestinian who lived in South Africa and had been recruited by Iranian intelligence. It gave no indication whether the South African government knew of the alleged Iranian activity, or of the Palestinian man's whereabouts.
South Africa, where pro-Palestinian sentiment is strong, has strained relations with Israel, but the Shin Bet statement also suggested the country effectively served as an Iranian spy hub.
""It became clear, during the Shin Bet investigation, that Iranian intelligence used South Africa as a significant arena for locating, recruiting and running anti-Israel agents in the West Bank,"" the Shin Bet said, adding that several Iranian officers had traveled there ""from Tehran"" for the operation.
South Africa's Foreign Ministry and Home Affairs Ministry and the Iranian embassy in Pretoria did not immediately respond to the Israeli allegations. 
The Shin Bet did not say when it cracked the Palestinian cell or when the trial of the suspects would begin. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Wednesday the case showed that ""Iran operates in a subversive and terrorist manner ... not just in aiding terror groups like Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad, but also in attempts to organize terror activities within the State of Israel against its civilians"".
The Shin Bet did not describe any of the attacks or espionage missions allegedly planned by the suspects as having been near to fruition. It also did not say whether the three had been assigned lawyers or how they might plead to the charges. 
A Shin Bet veteran interviewed by Israel Radio about the case suggested the purported South African link may be unprecedented.
""Apparently the Iranians found fertile ground in South Africa,"" said ex-officer Adi Carmi, adding: ""I do not recall South Africa ever having been used by the Iranians as a terrorist recruiting ground for the aim of carrying out attacks.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel will put her reputation as Europe's consummate consensus-builder on the line on Wednesday, when she launches a second bid to form a coalition government after weeks of sniping between its would-be partners.
Seeking a fourth term in office, Merkel saw her authority weakened in a national election in September, when support for her conservatives was eroded by the far right.
She is now under increasing pressure to reach a deal with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), which also lost ground in the election, but the two sides have bickered over a range of issues, notably immigration and taxation.
At a meeting on Wednesday afternoon, Merkel will try to build trust with SPD leader Martin Schulz and the head of Bavaria's CSU conservatives, Horst Seehofer, by agreeing a structure for talks that are due to start on Sunday and could lead to official coalition negotiations in a few weeks. 
Having failed before Christmas to form a coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), Merkel is now leading an interim government with the SPD that is keeping things ticking over in Europe's biggest economy.
Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance ruled in a 'grand coalition' with the SPD from 2013 to 2017 and, with investors fearing a protracted power vacuum that could delay reforms in Germany and the European Union, she is pressing for a re-run of that arrangement.
But the SPD has shown reluctance, with some of its members favoring a looser cooperation agreement or supporting a minority government.
'VERBAL SHENANIGANS' 
The two blocs are at odds on issues from healthcare and immigration to Europe and pensions and, if no deal is done, Merkel's future as chancellor would be thrown into doubt with new elections a distinct prospect.
In recent days some conservatives, especially from Bavaria, have stoked tensions by calling for tax cuts for high earners and reductions in benefits for asylum seekers, which the SPD opposes. 
""Again verbal shenanigans from the Bavarian CSU,"" tweeted one of the SPD's deputy leaders, Ralf Stegner.
""Always the same recipe: humor the lederhosen public. No sense of reality in terms of agreeing with the other parties.""
But Seehofer sounded more conciliatory on Wednesday, saying ""important days"" lay ahead. ""We will do everything in these talks to reach sensible agreements,"" said the Bavarian before internal party talks on Wednesday morning.
One of Merkel's priorities will be to establish an atmosphere of trust between the parties, the absence of which led to the collapse of the talks with the Greens and FDP in November.
Many within the SPD, which said it would go into opposition after the election in which its support slumped to its lowest level since 1933, fear sharing power with Merkel again will lead voters to punish it further.
To keep the rank and file on board, the SPD leadership has said it will let its members vote on Jan 21 on going ahead with detailed coalition talks after a first exploratory phase has been completed.

""I have said that (a coalition deal) must be agreed at the very latest by Easter,"" said Seehofer.

The disappearance of the aircraft en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people aboard ranks among the world's greatest aviation mysteries. Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200-million ($156.62 million) search in January last year.
But in October, Malaysia said it was in talks with Ocean Infinity to resume the search on a ""no-cure, no-fee"" basis, meaning it will only get paid if it finds the plane.
""Ocean Infinity is hopeful of receiving the final contract award for the resumption of the search for MH370 over the coming days,"" a company spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement.
""With a relatively narrow weather window, we are moving the vessel, Seabed Constructor, towards the vicinity of the possible search zone. This is designed to save time should the contract award be forthcoming, as hoped,"" he said.
Reuters shipping data showed the Seabed Constructor left Durban, South Africa, on Tuesday and was headed to Perth, Australia, where it is due on Feb. 7.
Malaysia's deputy transport minister, Aziz Kaprawi, said the government was negotiating final terms of the agreement with Ocean Infinity and he was not aware of the vessel's movement.
""We are in the final stages of the decision. On our part, we have yet to finalize the agreement,"" he told Reuters.
When asked whether Australia and China would be consulted about the contract award, Aziz said: ""Basically, Malaysia will make the decision, as this offer was made to the Malaysian government. The cost will also be decided by Malaysia.""
Investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the transponder of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 before diverting it over the Indian Ocean.
Various pieces of debris have been collected from Indian Ocean islands and Africa’s east coast and at least three of them have been confirmed as coming from the missing plane.

The military's Africa Command said the strike took place around 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the capital Mogadishu on Tuesday, and that a ""vehicle-borne improvised explosive device"" had also been destroyed in the early morning attack.
Last month Washington warned of a threat to its diplomatic staff in Mogadishu and directed all non-essential staff to leave the city.
Al Shabaab was pushed out of Mogadishu in 2011 and has lost control of most of Somalia's major towns. But the group retains a strong presence in the south and center and can still carry out major attacks. It was blamed for twin bomb blasts in Mogadishu in October that killed more than 500 people.
The militants aim to topple Somalia's government, to drive out African Union peacekeeping troops and to impose the group's own strict interpretation of Islamic law.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has banned a film festival from screening a documentary later this week that features a teenage Palestinian female activist whose arrest last month has made her a symbol of resistance to Israeli military occupation in the West Bank.
Justifying the ban, authorities in the Southeast Asian city state said the film ""Radiance of Resistance"" was ""skewed"" and potentially divisive for Singapore's multi-ethnic population.
The documentary, which looks at the Palestine-Israeli conflict through the eyes of 16-year-old Ahed Tamimi and another young female activist, lacked ""counterbalance"", the Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) said on its website.
""The skewed narrative of the film is inflammatory and has the potential to cause disharmony amongst the different races and religions in Singapore,"" the IMDA said.
The documentary was due to have been shown at the Singapore Palestinian Film Festival on Thursday.
It was screened at a number of festivals worldwide in 2017 and won Best Documentary at the Respect Human Rights Film Festival in Belfast, but has become even more topical following Tamimi's arrest last month.
Tamimi was charged on Monday with counts of aggravated assault and will be tried in an Israeli military court. An adult found guilty of assaulting a soldier could be jailed for up to 10 years, but Tamimi is a minor so such an outcome is unlikely.
While Singapore's authorities are known to keep a tight rein on public speech and the media, especially when it comes to matters related to race and religion, outright bans are more rare.
Adela Foo, the organizer of the Singapore festival, called the ban ""understandable"", without elaborating.
""At the end of the day, the IMDA's position is one to be respected,"" the 23-year-old student told Reuters.
With a sizable Muslim minority and surrounded by Muslim majority neighbors where sympathy for the Palestinian cause runs high, Singapore maintains friendly diplomatic and military ties with Israel. But it has lined up with many other countries opposed to U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

Around 15 percent of Singapore's 3.3 million resident population aged 15 years and over identify as Muslim, recent government surveys show.

Kalaba is seen as a potential PF candidate in a 2021 presidential election but analysts say his chances of winning the PF nomination may stall if Lungu wins a court battle allowing him to run for a third term.
""We cannot proceed to manage national affairs with cold indifference when the levels of corruption are swelling and being perpetrated by those who are expected to be the solution,"" Kalaba said in a Facebook post late on Tuesday.
Presidential spokesman Amos Chanda told Reuters State House had not received Kalaba's resignation letter.

All forms of surrogacy, where a woman gives birth to a child on behalf of someone else, are banned in France, as in several other European countries such as Germany. Some countries like the United Kingdom allow for altruistic surrogacies, not commercial ones. 
The French government will launch a debate on a new bioethics legislative pact this year, which could see medically assisted reproduction extended to female gay couples and single women, a stance favored by President Emmanuel Macron.
He opposes introducing surrogate motherhood, however.
Until recently public opinion was also against surrogacy, but the poll by Ifop, published in La Croix, a Catholic newspaper, found that 62 percent of French people were now in favor of it. 
Of those, 46 percent would only back surrogate motherhood if there were medical reasons to do so, while 18 percent said they supported it in all circumstances. 
In a similar poll last September, 52 percent of French people rejected surrogacy under any form, versus 36 percent now. 
France's previous Socialist government legalized same-sex marriage in 2013, drawing a strong unexpectedly show of opposition in the run-up to the law from conservatives, especially Roman Catholics, and large street protests. 
France's highest court has since made it easier for children born through surrogacy abroad to a same-sex couple to be recognized as citizens and adopted by the partner of the child's biological father.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea reopened a long-closed border hotline with South Korea on Wednesday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to mock the North's leader by saying he has a ""bigger and more powerful"" nuclear button than he does.
The North's decision to open the border phone line came a day after South Korea proposed high-level discussions amid a tense standoff over North Korea's missile and nuclear programs.
That followed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's New Year address in which he said he was open to speaking with the South and would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics to be held just across the border in Pyeongchang in February.
U.S. officials said Washington would not take any talks between North and South Korea seriously if they did not contribute to denuclearizing North Korea. A State Department spokeswoman said North Korea ""might be trying to drive a wedge of some sort"".
Kim ordered the reopening of the hotline at the truce village of Panmunjom at 0630 GMT on Wednesday, when South Korean officials at the border received a call from the North, the South's unification ministry said in a text message.
Officials on both sides were checking the line and conducting a conversation for about 20 minutes, the contents of which were not disclosed by the ministry.
That gesture came only hours after Trump, who has mocked Kim as ""Little Rocket Man"", again ridiculed the North Korean leader on Twitter.
""Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!"" Trump tweeted.
Trump and Kim have exchanged a series of bellicose comments in recent months, raising alarm across the world, with Trump at times dismissing the prospect of a diplomatic solution to a crisis in which North Korea has threatened to destroy the United States.
While appearing to open the door to discussing taking part in the Winter Olympics, Kim also warned that he would push ahead with ""mass producing"" nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions.
His New Year's Day speech came after a steep increase in missile launches in 2017, as well as the North's sixth and most powerful nuclear test. Kim, who has vowed to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, said he had a nuclear button on his desk.
'SERIOUS AND SINCERE'
The hotline with the South was shut down by North Korea in February 2016 in retaliation against the closing of a border factory town that was jointly operated by the two Koreas.
""We will try to keep close communications with the south Korean side from sincere stand(sic) and honest attitude, true to the intention of our supreme leadership, and deal with the practical matters related to the dispatch of our delegation,"" the North's KCNA news agency quoted Ri Son Gwon, chairman of North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, as saying.
The talks would aim to establish formal dialogue about sending a North Korean delegation to the Olympics, Ri said.
South Korean presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan said the North's decision to open the hotline had ""significant meaning"" because it could lead to constant communication.
U.S. officials had voiced scepticism about the possibility of meaningful talks, particularly if they did not take steps towards banning North Korea's nuclear weapons.
Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, warned North Korea against staging another missile test and said Washington was hearing reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said both sides should seize the Olympics as an opportunity to improve ties and make concrete efforts toward alleviating tension. 
""All relevant sides should grab hold of this positive trend in the Korean peninsula and move in the same direction,"" Geng told a daily news briefing in Beijing. 

North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, the United States and Japan, and says its weapons are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.

The call for a general strike across the western state of Maharashtra led to largely peaceful protests, but life in many parts of Mumbai was disrupted with Dalits pelting buses with stones and deflating tires in some areas. Railway lines and some major roads leading into the city were blocked.
The Dalits, who rank at the bottom in India's ancient caste hierarchy, called the strike in protest against attacks from right-wing groups in the city of Pune on Monday. The strike shut businesses and schools in Mumbai and other cities across the state.
""The government didn't arrest the perpetrators of violence in Pune. Hindu group members were beating Dalits and the police were just watching from afar,"" said protester Sandeep Kamble. ""We are demanding the arrest of the culprits.""
The protest came a day after thousands of Dalits hurled stones and caused traffic disruption across Mumbai. Dalits have been ostracized by upper-caste Hindus for centuries for jobs they deemed as impure, such as garbage pickers and tannery workers.
Those protests followed celebrations by Dalits in Pune, 150 km (95 miles) from Mumbai, on the 200th anniversary of a battle they won, fighting alongside British colonial forces, against an upper-caste ruler. Those celebrations were disrupted by right wing Hindu groups and a 28-year-old man was killed in the clashes, according to the state government.
In parts of the Mumbai suburb of Thane, officials banned the assembly of crowds, small or large, to control protesters, who disrupted road and rail services during the morning rush hour. 
Schools were closed in some cities and internet service was down in places to restrict social media access and the spread of rumors.

Fleet taxis, along with cab hailing services like Uber and Ola, were also largely off the roads in Mumbai on Wednesday. Several offices asked employees to work from home.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran's supreme leader accused the country's enemies on Tuesday of being behind days of street unrest, as the death toll from anti-government demonstrations rose to 21.
Riot police were out in force in several cities on the sixth day of protests, which spread to the northwestern city of Tabriz, according to social media posts, as security forces scrambled to contain the boldest challenge to Iran's leadership since 2009.
More than 450 protesters have been arrested in the capital in the last three days, Tehran's deputy provincial governor said, and hundreds of others were detained around the country. A judicial official said some could face the death penalty.
In the southwestern city of Ahvaz, police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators.
""Police shot tear gas and later went around asking shops on two main streets to close, to completely clear the area,"" a resident told Reuters by telephone.
Nine people were killed in Isfahan province during protests on Monday night, including two members of the security forces, state TV said. Six protesters were killed during an attack on a police station in the town of Qahderijan in that province. The local governor said the protesters were armed. 
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Iran's foes of fomenting the unrest, which began as protests about economic hardship and corruption but have grown into political rallies, some of which have criticized him by name.
""In recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the Islamic Republic,"" he said, in his first reaction to the unrest. 
He did not name the enemies but Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia were behind the riots. 
""Saudis will receive Iran’s unexpected response and they know how serious it can be,"" Shamkhani was quoted by Tasnim news as saying in an interview with Beirut-based Al Mayadeen TV. 
Khamenei said on his website that he would address the nation about the events ""when the time is right"".
The United States rejected the suggestion that the protests were the work of foreign powers.
""We all know that's complete nonsense,"" said Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. 
""The demonstrations are completely spontaneous. They are virtually in every city in Iran. This is the precise picture of a long oppressed people rising up against their dictators."" 
""INFILTRATORS""
Washington will seek emergency sessions at the United Nations to express support for the protesters, Haley said, adding that the international community had failed to support reformist protests in 2009 that were crushed by Tehran.
""We must not make that mistake again,"" she said.
The U.S. State Department urged Tehran to restore access to any social media sites that had been restricted and urged Iranian security forces to exercise restraint.
A U.S. official told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that U.S. intelligence officials think the protests have little chance of toppling the government.
Responding to President Donald Trump's daily tweets praising the protesters, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iranians enjoyed the right to peaceful protest that was denied to citizens of U.S. allies in the Middle East.
""These hard-earned rights will be protected, and infiltrators will not be allowed to sabotage them through violence and destruction,"" Zarif tweeted.
French President Emmanuel Macron's office said a planned trip by Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to Tehran this week had been postponed. Macron also told Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a telephone call that Tehran must respect Iranians' right to free speech and to protest.
Russia, which is allied with Iran in its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said ""unacceptable"" external interference was destabilizing the situation in Iran, the RIA news agency reported. 
Turkey, which, along with the United States and Saudi Arabia, supports Syrian rebel groups, called for restraint.
""We believe it is necessary to avoid violence and not succumb to provocations,"" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said, adding that it hoped foreign intervention would be avoided. 
""BREAD"" AND ""FREEDOM""
Earlier on Tuesday, Trump had tweeted: ""The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime ... The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!""
The head of Tehran's Revolutionary Court, Musa Ghazanfarabadi, said protesters would be tried soon and the ringleaders could be charged with ""moharebeh"" -- an Islamic term meaning warring against God -- which carries the death penalty. 
Deputy Interior Minister Hossein Zolfaghari said 90 percent of the detainees were under 25, showing the younger generation's frustration at economic hardships and lack of social freedoms.
Iran is an OPEC oil producer and regional power deeply involved in Syria and Iraq as part of a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia, foreign interventions resented by many Iranians who want their leaders to pour more resources into cutting youth unemployment, which reached 29 percent last year.
President Rouhani, seen as a pragmatist who is at odds with hardliners, deflected criticisms of his economic record.
""People on the streets do not ask for bread and water, but for more freedom,"" he said in televised comments on Monday, implying that the protesters were not targeting his government but the more rigid clerical establishment. 
Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said both protesters and the security forces should follow the law.
""Even those who are confronting the rioters should act within the framework of law,"" he told a news conference.

State television reported that protesters who set ablaze four mosques in villages in Savadkuh County in northern Iran on Monday had been arrested.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in tweets on Tuesday that the United States may withhold future aid payments to Palestinians, accusing them of being ""no longer willing to talk peace"" with Israel.
Trump said that Washington gives Palestinians ""HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don't even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?""
The President's tweets follow plans disclosed by his U.N. ambassador earlier on Tuesday to stop funding a United Nations agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees.
""The President has basically said he doesn't want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table,"" Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters when asked about future U.S. funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees.
The U.S. is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA's website.
Relations between the Palestinians and Washington soured early last month after Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, generating outrage across the Arab world and concern among Washington's Western allies.
Weeks later, more than 120 countries defied Trump and voted in favor of a U.N. General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its stance on Jerusalem's status.
""What we saw with the resolution was not helpful to the situation,"" Haley said on Tuesday.
""The Palestinians now have to show to the world that they want to come to the table. As of now, they're not coming to the table but they asked for aid. We're not giving the aid, we're going to make sure that they come to the table and we want to move forward with the peace process,"" she said.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called the Trump administration's decision on Jerusalem the ""greatest crime"" and a flagrant violation of international law, and said it was unacceptable for the United States to have a role in the Middle East peace process because it was biased in favor of Israel.

On Tuesday, the Israeli Parliament passed an amendment that would make it harder for it to cede control over parts of Jerusalem in any peace deal with the Palestinians.

""The Bridgewater family lost Bruce Steinberg (a senior investor at Bridgewater and a wonderful man) and his family in a plane crash in Costa Rica,"" Dalio posted on Twitter.
Bridgewater Associates, based in Westport, Connecticut, manages $160 billion for about 350 institutional clients such as public and private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and central banks, according to its website.
In Costa Rica, civil aviation authorities were investigating the plane crash that occurred shortly after takeoff from the airport at the popular beach town of Punta Islita. The Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft was bound for the capital, San Jose.
The other victims were Steinberg's wife, Irene, and their three sons - Zachary, William and Matthew - as well as five other U.S. citizens and two Costa Rican crew members.
Michael Soto, a Costa Rican police spokesman, said on Tuesday that various possible causes for the crash such as weather, mechanical failure or human failure were still being investigated.
Soto said forensic pathologists and dentists had begun autopsies on the 12 badly burned bodies and that it could take two months or more to finish DNA identification tests.

The work was difficult because of the temperatures to which the bodies were subjected, he added.

AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army backed by Russian jets escalated bombing of the last rebel bastion on the eastern outskirts of Damascus as they prepared to break a siege of an army base encircled by opposition forces, residents and witnesses said on Wednesday.
They said the army was amassing elite forces to prepare for a major assault on the Military Vehicles Administration, which is besieged by rebels. At least 200 troops were believed to be trapped within its sprawling, heavily defended grounds. 
Since Sunday, rebels mainly belonging to the Islamist Ahrar al Sham faction widened their control of parts of the army base in Harasta that penetrates the Eastern Ghouta, the last rebel bastion around the capital.
They stormed the base last November in a drive to relieve pressure on Eastern Ghouta's towns and villages, which have seen escalating aerial attacks in the last week.
State media did not report the assault but said ""terrorists"" had fired mortars on residential areas in Harasta and the army responded by strikes in Eastern Ghouta that led to losses in the ranks of the insurgents. No further details were given.
Civil defense sources said that in four days of heavy aerial strikes since Friday 38 civilians have been killed and at least 147 people have been injured. Five civilians were killed on Tuesday. 
The base has long been used to strike at the densely populated Eastern Ghouta in an attempt to force the rebel enclave to submission. More than 300,000 people there have lived under siege by army troops since 2013. 
The advances bring rebels closer to the heart of the capital once again, after they were pushed out of their remaining pockets last year by months of siege and bombardment.
The army setback comes against a backdrop of successive battlefield victories that allowed the Syrian army with heavy reliance on Russia and Iran to regain in the last year large tracts of territory from insurgents.
Residents said at least 30 aerial strikes hit residential areas of Eastern Ghouta on Tuesday. Shelling of a market in the city of Douma, the main urban center in the Ghouta, left one dead and scores injured. 
""The frontlines of Ghouta are witnessing battles and clashes and big losses inflicted on (Syrian President) Assad's forces and his militias,"" said Hamza Biriqdar, the spokesman for Jaish al Islam, a main rebel faction.
Further northwest, rebels ranging from jihadists to mainstream Free Syrian Army (FSA) were retreating from more villages seized by the army in southern Idlib province and the adjoining eastern Hama countryside.
The strikes have escalated in the last week on this major front with at least 50 villages retaken by the Syrian army and its allies in their push into the last major province in rebel hands that borders Turkey. 

The intensity of strikes by Russia and the Syrian Air Force has driven tens of thousands of villagers in these areas to flee to the relative safety of the northern part of Idlib province near of the Turkish border, where many families have spread makeshift tents on main roads and agricultural land.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 02:33AM ET</span>",Poland's far-right: opportunity and threat for ruling PiS,"By Lidia Kelly and Justyna Pawlak
WARSAW (Reuters) - When activists from eastern Poland traveled to Warsaw to join a far-right march, the local mayor from the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) paid for some of their travel.
The march caught the attention of the world's media because some of the 60,000 participants carried banners bearing racist and xenophobic slogans such as ""pure blood, clear mind"" and ""Europe will be white or uninhabited"".
Stalowa Wola's PiS mayor, Lucjusz Nadberezny, does ""not regret the decision to support the trip"". His office said in a statement the November Independence Day march was a ""safe and joyous manifestation of patriotism"" and that people from his town did not participate in any ""provocations"". 
A resurgence of far-right sentiment poses a dilemma for the PiS - a socially conservative group with a nationalist agenda.
Far-right voters are a threat and an opportunity. The party tapped into frustration with western liberal values, when it won the 2015 election with the biggest majority by any party since the end of communism.
In other European states where anti-establishment right-wing slogans are also increasingly resonant, several far-right groups have got a foothold in power. 
But in Poland they have had little success, or desire, to compete for office. This is in large part because the PiS has tailored its message across the spectrum of right-wing voters. 
The activists from Stalowa Wola said they were going to Warsaw to express their opposition to ""an invasion of immigrants and atheism in Europe"".
While several PiS officials said any racist slogans were few and unrepresentative, they also praised the march. 
Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said afterwards it fueled ""patriotic behavior of Poles"" and any displays of xenophobia were ""incidents"" that were ""of course, reprehensible.""
His comments were a typical PiS mix of patriotism with a general condemnation of racism and anti-Semitism.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the powerful leader of the PiS who has no formal position in government, said in 2015 that Middle East migrants could bring parasites and diseases to Poland.
But he also said that the racist banners at the march were ""disgraceful rubbish"" and that the ""Polish tradition"" has nothing to do with racism or anti-Semitism.
RISK OF BREAKAWAY GROUP
The PiS is mindful of the need to retain the support of all right-wing voters, including far-right, for elections in each of the next three years.
It is also wary of the risk of a breakaway, ultraconservative group emerging to challenge its majority in parliament. 
Tadeusz Cymanski, deputy head of the PiS parliamentary caucus said it is better if far-right organizations such as ONR, which helped organize the Warsaw march, do not feel threatened by the PiS.
""It is in the interest of democracy, in the interest of our state that extreme groups, either left or right-wing, have no representation in parliament,"" he told Reuters.
""Any association (of ONR with PiS) is painful and unpleasant, I reject it with shame, but I think it would be better even if I, or my faction, were associated with them rather than these forces were to gain in force.""
He said the PiS is mindful that its 2015 election victory was fueled in part by the fact that several smaller groups did not cross the election threshold, earning PiS extra seats in parliament.
Another outspoken PiS member, Ryszard Czarnecki, said the party gave all right-leaning voters a sense of belonging, in contrast to the previous centrist government which was seen as ""cosmopolitan"".
""Right-wing voters have the feeling ... that we are a serious group, which has power, fulfils the right-wing agenda, so there is no need to escape towards the far right,"" he said.
""A number of young people now prefer to vote for PiS. If (centrist) rule continued, then I think radical movements would have been stronger in Poland.""
The party's more centrist electorate has stuck with it despite the move to embrace the right, partly because of generous social policies. But any stronger association with the far-right could turn those voters away, analysts say. 
XENOPHOBIA RISING
ONR and other far-right Polish groups such as Mlodziez Wszechpolska refuse to release membership figures but analysts say acceptance of xenophobic slogans as well as violence against Muslims is on the rise.
In a November 2016 survey by CBOS, a pollster overseen by the government, 95 percent of Poles said they did not know anyone from a far-right group. However, more than one in three said they supported far-right activities.
Hate crimes committed against Muslims have grown by more than 300 percent between 2013 and 2016, according to data from the Warsaw University's Center for Research on Prejudice. 
ONR, which calls for ""ethnic homogeneity"" in Poland in its official literature, says it has helped the PiS.
""PiS has copied some of our rhetoric, for example referring to migrants from Muslim states,"" said ONR deputy chief Tomasz Dorosz. ""This has assured their victory in the last election.""
Poland, like Hungary, has refused to take in any of its European Union quota of refugees from Syria and elsewhere on the grounds that Muslim immigrants are a threat to national security and stability.
New PiS Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the state-run television TVP on Monday that the government's stance on migrants is not going to change ""in years to come"".
""We will not accept refugees, migrants from the Middle East and Africa. This is our sovereign decision,"" Morawiecki said.
In 2016 the PiS government disbanded the Council for the Prevention of Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Intolerancee, an advisory body to the government, and a unit at the interior ministry responsible, among others, for monitoring hate crimes.
""While the PiS governs increasingly as a far-right party, it didn't campaign as such and it wasn't elected as such,"" said Cas Mudde, an expert on the far-right at the University of Georgia. 
But with local elections expected in late 2018, a parliamentary vote in 2019 and presidential elections in 2020, this tactic is expected to continue. Polls expect the PiS to do better in the local elections than four years ago.
""Kaczynski is probably disgusted (by the far right),"" said Konstanty Gebert, a liberal analyst with the European Council for Foreign Relations think tank. 

""But it won't cloud his perspective on election interests.""

432,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 01:14AM ET</span>","U.S. warns North Korea against new missile test, plays down talks","By Rodrigo Campos and Christine Kim
UNITED NATIONS/SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, warned North Korea on Tuesday against staging another missile test and said Washington would not take any talks between North and South Korea seriously if they did not do something to get Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.
Haley told reporters the United States was hearing reports that North Korea might be preparing to fire another missile.
""I hope that doesn't happen. But if it does, we must bring even tougher measures to bear against the North Korean regime,"" Haley said.
South Korea on Tuesday offered talks with North Korea next week, amid a tense standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year's Day speech that he was ""open to dialogue"" with Seoul.
Kim also said he was open to the possibility of North Korean athletes taking part in Winter Olympics South Korea hosts next month. 
At the same time, he stressed that his country would push ahead with ""mass producing"" nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions and that he had a nuclear button on his desk capable of launching missiles at the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump responded to Kim in a Twitter post on Tuesday: ""Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!""
Haley said the United States would not take talks seriously if they did not take steps toward banning North Korea's nuclear weapons.
""North Korea can talk to anyone they want, but the U.S. is not going to recognize it or acknowledge it until they agree to ban the nuclear weapons that they have,"" she said.
Haley gave no details of the missile test preparations.
Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were indications that could point toward a potential missile launch “sooner rather than later,” but cautioned that such signs had been seen in the past and no test had resulted.
'DRIVE A WEDGE'
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said North Korea might be ""trying to drive a wedge of some sort"" between the United States and South Korea and added that while it was up to Seoul to decide who it talked to: ""We are very skeptical of Kim Jong Un's sincerity in sitting down and having talks.""
Trump, who has led a global drive to pressure North Korea through sanctions to give up development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States, earlier held back judgment on Pyongyang's offer to talk, saying on Twitter:
""Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. ""Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!""
Trump has frequently derided Kim as ""rocket man."" The U.S. president said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea. 
Kim and Trump have exchanged fiery barbs in the last year and the U.S. president has warned that the United States would have no choice but to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies.
North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States, South Korea and Japan and tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead anywhere in the United States.
South Korea's Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon said the offer for high-level talks next Tuesday had been discussed with the United States. Nauert said she was not aware if the matter had been discussed in advance of the South Korean response. 
Cho suggested the talks be held at the border village of Panmunjom and said they should be focused on North Korea's participation at the Olympics, but other issues would likely arise, including the denuclearisation of North Korea.
""I repeat: The government is open to talking with North Korea, regardless of time, location and form,"" Cho said.
Should the talks be held, it would be the first such dialogue since a vice-ministerial meeting in December 2015. 
South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed Kim's New Year address and asked his government to move as quickly as possible to bring North Korea to the Olympics, but he stressed that an improvement in inter-Korean relations ""cannot go separately with resolving North Korea's nuclear program"".
China, which has persistently urged a return to talks to ease tensions, said recent positive comments from North and South Korea were a good thing.

""China welcomes and supports North Korea and South Korea taking earnest efforts to treat this as an opportunity to improve mutual relations, promote the alleviation of the situation on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearisation on the peninsula,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 01:04AM ET</span>",Former senior Hong Kong police officer jailed for baton assault during democracy protest,"By Chermaine Lee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A former senior Hong Kong police officer was sentenced to three months jail on Wednesday for assaulting a passerby with his baton during the city's massive pro-democracy protests of late 2014.
The ""Umbrella Movement"" demonstrations which occupied major roads and demanded, in vain, full democracy for the former British colony, was one of the most direct populist challenges to Beijing's Communist Party leaders since the city came under Chinese rule in 1997.
During the civil disobedience movement that ran for 79 straight days, protesters, sometimes numbering in their thousands, faced off repeatedly with the police who used batons, tear gas and pepper spray -- drawing some criticism for the excessive use of force.
Retired superintendent Frankly Chu, 58, showed no obvious emotion when principal magistrate Bina Chainrai sentenced him to four months jail for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
This was mitigated to three months given his retirement and the unlikelihood of him reoffending. 
Chainrai said the sentence was necessary so that public confidence in the police force could be maintained and that the police had a ""duty to uphold standards"". 
Chu was filmed hitting a man on the neck with a baton during a protest in the Mong Kok district in 2014, targeting what some deemed to be a high-risk part of the body. 
Chu, however, said during the trial that his use of force had been appropriate and that he was carrying out orders from his superiors to move protesters away from that area. 
Chu's lawyer, Peter Pannu, said his client would appeal.
A Hong Kong court last February also sentenced seven policemen to two years behind bars for beating a handcuffed activist during the 2014 protests. The seven have been released on bail pending appeal.
The assaults by the seven policemen, and Chu, were captured on video and widely broadcast, triggering public outrage and tarnishing the reputation of the Hong Kong police force that has sometimes been dubbed ""Asia's finest"". 
Police support groups, however, say the officers were only maintaining public order. After the sentencing, around 30 supporters of Chu yelled: ""Hong Kong's judiciary is unfair. Hong Kong police were insulted"".
A University of Hong Kong poll that surveyed over a thousand people shows public satisfaction with the police force's performance after the Occupy protests were cleared in December 2014 plummeted to the lowest point since the handover right.

The half yearly figure has since risen from 21 percent in the first six months of 2015 to 37 percent in the last six months.

Investigators looking into the Dec. 23 blaze in Davao City, which broke out at a furniture and fabric store on a lower floor before engulfing the call center's offices, said there were indications of fire safety lapses that may have contributed to the tragedy.
Charito Plaza, director-general of the government's Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), said the agency has suspended the registration of the New City Commercial Center (NCCC) and American firm Research Now SSI in Davao for failing to meet certain safety requirements since 2013.
""Violations were more of the non-compliance of annual emergency drills to test the fire safety equipment, response and rescue capability, sprinklers and emergency exits,"" Plaza told Reuters in a text message.

437,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 07:56PM ET</span>",U.S. judge orders government to release Iraqis or grant bond hearings,"By Yeganeh Torbati
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ordered the government on Tuesday to either release Iraqi immigrants it arrested last year or grant them bond hearings, in the latest judicial curb on the Trump administration's efforts to tighten U.S. immigration.
Last year the federal government detained hundreds of Iraqi immigrants who had been ordered deported years ago due to criminal convictions. Iraq until recently had refused to take them back, but struck a deal with the United States in March to repatriate its citizens, sparking the immigration sweeps.
The Iraqis and civil rights groups representing them sued the federal government. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith, in Detroit, had previously halted the deportation of the Iraqis, many of whom are Christian, who argued they would face persecution if they were sent back to Iraq. 
In his ruling on Tuesday, Goldsmith said that any of the Iraqis held for six months or longer must either be released or granted a bond hearing before an immigration judge within 30 days. 
""Our legal tradition rejects warehousing human beings while their legal rights are being determined,"" wrote Goldsmith.
The Trump administration has tried to deport the Iraqis as part of its push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States.
Since June, immigration enforcement officers have detained approximately 300 Iraqi nationals with final deportation orders, according to information provided to the court by the Iraqis' lawyers. There are approximately 1,400 Iraqis in the United States with final deportation orders.
The U.S. government said in March that Iraq had agreed to repatriate Iraqi nationals ordered deported from the United States.
But Goldsmith noted in his order that the United States has ""no written agreement"" with Iraq regarding its cooperation, and that it is therefore unclear whether Iraq had agreed to take back all its nationals, and if so, under what conditions.
Goldsmith said his ruling would apply to Iraqi detainees in similar circumstances nationwide, even if they are not involved in the litigation.
""(Goldsmith) just really reaffirmed the principle that indefinite detention in this country is not acceptable,"" said Kary Moss, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, which is representing the Iraqis.

The Department of Justice, which is arguing on behalf of the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Priests from Cuba’s Afro-Cuban Santeria religion forecast on Tuesday that the upcoming retirement of President Raul Castro would signify ""a moment of change"" that accelerates the pace of reform on the Communist-run island.
The ritual-filled religion, which fuses Catholicism with ancient African beliefs brought to Cuba by slaves, is practiced by millions of Cubans, many of whom eagerly await guidance from its annual forecast.
Víctor Betancourt, a babalawo or Santeria priest, and member of the commission that writes the “Letter of the Year” containing prophesies and recommendations for followers, was upbeat at a news conference following the release of the letter.
“I am sure this is a moment of change, a moment that can favor us, first of all because it is under the divinity of Yemaya, the Orisha (goddess) of feeding,” he said, “and really that is what we need.”
In a broader sense, Yemaya is goddess of the seas and of water, and is considered one of the most powerful and positive deities.
Castro, 86, said last month he would step down as president in April. He took over in 2008 after his brother Fidel Castro, who had governed Cuba since leading the 1959 revolution, became seriously ill. Fidel Castro died in 2016.
""We hope that the new leader will bring new reforms,” Betancourt said. “We are betting on reforms of the laws, in the food and health system, in social education that is contaminating the minds of the youth.”
First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel, 57, is widely seen as Castro’s successor. 
""It is a moment of change ... to make changes. A time to change schemes that really do us harm,” Betancourt said.
Cuba has been immersed for a decade in efforts to transform its Soviet-style economy in hopes of improving the country's sluggish performance.
But bureaucratic resistance has slowed progress toward a more market-oriented system and the crisis in ally Venezuela has left Cuba hard-pressed to pay for imports and recapitalize infrastructure.

The Letter of the Year prophesied “health in the complete sense of the term,” and urged followers to “maintain a good social and moral conduct.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday refused to order a mistrial in the case of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey's majority state-owned Halkbank who is charged with helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions.
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan federal court rejected arguments by Atilla's lawyers that the trial was tainted when prosecutors asked Atilla, during a Dec. 19 cross-examination, whether he remembered that a report by a Turkish expert had concluded he violated sanctions.
Atilla's lawyers objected before Atilla could answer, saying the question involved hearsay and ""grossly mischaracterized"" the Turkish expert's conclusion. Berman told the jury to disregard it.
Atilla's lawyers moved for a mistrial on Dec. 20.
Berman said on Tuesday that his instruction to the jury was enough to prevent any unfairness to Atilla, adding that a mistrial was an ""extreme"" outcome that should be avoided whenever possible. Berman had already denied another motion by Atilla for a mistrial earlier in the case.
A lawyer for Atilla could not immediately be reached for comment.
Jurors are expected to come to court on Wednesday for their fourth day of deliberations in the case, which has strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey.
At the center of the three-week trial was testimony from Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who pleaded guilty to charges of violating sanctions and testified for U.S. prosecutors.
Zarrab testified that Atilla helped design fraudulent gold and food transactions that allowed Iran to spend its oil and gas revenues abroad, including through U.S. financial institutions, defying U.S. sanctions.
Zarrab also implicated Turkish officials in the scheme, including President Tayyip Erdogan.
Attempts to reach Erdogan's spokesman for comment on the allegations at the trial have been unsuccessful. Erdogan has publicly dismissed the case as a politically motivated attack on his government.
Atilla has denied all of the charges against him.
Halkbank has denied taking part in any illegal transactions.
The first request for a mistrial came after jurors heard testimony from Huseyin Korkmaz, a former Turkish police officer who said he led an investigation that included Atilla and fled Turkey in fear of retaliation. Atilla's lawyers said the testimony unfairly associated their client with political violence.
U.S. prosecutors charged nine people in the criminal case, though only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, were arrested by U.S. authorities.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Canadian man freed in 2017 nearly five years after being abducted in Afghanistan has been arrested in Ottawa and faces several charges, including assault and forcible confinement, his lawyer said on Tuesday.
Joshua Boyle, his wife Caitlin Coleman and three children arrived back in Canada last October. At the time he said one of his children had been murdered and spouse was raped after their capture by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network.
Police have laid 15 charges against Boyle, 34, including eight counts of assault, two counts of sexual assault, two counts of forcible confinement and one count of uttering death threats.
A publication ban has been imposed, preventing the alleged victims from being identified.
""Mr. Boyle is presumed innocent. He's never been in trouble before ... We look forward to receiving the evidence and defending him against these charges,"" Boyle's lawyer, Eric Granger, said in an email.
Ottawa police laid the charges on Dec. 30, since when Boyle has been in jail. He is due to make a brief court appearance on Wednesday.
Ottawa police declined to comment and referred questions to the attorney general of Ontario, which was not immediately able to comment.
Boyle, his wife and their three children met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his Parliament Hill office last month. Photos that Boyle released at the time on Twitter showed Trudeau holding the youngest child in his lap.
Trudeau had said in September he could not imagine what the family were going through. The Taliban denied the accusations of rape and murder.

Boyle and Coleman were kidnapped in 2012 while backpacking in Afghanistan and their children were born in captivity. U.S. officials say the family spent almost all their confinement in neighboring Pakistan, which is where they were freed by Pakistani troops.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>","Iran protests could hurt clerics but Rouhani has most to lose, say insiders","DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian authorities are concerned that nationwide unrest will undermine the clerical establishment and want to stamp out the protests quickly, senior government officials say. But the person with the most to lose is President Hassan Rouhani.
While several senior officials said there was concern that prolonged unrest would damage the legitimacy and influence of the country's religious leaders, few insiders see the unrest as an existential threat to that leadership, which has ruled since the 1979 revolution and is now controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the ultimate authority in Iran’s system of dual clerical and republican rule.
The biggest loser, they say, is likely to be Rouhani, who is much more closely tied to the country’s economic policies.
""Of course Rouhani and his government will have less power afterwards, especially because his economic policy was criticized during the unrest,"" said political analyst Hamid Farahvashian.
""He will be a lame-duck president and Khamenei will have more power.""
Much of the protesters’ anger has focused on what Rouhani and his government have failed to deliver: an economic boom promised as the payoff for the 2015 deal that curbed Iran's disputed nuclear program in return for world powers lifting sanctions.
Protesters are angry that Iran's youth unemployment rate is edging towards 30 percent, want higher wages and an end to alleged graft. They have chanted slogans against all of Iran's leaders, including the clerical elite, and attacked police vehicles, banks and mosques as the unrest widened.
""The continuation of the protests will lead to a legitimacy crisis,"" said one senior official close to Rouhani, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
""People have economic demands ... of course these demands should be taken seriously ... of course the establishment should listen to the people, but all these can be discussed in a calm atmosphere,"" the official said.
Some conservatives have pushed for a hardline approach, even though bloodshed could fuel more protests in the largest wave of demonstrations since nationwide unrest in 2009.
""So far, security forces have not tried to prevent the demonstrations .... but this will change if (Khamenei) calls for an end to the street protests and demonstrators defy his call,"" said one former Iranian official from the reformist camp.
Even if the unrest is quelled, the demands of tens of thousands of restless working class youths who have taken to the streets are unlikely to dissipate.
Khamenei spoke publicly for the first time about the crisis on Tuesday, accusing Iran's enemies of stirring unrest but saying no more. A statement on his website said he would address the nation about the events ""when the time is right"".
THE LIMITS OF ROUHANI'S POWER
The protesters have little chance of toppling the clerical leaders, who appear to be retaining control of the military, police, and security forces and have no compunction about using them, according to one U.S. official following the developments.
Rouhani, who was elected in 2013, is more exposed. He is seen as a pragmatist at odds with Iran's hardliners and has said in response to the protests that Iranians have a right to criticize the authorities.
But he has a fight on his hands because of growing resentment over high prices and allegations of corruption.
""His power is limited in Iran's ruling system. Public discontent is increasing ... people are losing their faith in the establishment system,"" a third Iranian official said. ""The leaders are well aware of this fact and its dangerous consequences.""
U.S. officials fear the likeliest outcome of the protests is discrediting what one called Rouhani's ""moderate brand of moderation"" and a harsher crackdown by the clerical authorities.
""It's an open question whether Rouhani ever intended to keep any of his promises, but he hasn't delivered, especially on the economic front, and that means he has no popular support and is expendable to Khamenei,"" said a second U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.
""He's likely to be one of the casualties, though maybe not immediately.""
Rouhani has blamed his predecessor and the United States, Iran’s long-time adversary, for the economy's shortcomings.
But his government has also backtracked on planned fuel price rises and promised more jobs.
Rouhani may need to spend more money to create more employment if he is to ease discontent, and could risk antagonizing powerful interests if he tries to address allegations of corruption.
His vulnerability and the deep divisions in Iran's hierarchy have fueled suspicions among some of his sympathizers that conservative rivals may have played a hand in the crisis.
""It was a coup against Rouhani and his achievements ... The aim was to harm Rouhani,"" said Saeed Leylaz, a political analyst close to the pro-reform movement.
But a fourth official in Tehran said the nationwide protests had united Iran's leadership. 
""At this point it is not important whether a political faction initiated the unrest to harm the rival group,"" the official said.

""The unrest was hijacked by our enemies ... that is why all factions have united to protect the Islamic Republic.""

WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The United States accused Pakistan on Tuesday of playing a ""double game"" on fighting terrorism and warned Islamabad it would have to do more if it wanted to maintain U.S. aid.
""They can do more to stop terrorism and we want them to do that,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.
The White House said it would likely announce actions to pressure Pakistan within days, shortly after U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said at the United Nations that Washington would withhold $255 million in assistance to Pakistan.
""There are clear reasons for this. Pakistan has played a double game for years,"" Haley told reporters. ""They work with us at times, and they also harbor the terrorists that attack our troops in Afghanistan.
""That game is not acceptable to this administration. We expect far more cooperation from Pakistan in the fight against terrorism.""
The comments followed an angry tweet from President Donald Trump on Monday that the United States had been rewarded with ""nothing but lies and deceit"" for ""foolishly"" giving Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid in the last 15 years.
""They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!"" he tweeted.
Pakistan civilian and military chiefs on Tuesday rejected ""incomprehensible"" U.S. comments and summoned American Ambassador David Hale to explain Trump's tweet. 
Relations with Washington have been strained for years over Islamabad's alleged support for Haqqani network militants, who are allied with the Afghan Taliban.
The United States also alleges that senior Afghan Taliban commanders live on Pakistani soil, and has signaled it will cut aid and take other steps if Islamabad does not stop helping or turning a blind eye to Haqqani militants crossing the border to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.
In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Mansour was killed by a U.S. drone strike inside Pakistan and in 2011, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. troops in the garrison town of Abbottabad.
STATE DEPT: PAKISTAN NEEDS TO EARN ITS AID
At the State Department on Tuesday, spokesman Heather Nauert said Pakistan knows what it needs to do, including taking action against the Haqqani network and other militants.
Pakistan needs to ""earn, essentially, the money that we have provided in the past in foreign military assistance,"" she said. 
Islamabad bristles at the suggestion it is not doing enough to fight militants, noting that its casualties at the hands of Islamists since 2001 number in the tens of thousands.
Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday chaired a National Security Committee meeting of civilian and military chiefs, focusing on Trump's tweet. The meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, was brought forward by a day and followed an earlier meeting of army generals.
The committee, in a statement issued by the prime minister's office, did not name Trump but spoke of ""deep disappointment"" at a slew of critical comments coming from U.S. officials over the past few months.

""Recent statements and articulation by the American leadership were completely incomprehensible as they contradicted facts manifestly, struck with great insensitivity at the trust between two nations built over generations, and negated the decades of sacrifices made by the Pakistani nation,"" it said.

The thin, cylindrical, waist-height metal bollards are intended to be a more attractive alternative to the hulking concrete blocks the New York Police Department had deposited in busier areas around the city following the vehicle attacks, de Blasio said.
""We understand what's happening around the world and we even saw some tragedies here,"" the mayor said at a Times Square (NYSE:SQ) announcement in front of a line of the posts. Similar bollards were installed in Times Square in 2016.
There has been a spate of attacks on pedestrians in European and U.S. cities by people using cars or trucks, a tactic that the Islamic State militant group encourages its supporters to use. In July 2016, a driver used a truck to kill 86 people celebrating Bastille Day in Nice. Similar carnage unfolded at a Christmas market in Berlin a few months later.
De Blasio spoke within sight of the place where an intoxicated man in May steered a car along sidewalks for three city blocks, killing a young woman and injuring at least 22 people.
Last November, a man was charged with murder and providing support to Islamic State after he plowed down people on a Manhattan bike lane the previous month, killing eight.

""We know we have to do even more to keep people safe,"" de Blasio said on Tuesday. The city will spend an additional $50 million on installing the new bollards in busy, high-profile areas and other efforts to protect public spaces, the mayor said.

The Central American country, which has been engulfed in a political crisis since a disputed Nov. 26 presidential election, had a 2016 murder rate of 59.1 killings per 100,000 people.
""We've registered a dramatic fall in the murder rate in this country due to the coordinated attack between the national police and military forces on drug smugglers and gangs,"" police investigations chief Romel Martinez said at a press conference. 
Honduras' murder rate has been falling steadily in recent years, after hitting 85.5 murders per 100,000 people in 2011. Nonetheless, Honduras remains one of the world's deadliest peacetime nations. 
In recent weeks, the small coffee-exporting country has been convulsed by protests in which at least 31 people have died. The opposition says the election was stolen by President Juan Orlando Hernandez, a U.S. ally on tackling migration and drugs. 

Late last month, the United States backed the re-election of Hernandez despite widespread misgivings about the vote count, prompting the opposition candidate to describe his bid for the presidency as a ""lost cause.""

KINSHASA (Reuters) - The head of the Roman Catholic Church in Congo on Tuesday condemned a crackdown on protests against President Joseph Kabila as ""barbarism"", escalating a confrontation between the government and one of the country's most powerful institutions. 
Security forces in Democratic Republic of Congo killed at least seven people in the capital, Kinshasa, on Sunday during demonstrations that Catholic activists organized to protest Kabila's refusal to step down from office, according to the United Nations.
Police spokesman Pierrot Mwanamputu, however, said on Tuesday that five people, including one police officer, had died in Sunday's violence and that the police had acted justifiably in each case against militants and gangsters. 
In a rare appearance before the media, Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo, wearing a red prayer cap and gold cross, accused security forces of opening fire on peaceful protesters and desecrating places of worship.
""We can only denounce, condemn and stigmatize the actions of the supposedly valiant men in uniform, which are, unfortunately, nothing more, nothing less than barbarism,"" Monsengwo told reporters in the capital Kinshasa.
""How can we trust leaders incapable of protecting the population, of guaranteeing peace, justice and love of people?"" he said. 
The Catholic Church is one of the few institutions in Congo to enjoy broad credibility. Some 40 percent of the population identifies as Catholic and the Church has long filled voids in education, healthcare and other services left by an absent state.
Its bishops have frequently spoken out against human rights abuses by the government and alleged plans by Kabila to remove term limits that forbid him to run for re-election. 
However, it reverted to a more neutral posture as Kabila's mandate expired in December 2016 in order to broker a deal between the ruling coalition and opposition leaders.
Under the Dec. 31 agreement, Kabila was permitted to stay in office beyond the expiry of his mandate but required to step down after an election to be held in 2017. 
Instead, Congo's electoral commission said later that the election could not be organized until December 2018, reviving suspicions that Kabila intends to cling to power. Kabila denies those charges and blames the delays on a slow voter registration process. 

Dozens have died in protests over Kabila's future in the past two years and militia violence across the country has also risen, stoking fears the country will slide back into the kind of civil war that killed millions at the turn of the century.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A record-shattering arctic freeze kept its grip on the U.S. Northeast on Tuesday, closing schools and affecting travel on the first business day of 2018, and forecasters warned the region could be walloped by snow later in the week.
Boston tied a 100-year-old record on Tuesday when it marked seven consecutive days that the temperature did not top 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-6.7 degrees Celsius), and people whose work kept them outside struggled to find ways to keep warm.
""I'm here since '78 and I don't remember cold weather like this,"" Yiannis Galanopoulos, who sells $3 cheese pretzels from a cart in New York's Times Square (NYSE:SQ), said as he warmed his hands over the glowing charcoals that keep his wares hot. 
""But a living is a living,"" he said, adding that if the temperature dipped much lower, he might rethink the trip from his home in West New York, New Jersey. ""It's not worth it to take a chance.""
Officials throughout the region urged residents to alert social services if they saw people stuck outside in the cold.
""We want every resident to have shelter and warmth,"" Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said on Twitter. Bitter cold was blamed for at least four deaths across the United States over the New Year's holiday weekend.
Frigid weather had gripped much of the country for the past few days, breaking long-standing temperature records in cities from Omaha, Nebraska, to Aberdeen, South Dakota, but the weather was forecast to warm up in the coming days. 
However, the higher temperatures were expected to be accompanied by heavy snow in the East Coast by as early as Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service.
""New York City will probably expect anywhere from 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of snow,"" said weather service meteorologist Greg Gallina. ""The maximum swath will be from southern Rhode Island to the south of Boston and into Maine. Southeast Maine will experience anywhere from 12 to 15 inches (30-38 cm) of snow.""
Gallina added that cities in northern Florida will experience freezing rain and maybe some sleet. Coastal areas in Georgia and South Carolina will start to experience smaller amounts of snow, from as early as late Tuesday. 
In Iowa, Massachusetts, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina, school districts canceled or delayed the start of classes as bitterly cold weather, 20 degrees to 30 degrees F (11 to 17 degrees C) below normal, were expected across the eastern half of the United States. 
The cold was blamed for the deaths of two men in separate incidents in Milwaukee, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. A homeless man was found dead on a porch in Charleston, West Virginia, while another man was found dead outside a church in Detroit, and police said he may have frozen to death, local news outlets reported. 
The cold should ease across most of the country heading into the weekend, Gallina said. 

""We're going to see a steady of warm-ups at the end of the weekend when temperatures become average again across the Great Plains and into the Midwest by Sunday,"" he said. ""Another cold blast will come in on Monday, but it won't be as brutal. This warm spell will basically be a short respite from the severely cold weather.""

450,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",German conservatives call for age tests for minors seeking asylum,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The Bavarian allies of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party on Tuesday said minors seeking asylum should undergo medical age tests, a measure the German Medical Association said could be a violation of ethics.
A debate about verifying the ages of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum has intensified since last week, after the fatal stabbing of a 15-year-old German girl by a suspect identified by police as her former boyfriend, an Afghan migrant.
The suspect's documents say he is 15, but the girl's father told German media he believed the migrant was older.
Germany is undergoing a fierce national discussion over migration since Chancellor Angela Merkel accepted more than a million migrants in 2015, mainly fleeing conflicts in the Middle East. In an election in September, the issue helped bring the far-right AfD party into parliament for the first time.
In the past three years, German authorities have registered nearly 70,000 unaccompanied minors seeking asylum. Critics of government policy have argued that some of them may not be minors, and could be falsifying their ages to qualify for extra benefits and protection from deportation.
Immigration is likely to be a major issue as Merkel seeks to renew a coalition agreement with the center-left SDP party, after both her ruling conservatives and the SDP lost votes in the election. The Bavarian CSU party, which is part of her conservative bloc, has sought a tougher line in particular.
A CSU draft resolution calls for mandatory tests for minors seeking asylum when there is doubt about their ages.
""I believe that we will require in the future, from all allegedly underage refugees for whom we have specific doubts about their minority, a compulsory medical assessment on entering"" the country, said Stephan Mayer, a CSU domestic policy expert.
Mayer said medical tests in other EU countries such as Austria and Sweden had revealed that a significant proportion of age information provided by asylum seekers was incorrect.
""Particularly, since numerous privileges such as much more complex care and a ban on deportation are tied to the status of being minor,"" Mayer told Reuters on Tuesday.
The head of the German Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, said an age test, which could involve X-rays of teeth and wrist bones, could be unethical and inaccurate.
""The examination is laborious, expensive and is loaded with major uncertainties,"" Montgomery told Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. The tests involved exposing people to radiation, which is normally impermissible without a medical indication, except in criminal proceedings, he said.

MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberian President-elect George Weah on Tuesday set modest goals for his six-year term, calling for Liberia to start exporting crops and repairing decrepit infrastructure, in his first interview since winning election last week.
Weah rode a wave of youth support to capture more than 60 percent of the vote in last Tuesday's run-off, but he will need to manage expectations as he attempts to revive one of Africa's worst-performing economies.
Later this month, he will replace President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female head of state and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, in Liberia's first democratic transfer of power since 1944. 
Seated outside his unfinished new house on a quiet dirt backstreet near the capital Monrovia, where a concrete sign announces, ""Friends of Weah say welcome"", the 51-year-old ex-soccer star began to tentatively fill in some of the gaps in his vague campaign promises.
""I want for us to be self-sustained so we can export,"" he said, appearing at ease in a dark blue dress shirt and gold watch. ""The government has a responsibility to have agricultural programs so people are able to grow their own food.""
""Ghana exports, our neighboring countries export - we have the capacity to export,"" he continued. ""They export and we can do the same.""
Liberia spent years recovering from civil wars from 1989-2003 that killed hundreds of thousands of people and then was hit more recently by low prices for its chief exports, iron ore and rubber, and an Ebola outbreak from 2014-16.
INFRASTRUCTURE A PRIORITY 
More than 60 percent of Liberians depend on agriculture for their livelihood and multinationals like Malaysia-based Sime Darby have invested heavily in palm oil plantations. But the sector has languished due to low productivity, forcing Liberia to import more than 80 percent of its staple foods.
Weah has also made repairing Liberia's hollowed-out infrastructure a priority. He grew up in Monrovia's Clara Town slum and can look out on the derelict lots and gutted streets from the upstairs balcony where he spoke to Reuters. 
""The roads for connectivity are vital. We have partners and we have revenue that we will make sure will come in to build our roads,"" he said. 
Weah, who starred for top European clubs such as AC Milan and Paris Saint Germain in the 1990s, has parlayed his rags-to-riches biography into political success but faces criticism that he lacks the experience and knowledge for the job.
He has in turn promised to surround himself with first-rate advisers and appealed to Liberians living overseas to return home. 
""We will have economists who will put us on track. They will look at what is in the coffers and then work out how to move forward,"" he said.
In the days since he became president-elect, security guards in sharp suits and ties have appeared outside the house and a new watch tower rises above 10-foot walls reinforced with barbed wire. 
But Weah insisted that his new-found status would not go to his head. 

""I don't want my title to define my character,"" he said as he walked the property, exchanging jokes with the staff. ""I don't think as a president I will change.""

Sarah Hegazy, 28, and Ahmed Alaa, 21, were released and fined 2,000 Egyptian pounds ($113) each, lawyer Amr Mohamed said.
The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information also reported their release on its Twitter account. It was unclear when their trial would resume. 
Hegazy and Alaa were among dozens of people detained in the conservative Muslim country last year on charges that included ""promoting sexual deviancy"". The crackdown was a response to a rare show of public support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in Egypt.
At a Sept. 22 concert packed with 30,000 people and headlined by Mashrou' Leila, a Lebanese alternative rock band whose lead singer is openly gay, a small group of concertgoers raised a rainbow flag.
Local media said homosexuals were receiving foreign funding, and hosted callers who compared their threat to Islamic State.
Egypt, a key Western ally in the Middle East, has been under fire internationally for its human rights record.
Police, state-aligned media and the religious establishment all regard it as a public duty to combat the spread of homosexuality.

The Dec. 29 report (http://reut.rs/2Dss5by) quoted the World Health Organization as saying 380 patients had been admitted to hospitals across Yemen with diphtheria since August. The spread of the disease compounds widespread hunger and one of the worst cholera outbreaks ever recorded. 
In a statement to Reuters, the Saudi-led coalition statement did not specifically address diphtheria. 
""The Coalition categorically denies blocking any aid or vital provisions from reaching the Yemeni people, and asserts that these claims lack any viable evidence,"" a coalition spokesman said in an emailed statement.
A Saudi-led blockade aimed at blocking arms to Houthi militia has ended up isolating a country that was already the poorest in the Middle East, according to the Reuters report and an earlier investigation (http://reut.rs/2gzvzjn).
Vital provisions – food, medicine, fuel, medical equipment, batteries, solar panels and more – are not getting through.
Humanitarian shipments of food and medicine have mostly been allowed into the country, the story said, but Saudi-led forces have delayed both aid and commercial shipments and have also closed ports outright.
The spokesman blamed the Houthis for holding up humanitarian supplies, hurting the supply of medical assistance and interrupting vaccination campaigns by international aid groups.

The incident took place on Monday in Achin, Nangarhar province, the statement said.
Two of the wounded service members are being treated at a medical facility and in stable condition, it added.
Nangarhar, on the porous border with Pakistan, has become a stronghold for Islamic State, generally known as Daesh in Afghanistan, which has grown to become a dangerous militant group since it appeared around the start of 2015.
The Taliban and Islamic State have frequently fought each other in Nangarhar and both have been targeted by sustained U.S. air strikes.
The exact nature of the relationship between the two groups is little understood. There have been isolated incidents in Afghanistan in which the fighters of both appear to have cooperated.
There are currently about 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan and under President Donald Trump's South Asia strategy, U.S. troops are allowed to accompany Afghan forces at the battalion level, potentially putting them at greater risk.

According to a Harris Interactive survey for RTL radio, 59 percent of the French were optimistic for 2018, the highest level since 2010 and 15 points higher than a trough in 2012.
Supporters of President Emmanuel Macron's party were the most optimistic, the poll showed, while those of the far-right National Front were the most pessimistic.
""There's probably a bit of a Macron effect,"" Harris head of political polling Jean-Daniel Levy said, pointing to renewed hope about European integration, one of Macron's policy priorities.
""There is in particular the feeling of having a presidency that holds water, with good prospects on the economic front,"" he told Reuters.
""It's not only the end of the Hollande years,"" Levy added, referring to the broad sense of malaise that marked the 2012-17 tenure of Macron's Socialist predecessor Francois Hollande. ""The French hear a lot about a better outlook for growth, for jobs. There are signs that show France is less depressed.""
For the first time in five years, a majority of 51 percent of the French said the past year was a positive one.

That was in contrast with the 54 percent who thought 2015 and 2016 were negative - years that were marked by deadly Islamist militant attacks. The state of emergency instituted by Hollande over those attacks was lifted by Macron in November.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has signed a law that scraps a 75-year age cap for presidential candidates, a spokesman for parliament said on Tuesday, a move critics say will allow him to remain in power indefinitely.
Museveni, 73, has ruled Uganda for 31 years and could now stand again in the next election, due in 2021, despite increased public anger over corruption, human rights violations and poor social services.
Parliament, controlled by Museveni's ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM), approved the constitutional amendment on Dec. 22 amid heavy security deployments across the capital Kampala and outside parliament.
""It has been signed into law,"" spokesman Chris Obore said, adding that the president had done so on Dec. 27. 
Museveni's move quickly drew criticism from his political opponents, religious leaders, human rights activists and even some members of the ruling party.
Protests in September by opposition activists against the proposed amendment were quickly put down with detentions, teargas and beatings. At least two people were killed. 
Some legislators opposed to the law tried unsuccessfully at various stages to filibuster it and some were suspended from proceedings. During the final debate on the amendment last month, some lawmakers scuffled with police. 
Museveni is the latest of a growing list of African leaders who have either changed the law or used other tactics to thwart opponents and hold onto power long after their tenure has ended.
In Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan, such moves have provoked instability. 
Last month's vote by parliament was the second time the Ugandan legislature has amended the constitution to allow Museveni to stay in power. In 2005 they voted to remove a limit of two five-year terms, which had blocked him from standing again.
Despite the growing cries of autocracy against Museveni, Washington has backed him as a strongman who has turned Uganda into a bulwark of stability in Africa’s troubled Great Lakes region.
The landlocked East African country is eyeing commencement of crude production in 2020 and the construction of a pipeline to export it via neighboring Tanzania is underway.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's parliament passed an amendment on Tuesday that would make it harder for it to cede control over parts of Jerusalem in any peace deal with the Palestinians, who condemned the move as undermining any chance to revive talks on statehood.
The legislation, sponsored by the far-right Jewish Home coalition party, raises to 80 from 61 the number of votes required in the 120-seat Knesset to approve any proposal to hand over part of the city to ""a foreign party"".
Last month U.S. President Donald Trump angered the Palestinians, Middle East leaders and world powers by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. 
As home to major Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites, Jerusalem's status is one of the most sensitive issues in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump's Dec. 6 decision sparked regional protests and prompted the Palestinians to rule out Washington as a peace broker in any future talks.
Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, described Trump's policy shift on Jerusalem and the passage of the amendment as ""a declaration of war against the Palestinian people"".
""The vote clearly shows that the Israeli side has officially declared an end to the so-called political process,"" Abu Rdainah said, referring to U.S.-sponsored talks on Palestinian statehood that collapsed in 2014.
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its ""eternal and indivisible"" capital.
Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.
The amendment, long in the legislative pipeline, was passed with 64 lawmakers voting in favor and 52 against.
Opposition head Isaac Herzog said Jewish Home was leading Israel ""toward a terrible disaster"". Jewish Home's leader, Naftali Bennett, said the vote showed that Israel would keep control of all of Jerusalem forever.
""There will be no more political skulduggery that will allow our capital to be torn apart,"" Bennett said on Twitter.
A bid to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations led by the president's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has so far shown no progress.
On Sunday, Netanyahu's Likud party unanimously urged legislators in a non-binding resolution to effectively annex Israeli settlements built in the West Bank. [L8N1OV0GP]
Political commentators said Likud's decision might bolster right-wing support for Netanyahu, who could seek a public mandate in an early election while he awaits possible criminal indictments against him on corruption suspicions. He denies wrongdoing. 
Parliamentary elections are not due until November 2019 but the police investigations in two cases of alleged corruption against Netanyahu and tensions among coalition partners in his government could hasten a poll.
Some commentators, pointing to an existing law that already sets a similar high threshold for handing over territory in a land-for-peace deal, have said Jewish Home was essentially competing with Likud for support among the right-wing base.

The shells came from an area of Syria controlled by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Anadolu said, adding that there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties after the shells hit a rural area of the border district of Yayladagi.
Last week, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called Syrian President Assad a terrorist and said it was impossible for peace efforts in Syria to continue if he did not leave power.
Turkey has demanded the removal of Assad from power and backed rebels fighting to overthrow him, but it had toned down its rhetoric since it started working with Assad's allies Russia and Iran for a political resolution.
Turkey now says its main concerns in Syria are combating both Islamist militants and Kurdish YPG militia fighters it considers allies of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which has fought a decades-long insurgency in southeastern Turkey.

MOSS, Norway (Reuters) - Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg began negotiations on Tuesday to add the small Liberal Party to her cabinet, emphasizing jobs creation and energy policy among top priorities for the talks.
Adding the Liberals to her coalition of the Conservatives and the anti-immigration Progress Party may make day-to-day governing easier for Solberg. But the three parties together would hold only 80 seats in Norway's 169-seat assembly.
Solberg would still need the backing of another small party, the Christian Democrats, who hold eight seats. She had initially tried to form a majority government by including both Liberals and Christian Democrats, but the Christian Democrats have so far rejected the offer.
""Norway's economy is improving, unemployment is coming down and we have won a competitiveness that it is essential to maintain in the coming years,"" Solberg told reporters as the talks started. They are provisionally scheduled to last until Jan. 19.
The comments echoed recent speeches by the prime minister, in which she praised labor unions and employers for agreeing to moderate wage increases that helped keep inflation low and the crown, Norway's currency, weak against the euro.
While Norway is western Europe's largest exporter of oil and gas, the country also supports the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to end the fossil fuel era this century.
""It's very important that we can come to an agreement on policies that will help us tackle the new challenges our country is facing,"" Solberg said, adding that a gradual shift to a greener economy was necessary.
Energy policy may be a stumbling block for the talks, though. The Liberals want to curtail exploration, while the Progress Party and Solberg's own Conservatives both intend to continue drilling for hydrocarbons.

Solberg narrowly retained power in a September election by promising further tax cuts and economic progress for Norway, which has only partly recovered from a 2015-2016 downturn caused by a plunge in the price of oil.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Cash cannot be king for the people of Bakasi camp.
Instead, a small bundle of firewood can be traded for some milk. An unwanted bowl of baby fish is good in exchange for cooking oil. Peanuts are always in high demand.
With little money to hand at the best of times, and struggling to find the goods they need, bartering is key to getting by for Bakasi's more than 21,000 displaced people.
The eight-year Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria's northeast has displaced around 2 million people, some in Nigeria and some overseas. The United Nations calls it one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
More than 670,000 of those people live in camps in Nigeria's northeast, where cash is hard to come by, opportunities for work are rare and the food and aid they get is often not what they want.
The dusty Bakasi camp sits on the outskirts of the city of Maiduguri in Borno, the spiritual home of the Islamist Boko Haram movement, which wants to establish a caliphate in the region surrounding Lake Chad.
In Bakasi, the displaced frequently swap the little they have for their preferred goods, whether it's herbs and spices to make soup, groundnut to help a breastfeeding mother produce milk or laundry detergent for a family's clothes.
""We don't get money, that's why we do this,"" said Umaru Usman Kaski, hoping to trade a small bundle of firewood worth about 50 naira (0.12 pounds) to support his family of eight.
While many would prefer money, cash distribution in Nigeria's northeast is fraught with risk.
Reports of corruption in the humanitarian crisis relief efforts are rife. Those involved, such as government officials, aid workers and soldiers, are alleged to skim from the top before distributing aid.
Many of those responding to the crisis are also concerned that with economic prospects dim for the foreseeable future, millions of people will become dependent on the aid, the vast majority of it coming from overseas.
Until then, Nigeria's displaced are finding their own ways to balance what they receive with their needs.
Abdulwahal Abdulla, a 50-year-old living in Bakasi for three years, hoped to trade his bowl of young tilapia worth roughly 150 naira for cooking oil. 
Abdulla, no fan of the fish, had bought them because products were scarce and it was the only thing he could buy at the time, he said.
Nasiru Buba was trading packets of laundry detergent. He had bought them after working as a porter in the city, pushing a cart loaded with people's belongings, and wanted to trade them for groundnuts.
""My wife has just delivered a baby and the breast is not coming out with milk,"" said Buba. 

""I needed to get groundnuts for her to eat so she will produce sufficient breast milk, and I don't have any money. When I got the detergent I was not in need of anything, but that changed.""

There was no immediate comment from Saudi officials, but a Saudi source familiar with the matter said Assaf retained his positions as minister of state and adviser to the king. 
Assaf, who was also a former finance minister and a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco, was among people detained and under investigation by a new anti-corruption body in November, a senior Saudi official had told Reuters.
He was released from the Ritz last month after being cleared of wrongdoing and without making any payment to the state, the source said. Local media also reported his release.
Saudi security forces rounded up about 200 princes, ministers and business leaders and converted the Ritz-Carlton into a luxurious prison for them in early November in what Riyadh said was a crackdown on corruption. 
The move was also widely seen by analysts as helping Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman consolidate his grip on power, after he ousted his cousin as heir to the throne in the summer.
The most powerful of King Abdullah's sons, former National Guard chief Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, was released last month after agreeing to pay the government $1 billion. 
Prince Miteb had been the last member of Abdullah's Shammar branch of the family to retain a key position in the Saudi power structure, after Prince Meshaal and Prince Turki were relieved of their posts as governors in 2015.
Assaf had been accused of embezzlement related to the expansion of Mecca's Grand Mosque and taking advantage of his position and inside information to purchase lands, according to a Saudi official. 
Several detainees have been freed after agreeing to settlements in which they hand over assets to the state.

Saudi authorities see the settlements not as blackmail but as an obligation to reimburse money taken illegally from the world's top oil producer over several decades.

The protest came a day after celebrations by Dalits in Pune, 150 km (95 miles) from Mumbai, of the 200th anniversary of a battle they won, fighting alongside British colonial forces, against an upper caste ruler, were marred by clashes with right-wing Hindu groups.
Those clashes resulted in the death of a 28-year-old man, according to the Maharashtra state government. It was not immediately clear which side the man was on.
Tuesday, Dalit protesters threw stones at buses in various parts of Mumbai, while rail services on a main line across the city were disrupted, said a senior police official who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German police have asked prosecutors to investigate a far-right lawmaker for possible incitement to hatred after she criticized a police force for tweeting in Arabic ""to appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hoards of men"".
Police in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) posted a New Year's Eve greeting in Arabic as well as German, English and French. Cologne, a city where groups of mainly Arab immigrants were accused of sexual assaults at New Year's Eve celebrations two years ago, is located in the state.
""What the hell is wrong with this country? Why is the official page of police in NRW tweeting in Arabic,"" Beatrix von Storch, a member of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), wrote in a Dec. 31 tweet that was later deleted by Twitter after receiving complaints from members of the public.
""Are they seeking to appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hoards of men?"" she added.
Twitter suspended her account for some 12 hours after she posted the message, saying it breached the micro-blogging website's rules that bar users from posting hateful messages.
Social media platforms face hefty fines in Germany if they fail to remove hateful postings swiftly, and companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter have hired extra staff to monitor such messages.
The NRW police deployed large numbers of officers to secure New Year's street parties in large cities this year and said celebrations were largely peaceful.
'CENSORSHIP'
Prosecutors in NRW must first decide whether they should deal with the police complaint against von Storch or transfer the case to Berlin authorities given that her constituency is in the capital.
If prosecutors deem there is sufficient grounds to launch an official criminal investigation against von Storch, they would first have to ask parliament to suspend her immunity before proceeding with a case.
Cologne Chief Prosecutor Ulf Willuhn said prosecutors must now decide whether von Storch's message amounted to ""inciting people to commit violence against a certain section of society"". 
Twitter also deleted a message by AfD member Alice Weidel in which she said German authorities wanted Germans to live with criminal mobs of migrants. 
The AfD won seats in parliament for the first time in September, riding a wave of discontent against Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to open Germany's borders to more than a million asylum-seeking migrants.
The AfD, which says Islam is incompatible with the German constitution, is the third largest party in parliament. It has upended German politics by stealing voters from Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats, making coalition building more difficult.
AfD leaders reacted angrily to Twitter's decision to delete the two postings under a new law passed by parliament in June that authorizes fines of up to 50 million euros against social media networks if they don't promptly remove hateful content.
""The censorship law of (Justice Minister) Heiko Maas has already showed on the first day of the year its ability to curtail freedom of expression,"" said AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland. ""I call on every social media user to take action against such oppression by reposting the deleted comments again and again!""

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader on Tuesday accused enemies of the Islamic Republic of stirring unrest across the country as a crackdown intensified against anti-government demonstrations that began last week.
Police have arrested more than 450 protesters in the capital Tehran over the past three days, the deputy provincial governor said. Protesters also attacked police stations elsewhere in Iran late into the night on Monday, news agency and social media reports said.
One member of the security forces was reported killed on Monday, bringing to at least 14 the death toll stemming from the boldest challenge to Iran's clerical leadership since unrest in 2009. 
In his first reaction to the unrest, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: ""In recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the Islamic Republic."" 
Khamenei said on his website that he would address the nation about the recent events ""when the time is right"".
He did not mention any enemies by name but Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia were behind the recent riots in Iran. 
""Saudis will receive Iran’s unexpected response and they know how serious it can be,"" Shamkhani was quoted as saying by Tasnim news in an interview with Beirut-based Al Mayadeen TV.
HARSH PUNISHMENT 
Musa Ghazanfarabadi, head of Tehran's Revolutionary Court, warned protesters on Tuesday that those arrested would face harsh punishment.
The semi-official ILNA news agency quoted Ali Asghar Naserbakht, the deputy governor of Tehran province, as saying that 200 people were arrested on Saturday in Tehran, 150 people on Sunday and about 100 people on Monday.
Hundreds of others have been arrested in other cities, according to agency reports and social media.
Naserbakht said the situation in Tehran was under control and police has not asked for the help of the Revolutionary Guards special forces.
Deputy Interior Minister Hossein Zolfaghari said 90 percent of the detainees were under 25-years-old, showing frustration among youths from the economic situation and lack of social freedoms.
Mehr news agency quoted a judiciary official as saying that several ringleaders of protests in Karaj, the fourth largest city in Iran, have been arrested.
Ghazanfarabadi said the detainees will be soon put on trial and the ringleaders would face serious charges including ""moharebeh"" -- an Islamic term meaning warring against God -- which carries the death penalty. 
Iran's judiciary chief Sadeq Larijani ordered prosecutors on Monday to ""punish rioters firmly"".
The demonstrations which broke out last week were initially focused on economic hardships and alleged corruption but turned into political rallies.
Anger was soon directed at the clerical leadership that has been in power since the 1979 revolution, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the ultimate authority in Iran’s system of dual clerical and republican rule.
Iran is a major OPEC oil producer and regional power deeply
involved in Syria and Iraq as part of a battle for influence
with rival Saudi Arabia. 
Many Iranians resent the foreign interventions and want their leaders to create jobs at home, where youth unemployment reached 29 percent last year.
Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a news conference that both protesters and the security forces should follow the law.
""People have the rights to protest but there is a difference between demonstration and riot...Even those who are confronting the rioters should act within the framework of law,"" he said.
Videos on social media on Monday showed an intense clash in the central town of Qahderijan between security forces and protesters who were trying to occupy a police station, which was partially set ablaze. 
There were unconfirmed reports of several casualties among demonstrators.
In the western city of Kermanshah, protesters set fire to a traffic police post, but no one was hurt in the incident, Mehr news agency said.
State television reported that protesters burned down four mosques in villages in Savadkuh County in northern Iran on Monday.
REACTIONS
Rouhani refrained on Monday from accepting responsibility of problems raised by protesters and he blamed his predecessor and also Iran’s long-time adversary, the United States for the government's shortcomings.
Rouhani, seen as a pragmatist who is at odds with hardliners, said: ""People on the streets do not ask for bread and water, but for more freedom,"" -- implying that the protesters were not targeting his government but the more rigid establishment. 
U.S. President Donald Trump supported the protesters in a tweet on Monday: ""The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!""
Turkey said on Tuesday it was concerned by reports of people dying and public buildings being damaged in Iran.
""We believe it is necessary to avoid violence and not succumb to provocations,"" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding that it hoped foreign intervention would be avoided.
The Russian Foreign Ministry was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying external interference was destabilizing the situation and calling it ""unacceptable"". 
Iran and Russia are the main allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while the United States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey support rebel groups.

It was the second reported multiple execution of convicted Islamist militants in a week. A week ago Egypt hanged 15 men accused of deadly attacks in the Sinai peninsula, believed to be the largest number of people executed in a single day since President Abdel Fateh al-Sisi took power.
The latest executions were carried out in the Borg al-Arab prison, west of the coastal city of Alexandria, after the military appeals court rejected appeals by the defendants, the sources said.
The four were hanged for their role in a bombing in the Nile Delta town of Kafr al-Sheikh that took place during violence that followed the ouster of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Sisi, then the military chief, removed Mursi in mid-2013 after mass protests against Mursi's rule.
The court also sentenced three others in absentia to death, and jailed eight others, including Salah al-Feki, head of the Muslim Brotherhood's administrative office in Kafr al-Sheikh.
Authorities banned the Brotherhood and declared it a terrorist organization after Mursi was deposed, arresting thousands of its members and supporters.
Since then, Egypt has faced a growing insurgency from Islamic State fighters in the Sinai Peninsula.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",Bulgaria's president vetoes anti-corruption law,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgarian President Rumen Radev on Tuesday vetoed anti-graft legislation passed by parliament in December, saying the bill would not allow the efficient investigation of corruption networks.
Radev acted only a day after Bulgaria, the European Union's poorest country, assumed the six-month, rotating presidency of the bloc. It is the first time the Balkan state has taken over the role since it joined the EU on Jan. 1, 2007.
Bulgaria has made scant progress towards stamping out graft and organized crime, and the European Commission, the EU's executive, has repeatedly rebuked the Black Sea country for failing to prosecute and sentence allegedly corrupt officials.
According to Transparency International, Bulgaria is the EU's most corrupt country.
The measures in the law, approved by the national assembly two weeks ago, included the creation of a special anti-graft unit, meant to investigate persons occupying high state posts as well as assets and conflict of interest.
""I believe that the adopted law not only does not create an adequate legal basis for tackling corruption but will even make it difficult to fight it,"" Radev, who won a presidential election in November 2016, said in a statement.
Bulgaria’s president is chosen by popular vote.
Analysts have also voiced concern that the bill was not fit for purpose as the new unit, whose management would be appointed by parliament, may not be truly independent and could be used by those in power to persecute opponents.
""No doubt, the president has strong arguments (to veto the law),"" political analyst Petar Cholakov said. Analysts, however, expect the parliament to overturn Radev’s veto.
The new law also focuses on improving control and accountability of law-enforcement agencies, and the government in Sofia is hoping that Bulgaria will be able to change opinions and remove its tarnished image during its EU presidency.

Corruption has deterred foreign investment since communism collapsed in Bulgaria in 1989, and the EU has kept Sofia as well as neighboring Romania - for the same rule-of-law failings - outside its Schengen zone of passport-free travel.

474,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 05:53AM ET</span>",North Korea's Olympic overture seen aimed at blunting international pressure,"By Josh Smith and David Brunnstrom
SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After a year of threats and weapons advances, North Korea's leader appears to be using the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in South Korea as a tool to blunt growing international pressure on his regime while leaving his nuclear arsenal untouched.
Kim Jong Un, in his annual New Year's Day speech, called for reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula and flagged the North's possible participation in the Games next month, just across the border in Pyeongchang.
South Korea has been eager to involve North Korea to ensure the Games are not disrupted by any further nuclear or missile tests and as a way of re-establishing dialogue with the reclusive state.
Analysts say Kim's gambit is aimed at driving a wedge between Seoul and Washington, which has advocated a strategy of maximum pressure and insisted that all options, including military ones, are on the table. 
But the move also targets the broader international consensus involving major players China, Russia and Japan that has tightened sanctions and deepened isolation for North Korea in recent months.
""A major part of the Kim family playbook is to exploit and to widen the divergences in the interests, in the first instance between the U.S. and South Korea, but more broadly among the five major neighbours,"" said Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until last April and now at the Asia Society Policy Institute.
North Korea has long followed such a strategy of intense provocations followed by conciliatory phases aimed at exposing rifts, he said.
""This is a classic united we stand, divided we fall situation,"" Russel said. ""It’s always easier to maintain five party solidarity when North Korea is behaving badly.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has led a drive to step up global sanctions on North Korea as it seeks to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.
Washington says the full cooperation of China, Russia and other countries is vital to the success of this effort, which includes significant restrictions on trade and other ties with North Korea.
China, which remains North Korea's major partner, has curtailed trade in line with United Nations sanctions, but Washington has called for it to do more to isolate Pyongyang.
""ABSURD OVERTURE""
South Korea's government publicly welcomed Kim's overture, and President Moon Jae-in has pushed to ease tensions ahead of the Games by postponing joint military drills with American troops until after the Olympics.
Moon also said on Tuesday the improvement of inter-Korean ties was linked to resolving North Korea's nuclear programme.
The White House has yet to make a detailed response. However, powerful Senator Lindsey Graham suggested the United States would boycott the Games if North Korea attends.
""Allowing Kim Jong Un’s North Korea to participate in Winter Olympics would give legitimacy to the most illegitimate regime on the planet,"" Graham said on Twitter. ""I’m confident South Korea will reject this absurd overture and fully believe that if North Korea goes to the Winter Olympics, we do not.""
Graham unsuccessfully called for a boycott of the previous Winter Olympics in Sochi over Russia's granting of asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden.
The spectacle of North Korean athletes and officials participating in Olympic events may create some awkward moments for international leaders who have spent months painting the country as a pariah state, said Robert Kelly, a professor at South Korea's Pusan National University. 
""It puts the South Koreans in a weird position because it potentially creates tension between U.S. and Japan who have gone to lengths to isolate the regime,"" he said.
Japan's relationship with South Korea is already seen as under some strain, with one former Japanese diplomat saying Tokyo was suffering from ""fatigue"" with Seoul and lacking confidence in Moon. 
Still, analysts were sceptical Kim's gambit would do lasting damage to the alliance between Seoul and Washington, or to the international push for sanctions.
""I doubt that there will be a substantial reversal in global economic and political isolation measures in the near term,"" said Scott Snyder, director of U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
MORE MISSILE TESTS
At the heart of analysts' scepticism is Kim's apparent lack of appetite for compromise on the main points of nuclear weapons, missile testing, or human rights.
""Participation in things like the Olympics are pseudo-concessions, because the North doesn’t actually have to give up anything,"" Kelly said.
In his speech, Kim vowed he would spend 2018 ""mass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles"" to ""give a spur to the efforts for deploying them for action.""
That means further missile tests are almost certain, with more focus on ""realistic"" exercises than developmental tests, said Joshua Pollack, a senior researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.
""The major theme here for strategic forces is shifting from development to serial production, deployment, and increased readiness,"" he said.
If the United States wants to take advantage of any possible easing in tensions, it needs to drop its demands for a halt in testing as a precondition for talks, said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project in New York.

""The most important reciprocal step would be to scale back - not (just) postpone - the spring joint exercises,"" he said. ""Failure to try these steps will only ensure that unbridled North Korean weapons development continues.""

A statement by Bilal Badr, who led a hardline Sunni Islamist faction against mainstream Palestinian groups in the Ain el-Hilweh refugee camp at Sidon, did not say when or how he had traveled to Syria. 
The rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad has drawn militant Sunnis from across the region. After fighting in Ain el-Hilweh in August, Palestinian groups urged wanted security suspects to leave the camp. 
Badr's statement addressed his supporters ""from the land of jihad and glory, from Assad's lair in Syria, to which we migrated to support the religion of God"". 
The statement was circulated on social media inside the camp and its authenticity was confirmed by a source close to Badr. 
Although his statement revealed his presence in Syria, it was issued to thank followers for helping his wife, who had been briefly detained, rather than to describe his whereabouts.
Islamist sources in Ain el-Hilweh said Badr had gone to Idlib province which borders Turkey in northwest Syria and is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance spearheaded by the former al Qaeda affiliate in the country. 
Badr fighters have repeatedly battled the mainstream Fatah and other factions in Ain el-Hilweh, leading to more than a dozen deaths in 2017. 
Lebanon's Palestinian camps mainly fall outside the jurisdiction of the Lebanese security forces. There are 170,000 Palestinian refugees living in 12 camps in Lebanon, according to a recent census announced by Lebanese authorities.

There have been at least five violations reported, blamed on both sides in the conflict.
The United States, Britain and Norway form a group that supported the 2005 accord leading to the independence of South Sudan from Sudan. They have threatened to impose individual or group sanctions for those violating the ceasefire.
Signed in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, the ceasefire is the latest attempt to end a four-year civil war, that has killed tens of thousands. It is also designed to allow humanitarian groups access to civilians caught in the fighting.
It aims to revive a 2015 peace deal that collapsed in 2016 after heavy fighting erupted in the capital Juba. 
President Salva Kiir's decision to sack his deputy, Riek Machar, in 2013 triggered the war in the world's youngest country. It has been fought largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to Kiir, who is Dinka, and Machar, who is Nuer.
The war has forced a third of the population to flee their homes. 
""We call on all signatories, and the field commanders who answer to them, to immediately end all military operations,"" the three Western countries said in a statement.
They added that field commanders and their political bosses would be held accountable for violating the ceasefire and impeding humanitarian assistance.
There was no immediate comment from the army or the rebels.
The ceasefire was to be followed by further talks focusing on a revised power-sharing arrangement leading up to a new date for polls.

Australian Transport Safety Bureau Executive Director Nat Nagy said investigators would probe several lines of inquiry to piece together what happened, including a close look at the plane's avionics and maintenance record and the pilot's background and experience.
It was hoped the plane would be raised by the end of the week, Nagy said. A crane, airbags, or a combination of the two, would be used to raise the plane from the riverbed as gently as possible.
The plane is submerged in 13 meters of water near Cowan, about 40 km (25 miles) north of Sydney.
Nagy said investigators would also look for any other electronic devices, including iPads or iPhones, that may have been on board when the plane crashed on Sunday, killing Compass chief executive Richard Cousins, 58, and four members of his family. The pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, was also killed.
A preliminary report into the crash will be made public in about a month, although authorities have warned it may take up to a year to find out what happened.
""If we do identify any critical safety issues throughout the course of the investigation, we will immediately notify the relevant authorities ... to remedy any issues,"" Nagy said.
""This particular aircraft, I understand was manufactured in 1963, it's not unusual to have aircraft of that sort of age flying around ... we haven't seen any systemic issues around this aircraft,"" he added.
Australian police have identified those killed with Cousins as Emma Bowden, 48, Heather Bowden, 11, Edward Cousins, 23, and William Cousins, 25.
Family members and media reports identified four of the victims Cousins' two sons, his fiancée and her daughter.
Cousins, who led Compass over the past 11 years, was due to step down in March after being widely credited with turning the company's business around and making it into one of the Financial Times Stock Exchange's best-performing firms. 
The seaplane was part of the Sydney Seaplanes business that has operated since 2005 with no previous record of mishap. Seaplane flights have been canceled until further notice.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) traded barbs about migration and tax cuts on Tuesday amid mounting questions about whether they can agree to renew the ""grand coalition"" that ruled Germany for the past four years.
Merkel, under pressure after failing to form a government three months after national elections, hopes to secure a fourth term in office by persuading the center-left SPD to join the government despite punishing losses in September's election. 
Party leaders will meet for preliminary talks on Jan. 3 ahead of exploratory talks scheduled for Jan. 7 through Jan. 12, but a growing number of politicians now say Merkel might have to rule with a minority government, or face new elections.
SPD deputy leader Thorsten Schaefer-Guembel said recent comments by some conservatives were ""counterproductive for every form of government formation"" and said they had sparked doubts about the will of conservatives to govern together.
He said a deal on a new coalition was far from certain and it was unclear if the talks could develop sufficient trust.
""A minority government remains an option, even if Chancellor Angela Merkel doesn't want to acknowledge that,"" he said in an interview published Tuesday in the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper.
Schaefer-Guembel cited differences with conservatives on a range of issues and rejected as ""absurd"" proposals by some conservatives to cut taxes for high-income earners.
Conservatives and the SPD are also at odds over healthcare, immigration, Europe, work regulations and pensions.
Schaefer-Guembel said he backed calls by SPD parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles to raise taxes for the wealthiest and urge fresh efforts to prevent big companies from evading taxes.
Merkel's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has distanced itself from the SPD through policy papers calling for corporate tax cuts, reductions in benefits for asylum seekers, higher military spending and limits on immigration.
The powerful economic council of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) said it will urge CSU party leaders to push for a minority government when they meet this week, arguing that Germany would face ""enormous financial burdens for generations"" if the SPD pushed through its spending plans in a coalition.
""A grand coalition will be more expensive in the long term than a minority government,"" Wolfgang Steiger, secretary general of the council told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper.
The SPD initially wanted to stay in opposition, but agreed to explore the possibility of governing with the conservatives in the interest of political stability after Merkel's coalition talks with two smaller parties collapsed in November.
Experts say new elections could hand more gains to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that entered parliament for the first time in September. Merkel says a new coalition would be more stable than minority government.
Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, a CSU negotiator, told the Funke media group his party would insist on limiting immigration levels. It wanted to extend a temporary ban on family reunifications for migrants who were granted ""subsidiary protection"", an asylum status for those not officially classed as refugees.
He said his party viewed it as a democratic responsibility to negotiate a new coalition if policy gaps could be overcome.
""I hope the Social Democrats feel the same sense of responsibility,"" he said. ""We have an urgent need for action on the legislative front.... We urgently need clear majorities in parliament, we need reliable coalitions.""
A top member of the pro-business Free Democrats, which dropped out of coalition talks with conservatives and Greens in November, said such a coalition remained a future possibility.

Alexander Lambsdorff, deputy leader of the FDP's parliamentary group, also told the Heilbronner Stimme newspaper that he did not exclude the possibility of new elections or a minority government. ""That would not be nice, but it also would not result in a constitutional crisis,"" he said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A real estate developer wanted by Vietnamese authorities amid a crackdown on corruption has been detained in Singapore, lawyers representing him said on Tuesday.
Phan Van Anh Vu, 42, was detained in Singapore on Thursday at the Tuas border checkpoint as he tried to leave for Malaysia, said Remy Choo, who said he had been engaged by Vu's family to represent him but had not yet been able to contact him.
Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security said last month it was seeking the arrest of Vu, a major property developer in the central city of Danang, where the local leadership was shaken up after corruption accusations last year.
Vietnamese media quoted police as saying Vu was wanted for revealing state secrets. They did not say what these related to or whether that was linked to his role as a property developer.
Choo said Vu had applied for asylum in a European country.
Another lawyer retained by the family, Foo Chow Ming, said: ""I am now trying to obtain access to see Mr Vu, who is held in remand.""
Singapore's Immigration and Checkpoints Authority did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Vietnam's foreign ministry also did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Vu's detention in Singapore and whether Hanoi had sought his extradition.
Singapore has close diplomatic and trade ties to Vietnam. This year, Singapore is also chairing the regional Association of Southeast Asian Nations grouping, which has sought to strengthen regional cooperation on all fronts.
Dozens of Vietnamese officials and business figures have been arrested in a crackdown on corruption that has gathered pace since the security establishment gained greater sway in the ruling Communist Party in 2016.
The crackdown grabbed world headlines last year when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping a former oil executive to return him home to face trial.

No further details were provided, but critics of President Nicolas Maduro's leftist government seized on the incident, calling it a stark example of the oil-rich country's meltdown.
Local media reported that Colopoy's husband and a witness said the soldiers were drunk when they arrived at the queue for pork in a poor area of Caracas. They said the soldiers ordered the Venezuelans to move on because the traditional Christmas meat had run out, but the group refused. 
""The National Guard went crazy and started firing,"" Colopoy's spouse Bernabé said in a filmed interview circulating on social media. ""She fell to the ground,"" he said, adding his wife was five month pregnant. His brother Alejandro was also shot, but was recovering, he said.

""The Venezuelan state guarantees the respect and application of human rights, as well as sanctions for those who violate them,"" he tweeted. 
Food riots and rowdy queues in front of supermarkets have become frequent in Venezuela. The OPEC country is reeling from a fourth year of brutal recession. Millions of residents have salaries that add up to just a few U.S. dollars a month, making it difficult to obtain enough food.

(Reuters) - Record-shattering arctic cold reached as far south as Florida on Monday with freeze warnings in place from Texas to the Atlantic Coast and the Northeastern United States facing another cold wave at the end of the week, forecasters said.
Temperatures ranged from 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit (11 to 17 degrees Celsius) below normal across the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, with only southern Florida untouched by the arctic blast.
""That degree of cold will be with us until tomorrow,"" said Brian Hurley, a National Weather Service meteorologist at College Park, Maryland. ""Tuesday morning, we're looking at temperatures with very high probability of record lows.""
Along Alabama's Gulf Coast, the temperature in the city of Mobile could hit a low of 16 F (minus 9 C) overnight. Stiff breezes were expected to create dangerously cold wind chills across southeastern Georgia and most of northeastern Florida, the weather service said.
Michael Kimberl, co-founder of Sean's Outpost, an encampment for homeless people in Pensacola, Florida, said he was handing out propane fuel and extra blankets to residents.
""Our community is very unequipped for weather of this type,"" he said by phone. Homeless shelters were also making special accommodations, including one site available for women and children, he said.
The mass of frigid air pumped south by a dip in the jet stream sent temperatures plunging across the U.S. heartland. Omaha, Nebraska, posted a low of minus 20 F (minus 29 C), breaking a 130-year-old record, and Aberdeen, South Dakota, shattered a record set in 1919 with a temperature of minus 32 F (minus 36 C).
The cold will be unrelenting across the Middle Atlantic and Northeastern United States, with up to two dozen low-temperature records expected in those regions over the next day or two, Hurley said.
Although the cold should ease across most of the United States after Tuesday, the northeastern quarter of the country will see a repeat of the frigid temperatures from Thursday to Friday as another arctic blast hits the area.
The private AccuWeather forecaster said the cold snap could combine with a storm brewing off the Bahamas to bring snow and high winds to much of the Eastern Seaboard as it heads north on Wednesday and Thursday.

The only part of the United States spared the deep freeze is the Southwest, with above-normal temperatures and dry weather expected to linger there, the weather service said.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A family of five from the New York City suburb of Scarsdale was aboard a plane that crashed and exploded minutes after takeoff from a popular beach resort in Costa Rica on Sunday, killing all 12 people aboard, a relative and the family's rabbi said.
Ten U.S. citizens and two Costa Rican pilots were killed when the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft crashed into a mountainous area off the beach town of Punta Islita, the Costa Rican government said. The town is in the province of Guanacaste, about 230 km (140 miles) west of the capital of San Jose.
Forensic workers recovered badly burned bodies from the crash site on Sunday and took the remains to San Jose on Monday, where family members and friends of the Costa Rican pilots gathered outside the morgue.
Autopsies were to begin on Tuesday, a local police official told reporters. He would not specify when bodies would be returned to relatives. 
""Due to the state they are in, a little more time is required to identify them. We have to wait,"" the country's security minister, Gustavo Mata, told Reuters Monday in a brief telephone interview. 
The dead included the Steinberg family, consisting of a couple and their three sons.
""We are in utter shock and disbelief right now,"" Tamara Steinberg Jacobsen, sister of the father, Bruce Steinberg, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), where she posted pictures of the family and thanked people for their condolences.
She also asked for privacy.
Rabbi Jonathan Blake of the Westchester Reform Temple identified the family as Bruce and Irene Steinberg and their sons William, Zachary and Matthew.
""This tragedy hits our community very hard,"" Blake said on Facebook, saying the family had belonged to the temple since 2001 and were active in philanthropic organizations.
Nature Air, the Costa Rican company that operated the flight, identified the five Steinbergs and five other passengers: Thibault Astruc, Amanda Geissler, Charles Palmer, Leslie Weiss and Sherry Wuu. 
All 10 passengers were U.S. citizens, the State Department confirmed on Monday.
They died along with Costa Rican pilots Juan Manuel Retana and Emma Ramos, Nature Air said.
Costa Rican civil aviation authorities noted Sunday there were strong winds in the area but said officials had not yet determined the cause of the crash. The flight was part of a special charter of two planes. The other took off 20 minutes earlier and arrived safely in San Jose.

Punta Islita, on Costa Rica's Pacific Coast, is popular among North American and European tourists for its pristine beaches and lush landscape.

""In light of the demanding situation for the party, and the nature of the case, Trond Giske and I have agreed that he will be relieved of his duty as deputy leader for an indefinite period,"" Labour leader Jonas Gahr Stoere said in a statement.
On Dec. 21, Gahr Stoere said several women had accused his deputy of ""unwanted encounters of a sexual nature."" The board of the Labour Party is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss the situation.
Giske, who is currently on sick leave, confirmed on Monday he had agreed to step aside temporarily from his leadership post, writing on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that he hoped it would allow him to respond further to the accusations.
Giske, a former industry minister, culture minister and education minister, remains a member of Norway's parliament where he is also Labour's chief spokesman on economic policy.
A number of political, corporate and other leaders in several countries have quit or been fired in recent weeks as women have come forward with accusations of abuse and harassment.
In neighboring Finland, the deputy head of the nationalist Finns Party quit his post on Dec. 19 after harassing a lawmaker in parliament.

The social movement aimed at raising awareness of sexual harassment and assault, epitomized by the #MeToo social media hashtag, was last month named Time magazine's 2017 ""Person of the Year"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Airlines recorded zero accident deaths in commercial passenger jets last year, according to a Dutch consulting firm and an aviation safety group that tracks crashes, making 2017 the safest year on record for commercial air travel.
Dutch aviation consulting firm To70 and the Aviation Safety Network both reported Monday there were no commercial passenger jet fatalities in 2017. ""2017 was the safest year for aviation ever,"" said Adrian Young of To70.
To70 estimated that the fatal accident rate for large commercial passenger flights is 0.06 per million flights, or one fatal accident for every 16 million flights.
The Aviation Safety Network also reported there were no commercial passenger jet deaths in 2017, but 10 fatal airliner accidents resulting in 44 fatalities onboard and 35 persons on the ground, including cargo planes and commercial passenger turbo prop aircraft.
That figure includes 12 people killed on Dec. 31 when a Nature Air Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft crashed minutes after takeoff into a mountainous area off the beach town of Punta Islita, Costa Rica. [nL1N1OW0A3] 
In comparison, there were 16 accidents and 303 deaths in 2016 among airliners.
The deadliest incident last year occurred in January when a Turkish cargo jet smashed into a village in Kyrgyzstan as it tried to land at a nearby airport in dense fog, killing 35 on the ground and all four onboard.
The Aviation Safety Network said 2017 was ""the safest year ever, both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in terms of fatalities.""
Over the last two decades aviation deaths around the world have been steadily falling. As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said.
The United States last recorded a fatal airline passenger jet crash in February 2009, when Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed short of the runway in Clarence Center, New York, killing 49 onboard and one person on the ground.
In 2016, 412 people were killed in the United States in aviation accidents - nearly all in general aviation accidents and none on commercial passenger airlines.
The last fatal passenger jet airliner accident worldwide took place in November 2016 near Medellin, Colombia and the last commercial passenger aircraft crash to kill more than 100 people occurred in October 2015 in Egypt.

490,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2018 01:55PM ET</span>","Merkel's allies, further defying SPD, seek cuts to tax and asylum seeker benefits","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Bavarian conservatives are pressing for corporate tax cuts and cuts to welfare payments for asylum seekers, which could complicate talks with the Social Democrats (SPD) on forming a new government.
Chancellor Angela Merkel hopes to secure a fourth term in office by persuading the center-left SPD to extend the ""grand coalition"" that ruled Germany for the past four years, even though both blocs suffered big losses in September's election.
Exploratory talks are scheduled from Jan. 7 to Jan 12.
The SPD, which initially wanted to stay in opposition, has agreed to explore the possibility in the interest of political stability after Merkel's coalition talks with two smaller parties collapsed in November. But SPD officials have made no promises.
Policy papers prepared by Bavaria's CSU, sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrats, point to difficult negotiations ahead at a time when Merkel and others are calling for quick work to form a stable new government. 
The CSU, historically more conservative than Merkel's larger party, will play a key role in the coalition talks. The two conservative parties have presented a more unified front in recent months after prolonged conflict over Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome more than one million migrants to Germany. 
In a paper leaked last week, the CSU said it wanted military spending to reach NATO's target of 2 percent of national output, called for a hardline position on immigration, and rejected closer European integration, charting a collision course with the SPD.
Now, draft policy papers prepared for a CSU party meeting this week set up further conflicts.
In one paper, first reported by German magazine Focus, the CSU calls for cuts in corporate tax rates, given U.S. tax cuts and similar moves afoot in Britain and France.
""If Germany does not act, it will in the near future have one of the highest corporate tax rates in international comparison,"" the paper said.
SPD parliamentary group leader Andrea Nahles has called for increasing taxes on the wealthy. Her party is pressing for more spending on infrastructure, education, health care and other social priorities. 
Another CSU paper called for cuts in benefits for asylum seekers to discourage more migrants from coming to Germany, the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper reported late on Monday.
Instead of transitioning to higher regular welfare payments after 15 months, asylum-seekers would continue to receive the lower basic aid for 36 months.
""We want to reduce social welfare payments for asylum seekers so that Germany does not remain the main magnet for refugees from the whole world,"" Alexander Dobrindt, a top CSU official told the newspaper.
Pressure is mounting on Merkel to form a new government three months after the election.
Former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, now president of the lower house of parliament, said on Saturday he could not rule out a minority government if no deal emerged.

Another alternative would be a new election, but political experts say that could result in further gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which parlayed concerns about migration to enter parliament for the first time in September.

The incident took place just days after attacks on a Coptic church and another Christian-owned shop also south of the Egyptian capital that killed more than 10 people, as security forces brace for attacks against the Arab world's largest Christian minority ahead of Orthodox Christmas celebrations.
The gunman used a rifle in the attack, shooting at the shop from outside after pulling up on a motorcycle, two security sources said. The attacker fled the scene afterwards.
An image on social media showed the body of what purported to be one of the victims, covered in blood from the waist down.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
Islamic State claimed Friday's attack on a Coptic church in Helwan, east of Giza on Cairo's outskirts and on the opposite side of the Nile river.
Egypt's large Christian minority has increasingly been targeted in recent years by Islamist militants including Islamic State, which is waging an insurgency in the north of the remote Sinai Peninsula.
Sale and consumption of alcohol in Egypt is legal, and it is sold in specialist shops or licensed premises. Some Islamists say it should be banned because it is forbidden by Islam.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani may have to step back from some of his core economic policies in the face of nationwide protests by tens of thousands of people frustrated by high unemployment and stagnant living standards.
The protests, during which at least 10 people have been killed, are fueled by disappointment that the lifting of sanctions on Iran in January 2016 has failed to deliver an economic boom.
Instead, the non-oil part of the economy has continued to struggle, with unemployment officially put at around 12.5 percent - in reality, much higher for Iran's millions of young people - and inflation running at nearly 10 percent.
""There is a crisis of expectations in Iran,"" said Tamer Badawi, a research fellow at the Istanbul-based Al-Sharq Forum. ""It is a deep sense of economic frustration.""
To ease that discontent, Rouhani may need to spend more government money on creating jobs, restrain inflation by supporting the rial exchange rate and do more to eradicate the widespread corruption which angers the protesters.
But all of those actions would involve policy change. Rouhani has been pursuing a conservative budget policy to bring Iran's volatile state finances under control, part of his effort to create an attractive environment for foreign investors. Meanwhile, fighting corruption would risk a backlash from powerful interests hurt by a crackdown.
Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian economist who is head of energy risk analysis at the Betamatrix consultancy in London, said Rouhani faced a ""Herculean challenge"" fighting corruption in particular. But he suggested Rouhani might have no choice.
""People are more and more desperate,"" he said. ""In this situation, there will be periodic outbreaks of dissent.""
SANCTIONS
After taking power in 2013, Rouhani quickly reversed the spendthrift fiscal and monetary policies of his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, curbing a system of cash handouts for lower- and middle-income Iranians. 
Last month he proposed another conservative budget to parliament for the Iranian year starting next March 21. The $104 billion budget was up about 6 percent from the plan for the current year - a cut in real terms at current inflation rates.
Such austerity has become increasingly unpopular among the public as the economy has struggled despite the end of sanctions. Many foreign banks and companies remain reluctant to do business with Iran, partly because U.S. President Donald Trump's hard line on Tehran has deterred trade and investment.
Emadi said a study to which he contributed found Iranians were dissatisfied with the economy for five main reasons: unemployment, weak purchasing power, corruption, a weak rial, and unequal distribution of wealth among Iran's regions.
The study showed their perceptions of the first three areas have worsened this year, he said. In some areas of southeast Iran, unemployment among young people has reached 45 percent and the job market is shrinking, he added.
The rial has sunk to 42,900 against the U.S. dollar from 36,000 a year ago. Rouhani's administration might support the currency by spending more of Iran's foreign reserves, but this would risk deterring foreign investment; the International Monetary Fund warned against such a policy last month.
Emadi blamed much of the economy's poor performance on a deep-rooted structural issue: the influence of paramilitary bodies such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as well as religious institutions on business.
Those interests, which according to some estimates control over 60 percent of assets in Iran, generally do not pay taxes and stifle competition from small private companies, blocking job creation, he said.
Emadi said Rouhani's administration was addressing this problem, pressing institutions to open their books to tax audits and demanding more transparency in the business world.
But Badawi predicted the government would find it hard to secure any quick improvement in the economy.
While it may announce a stimulus package to create jobs, it is unlikely to backtrack on cash handouts, and problems such as diversifying the economy and repairing a debt-burdened banking system can only be solved in the long term, he said.

""My guess is that nothing significant will change. The government will try to be open with people, to propose initiatives, but there are structural problems - diversification, the banking problem and relations with the rest of world, especially Trump.""

OFER PRISON, West Bank (Reuters) - Israel indicted a 16-year-old Palestinian girl on Monday on charges including assault for punching an Israeli soldier in the face two weeks ago, an incident which made her into a hero for Palestinians and was seen as humiliating by right-wing Israelis.
Israel has held Ahed Tamimi since arresting her three days after she was filmed punching the soldier at the entrance to her family home in a village in the occupied West Bank. The confrontation took place after what Israel says was a stone-throwing assault on its troops.
The case has made her into such a potent symbol for Palestinians that a commentator in Israeli left-wing newspaper Haaretz said Israel risked turning her into the ""Palestinian Joan of Arc"".
Right-wing Israelis, meanwhile, have debated whether the soldier had appeared weak by opting not to strike back. The Israeli army said he ""acted professionally"" by showing restraint.
The charge sheet against Tamimi, seen by Reuters, included counts of aggravated assault against a soldier, who the army said was bruised on his brow by her punch, obstructing a soldier in the performance of his duty and throwing stones at troops. 
""Tamimi threw stones at them (the soldiers), threatened them, obstructed them in fulfilling their duty, took part in riots and incited others to take part in them,"" the military said on its public affairs Twitter account.
Qadoura Fares, chairman of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, which advocates on behalf of Palestinians in Israeli jails, said the charges were false.
""Their aim is to terrorize people, and they are trying to deter children and others,” he said.
Tamimi's lawyer, Gaby Lasky, said she was certain some of the charges would eventually be dismissed, but nonetheless prosecutors may seek the maximum penalty for other counts. 
""I am sure they want to keep her as long as possible because they don't want the voice of resistance outside prison,"" Lasky told Reuters at the military courtroom in Ofer prison near the Palestinian city of Ramallah. 
Tamimi was not asked to enter a plea at this stage. The military court gave her lawyer more time to study the charges.
An adult found guilty of assaulting a soldier could be jailed for up to 10 years, but such an outcome would be unlikely for Tamimi as a minor. 
The incident occurred at the entrance to Tamimi’s family home in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh, where weekly protests against Israeli settlement policy have been held for years. Tamimi's father is a prominent Palestinian activist. 

Tamimi made news two years ago when she was pictured biting a soldier who tried to arrest her younger brother. In 2012 she was presented with an award in Turkey and met its president, Tayyip Erdogan, after images of her confronting an Israeli soldier went viral.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California will launch the world's largest regulated commercial market for recreational marijuana on Monday, as dozens of newly licensed stores catering to adults who enjoy the drug for its psychoactive effects open for business up and down the state.
It becomes the sixth U.S. state, and by far the most populous, venturing beyond legalized medical marijuana to permit the sale of cannabis products of all types to customers at least 21 years old.
Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Nevada were the first to introduce recreational pot sales on a state-regulated, licensed and taxed basis. Massachusetts and Maine are on track to follow suit later this year.
With California and its 39.5 million residents officially joining the pack, more than one-in-five Americans now live in states where recreational marijuana is legal for purchase, even though cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under U.S. law.
The marijuana market in California alone, which boasts the world's sixth-largest economy, is valued by most experts at several billion dollars annually and is expected to generate at least a $1 billion a year in tax revenue.
""Adding California to the regulated [recreational] market for cannabis is a really big deal,"" said Heather Azzi, a senior attorney for the Marijuana Policy Project, an advocacy group working to liberalize marijuana laws.
Uruguay became the first and only country to legalize recreational marijuana sales nationally, permitted through its pharmacies starting in July 2017, but is far smaller in comparison, with a population of just 3.4 million.
Still, most California jurisdictions are sitting out the highly anticipated New Year's Day inauguration of recreational cannabis sales.
Many, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, will not be ready for days or weeks because of additional red tape required by city and county governments before would-be retailers can obtain their state licenses.
But business will almost certainly be brisk at newly permitted shops ready on Day One. They number about four-dozen outlets across California, according to an authoritative guide to the cannabis market, GreenState, published by the San Francisco Chronicle.
Stores authorized to carry recreational weed were set to go on New Year's Day in San Diego, San Jose, Santa Cruz, Oakland, Berkeley, Eureka and Desert Hot Springs, among other locales. Hundreds more are expected to open throughout the state as the year progresses.
Many previously operated strictly as medical cannabis dispensaries under a patchwork of local regulations, and will now be licensed by the state for recreational merchandise as well.
Among the very first will be the Oakland-based Harborside dispensary, which has long ranked as the largest U.S. medical marijuana outlet. It planned to opens its doors at 6 a.m. local time on Monday.
Customers in the recreational sector - which state regulators prefer to call the ""adult use"" market - are only permitted to buy an ounce (28 grams) of raw cannabis or its equivalent at a time.
Medical patients can buy unlimited quantities, but must present a doctor's note and have purchased a medical ID card.
The stage for Monday's grand opening was set when voters passed a ballot measure in November 2016, Proposition 64, immediately legalizing personal possession and use of recreational pot by adults 21 and over.
But it has taken California lawmakers and bureaucrats over a year to devise a licensing, regulatory and tax structure for all phases of the commercial distribution chain.

California in 1996 became the first state to legalize marijuana for medical use, and more than 30 states have since done likewise.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2018 12:18PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Pakistan plans takeover of charities run by Islamist figure U.S. has targeted,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's government plans to seize control of charities and financial assets linked to Islamist leader Hafiz Saeed, who Washington has designated a terrorist, according to officials and documents reviewed by Reuters.
Pakistan's civilian government detailed its plans in a secret order to various provincial and federal government departments on Dec. 19, three officials who attended one of several high-level meeting discussing the crackdown told Reuters.
Marked ""secret"", a Dec. 19 document from the finance ministry directed law enforcement and governments in Pakistan's five provinces to submit an action plan by Dec. 28 for a ""takeover"" of Saeed's two charities, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and the Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation. 
The United States has labeled JuD and FIF ""terrorist fronts"" for Lashkar-e-Taiba (""Army of the Pure"" or LeT), a group Saeed founded in 1987 and which Washington and India blame for the 2008 attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people.
Saeed has repeatedly denied involvement in the Mumbai attacks and a Pakistani court saw insufficient evidence to convict him. The LeT could not be reached for comment. 
The Dec. 19 document, which refers to ""Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issues"", names only Saeed's two charities and ""actions to be taken"" against them.
The FATF, an international body that combats money laundering and terrorist financing, has warned Pakistan it faces inclusion on a watch list for failing to crack down on financing terrorism.
Asked about a crackdown on JuD and FIF, Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who co-chaired one of the meetings on the plan, responded only generally, saying he has ordered authorities ""to choke the fundraising of all proscribed outfits in Pakistan"". 
In a written reply to Reuters, he also said Pakistan wasn't taking action under U.S. pressure. ""We're not pleasing anyone. We're working as a responsible nation to fulfill our obligations to our people and international community.""
In response to the Reuters article, JuD spokesman Yahya Mujahid said the organization will go to court if the government decides to take over JuD and FIF.
""We will not keep silent. We will fight a legal battle,"" Mujahid said in statement, terming the government move illegal.
Saeed could not be reached for comment. He has frequently denied having ties to militants and says the charitable organizations he founded and controls have no terrorism ties. He says he promotes an Islamic-oriented government through doing good works.
On Monday, some of the first directives from the proposed crackdown were put in place.
The country's financial regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), issued an order that ""prohibits"" all companies from donating money to Saeed, LeT, JuD, FiF and other groups and individuals who are named on the U.N. Security Council sanctions lists.
In the capital Islamabad, the district magistrate banned proscribed organizations from ""fund-raising in any kind and social, political, welfare and religious activities by these groups"", according to an order reviewed by Reuters.
The two-month ban, which can be extended, was put into place ""to curb the terrorist acts and assistance activities carried out by the proscribed organizations and their subsidiary welfare wings,"" the document said.
 
    FIRST MAJOR MOVE
    If the government follows through with the plan, it would mark the first time Pakistan has made a major move against Saeed's network, which includes 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance services. The JuD and FIF alone have about 50,000 volunteers and hundreds of other paid workers, according to two counter-terrorism officials.
Participants at the meeting raised the possibility that the government's failure to act against the charities could lead to U.N. sanctions, one of the three officials said. A U.N. Security Council team is due to visit Pakistan in late January to review progress against U.N.-designated ""terrorist"" groups.
    ""Any adverse comments or action suggested by the team can have far-reaching implications for Pakistan,"" the official said.
The Dec. 19 document gave few details about how the state would take over Saeed's charities, pending the plans submitted from the provincial governments. It did say it would involve government entities taking over ambulance services and accounting for other vehicles used by the charities. 
It says law enforcement agencies will coordinate with Pakistan's intelligence agencies to identify the assets of the two charities and examine how they raise money.
The document also directs that the name of JuD's 200-acre headquarters, Markaz-e-Taiba, near the eastern city of Lahore be changed to something else ""to make it known that the Government of ""Punjab (province) solely manages and operates the Markaz(headquarters)"".
    The move to seize the charities could spark some concern from the powerful military, which has proposed plans to steer Saeed and the JuD into mainstream politics. The military did not respond to a request for comment. 
In August, JuD officials formed a new political party, the Milli Muslim League, and backed candidates who fared relatively strongly in two key parliamentary by-elections. 
    The JuD publicly disavows armed militancy inside Pakistan, but offers vocal support for the cause of rebel fighters in Indian-administered Kashmir and has called for Pakistan to retake Kashmir. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the disputed region.
    Washington, which has offered a $10 million reward for information leading to Saeed's conviction over the Mumbai attacks, warned Islamabad of repercussions after a Pakistani court in late November released him from house arrest.
Punjab's provincial government had put Saeed under house arrest for 10 months this year for violating anti-terrorism laws.

Writing on Twitter on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States has ""foolishly"" handed Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid over the last 15 years while getting nothing in return and pledged to put a stop to it.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - After a year that saw democracy advocates in Hong Kong jailed and ousted from public office, thousands marched through the streets of Hong Kong on New Year's Day to warn China not to meddle further in the city's affairs and undermine its autonomy.
Over the past year, Hong Kong, a former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, has experienced what critics and pro-democracy activists describe as an intensifying assault on its autonomy by China's Communist Party leaders.
This is despite Beijing's promises to grant the city wide-ranging freedoms including an independent judiciary, under a so-called ""one country, two systems"" framework.
Besides the controversial jailing of several prominent young activists for unlawful assembly over the massive 2014 ""Occupy"" pro-democracy protests, authorities also ejected six pro-democracy lawmakers from the legislature for failing to take proper oaths of office.
The city's reputation as one of Asia's most robust legal jurisdictions has also come under a cloud amidst accusations of a politicization of certain legal cases. 
The protesters, who included many middle-aged and elderly citizens, held up banners and chanted the march's main theme to ""Protect Hong Kong"" during a walk of several kilometers to the city's government headquarters. 
Others decried an unprecedented move by China's parliament last week that said part of a high-speed railway station being built in Hong Kong would be regarded as mainland territory governed by mainland laws.
""We are here to tell the government that we will not give up,"" said Joshua Wong, one of the democracy activists jailed last year, but who is now out on bail pending an appeal.
""We have encountered many difficulties last year, including some of us being sued and jailed, but we will stand with Hong Kong people. We will fight for the rule of law, fight for Hong Kong, fight for the future, fight for the next generations.""
Two protesters who dressed up as People's Liberation Army soldiers said they were concerned about the reach of China's security apparatus. Others called for full democracy as the only lasting means to safeguard the city's way of life. 
The organizers of the march said some 10,000 people had showed up. Police, however, put the figure at 6,200.
The demonstration was largely peaceful, though some protesters who tried to later gather in a forecourt of the government's headquarters skirmished briefly with security guards.
The so-called ""Civic Square"" was where the 2014 pro-democracy protests first kicked off when a group of protesters stormed over a fence and faced off with local police.
Despite the defiance on show, some said they feared Hong Kong would continue to be squeezed by Beijing.
""Everyone's doing what they can,"" said Andy Lau who was among the marchers. ""If we have the right to demonstrate then we should. But I'm not feeling positive. I think things will get worse."" 
The Hong Kong government, in a statement, said it ""fully respects the right of Hong Kong people to take part in processions and their freedom of expression"".

China's leader Xi Jinping has said that while Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy under ""one country, two systems"", Beijing still holds supreme authority over the city and won't tolerate any challenge to its authority.

Francis reminded some 40,000 people who gathered in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) at the Vatican that he had chosen the plight of migrants and refugees as the theme for the Roman Catholic Church's World Day of Peace, which is celebrated every January 1.
""For this peace, to which everyone has a right, many of them are willing to risk their lives in a journey which is often long and dangerous, they are willing to face strain and suffering.""
""Please, let us not extinguish the hope in their hearts, let us not suffocate their hopes for peace!""
Across the world, the mass movement of people has shot to the top of the political agenda, and Francis has made defending those who migrate a central theme of his papacy.
During a trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh last year, he met Muslim refugees and called for decisive measures to solve the political problems that caused many to flee.
He has also criticized President Donald Trump's stated intention to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants.
In a homily earlier on Monday, Francis said everyone should look after their soul by taking a moment of silence every day, ""to keep our freedom from being corroded by the banality of consumerism, the blare of commercials, the stream of empty words and the overpowering waves of empty chatter and loud shouting"".
In a message released in November ahead of the World Day of Peace, Francis said politicians who stoke fear of migrants were sowing violence and racism. He acknowledged that the presence of immigrants can compound existing problems in a country, but appealed for practical ways to be found to welcome newcomers.

On Monday, he said: ""It is important that there is a commitment from everyone, from civil institutions, and those in education, welfare and church organizations, to ensure a peaceful future for refugees, migrants, everyone.""

Compass, with annual turnover of almost 23 billion pounds ($31 billion), employs around 550,000 people around the world providing food services to schools, the armed forces and office workers.
Blakemore, who has worked at Compass since 2012 with roles as both finance director and head of the group's European operations, has a background in accounting. He has also held senior financial roles at British food groups Cadbury and Birds Eye Iglo. 
Compass Chairman Paul Walsh said in a statement: ""The thoughts of everyone at Compass are with Richard's family and friends, and we extend our deepest sympathies to them."" 
""Richard was known and respected for his great humanity and a no-nonsense style that transformed Compass into one of Britain's leading companies,"" he added.
Cousins led Compass over the past 11 years. He was widely credited with turning the company's business around and making Compass into one of the FTSE 100's best-performing firms, and had also been named as one of the world's best-performing CEOs by Harvard Business Review.
He joined  Tesco  (L:TSCO) as an independent director in 2014 at the height of the British supermarket chain's accounting scandal, stepping down from that role at the start of 2017.
The family are believed to have been flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay when the plane crashed, the BBC reported.
Police are working with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to recover the wreckage of the plane, which is submerged in 13 meters of water near Cowan, north of Sydney. A probe into the cause of the crash has begun, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days. Authorities have warned it may take up to a year to find out what happened.
The seaplane was part of the Sydney Seaplanes business that offers sight-seeing trips and has operated since 2005 with no previous record of mishap. Seaplane flights have been canceled until further notice.
Cousins' son William worked at Open Britain, a group campaigning to keep Britain in the European Union single market, and directors and co-workers praised him as an enthusiastic and talented team member.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Fire officials relieved of duty over deadly fire in southern Philippines,"MANILA (Reuters) - Five fire officials being questioned over a blaze that led to the deaths of 37 staff at the southern Philippines offices of an American market research firm have been relieved of their duties, a government investigator said on Monday. 
The Dec. 23 blaze in Davao City broke out at a furniture and fabric store on the third level of a mall, the New City Commercial Center (NCCC), and then engulfed the offices of the U.S. firm, Research Now SSI, on the fourth floor of the same building in choking smoke.
The only person among the 38 killed in the fire who did not work at the firm was a mall security officer. More than 100 SSI employees who were on duty that day managed to escape, of whom six were injured.
Initial findings from a probe showed Leo Lauzon, fire safety inspector of SSI Office, Joel Quizmundo, fire safety inspector of the NCCC Mall, Roger Dumag, chief of the fire safety section of SIR fire station, and Renero Jimenez, station commander of SIR fire station have ""some liabilities"", said Senior Superintendent Jerry Candido, one of the lead investigators.
SIR fire station has jurisdiction over the NCCC mall.
All four were relieved of their duties, Candido told Reuters over phone. A fifth official, Honee Fritz Alagano - Davao City fire marshal and spokeswoman for the Bureau of Fire Protection in the city - has also been relieved of command, he added.
""They were relieved because they are the subject of an investigation and of course to avoid influencing any witnesses in the investigation and possible tampering of documents within their custody,"" said Candido, who is also director of logistics at the Philippines' Bureau of Fire Protection.
Candido earlier said there were indications of fire safety lapses that may have contributed to the tragedy.
The NCCC mall had been issued a fire safety inspection certificate in April 2017, a requirement for its yearly business permit renewal, Candido said, adding investigators would look into whether any questions were raised when it was granted the certificate last year and in previous years. 
""When we conducted a verification inspection (after the fire), we found out there exists several violations of the fire code in the building,"" he said. There are problems with ""exits, sprinkler systems and alarm systems"". 
Darry Gallego, assistant vice president of corporate services at the NCCC, has said the mall could not comment on an ongoing investigation, but stressed that safety requirements had been met, including having a sprinkler system.

Barbara Palmer, SSI's senior vice president for global marketing, said in an email response to a series of Reuters' questions about fire safety at its Davao offices that the firm could not address them specifically while the probe was ongoing.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Kim Jong Un on Monday warned the United States that he has a ""nuclear button"" on his desk ready for use if North Korea is threatened, but offered an olive branch to South Korea, saying he was ""open to dialogue"" with Seoul.
After a year dominated by fiery rhetoric and escalating tensions over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, Kim used his televised New Year's Day speech to declare North Korea ""a peace-loving and responsible nuclear power"" and call for lower military tensions on the Korean peninsula and improved ties with the South.
""When it comes to North-South relations, we should lower the military tensions on the Korean Peninsula to create a peaceful environment,"" Kim said. ""Both the North and the South should make efforts.""
Kim said he will consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics Games to be held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February.
""North Korea's participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to showcase the national pride and we wish the Games will be a success. Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility,"" Kim said.
South Korea said it welcomed Kim's offer to send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Games and hold talks with the South to discuss possible participation.
""We have always stated our willingness to talk with North Korea any time and anywhere if that would help restore inter-Korean relations and lead to peace on the Korean peninsula,"" a spokesman for the presidential Blue House said.
""We hope the two Koreas will sit down and find a solution to lower tensions and establish peace on the Korean peninsula.""
Lee Hee-beom, president of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee, said the organization welcomed participation by the North Koreans. 
""The (organizing committee) will discuss relevant matters with the South Korean government as well as the International Olympic Committee,"" he said in a statement.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said North Korea's participation will ensure safety of the Pyeongchang Olympics and proposed last month that Seoul and Washington postpone large military drills that the North denounces as a rehearsal for war until after the Games.
Moon took office in May last year pledging to engage Pyongyang in dialogue and restore strained ties after nearly a decade of conservative rule in the South.
But North Korea has so far snubbed his overtures for warmer ties, including an offer to hold inter-Korean military talks about ceasing hostile activities along the border, as it tested missiles at an unpredecented pace and lambasted joint military drills between Seoul and Washington. 
Rather than encouraging U.S. measures that ""threaten the security and peace of the Korean peninsula,"" Seoul should instead respond to overtures from the North, and ""stop nuclear war exercises with foreign forces, Kim said.
Asked by reporters to comment on Kim's speech, U.S. President Donald Trump simply said ""we'll see, we'll see"", as he walked into New Year’s eve celebration at Mar-a-Lago, his elite resort in Florida.
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Kim’s New Year’s address.
""REALITY, NOT A THREAT""
North Korea tested intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September in defiance of international warnings and sanctions, raising fears of a new conflict on the Korean peninsula.
After testing what Pyongyang said was its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), capable of delivering a warhead to anywhere in the continental United States, at the end of November, Kim declared his nuclear force complete.
He continued that theme in his New Year's address, announcing that North Korea would focus on ""mass producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment"" in the coming year.
This, Kim said, was ""irreversible with any force"", making it impossible for the United States to start a war against North Korea.
""The whole territory of the U.S. is within the range of our nuclear strike and a nuclear button is always on the desk of my office and this is just a reality, not a threat,"" he said, while emphasizing that the weapons would only be used if North Korea is threatened.
Kim's customary New Year’s speech is closely watched for indications of the policy direction the unpredictable and reclusive leader is likely to pursue in the coming year.
Beyond listing military accomplishments, Kim also outlined economic gains as part of his two-pronged policy of developing his country's economy and military.
Despite increased international sanctions imposed over the weapons program, North Korea made progress in areas like fabrics, shoes and tractors, Kim said.
While Kim is keen to declare his weapons program a success, he is unlikely to completely end his contentious testing regime, said Scott LaFoy, a ballistic missile analyst at the website NK Pro, which monitors North Korea. 
""I'm still very skeptical of the 'complete' thing they've been talking about, if only because we've seen so much activity in regards to the submarine launched ballistic missile program,"" he said. ""I think a slowdown (in testing) is very realistic, though.""
Kim seems likely to tone down his weapons testing at least ahead of the Olympics, said Nam Sung-wook, a North Korea expert at Korea University in Seoul.

""What North Korea is most afraid of is being forgotten in the international arena,"" he said. ""Without launching missiles and conducting a nuclear test, North Korea will be in the spotlight just by attending the Winter Olympics.""

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's detained opposition leader Kem Sokha called for free and fair elections in the Southeast Asian country in a New Year's message on Monday.
Kem Sokha, head of the banned opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was arrested in September.
He is accused of trying to overthrow the government of strongman Prime Minister Hun Sen with American help and of espionage - charges he denies and says are politically motivated.
In a two-page letter read by his daughter Kem Monovithya and posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Monday, Kem Sokha said Cambodia faces losing aid and its export markets abroad as well as condemnation by the international community after the CNRP's dissolution.
""Leave an opportunity for people to choose leadership representatives through an election that is free and fair,"" Kem Sokha said, calling for national unity and non-violence to solve the political crisis.
His message comes amid an ongoing crackdown by Cambodia's government on critics, civil society groups and independent media that rights group say amounts to the destruction of democracy.
Kem Sokha's CNRP was dissolved by the Supreme Court in November at the request of the government. The decision also banned more than 100 opposition lawmakers from politics.
That prompted the European Union and the United States to withdraw their support of the 2018 election.
Cambodia will hold a general election on July 29. Hun Sen has vowed to extend his more than 30 years in power by at least another decade.
Kem Sokha said 2017 was marked by big political crises that led to a ""democracy walked backward."" 
A spokesman from Hun Sen's ruling party, Sok Eysan said there was little interest in Kem Sokha's new year message, adding that opposition politicians could create a new party.
""They have the political rights as citizens ... to create a new party to compete,"" Sok Eysan told Reuters.

A Reuters graphic makes use of data from the U.N. Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) to show hundreds of villages in Rakhine state that were once inhabited by the Rohingya, but have now been burned down.
A total of 354 villages have either been completely or partially destroyed, Human Rights Watch said on Dec. 18.
The data, which was gathered from Aug. 25, the day of the Rohingya militant attack, to Nov. 25, shows burned settlements in an area stretching 110 km (68 miles) from the green hills of Rakhine's northern tip to beaches near the state's capital Sittwe in the south.
See the interactive graphic here: http://tmsnrt.rs/2zGVUmt
Top officials in the United Nations and United States have described the Myanmar military's crackdown as ethnic cleansing. 
Myanmar has denied human rights abuses, saying its military is engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. The military exonerated itself of all accusations of atrocities in an internal investigation, which published its findings on Nov. 13. Myanmar's civilian government has said that the burnings were carried out by Rohingya militants and the Rohingya themselves.

Myanmar’s military did not respond to Reuters’ questions about its role in the alleged atrocities against the Rohingya described in this graphic.

DENVER (Reuters) - A gunman opened fire on sheriff's deputies at an apartment complex near Denver on Sunday, killing one officer before the suspect was shot and killed, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said.
Four other deputies and two civilians were shot and wounded by the suspect, identified as 37-year-old Matthew Riehl, who had had numerous run-ins with the law, according to Sheriff Tony Spurlock.
It was not immediately clear why the incident had escalated, Spurlock said. 
""All of them were shot very, very quickly and they all went down almost within seconds of each other,"" Spurlock told reporters at a news conference, calling it an ""ambush-type"" attack. 
President Donald Trump said on Twitter: ""My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @dcsheriff, and their families.""
The deputies first responded to a ""verbal disturbance"" at the apartment complex in Highland Ranch, about 16 miles (26 km) south of Denver, at about 3 a.m., the sheriff's office said in a statement. 
Two men were in the apartment, and one of them told the officers that the other was ""acting bizarre and may be having a mental breakdown,"" the statement said. The officers left the scene after determining no crime had been committed.
About 5:15 a.m., officers returned after a second complaint. After they entered the residence, the suspect opened fire from a bedroom, killing Deputy Zackari Parrish, 29, and wounding three others. 
Parrish, who was married with two young children, had joined the force seven months earlier.
""When he was shot and went down, the other officers went down right around him and they tried to pull him out, but were unable to because of their injuries,"" Spurlock said. 
At about 7 a.m., a SWAT team entered the apartment and more shots were exchanged. Riehl was killed and a fourth officer was wounded.
All told, Riehl fired more than 100 rounds before he was shot by police.
The injured officers were identified as Mike Doyle, 28; Taylor Davis, 30; Jeffrey Pelle, 32, and Tom O'Donnell 31. They were taken to hospital and were in stable condition.
Pelle, who had emergency surgery, is the son of Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle, according to an online statement from the family. 
The identities of the two injured civilians were not immediately disclosed, but Spurlock said he believed they are residents from other apartments. Their injuries were not life- threatening, he said. 

The housing complex in an affluent suburban community near Littleton is described on its website as ""one of the friendliest apartments"" in the area.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's royal palace warned it would take legal measures against anyone spreading what it said were lies about the ruling family, just days after King Abdullah relieved his brothers from top army posts in a major shakeup.
The king, a staunch U.S. ally, said on Tuesday that his brothers Prince Ali and Prince Faisal and his cousin Prince Talal - who all had high military ranks - would be retiring from the armed forces.
He said the move was part of a reorganization of the armed forces' hierarchy and structure.
Prince Faisal was head of the royal air force and deputy chief of staff, while Prince Ali had for years been in charge of the royal guards responsible for the king's protection.
Talal Bin Mohammad, a Sandhurst graduate who was and an officer in the elite special forces, was also sent into retirement. They were all given honorary promotions.
A palace statement on Sunday said it would pursue legal measures against those who propagated ""lies and false claims"" in social media and online websites with the goal of driving a wedge between the royal family and ordinary Jordanians.
""These fabricated news circulated recently are aimed at undermining Jordan and its institutions,"" the statement said.
A Jordanian army source said the move by the king was prompted by a desire to set an example that the Hashemite ruling family was not above the law ahead of an anticipated move to retire dozens of senior army generals.
The king, who himself is an elite special forces commander, said the restructuring plan aimed to reorganize the 120,000- strong army by cutting costs and creating a more lean and effective force better equipped to modern warfare against terrorist groups. 
The kingdom, which borders both Iraq to the east and Syria to the north and Israel to the west, has escaped relatively unscathed from the regional turmoil around it.
Many of the top army brass are drawn from native Jordanian tribes who form the backbone of the support for the royal family and play a dominant role in the army and government. 
Jordanians see the royal family as a unifying force that holds together a country where many of its citizens are Palestinians whose families settled after successive Arab-Israeli wars, placing the kingdom at the heart of the conflict.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A Costa Rican plane crashed into woodland off a popular tourist beach on Sunday, killing 10 U.S. citizens and two local pilots, the Costa Rican government said.
The accident occurred in the mountainous area off the Punta Islita beach town in the province of Guanacaste, about 230 km (140 miles) west of the capital of San Jose. 
Enio Cubillo, director of Costa Rica's civil aviation agency, said the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft operated by local company Nature Air had crashed minutes after take-off, but that officials had not yet determined the cause of the crash.
The plane had passed a safety inspection about a month ago and was authorized to fly, Cubillo said. Although strong winds in the morning had forced the pilots to alter their itinerary, they had flown safely to Punto Islita to pick up passengers headed to San Jose.
Nature Air said in a statement that it lamented the accident, without explaining the cause. The flight was part of a special charter service for 20 people, relying on two planes. The first plane, carrying 10 passengers, arrived safely in San Jose at 11:40 a.m. The second, with 10 passengers and two pilots, departed 20 minutes later. 
""Regrettably this plane crashed a few minutes after taking off,"" Nature Air said. 
A video of the crash site obtained from Costa Rica's Security Ministry shows orange flames consuming a pile of blackened ruins, with plane parts scattered in an area thick with trees.
Laura Chinchilla, who was president of Costa Rica from 2010 to 2014, said on Twitter that her cousin, one of the pilots, had died in the accident. 
A U.S. State Department official confirmed that multiple U.S. citizens had died, but said the agency would not provide further details out of respect for the affected families. 
""There are no people alive,"" Costa Rica's Security Minister Gustavo Mata said, adding that autopsies would be needed to confirm the total number and identities of victims because their remains were badly burned. 

Punta Islita, on Costa Rica's Pacific Coast, is popular among North American and European tourists for its pristine beaches and lush landscape.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts said on Sunday he would launch a review in 2018 of how the federal judiciary handles sexual harassment, following the recent resignation of a U.S. appeals court judge amid allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and comments. 
In his annual year-end report on the federal judiciary, Roberts said the judicial branch of government was not immune to incidents of sexual harassment and addressing it would be a new challenge in the coming year. 
Allegations of systematic sexual harassment and assault that surfaced against movie producer Harvey Weinstein earlier this year galvanized women to speak out about instances of sexual harassment in the media, government and workplaces across the country.
Earlier this month, renowned San Francisco-based federal appeals judge Alex Kozinski, 67, retired from his lifetime appointment after over a dozen women came forward to accuse him of inappropriate sexual conduct or comments.
In a statement announcing his resignation, Kozinski said that while friends and family had urged him to stay on and defend himself, he could not ""be an effective judge and simultaneously fight this battle."" Reuters has not verified any of the accusations.
""The judiciary will begin 2018 by undertaking a careful evaluation of whether its standards of conduct and its procedures for investigating and correcting inappropriate behavior are adequate to ensure an exemplary workplace for every judge and every court employee,"" Roberts wrote in his report. 
Roberts said he asked the federal judiciary's director of the administrative office to form a working group to examine the courts' practices and recommend necessary changes to codes of conduct, employee guidance on reporting misconduct and its own rules for investigating complaints.
""I am sure that the overwhelming number have no tolerance for harassment and share the view that victims must have clear and immediate recourse to effective remedies,"" he wrote.

511,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2017 05:00PM ET</span>",France's Macron vows to keep up pace of reforms,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron vowed on Sunday to rapidly push through economic and political changes in France over the coming months and said he would seek to jolt Europe into reforming too. 
The televised New Year's speech was the 40-year-old president's first year-end address following his electoral victory in May. Macron made clear he would tackle even potentially thorny domestic issues, like a new immigration law. 
Macron, who left political rivals reeling when he won power barely a year after launching a new centrist movement, has already rattled his way through an overhaul of French labor rules, in spite of street protests and a pushback from unions.
""I will ensure all voices, including contrary ones, are heard. But all the same, I will not stop acting,"" Macron said, seated a marble table in his office at the Elysee Palace. The formula of the speech was largely in keeping with the one favored by many of his predecessors, despite speculation Macron would seek to shake up France's New Year presidential rite of passage too. 
With parties to his left and right divided or scrambling to regroup under new leaders, Macron will benefit from a window of opportunity at home to push through more reforms in 2018 as the opposition flounders, analysts say. 
Macron's popularity ratings have recently recovered from a slump as he tries to carve out an international profile and starts delivering on campaign pledges.
But his next steps also carry risks as he seeks changes that could spawn more of a popular backlash than he has previously faced, including a proposed overhaul of unemployment benefits which aims to tighten conditions for these subsidies. 
Detractors have labeled the former investment banker the ""president of the rich"", and he also faces the challenge of maintaining a grip over his young party.
The French government plans changes in 2018 to immigration laws that have sown unease even among some members of Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) movement. They include a tougher line on deporting migrants who have been refused asylum. 
Macron vowed on Sunday that the country would continue to welcome refugees and immigrants, though he added France could not do so ""without rules.""
An unapologetic pro-European, Macron beat far-right, eurosceptic National Front leader Marine Le Pen in the election run-off and has since sought to kickstart a drive towards greater euro zone integration. 
He appealed on Sunday directly to people across Europe to step up and have more of a say in shaping the future of the European Union and giving it a ""jolt"", including through citizen consultations. 
""We need to recover a European ambition to be a more sovereign, more united, more democratic Europe,"" Macron said. ""I need for us, together, not to give way on anything, neither to nationalists nor to the skeptics."" 

Echoing an address earlier on Sunday by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Macron said Germany and France in particular would strive to work together.

LOD, Israel (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party unanimously urged legislators in a non-binding resolution on Sunday to effectively annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, land that Palestinians want for a future state.
By enacting civilian law over settlements, the move could streamline procedures for their construction and expansion. That land is currently under military jurisdiction and Israel's defense minister has a final say on building there.
The settlers are subject to Israeli civilian law.
""We will now promote the recognition of our sovereignty of the Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank). ... We must begin to enact this sovereignty, we have the moral right and obligation towards our settler brothers,"" Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan told a meeting of Likud's Central Committee.
Netanyahu is not bound to follow the resolution. He did not attend the meeting, which attracted several hundred delegates including ministers, legislators and party officials. The Likud Central Committee is the party's governing body.
At least two previous Likud Central Committee decisions have been ignored by party leaders:
In 2002, it voted against the creation of a Palestinian state, but then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he would act as he saw fit and Netanyahu in 2009 voiced conditional support for the establishment of a Palestinian state in a landmark speech.
Political commentators said the decision might bolster right-wing support for Netanyahu, who could seek a public mandate in an early election as he awaits possible criminal indictments against him on corruption suspicions. He denies wrongdoing. 
Although parliamentary elections are not due until November 2019, the police investigations in two cases of alleged corruption against Netanyahu and tensions among partners in his governing coalition could hasten a poll. 
Most countries view settlements that Israel has built on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war as illegal. Israel disputes that and cites biblical, historical and political links to the West Bank, as well as security interests.
About 400,000 settlers and 2.8 million Palestinians live in the West Bank. The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital.
In 1981, Israel enacted civilian law on the Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria in 1967, a de-facto annexation of the strategic plateau. The move has not won international recognition.

Israeli settlements have been one of the main stumbling blocks in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that have been frozen since 2014. Efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump's envoys to restart them have not yet shown any progress. Trump this month recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, reversing decades of U.S. policy.

At his last public event of the year, an evening vespers service in St. Peter's Basilica, the pontiff said that humanity had ""wasted and wounded"" the year ""in many ways with works of death, with lies and injustices"".
While war was the most obvious sign of ""unrepentant and absurd pride"", many other transgressions had caused ""human, social and environmental degradation"". 
""We must take responsibility for everything before God, our brothers and our creation,"" he said.
While the pope did not mention any specific events from 2017, he had made his voice heard on many of the world's biggest issues over the course of the year.
In April, Francis condemned the ""unacceptable massacre"" of innocent civilians in a chemical weapons attack in Syria. Just a month ago, he visited Myanmar, where more than 600,000 Muslim Rohingya people have been forced from their homes and into neighboring Bangladesh, speaking with authorities in an attempt to mitigate the crisis.
The pope also sought to encourage peace in Colombia during a trip in September and lobbied U.S. President Donald Trump to address climate change issues in May. Amid heightening tensions between North Korea and the West, Francis expressed concern about nuclear arsenals.
At the end of the service, Francis walked across St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ), stopping to shake hands and pose for pictures, as he paid a brief visit to the life-size nativity set up outside.

LONDON (Reuters) - Anti-government protesters demonstrated in Iran on Sunday in defiance of a warning by the authorities of a tough crackdown, extending for a fourth day one of the most audacious challenges to the clerical leadership since pro-reform unrest in 2009.
Police in the center of Tehran fired water cannon to try to disperse demonstrators, according to pictures on social media.
Video posted online also showed a clash between protesters and police in the city of Khoramdareh in Zanjan province in the country's northwest. Reuters was unable immediately to verify the authenticity of the footage.
There were also reports of demonstrations in the cities of Sanandaj and Kermanshah in western Iran as well as Chabahar in the southeast and Ilam and Izeh in the southwest.
Tens of thousands of people have protested across the country since Thursday against the Islamic Republic's unelected clerical elite and Iranian foreign policy in the region. They have also chanted slogans in support of political prisoners.
Demonstrators initially vented their anger over economic hardships and alleged corruption but they took on a rare political dimension, with a growing number of people calling on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down.
Videos showed protesters in central Tehran chanting ""Down with the dictator!"", in an apparent reference to Khamenei.
Protesters in Khorramabad in western Iran shouted ""Khamenei, shame on you, leave the country alone!"".
The government said it would temporarily restrict access to the Telegram and Instagram messaging apps, state television quoted an informed source as saying.
President Hassan Rouhani was due to address the nation on television on Sunday night.
An Iranian reached by telephone, who asked not to be named, said there was a heavy presence of police and security forces in the heart of the capital.
""I saw a few young men being arrested and put into police van. They don't let anyone assemble,"" he said. 
In the northwestern city of Khoy, a video showed a protester being arrested by police while a crowd shouted ""Police, go and arrest the thieves!"". The authenticity of the video, like others, could not immediately be verified.
BREAKING TABOO
Demonstrators also shouted: ""Reza Shah, bless your soul."" Such calls are evidence of a deep level of anger and break a taboo. The king ruled Iran from 1925 to 1941 and his Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown in a revolution in 1979 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic's first leader.
The protests are the biggest since unrest in 2009 that followed the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Demonstrators denounced high prices, corruption and mismanagement. Unemployment stood at 12.4 percent in this fiscal year, up 1.4 points from the previous year. About 3.2 million Iranians are jobless, out of a total population of 80 million.
The demonstrations are particularly troublesome for Rouhani's government because he was elected on a promise to guarantee rights to freedom of expression and assembly.
His main achievement is a deal in 2015 with world powers that curbed Iran's nuclear program in return for a lifting of most international sanctions. But it is yet to bring the economic benefits the government promised.
""Those who damage public property, violate law and order and create unrest are responsible for their actions and should pay the price,"" state media quoted Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli as saying.
Ali Asghar Naserbakht, deputy governor of Tehran province, was quoted as saying by ILNA news agency that 200 protesters had been arrested on Saturday.
Videos posted on social media showed families gathering in front of Evin Prison in Tehran, asking for information about relatives arrested in recent days.
""CARRIED AWAY BY EMOTIONS""
Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said some of the arrested protesters had confessed ""they were carried away by emotions and set fire to mosques and public buildings"", and said they would face heavy punishment.
""After giving thousands of martyrs for the Revolution, the nation will not return to dark era of Pahlavi rule,"" he said.
Police and Revolutionary Guards have in the past used violence to crush unrest. These demonstrations could be more worrying for authorities because they seem spontaneous and lack a clear leader.
No political party had urged Iranians to take to the streets and opposition leaders who galvanized Iranians during 2009 are under house arrest. In addition, the range of slogans suggests discontent with government policies across social classes.
Iran has a dual system of clerical and republican rule, in which each faction vies for control. The supreme leader rules for life and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He also appoints the head of the judiciary and, in all, has more power over foreign and economic policy than the elected president.
Analysts say Iran's leaders believe they can count on the support of many from a generation that took part as youths in the 1979 revolution and the ensuing eight-year war with Iraq to continue to defend the Islamic system, despite their advancing age, because of their ideological commitment and the economic gains they have made under the government.
In apparent response to the protests, the government backed down on plans to raise fuel prices, promised to increase cash handouts to the poor and create more jobs in coming years.
""We predict that at least 830,000 jobs will be created in the new year,"" government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on state television on Saturday night. He gave no details. Around 3.2 million Iranians are jobless.
Protesters also expressed anger over costly interventions in Syria and Iraq, where Iran is engaged in a proxy war for influence against regional rival Saudi Arabia.
Videos on social media showed protesters in the city of Shiraz tearing down a banner of Qassem Soleimani, the powerful head of the Quds Force, the branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' that overseas operations in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.
TRUMP TWEETS
The United States condemned the scores of arrests of protesters reported by Iranian media.
President Donald Trump tweeted: ""The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!""
Trump refused in October to certify that Tehran is complying with its 2015 nuclear deal and said he might terminate the agreement. He also detailed a more aggressive approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for militant groups in the Middle East.
British foreign minister Boris Johnson tweeted that it was ""vital that citizens should have the right to demonstrate peacefully"".

Protesters have attacked banks and government buildings and burned police vehicles. Two demonstrators were shot dead in the western town of Dorud on Saturday night. The deputy governor of Lorestan province blamed foreign agents for the deaths.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of merrymakers are making the annual pilgrimage to New York's Times Square (NYSE:SQ) on Sunday to witness the giant New Year's Eve ball drop at midnight, undeterred by bitter cold and an unprecedented security operation.
The temperature in midtown Manhattan is expected to plunge to about 10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 degrees Celsius) in the waning hours of 2017, with a ""Real Feel"" of 4F (minus 15C), according to AccuWeather.com. 
If forecasts prove accurate, 2017 would match 1962 as the second-coldest New Year's Eve on record. Top honors go to 1917, when the mercury in Times Square dropped to 1F (-17C) and the wind chill came in at -18F (-28C).
Madry Cox, 16, and his sister, Mattison, 19, traveled from Lubbock, Texas, to New York with their father for what he called a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" to see the glittering spectacle that unfolds in Times Square every Dec. 31. 
""It's worth bearing the cold to see the ball drop on New Year's Eve,"" he said. ""It'll be great.""
Mattison Cox said she plans on wearing plenty of clothes, while still managing to look ""a little bit cute,"" and drinking coffee to stay warm.
""I've only seen it in the movies,"" she said. ""It's nice to come witness in person.""
This year, police expect roughly 2 million people to crowd into the general vicinity of Times Square, the bow-tie-shaped plaza formed by the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue in midtown Manhattan. That is roughly the same number as last year, when the temperature at midnight was a comfortable 44F (7C).
A limited number of people will have access to fenced-off viewing areas within the square, giving them an unobstructed view of the giant crystal ball mounted on a pole atop a building at the southern end of the square. 
After hours of waiting, the throng will witness the ball's one-minute descent ending at the stroke of midnight, when a barrage of fireworks and confetti will punctuate the moment. 
""This event every year, New Year's Eve, is one of the things that people all over the country, all over the world, most associate with New York City,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters last week. He said the annual rite of winter was a source of pride for the city and ""a huge, joyous event.""
Revelers will count down the final hours of 2017 with a lineup of musical acts including Nick Jonas and Neil Diamond.
Mariah Carey is returning as well, no doubt hoping to make amends for last year's highly criticized performance marred by technical difficulties. Andy Grammer will perform his hit song ""Fresh Eyes"" and John Lennon's ""Imagine"" just before midnight.
Then comes the ball drop, a tradition that dates to 1907, three years after New Yorkers started gathering en masse in Times Square to usher in the new year.
The lighted ball, actually a geodesic sphere 12 feet (3.7 meters) in diameter and covered by illuminated crystals, will descend 70 feet (21 meters) in the final 60 seconds.
SHOW OF FORCE
Thousands of police will be on hand, some of them heavily armed, others undercover. The show of force is part of a beefed-up security plan that follows a spate of attacks in the city and around the world that authorities have labeled as terrorist. 
The New York Police Department has provided officers with specialized training to stop any suicide bombers in response to an attempted bombing in a Times Square subway station walkway on Dec. 11.
Police will also deploy observation teams trained to spot snipers, increase the number of explosive-detecting dogs and position more officers throughout the area this year.
People who want to see the New Year's Eve musical acts and other entertainment up close in Times Square will have to pass by dogs trained to detect explosives and heavily armed officers, go through a magnetometer to check for weapons, have their bags inspected, and then repeat all those steps a second time.
Police will again use dump trucks filled with sand, police cars and cement blocks to close streets starting at 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) on Sunday. About 125 parking garages in the area will be emptied of all cars and sealed.

Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor, said the attacker had blown himself up as people gathered for the funeral of a former district governor at a cemetery in the city.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which comes days after at least 41 people were killed and more than 80 wounded in a suicide attack on a Shi'ite cultural center in Kabul on Thursday.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, one of the worst in the Afghan capital in months.
Backed by intensive U.S. air strikes, Afghan forces have claimed growing success against the Taliban and other militant groups, including Islamic State, but attacks on civilian targets have continued, causing heavy casualties.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean authorities have seized a Panama-flagged vessel suspected of transferring oil products to North Korea in violation of international sanctions, a customs official said on Sunday.
The seizure was the second to be revealed by South Korea within a few days, as the United Nations steps up efforts to squeeze essential oil supplies to the reclusive North following its nuclear or ballistic missile tests.
The ship, KOTI, was seized at Pyeongtaek-Dangjin port, the official told Reuters, without elaborating, due to the sensitivity of the issue. The port is on the west coast, south of Incheon. 
A marine official also confirmed the seizure, which he said was done ""recently"". 
The KOTI's estimated time of arrival at the port was Dec. 19, according to VesselFinder Ltd., a tracking service provider, 
The ship can carry 5,100 tonnes of oil and has a crew mostly from China and Myanmar, Yonhap News Agency reported, adding that South Korea's intelligence and customs officials are conducting a joint probe into the vessel.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed the probe, declining to provide details. 
""The government has been in close consultations with related countries and ministries to thoroughly implement the sanctions by the U.N. Security Council,"" the spokesman said.
PROPOSED BLACKLISTING 
On Friday, South Korea said that in late November it seized the Hong Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore, which is suspected of transferring as much as 600 tons of oil to the North Korea-flagged Sam Jong 2.
The U.N. Security Council last month unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.
The United States has also proposed that the United Nations Security Council blacklist 10 ships for transporting banned items from North Korea, according to documents seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
The Lighthouse Winmore is one of the 10 ships proposed to be blacklisted. The KOTI does not seem to be included on the list. 
On Thursday, China blocked a U.S. effort at the United Nations to blacklist six foreign-flagged ships, a U.N. Security Council diplomat said.
China's Foreign Ministry, responding to a question from Reuters on the blocking, said Beijing always fully and strictly implemented Security Council resolutions.
""At the same time, any measures taken by the Security Council must have a basis in conclusive and actual proof. China will continue to participate in the work of the relevant Security Council sanctions committee on this principle,"" it said in a short statement, without elaborating. 
China also denied reports it had been illicitly selling oil products to North Korea in defiance of U.N. sanctions, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was unhappy that China had allowed oil to reach the isolated nation. 

Russian tankers have supplied fuel to North Korea on at least three occasions in recent months by transferring cargoes at sea, breaching U.N. sanctions, sources told Reuters.

ROME (Reuters) - Migrant arrivals to Italy by sea fell by a third in 2017 compared to a year earlier, the Interior Ministry said on Sunday, as Libyan authorities helped to slow departures during the second half of the year.
More than 119,000 came to Italy by boat this year after a record 181,000 made the crossing in 2016, the ministry said in a statement. Since July, arrivals have declined by more than two thirds versus a year earlier.
""We were able to govern the flow because we were the first to believe that an agreement with Libya was a turning point,"" Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Corriere della Sera, commenting on the decline.
In February, Italy signed an agreement with the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, promising aid, equipment and training in exchange for its help in fighting people smuggling. The deal was endorsed by the European Union.
Since then, armed groups supported by the Tripoli government have forced smugglers in the city of Sabratha - a key hub on the western coast - to stop sending out boats. Italy has also bolstered the Libyan coastguard's ability to turn back boats.
But rights groups and humanitarian organizations operating rescue ships in the Mediterranean have criticized the policy, saying that it traps migrants in a country where they face appalling treatment, including rape, torture and forced labor. 
While criticized by some, the figures are considered good news for the ruling Democratic Party (PD) ahead of a national election in March. More than 600,000 migrants have reached Italy by boat over the past four years, making immigration a hot-button political issue. 
More than 20,000 are estimated to have died attempting the crossing to Italy, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates, making it the deadliest border for migrants in the world.
But deaths at sea have declined as well, according to the IOM, with 2,833 this year, down more than 38 percent from 4,581 last year.

SRINAGAR (Reuters) - Four Indian paramilitary policemen and two militants were killed in a gunbattle that ensued after militants stormed into a police training center in Kashmir on Sunday, a police official said. 
At least two militants entered the building at around 2:30 a.m. at Letpora, south of Srinagar, Rajesh Yadhav, a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) spokesman told Reuters.
The militants fired indiscriminately and lobbed grenades before heading into the center, Yadhav said. 
He said two militants and four police were killed in the gunbattle.
SN Srinvastav, special director general of the CRPF, said that there could be one or more militants still hiding.
""We hope that we will conclude the operation as soon as possible"", he said.
S P Vaid, director general of Jammu and Kashmir police, said that a search operation was going on, adding that they had received tip-offs about an impending militant strike in the Kashmir for the past three days. 
""They (militants) were trying. They probably could not get a place and time earlier. So, they struck last night,"" Vaid said.
Militants have targeted police camps in Kashmir in recent months. Eight Indian police officials were killed when Jaish-e-Mohammad militants attacked a security camp in southern Kashmir in August.
Indian troops have killed 206 militants this year, Vaid said. Last year's total was 150.
India accuses Pakistan of training and arming militants and helping them infiltrate across the Line of Control that divides Kashmir. Pakistan denies those allegations.
The South Asian neighbors have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part.

The committee said in a statement that the suspect, whose identity has not been disclosed by investigators, ""deliberately made and planted a homemade explosive device"" that exploded on Wednesday at a branch of the Perekrestok supermarket chain in Russia's second city. 
The suspect told investigators he had been motivated by ""hatred toward the organizers and participants"" of mindset training sessions he used to attend, the committee said without providing further detail.
Investigators said the suspect had also hidden two USB drives near the site of the blast containing information about his actions and photographs of the explosive device.
The suspect will undergo psychological testing to assess his sanity. Investigators said has been followed by mental health professionals since the age of 19 for undisclosed issues. The indictment did not say how old he is now.
The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the blast but did not provide evidence to support its assertion. 

The claim came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said the explosion, caused by what investigators said was a homemade bomb packed with pieces of metal, was an act of terrorism.

Catholic activists had called for protests after Sunday mass, one year after Kabila committed to holding an election to choose his successor by the end of 2017 - an election that has now been delayed until December 2018. 
The delay has fueled suspicions Kabila will try to remove constitutional term limits that forbid him from running again. That in turn has raised fears the country will slide back into the kind of civil war that killed millions at the turn of the century.
The two men were killed outside St. Alphonse church in the Matete district of Kinshasa, the capital, according to Ida Sawyer, HRW's Central Africa director.
Police spokesman Pierrot Mwanamputu denied security forces had used live fire during the protests. ""We are operating in the daytime. Everyone is watching us. It's not the night,"" he said.
But a Reuters witness saw two people at a local hospital who had been slightly injured by gunshots in the arm and the leg as they left the St. Joseph church in the Matonge district.
About 50 people were arrested in Kinshasa and at least seven seriously wounded by gunfire, Georges Kapiamba, a human rights activist, said. Another 25 were arrested and three more seriously injured in the southeastern town of Kamina, he said. 
Mwanamputu confirmed the police had arrested protesters who had barricaded roads and set tires alight but did not know how many. 
At the Paroisse Saint Michel in Kinshasa's Bandalungwa district, security forces fired teargas into the church, creating panic, opposition leader Vital Kamerhe, who was present at the mass, told Reuters. 
SECURITY FEARS
The police have banned demonstrations and said that all gatherings of more than five people would be dispersed to ensure public order. Across Kinshasa, police and soldiers searched vehicles and checked passengers' identifications.
Authorities also on Saturday ordered all internet and SMS services cut until further notice.
At the Notre Dame du Congo cathedral in Kinshasa's Lingwala district, where opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi was attending mass, dozens of police and soldiers blocked the path of more than 100 opposition supporters as they prepared to try to march.
Tshisekedi, however, who had backed the activists' call to march, left the church in a vehicle, spurring angry shouts from the crowd, which said he was abandoning them. 
At another church in the working-class district of Barumbu, a few dozen police officers used teargas and stun grenades against some 300 churchgoers, who waved bibles and sang religious songs as they tried to march, a Reuters witness said.
Some 40 percent of Congo's population is Roman Catholic and the Church enjoys rare credibility with the public, even though its leadership has not formally backed the protests.

Turkey said on Saturday the decision by a Greek asylum board undermined relations between the two countries. The soldier was one of eight who fled after the July 15 coup attempt.
It also accused Athens of harboring ""coup plotters"", a charge Greece denies. The countries are at odds over a host of issues from ethnically split Cyprus to sovereignty over airspace, but their relations had improved in recent years.
The asylum board rejected the applications by the other seven soldiers, and the Greek government has appealed the decision to grant the soldier asylum and sought its annulment. But it says the country's judiciary is independent.
""Our faith in democratic principles and practices is not a weakness, but a source of strength,"" the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday.
""Democracies do not threaten, or can be threatened,"" the foreign ministry said. 
""On the contrary, they work responsibly and methodically to promote understanding and entrench stability and good neighborly relations. Greece will continue this path ...and hopes its neighbors will do the same.""

The eight soldiers had flown by helicopter to Greece in the early hours of July 16, 2016, as the attempted coup against Erdogan crumbled. They had denied involvement in the attempt.

The raids by the anti-terrorist branch of the Istanbul police took place on Saturday and targeted four locations across the city, the police said in a statement on Sunday. They did not give the nationalities of the foreign suspects.
The state-run Anadolu news agency said the suspects were believed to have been planning an attack during New Year's Eve celebrations in the city.

Several Australian media reported that four of the victims were British nationals, although that was not immediately confirmed by police. In London, the Foreign Office said its officials were in contact with local authorities in Sydney.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A group of Polish mountaineers set off for northern Pakistan on Sunday to start an attempt to be the first to scale K2, the world's second highest peak, in wintertime.
K2, in the Karakorum mountains along the border between China and Pakistan, is notorious for high winds, steep and icy slopes - and high fatality rates for climbers. In winter months, scant snowfall means the summit approach can turn into bare ice.
More than 70 people have died climbing the peak, many of them at the Bottleneck, where a wrong step can send a climber hurtling off the South Face, where bodies are unlikely to be recovered.
Team member Adam Bielecki, 34, told Reuters that the chance to make history is a ""strong motivation"" for the Polish group.
Polish climbers have written a ""beautiful chapter"" of exploring peaks of more than 8,000 meters (26,247 feet), and scaling K2 in winter would ""the last chapter of this book"". 
The Polish team comprises 13 mountaineers led by Krzysztof Wielicki, 67, who in 2003 headed a winter expedition of K2, which was unable to clear the 8,000 meter threshold.
K2, slightly shorter than Mount Everest, is 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) high.
Wielicki told Reuters that his team would begin their ascent on Jan. 8 or 9 and, if successful, expect to return to base camp by mid-March.
Pakistan is a hot destination for climbers. It rivals Nepal for the number of peaks over 7,000 meters (22,966 feet) and in all, it has five of the world's 14 summits higher than 8,000 meters. 
Bielecki said the group expects to be away from home for around three months.
""If you ask me what's the hardest part of the expedition or what I fear the most, it's actually the separation from my family,"" he said.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2017 12:10AM ET</span>",Probe into deadly fire at U.S. firm’s Philippines offices focuses on possible safety lapses,"By Neil Jerome Morales
DAVAO CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - A government investigator into a blaze that led to the deaths of 37 staff at the southern Philippines offices of an American market research firm says there are indications of fire safety lapses that may have contributed to the tragedy.
The Dec. 23 blaze in Davao City broke out at a furniture and fabric store on the third level of a mall, the New City Commercial Center (NCCC), and then engulfed the offices of the U.S. firm, Research Now SSI, on the fourth floor of the same building in choking smoke.
The only person among the 38 killed in the fire who didn’t work at the firm was a mall security officer. More than 100 SSI employees who were on duty that day managed to escape, of whom six were injured.
Initial evidence from an ongoing investigation by Philippine government agencies indicates sprinkler systems on the 3rd and 4th floors of the building weren't working as their valves were closed, said Senior Superintendent Jerry Candido, who is director of logistics at the Philippines’ Bureau of Fire Protection and one of the lead investigators into the fire.
Candido said that Research Now SSI employees may have been unaware of the fire beneath them for some time because their office had its own alarm that was not connected to the system used by the mall. “That explains why people inside the SSI were not aware that fire is happening just below their floor,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
His comments are the most extensive yet made publicly on the progress of the investigation.
In a statement issued in the United States on Friday, Research Now SSI said it is working with the authorities involved in the probe into the fire and is “confident that an impartial investigation will reveal that it has complied with all the security and safety requirements required by law"".
“We are focused on helping our employees and the victims’ families, and cooperating with the government agencies, over the coming weeks and months,” said the firm’s CEO Gary Laben.
Privately-held Research Now SSI is the result of a merger between Plano, Texas-based Research Now and Shelton, Connecticut-headquartered Survey Sampling International, which had operated the Davao call center, only three days before the fire. The merged company’s major shareholders are the private equity firms Court Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Partners and HGGC.
Darry Gallego, assistant vice president of corporate services at NCCC, said the mall could not comment on an ongoing investigation, but stressed that safety requirements had been met, including having a sprinkler system.
“The mall had passed through all the needed safety examinations and was certified by the authorities as being safe to operate and serve the public,"" Gallego said in an email.
    
INSPECTION CERTIFICATES 
Candido cautioned that the investigation is still some way from being completed and it has yet to reach firm conclusions, particularly on the issue of liability.
SSI, which rented the offices from NCCC, needed to have its own operating sprinkler system to get its annual fire safety inspection certificate, which was in turn required for its yearly business permit renewal, Candido said.
Investigators will look into whether there were any questions that came up when NCCC and SSI were granted these certificates this year and in previous years, he said.
NCCC last got the certificate in April 2017 and SSI in September 2017, according to Honee Fritz Alagano, Davao City fire marshall and spokeswoman for the Bureau of Fire Protection in the city. That was after passing the Davao City Bureau of Fire Protection’s annual inspections, she said.
Candido said it was the responsibility of both building owners and tenants to make sure that alarm and sprinkler systems were installed and operating. Under the nation’s fire code, if there were two alarm systems they should be integrated so that the mall’s would have triggered SSI’s, and vice-versa.
Barbara Palmer, SSI's senior vice president for global marketing, said in an email response to a series of Reuters' questions about fire safety at its Davao offices that the firm could not address them specifically while the investigation is ongoing.
Gallego from NCCC also declined to comment on specific safety issues.
    
STRUCTURAL QUESTIONS 
Candido said investigators are also looking at whether the ceiling material in the call center was flammable but haven’t drawn any conclusions yet.
He also said that the investigation was looking at some major structural questions concerning the SSI offices and how they related to the rest of the mall – issues that may not have put anyone in breach of regulations.
For example, while SSI’s fire exits would have passed inspection, only one of them had stairs leading directly outside the building. The others, he said, headed back into the mall. These areas quickly filled up with smoke making them useless as a means to escape, he said.
Indeed, the position of the offices in the mall may have put them at high risk as the smoke from a fire elsewhere in the building would be funneled toward the offices, Candido said.
""When fire occurred in any part of the mall, SSI will be fully engulfed. That explains why the exits were not used because they were cut off by the smoke,” he said.
Candido separately told reporters that initial findings indicated the fire was caused by an electrical problem in the ceiling at the furniture and fabric store, exacerbated by the failure of the sprinkler system on that same floor.
He also said the Research Now SSI records showed that the firm’s latest fire drill was poorly attended. He did not say when the exercise took place. ""Out of hundreds of personnel, less than 10 participated,"" he said, adding that three of those died in the blaze.
NCCC's Gallego and SSI's Palmer declined to comment on Candido's assertions.
Alagano, the fire marshall, said that soundproofing in SSI’s offices meant that staff may not have heard the alarm go off in the mall. She also said it is clear that some employees went to their lockers to get their mobile phones before trying to evacuate, wasting precious time.
The probe will also be looking at how long it took the mall to call the fire brigade. Alagano said the fire likely started some time between 9.40 a.m. and 9.48 a.m., but the fire service database showed it didn't get the call until 10.05 a.m and firefighters arrived five minutes after that.
BUSINESS PROCESSING BOOM
SSI says it has operations across the world and more than 3,500 market research, consulting, media, healthcare and corporate clients. It had about 500 employees at the Davao operation.
It is part of the Philippines' $23 billion business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. That is a vital source of jobs and foreign exchange, providing incomes key to driving what is one of Asia's fastest growing economies, though wages for call center workers are low at around $3,000-$5,000 a year, depending on location and experience.
The sector employs about 1.15 million people providing services to mostly international firms, with the United States its biggest market. The industry expects that to grow to 1.8 million people by 2025 amid plans to expand beyond its mainstay call center services.
Reuters reached out to numerous SSI employees in Davao in person and via their social media accounts but none of them agreed to be interviewed.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who was Davao's mayor for 22 years and was credited with boosting its economy by luring BPO firms, has promised relatives of victims that the truth will come out.

532,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2017 09:09PM ET</span>","New year could bring record low temperatures to U.S. Midwest, East Coast","(Reuters) - Bitterly cold weather will usher in the new year for much of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains this weekend, bringing record low temperatures to the Midwest, making travel difficult and putting a chill on New Year's Eve celebrations.
The mercury in New York City's Times Square (NYSE:SQ) was expected to drop to about 10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 Celsius) with a wind chill at nearly 0 F (minus 18C) during the final hours of 2017, the National Weather Service said, testing the willpower of hundreds of thousands of New Year's Eve revelers. 
In the heartland, next week could bring low temperatures last recorded 130 years ago to parts of Nebraska, said David Eastlack, a meteorologist with the weather service. That includes a record low for the date of minus 22F (minus 30C) for Tuesday.
""The bitter cold is going to be dangerous,"" he said in a phone interview, warning residents of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa to avoid venturing outside or taking a car trip. He said that the wind chills will be near minus 35F (minus 37C), a level when frostbite could set in within 10 minutes.
The weather service predicted lows would hit minus 20F to minus 30F (minus 7C to -34C) from Montana into the Dakotas and Minnesota, well below average.
Temperatures could drop to around 0 F (minus 18C) as far south as the northern border of Oklahoma on New Year's Day, and into the minus 30s near the Canadian border on Sunday and Monday, the service said. 
The arctic air from Canada will also bring subfreezing temperatures to U.S. Gulf Coast cities such as Biloxi, Mississippi. 
Icy roads will make travel difficult over much of the United States, from the south-central states of Texas and Oklahoma and eastward over Arkansas, northern Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama through the New Year's weekend, the private AccuWeather forecasting service said.

Weather was expected to remain much more mild on the West Coast, with temperatures forecast in the low 70s in Los Angeles over the next few days.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2017 04:57PM ET</span>","Street protests hit Tehran, 2 demonstrators reported killed in western Iran","DUBAI (Reuters) - Street protests hit Iran for a third day running on Saturday, spreading to the capital Tehran with crowds confronting police and attacking some state buildings, and a social media report said two demonstrators had been shot dead in a provincial town.
The wave of anti-government demonstrations, prompted in part by discontent over economic hardship and alleged corruption, are the most serious since months of unrest in 2009 that followed the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Saturday's protests, in fact, coincided with state-sponsored rallies staged across the Islamic Republic to mark the final suppression of the 2009 unrest by security forces, with mass pro-government events in Tehran and Mashhad, Iran's second city.
Pro-government rallies were held in some 1,200 cities and towns in all, state television reported.
At the same time, anti-government demonstrations broke out anew in a string of cities and in Tehran for the first time where protesters confronted and stoned riot police around the main university, with pro-government crowds nearby. 
Videos posted on social media from the western town of Dorud showed two young men lying motionless on the ground, covered with blood, and a voiceover said they had been shot dead by riot police firing on protesters.
Other protesters in the video chanted, ""I will kill whoever killed my brother!"" The video, like others posted during the current protest wave, could not be immediately authenticated.
In earlier footage, marchers in Dorud shouted, ""Death to the dictator,"" referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Social media video from Mashhad showed protesters overturning a riot police car and police motorcycles set ablaze.
In Tehran, the semi-official news agency Fars said up to 70 students gathered in front of its main university and hurled rocks at police, also chanting, ""Death to the dictator.""
Social media footage showed riot police using clubs to disperse more protesters marching in nearby streets, and arresting some of them. The student news agency ISNA said police shut two metro stations to prevent more protesters arriving.
In Tehran and Karaj west of the capital, protesters smashed windows on state buildings and set fires in the streets.
Images carried by the semi-official news agency Tasnim showed burning garbage bins and smashed-up bus shelters in the street lining the university after the protests subsided.
Brigadier-General Esmail Kowsari, the Revolutionary Guards' deputy security chief in Tehran, said the situation in the capital was under control and warned protesters would face ""the nation's iron fist"" if unrest persisted.
""If people came into the streets over high prices, they should not have chanted those (anti-government) slogans and burned public property and cars,"" Kowsari told ISNA.
The United States condemned the scores of arrests of protesters reported by Iranian media since Thursday.
President Donald Trump tweeted, ""The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.""
State media quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi as saying in response to an earlier Trump tweet criticizing the arrests: ""The Iranian people see no value in the opportunistic claims by American officials and Mr. Trump.""
Iranian media also reported street protests in the cities of Kashan, Arak, Ahvaz, Zanjan, Bandar Abbas and Kerman.
The elite Revolutionary Guards and its Basij militia, which spearheaded the security crackdown that crushed the protests of 2009, said in a statement carried by state media: ""The Iranian nation ... will not allow the country to be hurt."" 
DISCONTENT
Openly political protests are rare in the Islamic Republic, where security services are omnipresent.
But there is considerable discontent over high unemployment, inflation and alleged graft. Some of the new protests have turned political over issues including Iran's costly involvement in regional conflicts such as those in Syria and Iraq.
Joblessness has risen and annual inflation is running at about 8 percent, with shortages of some foods contributing to higher prices and hardship for many families. 
Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli warned against attempts to promote protests via social media.
""We ask people not to take part in unlawful gatherings. If they plan a gathering they should apply (for a permit,"" he told the Young Journalists Club news website.
On Thursday, hundreds of people took to the streets in Mashhad, one of the holiest places in Shi'ite Islam, to protest against high prices, shouting anti-government slogans. Police arrested 52 people, according to a judicial official.
An unnamed official quoted by state broadcaster IRIB's website said on Friday IRIB had not covered the protests so far ""after being asked by relevant bodies that the issue should not be reflected on state radio and television"".
MOST DETAINEES FREED
Most of those arrested in the last two days had been released, state television said, without giving details.
""Enemy websites and foreign media continue to try to exploit economic hardships and the legitimate demands of the people in this respect to launch illegal gatherings and possible unrest,"" it said.
Though purely political protests are seldom seen in Iran, demonstrations are often held by workers over lay-offs or non-payment of salaries and by people who hold deposits in non-regulated, bankrupt financial institutions. 
President Hassan Rouhani’s leading achievement, a 2015 deal with world powers that curbed Iran’s nuclear program in return for a lifting of most international sanctions, has yet to bring the broad economic benefits the government says are coming. 

Unemployment has risen to 12.4 percent this fiscal year, according to the Statistical Center of Iran, up 1.4 percentage points and leaving about 3.2 million Iranians jobless.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2017 04:37PM ET</span>",Congo orders internet and SMS cut ahead of anti-government demonstrations,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's government on Saturday ordered telecommunications providers to cut internet and SMS services across the country ahead of planned anti-government demonstrations.
Grassroots Catholic activists have called for marches in major cities on Sunday to demand that President Joseph Kabila commit to not changing the constitution to stand for a third term and release political prisoners.
Kabila was required by the constitution to step down in December last year when his mandate expired but an election to replace him has been repeatedly delayed and is now scheduled for December 2018.
Security forces killed dozens of protesters during anti-Kabila demonstrations last year, and deteriorating security has led to fears of renewed civil strife in Congo, where millions of people died in civil wars around the turn of the century.
""It is for reasons of state security,"" telecommunications minister Emery Okundji told Reuters. ""In response to violence that is being prepared ... the government has the duty to take all measures to protect Congolese lives.""
Okundji wrote a letter to telecoms providers ordering them to suspend internet and SMS services by 6 p.m. in the capital Kinshasa (1700 GMT) until further instruction, although some users still had access more than two hours later. 
Congolese authorities have banned Sunday's demonstrations, which have been backed by most opposition leaders, and warned that all gatherings of more than five people will be dispersed. 
A series of appeals by opposition leaders for protests this year have been easily suppressed by security forces but the Catholic activists' call has managed to unite nearly all of Congo's fractious opposition. 
Some 40 percent of Congo's population is Catholic and the church enjoys rare credibility with the public, even though its leadership has not formally backed Sunday's protests.
On Dec. 31 last year, Kabila's ruling majority and opposition leaders struck a deal that allowed Kabila to stay in power beyond the end of his mandate but required that the election to replace him be held by the end of 2017. 
The country's electoral commission, however, later said that was not possible and scheduled the vote for Dec. 23, 2018. 
Congo's government also cut internet and SMS service during anti-government demonstrations in January 2015 and more recently ordered limits to certain social media access, one of more than a dozen African governments to have done so in the past two years.

Among the regional crises the two leaders plan to discuss, there would be a particular focus on Syria as well as on the Palestinian situation, the source said, weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
The move stirred concern among Western allies and outrage in the Arab World. 
Erdogan earlier this week made some of his harshest comments in weeks regarding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, calling him a terrorist and saying it was impossible for peace efforts in Syria to continue if he did not leave power.
Macron, meanwhile, said recently that France would push for peace talks involving all parties in the six-year-old Syrian conflict, including al-Assad, and promised ""initiatives"" early next year.
The Elysee source said ""the question of human rights will also be raised"" when Erdogan and Macron meet. 

A security crackdown in Turkey after a failed coup in 2016 has drawn criticism from campaigners as well as the European Union, which is overseeing Ankara's halting bid to join the bloc.

The election failed to resolve Spain's biggest political crisis in decades with pro-independence parties taking 70 of 135 seats in the Catalan parliament but not managing to gain a majority of the popular vote.
""The ballot boxes have spoken, democracy has spoken, everyone has been able to express themselves. What is Rajoy waiting for in order to accept the results?"" said Puigdemont, speaking from Brussels where he is in self-imposed exile.
Catalonia had demonstrated it was a democratically mature population that had won the right to become a republic, he said in a televised speech. He asked Rajoy to start negotiating with independence leaders.
Puigdemont traveled to Brussels after being fired by Rajoy as leader of the wealthy region following an October declaration of independence by Catalonia. The region held an illegal referendum on secession from Spain on Oct. 1. 
Rajoy called on Friday for the Catalan parliament to be formed on Jan. 17, the first step in what is likely to be a drawn-out process to form a government. 
However, it is not clear how pro-independence forces will form an administration with Puigdemont in Brussels facing arrest in Spain for his role in organizing the referendum and former deputy Oriol Junqueras held in custody in a Madrid jail. 
Rajoy urged on Friday for a regional administration to be formed as soon as possible that would listen to all Catalans and not just half of them.
The Dec. 21 election, called by Rajoy after Madrid took over the region's local administration, failed to deliver a strong mandate to any party and underlined how Catalan society is evenly split into pro-independence and unionist camps.
Anti-independence party Ciudadanos (""Citizens"") scored most votes in the election but does not have enough seats or allies to form a government.

CAIRO (Reuters) - At an hour that Sama'an Farag usually spends leisurely sipping his morning tea, the doorman at the Mar Mina Coptic Church near Cairo found himself springing up to close the doors upon hearing gunshots and the sound of ricocheting bullets.
Inside, dozens of children at Sunday school, held on Friday morning to coincide with Egypt's weekend, were rushed upstairs out of the range of the gunfire.
""Imagine children from kindergarten to high school, they were all still inside the church. God forbid if he (gunman) had entered the church - there would have been many more victims,"" said churchkeeper Saad Saeed. 
The gunman fired at the church and a neighboring Christian-owned shop on Friday, killing at least 11 people, security and church sources said. The attack was later claimed by Islamic State militants via their news agency Amaq.
""I heard that there was a paralyzed man who was killed with his wife. We felt sad for him, the other people, and the policeman who was killed,"" Farag said.
The police conscript who had stood alongside Farag and the other doormen behind the massive gates was killed by gunfire. 
Islamist militants have claimed several attacks on Egypt's large Christian minority in recent years, including two bombings on Palm Sunday in April and a blast at Cairo's largest Coptic cathedral in December 2016 that killed 28 people.
The country has fought an insurgency led by Islamic State in the Sinai Peninsula that has killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen since the Egyptian military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013 - although no official death toll has been released to date.

Police have stepped up security measures around churches ahead of Coptic Christmas celebrations on Jan. 7, deploying officers outside Christian places of worship and setting up metal detectors at some of the bigger churches.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Former German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble urged Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and Social Democrats on Saturday to quickly form a new government, but said he could not rule out a minority government if no deal is reached.
Germany's constitution does not favor a minority government but that remains an option, Schaeuble, a leading conservative who is now president of the Bundestag (lower house of parliament), told Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper.
A deal between Merkel's conservative camp (Union) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) is her best chance of securing a fourth term in office. But Merkel's possible coalition partners are angling for concessions beforehand.
""A stable alliance between the Union and the SPD would be preferable,"" Schaeuble said, adding that the chancellor could still form a minority government. ""It would work one way or another,"" he said when asked about that possibility.
Coalition talks should be completed ""sooner rather than later,"" he said, noting that the Bundestag was not fully capable of action until a government had been formed.
He noted that President Frank-Walter Steinmeier - who stepped in after Merkel's talks with two smaller parties collapsed in November - had urged conservatives and the SPD to reach an agreement as soon as possible, and said Merkel and other politicians had supported that call.
Horst Seehofer, head of the CSU Bavarian sister party of Merkel's conservatives, told DPA news agency a new ""grand coalition"" should be completed by Easter, which falls on April 1 in 2018.
Seehofer said he favored new elections over a minority government.
MERKEL'S STATURE WANING
A new poll conducted for Die Welt newspaper showed waning support for Merkel, who has been unable to form a new government three months after national elections. Her talks on forming a three-way coalition with the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats fell apart in November. 
The poll showed that 46 percent wished Merkel would resign immediately as chancellor, with an additional 17 percent of those polled saying that she should quit if the coalition talks with the SPD also failed.
A separate poll conducted for Bild am Sonntag newspaper showed that 33 percent of Germans trusted Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen to replace Merkel as leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), followed by Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere with 32 percent, if Merkel resigned.
FDP leader Christian Lindner told Bild am Sonntag newspaper that Germany's political system was in the middle of a major transition, and many conservatives also favored a ""renewal.""
Simone Peter, one of the co-leaders of the Greens, told the Funke newspaper chain she hoped a stable new government could be formed, and that new elections should be ""the absolute last resort."" She said the Greens remained open to dialogue if Merkel's talks with the SPD failed.
SPD members on Saturday rejected a call by the CSU to raise military spending that could strain exploratory talks about a coalition that are due to start on Jan. 7.
A draft CSU resolution seen by Reuters on Friday called for military spending to reach NATO's target of two percent of economic output and rejected the idea of an ""ever closer"" European Union backed by SPD leader Martin Schulz.

SPD deputy leader Ralf Stegner said on Twitter that his party was focused on spending for families, education, health care and education.

Greece's administrative court of appeal will now look into the case.
Eight Turkish soldiers fled to Greece following Turkey's abortive July 2016 coup. Seven of them applied for asylum and were rejected, but have been kept in preventive custody.
Angered by a decision to grant asylum to the eighth soldier by the Greek asylum service committee, a panel of judges and experts, Turkey said earlier in the day that the move would affect bilateral relations and cooperation.
Athens said it was following its standing position regarding the eight soldiers, ""as it has been repeatedly expressed, also in public"", a government official said.
The Greek government has said that it does not support coup plotters and that the country's justice system is independent.
A Greek police official said the soldier who was granted asylum would be released from custody.
""By granting asylum to one of eight coup plotters involved in the July 15 coup, Greece has once again showed that it is a country that protects and embraces coup plotters with this decision,"" Turkey's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Greek courts have blocked two extradition requests by Turkish authorities, drawing an angry rebuke from Ankara and highlighting the tense relations between the NATO allies, who remain at odds over various issues.
During his visit to Greece earlier this month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara did not want Greece to turn into a safe haven for coup plotters.
The two neighbors teetered on the brink of war in 1974, 1987 and 1996 over long-running disputes over ethnically divided Cyprus, mineral rights in the Aegean Sea and sovereignty over uninhabited islets in the Aegean.
Since the attempted coup, Turkish authorities have jailed around 50,000 people pending trial while more than 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military, public and private sectors.

Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies say they fear President Tayyip Erdogan is using the failed coup as a pretext to crush all dissent. The Ankara government says its security measures are necessary to fight the threats it is facing.

(Reuters) - A 25-year-old Los Angeles man was arrested in the city on suspicion of making a hoax phone call that led a police officer in Kansas to kill an unarmed man at a home where the caller said hostages were being held, authorities said on Saturday.
The arrest of Tyler Barriss took place on Friday afternoon, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department said, following the killing of a 28-year-old father as he stood at the front door to his Wichita home on Thursday evening. 
The officer shot the Kansas man minutes after arriving at the residence in response to the call, Wichita Deputy Police Chief Troy Livingston said, describing the shooting ""as a tragic and senseless act."" 
Authorities said the call was an example of ""swatting,"" in which a caller falsely reports an emergency that requires a police response, usually by Special Weapons and Tactics, or SWAT, teams.
Barriss was being held without bond in the Los Angeles County jail system on Saturday on a fugitive warrant from Kansas and will not appear in court until Tuesday at the earliest, city police spokesman Mike Lopez said. 
Los Angeles County jail records listed no lawyer for Barriss.
In the 911 call that Wichita police released on Friday, a man could be heard saying that his parents had been arguing.
""I shot him in the head, and he’s not breathing anymore,” the man said.
The man then told the 911 operator that he was holding a handgun on his mother and little sister, had doused the house with gasoline and was thinking of torching it.
Wichita police officers surrounded a house on the city's west side, Livingston said. 
""A 28-year-old male opened the front screen door and stood in the doorway or just outside that doorway,"" he said. ""Officers gave him several verbal commands to put his hands up and walk towards them.""
A police officer shot once after the man quickly raised his hands and appeared to point a weapon at the officers, Livingston said. 
Police found no one dead, injured or taken hostage inside the house, he said. 
Family members told the Wichita Eagle newspaper that Andrew Finch, who was the father of two children, was the man killed. 

""The person who made the phone call took my nephew ... two kids’ father,"" Finch’s aunt, Lorrie Hernandez-Caballero, told the paper. ""How does it feel to be a murderer? I can’t believe people do this on purpose.""

HARARE (Reuters) - His wife is a beauty queen, his troops unseated Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe, and his motorcade is fit for a president. General Constantino Chiwenga, head of the armed forces until earlier this month, is on a roll.
On Dec. 15 his 10-vehicle convoy, complete with soldiers toting AK-47 assault rifles, roared into a congress of the ruling ZANU-PF party. It was one of several displays of power by Zimbabwe's generals since they helped oust Mugabe, the southern African nation's ruler of 37 years, on Nov. 21.
Ostensibly Chiwenga, 61, is subordinate to the veteran politician who replaced Mugabe as president: Emmerson Mnangagwa, nicknamed the Crocodile. Mnangagwa, 75, was sworn in on Nov. 24 and promised to hold elections in 2018.
But since Mugabe was deposed and Mnangagwa installed, moves by senior military men have suggested the president is the junior partner in an army-dominated administration. Following a month of speculation about his role in Mnangagwa's government, Chiwenga was named vice president on Dec. 23. He was also appointed defense minister on Dec. 29, so retaining control of the military.
That perception of Mnangagwa's disempowerment is buttressed by reports seen by Reuters from inside Zimbabwe's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO). ""The generals have tasted power and they are not willing to let it go,"" reads one intelligence report, dated Nov. 29. ""They want to enjoy the fruits of removing Mugabe from power.""
Another report, from Nov. 22, described the backroom negotiations to form a post-Mugabe government. ""Chiwenga is the one going to have final say as power is in his hands. He is now the most feared man in government and party as well as the whole country,"" it said.
The documents reviewed by Reuters are the latest installments in a series of hundreds of intelligence reports the news agency has seen from inside the CIO dating back to 2009. Reuters has not been able to determine their intended audience, but the documents cover every aspect of Zimbabwean political life over the last eight years - Mugabe, the top echelons of his ZANU-PF party, the military, opposition parties and the white business community.
In the dying days of Mugabe's regime, the CIO – the principal organ of Mugabe's police state – split into two factions. One served the interests of Mnangagwa, the other those of his main political rival, Grace Mugabe, the president's 52-year-old wife, according to several Zimbabwean intelligence sources.
Much of the content of the CIO reports has turned out to be correct, including an intelligence finding reported by Reuters in September that the army was backing then vice-president Mnangagwa to take over from Mugabe.
Army spokesman Overson Mugwisi did not respond to requests for comment on behalf of Chiwenga. However, a senior general appointed to Mnangagwa's post-Mugabe cabinet, Air Force chief Perrance Shiri, said there was nothing wrong in having military men in government.
""Who says military people should never be politicians?"" he told reporters at a lunch to celebrate the cabinet's inauguration on Dec. 4. ""I am a Zimbabwean. I've got every right to participate in the country's politics.""
Mnangagwa did not reply to an interview request for this article and his spokesman, George Charamba, did not respond to a request for comment. Mnangagwa's lawyer, Edwin Manikai, said the president wanted to ""work with anybody who adds value to the economy,"" in line with the new leader's stated desire to halt Zimbabwe's precipitous economic decline under Mugabe.
""DEMOCRATIC CORRECTION""
Mugabe's removal started with soldiers entering Harare on Nov. 14 and announcing in the early hours of Nov. 15 that they had taken control. Military vehicles took to the streets and gunfire and explosions were heard in parts of the capital. ""It is not a military takeover of government,"" said General Sibusiso Moyo, reading a statement on TV.
The generals dubbed their project ""Operation Restore Legacy."" They called the move a ""democratic correction"" against a 93-year-old leader whose decisions, they alleged, were being manipulated by an ambitious wife half his age. Reuters was unable to contact Grace Mugabe for comment.
Since his appointment, Mnangagwa has promised to rebuild relations with the West, to protect foreign investors and to hold elections.
""I intend, nay, am required, to serve our country as the president of all citizens, regardless of color, creed, religion, tribe or political affiliation,"" he said after being sworn in. The voice of the people was the ""voice of God.""
But for many Zimbabweans, actions speak louder than words.
On Dec. 4, Mnangagwa appointed Shiri, the Air Force chief, to the post of minister of agriculture. Moyo, the general who had announced the military's intervention, became foreign minister.
""Mnangagwa has got the reins but he cannot operate outside the generals that put him in office,"" said Martin Rupiya, a Zimbabwean professor at the University of South Africa in Pretoria and an expert on the Zimbabwe military.
On Dec. 6, Foreign Minister Moyo publicly overruled Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa, a civilian lawyer, as he outlined the financial terms of a Chinese loan for Harare airport.
""You should tell the reporters not to include the terms,"" Moyo told Chinamasa, wagging his finger at him and the reporters gathered at the finance ministry for the announcement.
Chinamasa said the incident was the result of a misunderstanding and did not reflect military muscle-flexing. Moyo did not respond to a request for comment.
Ever since a guerrilla war against colonial Britain and white-minority rule in the 1960s and 1970s, Zimbabweans have been used to the army and intelligence services playing a covert role in politics. But to many Zimbabweans, the appointment of military men to the cabinet was a shock.
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change reminded the ruling party in a statement on Dec. 18 that ""members of the security services are bound by the Constitution not to operate as political activists of any political party.""
Tendai Biti, finance minister in a 2009-2013 unity government, expressed concern at ""the obvious militarization"" of the Zimbabwean state. ""You cannot make a direct transition from the barracks to public office. We believe citizens should have that right to choose their representatives,"" he said.
International Crisis Group analyst Piers Pigou said the ""deployment of serving senior military officers removes the last pretence of non-military bias in Zimbabwe's politics. This is vintage wine in a camouflage decanter.""
AMERICA AND CHINA
If there were overt military rule, it could complicate Mnangagwa's efforts to get Zimbabwe's economy back on its feet, some Western diplomats say. Since the seizure by the Mugabe regime of thousands of white-owned commercial farms after 2000, Zimbabwe's GDP has almost halved and the banking system has endured a meltdown that saw inflation top out at 500 billion percent in 2008. To kick-start growth, Mnangagwa will need to clear $1.8 billion of arrears with multilateral lenders such as the World Bank. He will also have to attract private investors.
""These things don't happen overnight, and they have to really show they will implement what they say they will do. That is key,"" said Christian Beddes, the Zimbabwe representative of the International Monetary Fund.
Britain's foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, told Reuters on Nov. 29 that Britain could extend a bridging loan to help Zimbabwe clear World Bank and African Development Bank arrears, but such support would depend on ""democratic progress.""
U.S. Ambassador Harry Thomas avoided the term ""coup"" to describe Mugabe's overthrow, referring to it as a ""military intervention."" Thomas said Mnangagwa's administration should be judged by its performance - most notably whether it manages to hold credible elections next year. He was speaking on Dec. 6, two days after the cabinet was sworn in.
China too is an interested party. It has significant investments and loans outstanding in Zimbabwe and long ties to Mugabe, Mnangagwa and Chiwenga.
In early November, after Mugabe had sacked Mnangagwa for plotting against him, Mnangagwa met Chiwenga in China, said two sources familiar with the general's movements. Chiwenga also met Chinese Defence Minister Chang Wanquan, and the pair even discussed tactics to be used in the coup, according to two sources familiar with the talks. Beijing did not respond to a request for comment. Its Foreign Ministry has previously described Chiwenga's visit as a ""normal military exchange mutually agreed upon by China and Zimbabwe.""
Speaking at a signing ceremony for the Harare airport loan in December, Chinese ambassador Huang Ping said China's government would ""continue to support the Zimbabwean government in their economic development.""
GOLFING GENERAL
For Chiwenga, quitting as armed forces chief on Dec. 18 was the first time he had stepped out of uniform in more than four decades.
An ethnic Karanga like Mnangagwa, Chiwenga joined Mugabe's Chinese-backed ZANLA guerrilla army in the early 1970s. He received his training in Mozambique, where he learned Portuguese, as well as in Tanzania and China. As part of Mugabe's close-protection unit in Mozambique, Chiwenga had regular exposure to Zimbabwe's fiercely intellectual future leader, from whom the soldier acquired a respect for education and a keen nose for politics, according to a senior regional intelligence source who knows Chiwenga.
After independence in 1980, Chiwenga managed to thrive in the dangerous world of Zimbabwe's security forces.
According to a 2014 domestic media report of his divorce settlement with his first wife, Jocelyn, he owned, among other things, properties in Harare’s exclusive Borrowdale Brooke neighborhood, an apartment in Malaysia, a safari company, a fleet of luxury vehicles and a jewelry collection that included 40 gold watches, 45 sets of diamond earrings and a tiara. Chjiwenga has not commented on the report, which Reuters was unable to verify independently, and an army spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Asked about the report, Chiwenga's ex-wife Jocelyn said, ""You seem to have all the information already so what more do you want?"" 
Chiwenga's name has been linked to several of the darkest chapters of Zimbabwe's history. In 2003 he, Mnangagwa and Mugabe were among 77 Zimbabweans sanctioned by the United States for allegedly undermining ""democratic processes"" and causing ""politically motivated violence"" in elections the previous year. Mugabe's administration denied committing human rights violations and rejected the sanctions as an example of international bias against his rule.
Chiwenga was also a senior figure in the western region of Matabeleland in 1983 during the so-called Gukurahundi massacres, in which the army's North Korean-trained 5 Brigade cracked down on supporters of Mugabe's liberation war era rival, Joshua Nkomo. An estimated 20,000 ethnic Ndebele, including women and children, were killed. Chiwenga was not directly involved, but as commander of 1 Brigade in the city of Bulawayo, he provided ""logistical support"" to the operation, according to the 2017 book Kingdom, Power, Glory by Australian researcher Stuart Doran that draws on recently declassified diplomatic and defense archives. Shiri, now minister of land and agriculture, was 5 Brigade's commander at the time; Mnangagwa was minister of state security.
In a 2016 interview with Britain's New Statesman magazine, Mnangagwa dismissed allegations he was a Gukurahundi ""enforcer,"" saying these were smears peddled by political opponents. An army spokesman did not respond to a request for comment by Chiwenga or Shiri about their role in Gukurahundi. As career military officers, they have rarely given interviews and are not known to have commented on the massacres.
Chiwenga was head of the army in 2008 when troops removed thousands of artisanal miners from the Chiadzwa diamond fields in the eastern district of Marange. Before the army moved in, Marange had been open to small-scale local operators. According to Human Rights Watch, at least 200 people were killed, and the army then went on to use forced child labor and torture in running the fields for its own benefit. An army spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
In Mnangagwa, most of whose career has also been spent in security or intelligence, Chiwenga has a formidable rival. But - at 14 years Mnangagwa's junior – Chiwenga has time to play the long game for himself and his comrades in arms.

""The generals want Mnangagwa to run for one or two terms before handing over to Chiwenga,"" the Nov. 29 intelligence report reads. ""They want Chiwenga to be in power for two terms before handing over to the next general to be announced.""

544,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2017 02:20PM ET</span>","Erica Garner, activist daughter of New York chokehold victim, dies at 27","(Reuters) - Erica Garner, the daughter of a New York man whose death during an attempted arrest helped spark the “Black Lives Matter” movement against police brutality, died on Saturday, a posting on her official Twitter account showed.
Garner, 27, suffered a heart attack triggered by an asthma attack a week ago, family members told the New York Daily News. 
She became an activist against police brutality after the July 2014 death of her father, Eric Garner. The 43-year-old father of six died while New York City officers were attempting to arrest him on suspicion of selling loose cigarettes. Eric Garner also suffered from asthma. 
""If anything, (what) she would want us to do in memory of her is keep fighting for justice, and keep fighting for families,"" said civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton in a video posted online. Sharpton became an adviser to Eric Garner's family after his death.
Erica Garner often wore clothing emblazoned with ""I can't breathe,"" the words her father wheezed when an officer allegedly put him in a chokehold while trying to subdue him. 
That phrase became a rallying cry during protests across the United States in 2014 against police brutality, particularly against black people.
The New York Police Department has banned the use of chokeholds on suspects for more than two decades, but decided against indicting Daniel Pantaleo, the white officer who sought to subdue Garner. Activists say the prosecutor in the case, a Republican, was not aggressive enough in seeking the indictment.
A video of the incident went viral on social media in the days after it occurred in front of a beauty parlor in one of New York City's five boroughs, Staten Island.
After the grand jury's decision, the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association union released a statement from Pantaleo saying he never intended to harm Eric Garner and felt bad about his death.

Boubeye Maiga is expected to form a new government in the coming day after his predecessor Abdoulaye Idrissa Maiga and his entire cabinet resigned on Friday.
Idrissa Maiga did not give a reason for his resignation but he is widely expected to either manage Keita's campaign for next year's election or to run in Keita's place. 
The new government will be the fifth to serve under Keita since his election in 2013. Usually fewer than half the ministers appointed to a new government have served in the previous cabinet. 
Boubeye Maiga hails from Gao in Mali's north, where Islamist militants regularly attack soldiers, U.N. peacekeepers and civilians. They have increasingly used the region as a launchpad for attacks into neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2017 01:30PM ET</span>","President-elect Weah says Liberia 'open for business', vows to fight corruption","By Edward McAllister
MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberian President-elect George Weah on Saturday declared the country open to investment and pledged to tackle entrenched corruption, in his first speech to the nation since decisively winning an election this week.
Speaking in front of reporters and aides packed into a small conference room at his party headquarters, Weah thanked his predecessor, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, for enabling Liberia's first democratic transition in over 70 years but said he was determined to usher in sweeping changes.
""Those looking to cheat the Liberian people through corruption will have no place,"" said Weah, 51, alluding to a series of high-profile scandals that have tarnished Johnson Sirleaf's 12-year presidency.
Weah, a former soccer star who became the only African to win FIFA World Player of the Year in 1995, scored a landslide victory over Vice President Joseph Boakai in Tuesday's run-off. 
He faces sky-high expectations from his base of young supporters, who want him to fix rampant unemployment and poverty, but deep scepticism from others who see him as lacking the experience and knowledge for the job. 
His campaign was thin on policy specifics and he will now be faced with the messy realities of reviving an economy gutted by low prices for chief exports rubber and iron ore and dwindling foreign donor support.
Weah said he would assemble his cabinet in the coming days ahead of his inauguration in mid-January and work to expand the country's revenue base. ""To investors, we say Liberia is open for business,"" he said. 
He also urged Liberians overseas - whose remittances account for over a quarter of national GDP - to return home, calling for national unity in a country that was devastated by civil war from 1989 to 2003 and remains riven by divisions based on ethnicity, class and political affiliation.
""We are not enemies,"" he said in comments addressed to his political opponents. ""We welcome you with open arms as we try to build our country.""
""Two days ago the world watched me cry. I did not cry because I won. I cried that many people lost their lives in the struggle for change.""
The speech was closely followed across the country of five million people. 
""The main thing I took from him was that Liberia is open for business,"" said John Davies, a 30-year-old businessman. ""We need Liberians to come home and work for our country.""

547,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2017 01:00PM ET</span>","Egypt security forces kill three suspected militants, arrest 10 others","CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian security forces killed three suspected militants in an exchange of gunfire at a farm they believed to be a militant hideout on the outskirts of Giza, the interior ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
""The three killed were some of the leading figures that supervise the manufacturing of explosives and the carrying out of terrorist operations,"" the statement said.
Security forces arrested 10 others in the provinces of Qalyoubia, north of the capital, and Fayoum, some 60 km south of Cairo, confiscating a variety of explosive devices, automatic weapons, and other items.
The statement said the raids came as part of efforts by the authorities to pre-empt any attacks by militant groups ahead of Christmas and New Year celebrations and clamp down on members of Hasm, a group linked to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.
Hasm, a group that emerged last year and has claimed several attacks on security forces, including the fatal shooting of a policeman and injuries to three others in the province.
Egypt accuses Hasm of being a militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's oldest Islamist movement which Cairo outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this and says it strives only for peaceful political change.
An insurgency led by Islamic State militants in Egypt's rugged Sinai Peninsula has killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen since the Egyptian military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013 - although no official death toll has been released to date.
But in recent months, attacks have increasingly moved to the mainland, targeting Coptic Christians as well as security officers and checkpoints in and around major Egyptian cities.
A gunman killed at least 11 people on Friday in attacks on a Coptic Orthodox church and a Christian-owned shop near Cairo before he was wounded and arrested. IS later claimed the attack, though it provided no evidence for the claim.

548,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2017 12:40PM ET</span>","As Peru president faced impeachment, jailed Fujimori worked to save both","By Mitra Taj and Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - Last week, as Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski scrambled to survive a bid in Congress to oust him in the wake of a graft scandal, his jailed authoritarian predecessor Alberto Fujimori called on his loyalists in Congress to save the head-of-state.
The day before the vote and during hours of debating, Fujimori received prison visits or spoke on the phone with at least seven of the 10 lawmakers who broke party ranks to keep Kuczynski in office, according to prison records and interviews with two of the lawmakers this week.
Legislator Maritza Garcia said it was Fujimori's gentle warning that toppling the president would destabilize the economy that cemented her decision. Bienvenido Ramirez said Fujimori encouraged him to cast a vote of conscience. 
""He told us to trust our hearts ... that the country hung in the balance,"" Ramirez told Reuters.
Kuczynski ended up surviving the vote with the help of the 10-strong rebel faction, led by Fujimori's 37-year-old lawmaker son Kenji.
Three days later, Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori.
Kuczynski's decision sparked unrest, resignations, and prolonged the biggest political crisis this century in Peru, a top metals exporter that has enjoyed a fast-growing economy, relative stability and significant strides in development in recent years.
The power that Fujimori wielded from his prison cell - just days before being rushed to the hospital on the eve of the pardon - could be pivotal to Kuczynski as he seeks to rebuild his government.
""We're going to follow the guidance of ex-president Fujimori. He's experienced and has profound knowledge of the political world,"" Garcia said, calling Fujimori her party's ""maximum leader.""
Fujimori's son Kenji has courted ties with Kuczynski's government as he has challenged his sister Keiko's leadership of the rightwing opposition party that controls Congress. The two siblings are widely seen as potential president contenders in 2021.
Kuczynski expects the group of 10 rebel lawmakers, led by Kenji, to grow to about 30 under Fujimori's influence now that he is a free man - splitting Keiko's bloc in half, a government source who asked not to be named told Reuters.
The new bloc in the 130-member Congress could help center-right technocrat Kuczynski, a former Wall Street investor, govern for the rest of his term, after a tumultuous 17 first months in office that were marked by clashes with Keiko's supporters.
Already, support for him has rebounded. In an Ipsos poll published in local daily El Comercio on Saturday, Kuczynski's approval rating rose 7 points from two weeks ago to 25 percent, even as 63 percent saw the pardon as the result of a political deal to save his own skin.
It was unclear if Fujimori's lifeline to Kuczynski might evolve into a full-fledged alliance between the two 79-year-olds.
Garcia and Ramirez deny their votes were part of a quid pro quo, and surrogates for Kuczynski and Fujimori have repeatedly defended the pardon as justified on medical and humanitarian grounds.
""This was the exclusive decision of the president. At no point was it about a deal with Kenji or Alberto Fujimori,"" Kuczynski's office said.
Prime Minister Mercedes Araoz stressed that Kuczynski had openly talked for months about evaluating a humanitarian pardon for Fujimori, and finally took the decision on Christmas Eve after Fujimori was hospitalized for what his doctor described as life-threatening blood pressure and heart problems.
'POLITICAL PARDON'
But Fujimori's opponents - who, since the pardon, are now also Kuczynski's opponents - said Kuczynski walked into a trap.
""Our president just gave himself away to the biggest mafia in Peru's history,"" said Marisa Glave, one of several leftist lawmakers calling for Kuczynski to resign. ""He's now Fujimori's hostage.""
Fujimori, who remained in hospital in stable condition on Saturday, governed Peru with an iron fist from 1990-2000.
While many consider him a corrupt and ruthless dictator, others credit Fujimori with pulling Peru from economic ruin and quashing a leftist insurgency. The Ipsos poll showed 56 percent of Peruvians favor the pardon.
Kuczynski's decision, which cleared Fujimori's convictions for graft and human rights crimes less than halfway through his 25-year prison sentence, has been slammed by human rights advocates as an insult to Fujimori's victims and a blow to the global fight against impunity.
Some activists and lawyers say the process via which Kuczynski granted the pardon was secretive, riddled with irregularities and could be revoked by courts.
""A humanitarian pardon isn't an absolute right of the president. It must be reasoned logically and can't violate fundamental rights,"" said Jo-Marie Burt, a political scientist at George Mason University and senior fellow at human rights group the Washington Office on Latin America.
Pardons have been revoked in Peru before.
A television tycoon convicted of taking bribes from Fujimori's spy chief was pardoned in 2009 after claiming to be gravely ill. But he was sent back to prison a year later after being found out and about in town and in good health.
The pardon for Fujimori was approved in 13 days, after Kuczynski received a recommendation from a three-member medical board that included one of Fujimori's personal physicians. 
Experts said the process was unusually fast and lacking in transparency.
""No humanitarian pardon, even for those requested by prisoners suffering terminal illnesses, start and finish so quickly,"" said Roger Rodriguez, the former head of the pardons commission who quit his most recent ministerial post as human rights director in protest.

""This was no humanitarian pardon. It was a political pardon,"" said Rodriguez. ""There are elements here to challenge its validity in court.""

549,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2017 12:40PM ET</span>",Raid on senator's home reveals divisions in Somali security forces,"By Abdi Sheikh and Feisal Omar
MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Masked men who appeared to be members of the Somali security forces raided the house of a powerful Somali senator on Saturday, but the government initially said it did not know who they were, fuelling political tensions. 
Senator Abdi Hassan Awale Qaybdiid is a former militia leader, chief of police, minister and regional head. Now he heads the constitutional committee in parliament and the upper house. 
The attack on his home underscores the lack of clear lines of command and control within Somali forces as top officials ordered an urgent enquiry into who authorized the raid. 
The weak, U.N.-backed government is fighting an al-Qaeda linked Islamist insurgency. But the fight has been hampered by its inability to control its fledgling national security forces, largely recruited from clan militias and put through training by other nations. 
""Government forces broke into my house, they beat the guard with butts and took his gun,"" Qaybdiid told reporters at his home on Saturday. ""They broke all the doors of my rooms and my cupboards... My wife was in the toilet by then. They broke the toilet while she was inside it.""
""Immediately after my house was stormed, the head of Mogadishu's national security forces called me saying the forces that attacked my house were the military forces trained by the United Arab Emeritus. But an investigation will prove who they were,"" Qaybdiid said angrily.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE), along with Turkey, Britain, the United States and others have all given Somali soldiers training. A spat between the Gulf states, especially Qatar and the UAE, has fueled political divisions in Somalia. 
Earlier this month, security forces killed five people in a raid on the home of a powerful opposition leader perceived to be close to the UAE. Officials accused him of trying to overthrow the government. The raid exacerbated tensions between some of Somalia's powerful clans; the opposition leader was released although a court case against him continues.
But the government said it had not ordered Saturday's raid on Qaybdiid, who is from the same clan as the opposition leader. Somalia’s military commander, General Abdiweli Jama Gorod, said he had ordered an urgent investigation. 
""The entire government is disappointed. It was not something that was expected. We believe the forces and those who ordered them had ulterior motives,"" he said. ""I assure you that those who were behind the attack will be found and punished.""
Witness Mohamed Nur told Reuters, ""The forces that went into the senator's house had dark greenish uniform and masks of the same color. They were many. As they went in, six pickups blocked the nearby alleys...there was no gunfire. The six pickups looked new but I could not make out which type of government soldiers they were.""
Two security sources later told Reuters that 40 soldiers who had been trained by the UAE had been arrested for the attack. One source said two intelligence officials were also arrested. The soldiers' arrests were also reported on a government-run website, although without attribution.

The court tried four other people in absentia and handed them four-year sentences on the same charges, the sources said.
El-Massry was detained in Egypt’s second largest city along with activist Moatasim Medhat at a court hearing in November, ahead of the ruling. 
She can appeal against the sentence.
The plan to cede the islands to Saudi Arabia was announced last year and has become mired in political protest and legal action.
Opponents of the plan say Egypt’s sovereignty over the islands dates back to 1906, before Saudi Arabia was founded.
Saudi and Egyptian officials say the islands belong to the kingdom and were only under Egyptian control because Riyadh had asked Cairo to protect them in 1950.

The FSB said the suspect was detained on Saturday, but it did not provide details of the person's identity or location.
""The suspect has been handed over to Russia's Investigative Committee for further investigative procedures,"" the FSB said in a statement. 
Investigators said they had begun questioning the suspect.
The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the blast, which took place on Wednesday in a St. Petersburg branch of the Perekrestok supermarket chain. The group did not provide any evidence for its assertion.
The claim came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said the explosion, caused by what investigators said was a homemade bomb packed with pieces of metal, was an act of terrorism.
Russia has repeatedly been the target of attacks by Islamist militant groups, including one in April that killed 14 people when an explosion tore through a train carriage in a metro tunnel in St. Petersburg.

That attack was claimed by a militant group which said the suicide bomber was acting on the orders of al Qaeda. Russian police detained several suspects from mainly Muslim states in ex-Soviet central Asia.

Six women in a jail in the eastern province of Elazig went on hunger strike on Nov. 10, to protest against a rule obliging them to wear an ID while outside their living quarters, the Bar association said. Four more women joined them on Dec. 10.
The Diyarbakir Bar said the prisoners were losing weight and starting to have serious health problems. Prison officials were not available over the weekend to comment on the women's condition.
The Bar association said women who did not comply with the rule that was recently implemented were ""not allowed access to meetings outside the ward, hobby activities, communication, ventilation and meetings with their lawyers.""
A request by one of the hunger strikers to have the rule rescinded was rejected on the grounds that it ""prevented escape and averted disorder"".
The Bar did not specify why the women had been imprisoned and it was not available to comment on Saturday. 
Diyarbakir, which borders Elazig to the south, is the biggest city in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast.
Violence erupted between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in 2015, after the collapse of a ceasefire. The PKK, which has waged an insurgency against the state since the 1980s, is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and the European Union.

The man in the post office was concerned about the recent prisoner exchange between the Ukrainian authorities and pro-Russian separatists and thought more prisoners should have been released, Bekh said, adding police did not know what he wanted.
Ukraine and the separatists swapped hundreds of prisoners on Wednesday in the biggest such exchange since the outbreak of a conflict in the eastern Donbass region that has killed more than 10,000 people.

554,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2017 07:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russian tankers fueled North Korea via transfers at sea - sources,"By Guy Faulconbridge, Jonathan Saul and Polina Nikolskaya
LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian tankers have supplied fuel to North Korea on at least three occasions in recent months by transferring cargoes at sea, according to two senior Western European security sources, providing an economic lifeline to the secretive Communist state.
The sales of oil or oil products from Russia, the world's second biggest oil exporter and a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council, breach U.N. sanctions, the security sources said.
The transfers in October and November indicate that smuggling from Russia to North Korea has evolved to loading cargoes at sea since Reuters reported in September that North Korean ships were sailing directly from Russia to their homeland.
""The Russian vessels made transfers at sea to the North Koreans,"" the first security source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. The source said the transfers of oil or oil products took place on several occasions and were a breach of sanctions.
A second source, who independently confirmed the existence of the Russian ship-to-ship fuel trade with North Korea, said there was no evidence of Russian state involvement in the latest transfers. 
""There is no evidence that this is backed by the Russian state but these Russian vessels are giving a lifeline to the North Koreans,"" the second European security source said.
In comments carried by Russia’s RIA Novosti state news agency on Saturday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the country was observing sanctions against North Korea. 
The two security sources cited naval intelligence and satellite imagery of the vessels operating out of Russian Far Eastern ports on the Pacific but declined to disclose further details to Reuters, saying it was classified.
The Russian Customs Service declined to comment when asked on Wednesday if Russian ships had supplied fuel to North Korean vessels. The owner of one ship accused of smuggling oil to North Korea denied any such activity.
SATELLITE DATA
The U.S. State Department, in a statement, called on Russia and other U.N. members to ""strictly implement"" sanctions on North Korea and to work ""more closely together to shut down U.N.-prohibited activities, including ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum and the transport of coal from North Korea"".
The latest report came as China, responding on Friday to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, denied it had illicitly shipped oil products to North Korea.
North Korea relies on imported fuel to keep its struggling economy functioning. It also requires oil for its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear program that the United States says threatens the peace in Asia.
""The vessels are smuggling Russian fuel from Russian Far Eastern ports to North Korea,"" said the first security source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Reuters was unable to independently verify that the vessels had transferred fuel to North Korean vessels, whether the Russian state knew about the sales or how many Russian vessels were involved in the transfers. It was also unclear how much fuel may have been smuggled.
Ship satellite positioning data consulted by Reuters and available on Reuters Eikon shows unusual movements by some of the Russian vessels named by the security sources including switching off the transponders which give a precise location. 
The security sources said the Russian-flagged tanker Vityaz was one vessel that had transferred fuel to North Korean vessels.
The Vityaz left the port of Slavyanka near Vladivostok in Russia on Oct. 15 with 1,600 tonnes of oil, according to Russian port control documents. 
Documents submitted by the vessel's agent to the Russian State Port Control authority showed its destination as a fishing fleet in the Japan Sea. Shipping data showed the vessel switched off its transponder for a few days as it sailed into open waters. 
According to the European security sources, the Vityaz conducted a ship-to-ship transfer with the North Korean Flagged Sam Ma 2 tanker in open seas during October. 
Reuters could not independently verify the transfer as ship tracking data showed that the Sam Ma 2 had turned off its transponder from the start of August. 
The owner of the Russian vessel denied any contact with North Korean vessels but also said it was unaware that the vessel was fuelling fishing boats.
OIL PRODUCTS
Yaroslav Guk, deputy director of the tanker's owner, Vladivostok-based Alisa Ltd, said the vessel had no contacts with North Korean vessels.
""Absolutely no, this is very dangerous,"" Guk told Reuters by telephone. ""It would be complete madness.""
When contacted a second time, Guk said the vessel did not have any contacts with North Korean ships and that he would not answer further questions.
An official at East Coast Ltd, the vessel's transport agent, declined to comment.
Two other Russian flagged tankers made similar journeys between the middle of October and November, leaving from the ports of Slavyanka and Nakhodka into open seas where they switched off their transponders, shipping data showed. 
In September, Reuters reported that at least eight North Korean ships that left Russia loaded with fuel this year headed for their homeland despite declaring other destinations, a ploy that U.S. officials say is often used to undermine sanctions.
A Russian shipping source with knowledge of Far Eastern marine practices said North Korean vessels had stopped loading fuel in Russia's Far Eastern ports but that fuel is delivered at sea by tankers using ship-to-ship transfers, or even by fishing vessels.
China on Friday denied reports it had been illicitly selling oil products to North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was unhappy that China had allowed oil to reach the isolated nation.
China's denial came a day after it blocked a U.S. effort at the United Nations to blacklist six ships Washington believes had engaged in illicit trade with North Korea, a U.N. Security Council diplomat said.
According to documents seen by Reuters this month, the United States had proposed that the U.N. Security Council blacklist 10 ships for illicit trade with North Korea.
It accused the vessels of ""conducting illegal ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels or illegally transporting North Korean coal to other countries for exports.""

Three North Korean ships among the 10 were blacklisted, along with a Panama-registered vessel.

The commission this week barred Navalny from taking part in the March 18 vote because of a suspended prison sentence he says was trumped up.
Navalny, who did not attend the Supreme Court hearing, wrote on Twitter that he and his supporters ""will not recognize elections without competition"" and renewed calls for a boycott of the vote. 
Polls indicate that President Vladimir Putin, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for 18 years, is on course to be comfortably re-elected, but Navalny says his own exclusion from the vote makes a farce of the ballot.

Navalny, who has organized some of the biggest anti-government demonstrations in years, has been jailed three times this year and charged with breaking the law for organizing public meetings and rallies.

Hainan gang leader Huang Tuwang was sentenced to 25 years for gang activity dating back to 2005, while other members were sentenced to terms between 12 months and 23 years for a range of crimes, Xinhua said.
Chinese courts have sentenced several large mafia-style criminal gangs this year, often for offences involving gambling which is illegal in China. 
Huang Tuwang oversaw a range of illegal businesses including massage parlors, unlicensed lending outfits and casinos, forming ""unlawful control"" over certain regions and industries, said the report.
The gang, which went by the name ""Moon Help"", was made up of more than 40 members and frequently recruited students and school drop outs, it said.

Of the 6 billion euros ($7.20 billion) agreed upon in two deals in 2015 and 2016, only 1.78 billion euros has been transferred to Turkish ministries and international organizations responsible for implementing the projects, the ministry said in a statement. 
""While Turkey has used more than $30 billion of its national funds for the needs of Syrians who have been in Turkey for approximately seven years, a substantial amount of the 3 billion euros promised by the EU in Nov. 2015 has effectively not been used in the field.""
Of the 1.78 billion euros transferred so far, it said 1.3 billion went to international organizations, 270 million to the Ministry of Education, 120 million to the Ministry of Health, and 12 million to the Ministry of the Interior.
Yet that did not equate to the funds being actively used to meet the needs of Syrian refugees, the ministry said.
""Unfortunately, the spending mechanism of the EU funds are not working fast,"" it said. 
In the past, Turkey has argued it would be easier to give the money directly to the government - something the EU rejects, saying it always channels humanitarian aid through specialized agencies and non-governmental institutions so it goes directly to those in need.
In return for funds for Syrian refugees, visa-free travel and revitalized EU accession efforts, Turkey agreed to cooperate in stopping migrants crossing the Aegean Sea to Greece and take back those who do not qualify for asylum.
However, relations between Turkey and the West deteriorated in the past year. EU officials have said Turkey has a long path ahead of it before becoming a member of the bloc or being granted visa-free travel.
More recently, Turkey has expressed anger that Germany is granting asylum to Turks, more than 400 of them with diplomatic passports and government working permits, accused of participating in a failed coup in July. 

The failed putsch prompted a purge of the Turkish military, judiciary and civil service which Western countries have criticized as heavy-handed.

Nearly 450 people have been charged for offenses relating to the misused funds in an inspection of 28 provinces, said Xinhua, citing the Ministry of Finance and the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development.
The report gave no details on how the funds were misused. 
China's government has pledged to wipe out poverty by 2020, targeting 70 million people living below the poverty line, but researchers and social workers say a lasting solution will take much longer.
China has spent 196.1 billion yuan ($30.14 billion) on poverty relief over the past four years, said Xinhua.
Earlier this month, Hu Zejun, the head of the National Audit Office, said that the country has punished a total of 970 people for misusing the funds under the same program. It was not clear whether that number included the 450 people charged for offenses. 
Hu said 101,800 people had been removed from the government list of registered poor while another 95,000 were added.

562,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 10:18PM ET</span>","After Trump criticism, China denies selling oil illicitly to North Korea","By Philip Wen and David Brunnstrom
BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China on Friday denied reports it had been illicitly selling oil products to North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was unhappy that China had allowed oil to reach the isolated nation.
China on Thursday blocked a U.S. effort at the United Nations to blacklist six foreign-flagged ships -- five of which were mainland-China- or Hong Kong-owned -- that Washington believes had engaged in illicit trade with North Korea, a U.N. Security Council diplomat said.
Trump said on Twitter on Thursday that China had been ""caught RED HANDED"" allowing oil into North Korea and that would prevent ""a friendly solution"" to the crisis over Pyongyang's development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.
In a subsequent New York Times interview, Trump explicitly tied his administration's trade policy with China, North Korea's neighbor and lone major ally, to cooperation in resolving the North Korea standoff.
""I have been soft on China because the only thing more important to me than trade is war,"" he said. ""If they're helping me with North Korea, I can look at trade a little bit differently, at least for a period of time. And that's what I've been doing. But when oil is going in, I'm not happy about that.""
South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper this week quoted South Korean government sources as saying that U.S. spy satellites had detected Chinese ships transferring oil to North Korean vessels about 30 times since October.
U.S. officials have not confirmed details of this report but a U.S. State Department official said Washington had evidence that vessels from several countries, including China, had engaged in transhipping oil products and coal.
Russian tankers have supplied fuel to North Korea on at least three occasions in recent months by transferring cargoes at sea, two senior Western European security sources told Reuters, providing another economic lifeline to Pyongyang.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters she had noted recent media reports, including suggestions a Chinese vessel was suspected of transporting oil to a North Korean vessel on Oct. 19.
""In reality, the ship in question has, since August, not docked at a Chinese port and there is no record of it entering or leaving a Chinese port,"" Hua said, adding that the reports ""did not accord with facts.""
""China has always implemented U.N. Security Council resolutions pertaining to North Korea in their entirety and fulfils its international obligations. We never allow Chinese companies and citizens to violate the resolutions,"" Hua said. 
""If, through investigation, it's confirmed there are violations of the U.N. Security Council resolutions, China will deal with them seriously in accordance with laws and regulations.""
South Korea said on Friday that in late November it seized a Hong Kong-flagged ship, the Lighthouse Winmore, suspected of transferring oil to North Korea. The ship's registered manager, Lighthouse Ship Management, is in the Chinese port of Guangzhou. 
A South Korean Foreign Ministry official said the ship transferred as much as 600 tons to the North Korea-flagged Sam Jong 2 on Oct. 19 in international waters between China and the Korean peninsula, on the order of its Taiwan-based charterer, Billions Bunker Group Corp. 
Taiwan's presidential office said the firm was not incorporated in Taiwan and China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said she did not have any information about the matter.
U.S. SHIP-BAN PROPOSAL
Both ships were among 10 vessels the United States proposed that the U.N. Security Council should blacklist for illicit trade with North Korea, documents seen by Reuters this month showed.
Of those ships, three were listed earlier this month as Hong Kong-owned and two as mainland-China-owned, sailing under flags of convenience.
""China blocked six of the proposed vessels,"" a U.N. Security Council diplomat said. ""Four of the vessels were designated yesterday."" 
Three of the ships designated were North Korean, while the other was the Panama-registered Billions No. 18. Earlier this month, the latter ship was listed as Taiwan-owned.
The other ships were the Xin Sheng Hai; the Yu Yuan; the Glory Hope 1 (also known as Orient Shenyu), and the Kai Xiang.
The Trump administration has led a drive to step up global sanctions on North Korea and the U.N. Security Council last week unanimously imposed new sanctions in response to Pyongyang's Nov. 29 test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
Those sanctions seek to further limit North Korea's access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and Washington says the full cooperation of China, North Korea' main trading partner, is vital if this peaceful pressure campaign is to succeed.
It has warned that all options are on the table, including military ones, if sanctions fail.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was asked by reporters on Friday whether the U.S. Navy might become involved in seizing vessels suspected of transferring oil to North Korea.
He said he would not speculate on future operations but added: ""Obviously if a government finds that there is a ship in their port conducting trade that was forbidden under the U.N. Security Council resolution, then they have an obligation and so far we have seen nations take that obligation seriously.""
In September, the Security Council put a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum products exports to North Korea.
The latest U.N. resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year.
It also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Security Council to further cuts if North Korea conducts another nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile test.
Ship tracking data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that the Lighthouse Winmore has mainly been doing supply runs between China and Taiwan since August. 
Prior to that, it was active between India and the United Arab Emirates. In October, when it allegedly transferred petroleum products to the North Korean ship, the Lighthouse Winmore had its tracking transponder switched off.
South Korea's customs service concluded that the Lighthouse Winmore had loaded about 14,000 tons of Japanese refined petroleum products in South Korea on Oct. 11, reportedly bound for Taiwan, the South Korea official said. 
""It's unclear how much oil the ship had transferred to North Korea for how long and on how many occasions, but it clearly showed North Korea is engaged in evading the sanctions,"" the official told Reuters.
It was not immediately possible to find contact information for the Taiwanese charter company.
The Hong Kong government said it was ""liaising with the Korean parties concerned to obtain further information about the incident, and will take appropriate actions as necessary"".

Employees at the office of Lighthouse Ship Management declined to comment and said they had no knowledge of the situation.

563,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 09:02PM ET</span>",U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon,"By Lawrence Hurley and Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump's administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban.
Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration's request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1.
A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings.
""The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD's study and will continue to defend the president's lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump.
Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen.
Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: ""As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.""
Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal ""great news.""
""I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,"" Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration.
""COSTS AND DISRUPTION""
In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama's policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military ""cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.""
Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump's ban while legal challenges to the Republican president's policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law.
The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants' sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear.
The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept ""some individuals who are not medically fit for service.""
The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump's defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president's ban then put off indefinitely.

Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.

564,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 08:15PM ET</span>",Price protests turn political in Iran as rallies spread,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans in several cities across Iran on Friday, Iranian news agencies and social media reports said, as price protests turned into the largest wave of demonstrations since nationwide pro-reform unrest in 2009.
Police dispersed anti-government demonstrators in the western city of Kermanshah as protests spread to Tehran and several other cities a day after rallies in the northeast, the semi-official news agency Fars said.
The outbreak of unrest reflects growing discontent over rising prices and alleged corruption, as well as concern about the Islamic Republic's costly involvement in regional conflicts such as those in Syria and Iraq.
An official said a few protesters had been arrested in Tehran, and footage posted on social media showed a heavy police presence in the capital and some other cities.
Washington condemned the arrests. ""The Iranian government should respect their people's rights, including their right to express themselves,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.
The U.S. State Department in a separate statement urged ""all nations to publicly support the Iranian people and their demands for basic rights and an end to corruption.""
About 300 demonstrators gathered in Kermanshah after what Fars said was a ""call by the anti-revolution."" They shouted: ""Political prisoners should be freed"" and ""Freedom or death"", and some public property was destroyed. Fars did not name any opposition groups.
The protests in Kermanshah, the main city in a region where an earthquake killed over 600 people in November, took place a day after hundreds rallied in Iran's second largest city Mashhad to protest at high prices and shout anti-government slogans.
Videos posted on social media showed demonstrators yelling, ""The people are begging, the clerics act like God.""
Fars said there were protests in the cities of Sari and Rasht in the north, Qazvin west of Tehran and Qom south of the capital, and also in Hamadan in western Iran. It said many marchers who wanted to raise economic demands left the rallies after demonstrators shouted political slogans.
PRO-GOVERNMENT RALLIES PLANNED
State television said annual nationwide rallies and events were scheduled for Saturday to commemorate pro-government demonstrations held in 2009 to counter protests by reformists.
The Revolutionary Guards, which along with its Basij militia spearheaded a crackdown against the protesters in 2009, said in a statement carried by state media that there were efforts to repeat that year's unrest but added: ""The Iranian nation ... will not allow the country to be hurt.""
Mohsen Nasj Hamadani, deputy security chief in Tehran province, said about 50 people had rallied in a square but most had left after being asked to by police, while a few who refused were ""temporarily detained,"" the ILNA news agency reported.
In the central city of Isfahan, a resident said protesters had joined a rally held by factory workers demanding back-pay.
""The slogans quickly changed from the economy to those against (President Hassan) Rouhani and the Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei),"" the resident said by telephone.
In Qom, a stronghold of the Shi'ite clergy, footage posted on social media showed protesters attacking Ayatollah Khamenei by name. ""Seyyed Ali should be ashamed and leave the country alone,"" they chanted.
Protests were held also in the town of Quchan near the Turkmen border, and in Ahvaz, capital of oil-rich Khuzestan province, social media and Iranian news websites reported.
Police arrested 52 people in Thursday's protests, Fars quoted a judicial official as saying in Mashhad, one of the holiest places in Shi'ite Islam.
In social media footage, which could not be authenticated, riot police were seen using water cannon and tear gas to disperse crowds.
Openly political protests are rare in Iran, where security services are omnipresent.
The last unrest of national significance occurred in 2009 when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election as president ignited eight months of street protests. Pro-reform rivals said the vote was rigged.
However, demonstrations are often held by workers over lay-offs or non-payment of salaries and by people who hold deposits in non-regulated, bankrupt financial institutions.
Prominent conservative cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda called earlier for tough action against the protests.
""If the security and law enforcement agencies leave the rioters to themselves, enemies will publish films and pictures in their media and say that the Islamic Republic system has lost its revolutionary base in Mashhad,"" the state news agency IRNA quoted Alamolhoda as saying.
""DEATH TO DICTATOR""
Some social media videos showed demonstrators chanting ""Death to Rouhani"" and ""Death to the dictator"". Protests were also held in at least two other northeastern cities.
Alamolhoda, the representative of Ayatollah Khamenei in Mashhad, said a few people had taken advantage of Thursday's protests against rising prices to chant slogans against Iran's role in regional conflicts.
Tehran backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war, Shi'ite militias in Iraq, Houthi rebels in Yemen and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah group.
""Some people had come to express their demands, but suddenly, in a crowd of hundreds, a small group that did not exceed 50 shouted deviant and horrendous slogans such as 'Let go of Palestine', 'Not Gaza, not Lebanon, I'd give my life (only) for Iran',"" Alamolhoda said.
Social media videos also showed demonstrators chanting ""Leave Syria, think about us,” criticizing Iran's military and financial support for Assad.
Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri, a close Rouhani ally, suggested that hardline conservative opponents of the pragmatist president might have triggered the protests but lost control of them. ""Those who are behind such events will burn their own fingers,"" IRNA quoted Jahangiri as saying.
Rouhani’s leading achievement, a 2015 deal with world powers that curbed Iran’s disputed nuclear program in return for a lifting of most international sanctions, has yet to bring the broad economic benefits the government says are coming.
Unemployment stood at 12.4 percent in this fiscal year, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran, up 1.4 percent from the previous year. About 3.2 million Iranians are jobless, out of a total population of 80 million.

As far south as Charleston, South Carolina, freezing rain coated the city's landmark church steeples, while a shroud of ice blanketed rock faces next to Niagara Falls as mist from the thundering falls on New York's border with Canada froze in the bitterly cold air.
For the second day in a row, North Dakota and northern Minnesota were among the coldest spots in the country on one of the coldest days of the year, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a winter chill advisory for the region.
Temperatures in northern North Dakota are expected to plunge to around -30 F (-34.4 C) on Saturday with a wind chill of about -50 F (-45.5 C), said Ken Simosko, a meteorologist with the weather service in North Dakota.
The hundreds of thousands of people heading to New York's Times Square (NYSE:SQ) for the New Year's Eve celebration on Sunday may witness the giant ball drop on the second-coldest evening on record for the night, forecasters say. Temperatures are expected to be at about 10 F (-12 C) or colder in midtown Manhattan, forecasters said.
A few miles north, in New York's Bronx borough, nurse Libia Veliz entered a pastry shop, shivering even though she wore a thick winter coat.
""It's horrible,"" Veliz said, adding that she luckily does not have to work this weekend, when it is expected to snow. 
""I'm staying home, staying with family and staying warm,"" she said.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it was set to kick off talks next week with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders on immigration policy, government spending and other issues that need to be wrapped up early in the new year.
The expected flurry of legislative activity comes as Republicans and Democrats begin to set the stage for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump's Republican Party is eager to maintain control of Congress while Democrats look for openings to wrest seats away in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
On Wednesday, Trump's budget chief Mick Mulvaney and legislative affairs director Marc Short will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan - both Republicans - and their Democratic counterparts, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the White House said.
That will be followed up with a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump, McConnell and Ryan on Jan. 6 and 7 at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, according to the White House.
The Senate returns to work on Jan. 3 and the House on Jan. 8. Congress passed a short-term government funding bill last week before taking its Christmas break, but needs to come to an agreement on defense spending and various domestic programs by Jan. 19, or the government will shut down.
Also on the agenda for lawmakers is disaster aid for people hit by hurricanes in Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, and by wildfires in California. The House passed an $81 billion package in December, which the Senate did not take up. The White House has asked for a smaller figure, $44 billion.
Deadlines also loom for soon-to-expire protections for young adult immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, known as ""Dreamers.""
In September, Trump ended Democratic former President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protected Dreamers from deportation and provided work permits, effective in March, giving Congress until then to devise a long-term solution.
Democrats, some Republicans and a number of large companies have pushed for DACA protections to continue. Trump and other Republicans have said that will not happen without Congress approving broader immigration policy changes and tougher border security. Democrats oppose funding for a wall promised by Trump along the U.S.-Mexican border. 
""The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc,"" Trump said in a Twitter post on Friday.
Trump wants to overhaul immigration rules for extended families and others seeking to live in the United States.
Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent critic of the president, said he would work with Trump to protect Dreamers.
""We can fix DACA in a way that beefs up border security, stops chain migration for the DREAMers, and addresses the unfairness of the diversity lottery. If POTUS (Trump) wants to protect these kids, we want to help him keep that promise,"" Flake wrote on Twitter.
Congress in early 2018 also must raise the U.S. debt ceiling to avoid a government default. The U.S. Treasury would exhaust all of its borrowing options and run dry of cash to pay its bills by late March or early April if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling before then, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Trump, who won his first major legislative victory with the passage of a major tax overhaul this month, has also promised a major infrastructure plan.

567,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 05:10PM ET</span>","Gunman kills 11 in attacks on Coptic church, Christian-owned shop in Egypt","CAIRO (Reuters) - A gunman killed at least 11 people on Friday in attacks on a Coptic Orthodox church and a Christian-owned shop near Cairo before he was wounded and arrested, the Egyptian interior ministry and church officials said.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, in a statement carried out by its Amaq news agency, though it provided no evidence for the claim. 
Police have stepped up security measures around churches ahead of Coptic Christmas celebrations on Jan. 7, deploying officers outside Christian places of worship and setting up metal detectors at some of the bigger churches.
Islamist militants have claimed several attacks on Egypt's large Christian minority in recent years, including two bombings on Palm Sunday in April and a blast at Cairo's largest Coptic cathedral in December 2016 that killed 28 people.
Earlier reports by security sources and state media said at least two attackers were involved in Friday's attack, and that one was shot dead and another fled the scene. The interior ministry did not explain the reason for the different accounts.
The Coptic Church said the gunman first shot at a Christian-owned shop 4 km (3 miles) away, killing two people, before proceeding to the Mar Mina church in the southern Cairo suburb of Helwan. The Interior Ministry said he opened fire at the entrance to the site and tried to throw an explosive device. 
The gunman killed at least nine people, including a policeman, at the church, according to Interior Ministry and Coptic Church accounts. The Church said a young woman had died later from her wounds, bringing the civilian death toll at the church to eight. 
The ministry said security forces had ""immediately dealt with the (attacker) and arrested him after he was wounded."" It added, ""Legal measures have been taken,"" without elaborating.
GUNMAN IDENTIFIED
Investigators have identified the gunman, it said, adding that he had carried out several attacks since last year. Egypt is also grappling with a deadly Islamic State insurgency in the North Sinai region. 
The health ministry said five people had been wounded, including two women who it said were in a serious condition.
A joint funeral for eight of those killed was held on Friday evening at the Virgin Mary church in Helwan.
The head of the Coptic Church, Pope Tawadros II, led mourning for the victims. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi also offered his condolences to the families and ordered security forces to increase safety measures at sensitive sites, his office said in a statement. 
Cairo's state prosecutor said that an investigation had been launched into the incident.
""The shooting began at 10:30 a.m. and carried on for more than 15 minutes ... There was more than one attacker,"" Mohammed Hussein Abdelhadi, who lives close to the church, told Reuters.
A witness who did not want to give his name said the policeman was killed while he was closing the church gate to stop the gunman getting in.

CARACAS/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela is investigating Rafael Ramirez, a once powerful oil minister and former head of state oil company PDVSA, in connection with an alleged $4.8 billion Vienna-based corruption scheme, the state prosecutor's office announced on Friday.
Prosecutor Tarek Saab said Ramirez and at least four other oil executives from the South American OPEC nation sold crude oil at below market prices in exchange for bribes.
Ramirez, who led PDVSA for a decade, told Reuters the allegation was a “blatant lie.”
Venezuelan authorities had warned earlier this month that they planned to launch a criminal investigation of the former oil czar, in an escalation of a corruption purge that has resulted in the arrest of dozens of senior oil executives.
""(Ramirez) appears as the main intellectual author of what happened,” said Saab, inviting Ramirez to Venezuela to defend himself.
Venezuela ordered the removal of Ramirez from his post as representative to the United Nations in New York last month.
“What the prosecutor says is not only false but demonstrates a deep ignorance,” said Ramirez.
He added that the Vienna office of PDVSA was not in charge of selling oil but rather monitoring prices of Venezuelan crude exports.
“It’s a blatant lie ... intended to persecute not only me but my team.”
In his announcement on Friday, Saab also reported the arrest of Nelida Izarra, a former boss at a Vienna-based subsidiary of PDVSA, for alleged links to irregular purchases and sales of crude oil.
Saab also said he had ordered the arrest of two other PDVA officials who worked in Austria: Bernard Mommer and Irama Quiroz, as well as lawyer Mariana Zerpa. It is not immediately clear where Izarra was arrested or where the others currently reside.
Mommer was a pillar of oil strategy under former President Hugo Chavez, with oil sales serving as the cash cow for the country’s socialist revolution. He was key in planning the nationalization of swaths of Venezuela’s oil fields a decade ago and once served as the country's representative to OPEC.
“The executives involved in the case were complicit in thesemodifications that caused serious damage to the Venezuelan State, allegedly in exchange for commissions in foreign currency,” said a statement from the state prosecutor’s office.
Critics say the ongoing oil graft purge has as much to do with score settling among old political rivals as it does with any real attempt to root out endemic corruption.
Ramirez, 54, has been an increasingly vocal critic of leftist President Nicolas Maduro in recent months. He was seen by some as angling to run in the 2018 Venezuelan presidential election, in which Maduro is expected to seek another term.
The alleged crimes being investigated occurred between 2009 and 2015. Saab did not explain how authorities had reached the conclusion that they yielded $4.8 billion in illicit profits.

The prosecution reported that 69 oil managers have been arrested over the last few months for corruption in PDVSA, including former oil minister Eulogio Del Pino, former PDVSA president Nelson Martinez and the board of directors of Citgo, a PDVSA subsidiary in Houston.

KIEV (Reuters) - Kidnappers in Ukraine have released an employee at a United Kingdom-registered cryptocurrency exchange after getting more than $1 million in bitcoins as ransom, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister told Reuters on Friday.
Pavel Lerner, a leading analyst and blockchain expert, was abducted by unknown masked people on Dec. 26, according to a statement by his company, EXMO Finance, on its website.
""This is the first such case in Ukraine linked to bitcoins,"" Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, said in a phone text message. 
It was unclear who paid the ransom. Lerner's work at EXMO did not involve access to the financial assets of its users, the company said, adding that the platform was operating normally. 
""At the moment, he is safe, and there was no physical harm inflicted on him,"" the statement said. ""Nevertheless, Pavel is currently in a state of major stress, therefore, he will not provide any official comments in the coming days.""
News of the release came as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rebounded after two days of losses partly related to regulators toughening rules on digital currencies in an effort to curb excessive speculation. Many digital currencies surged in value this year.
BALACLAVAS
Strana.ua, a local news website, had earlier reported that six gun-toting men in dark clothing and balaclavas had snatched Lerner and pushed him into a minibus with stolen number plates.
Kiev police have begun a criminal investigation after a man was kidnapped in the Obolon district of Kiev, Oksana Blyshchyk, the Kiev police spokeswoman, said by phone without revealing the name of the victim. 
EXMO has 900,000 users as of December 2017, according to its website. 
""We would like to note that the story of Pavel's abduction has overgrown with rumors that might tamper with the official investigation,"" EXMO said in its statement. ""That said, EXMO currently refrains from any comments or suggestions of own versions of the possible scenario, in the nearest future.""
Separately, the company announced on Thursday that it had been hit by a denial-of-service attack.

Palestinian health officials said at least 50 protesters had been wounded by live fire, mostly along the Gaza border. An Israeli military spokeswoman said soldiers had shot at the ""main instigators"" who she said posed a direct threat to the troops and who were trying to damage the border security fence.
The spokeswoman said about 4,000 Palestinians across the West Bank and Gaza, some throwing rocks and fire bombs and setting tires alight, confronted Israeli soldiers who responded mainly by firing tear gas. 
In Gaza, demonstrators chanted ""Death to America, death to Israel, and death to Trump"" and militants fired rockets into Israel, drawing strikes by Israeli tanks and aircraft. 
The military said it targeted posts that belonged to Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Palestinian enclave, after intercepting two of the three rockets fired into Israel. Police said the third struck a building, causing damage. No casualties were reported in those incidents.
Trump outraged Palestinians and sparked anger in the Middle East and among world powers with his Jerusalem declaration on Dec. 6, which reversed decades of U.S. policy on one of the most sensitive issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city's eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.
Most countries regard the status of Jerusalem as a matter to be settled in an eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, although that process is now stalled.

A U.N. General Assembly resolution passed on Dec. 21 rejected Trump's Jerusalem declaration. A total of 128 countries voted for the U.N. resolution. Nine opposed it and 35 abstained. Twenty-one countries did not cast a vote.

Pika, a retired colonel in Congo's armed forces, immigrated to the United States in 1999 and became a citizen in 2005. He returned to live in Congo in 2007 and was arrested in March of last year.
His family suspected his detention was caused by his support for opponents of President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who has ruled the country for 33 of the last 38 years, during the March 2016 presidential election.

PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Panama said on Friday that it will hand over a former state governor for Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to Mexican authorities next week for extradition to face corruption charges.
Roberto Borge, who was governor of the state of Quintana Roo from 2010 to 2016, was arrested in Panama City in June as he was preparing to board a flight to Paris.
A spokeswoman for Panama's Foreign Ministry told reporters that on Thursday morning Mexican authorities will take Borge to Mexico, where prosecutors accuse him of using funds obtained illegally, embezzlement and abuse of public office.
Corruption will be one of the major issues in Mexico's presidential election next July, with public discontent widespread over a spate of conflict-of-interest rows that have dogged the Cabinet and President Enrique Pena Nieto himself.

Borge has long been accused of corruption by opposition parties. He has denied the allegations.

The federal investigation has hung over Trump's White House since he took office almost a year ago, and some Trump allies have in recent weeks accused the team of Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller of being biased against the Republican president.
But in an interview with the New York Times, Trump appeared to shrug off concerns about the investigation, which was prompted by U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia tried to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda.
""There's been no collusion. But I think he's going to be fair,"" Trump said in what the Times described as a 30-minute impromptu interview at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida.
Mueller has charged four Trump associates in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election.
U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said this month that he was not aware of any impropriety by Mueller's team.
Trump's lawyers have been saying for weeks that they had expected the Mueller investigation to wrap up quickly, possibly by the end of 2017. Mueller has not commented on how long it will last.
Trump told the Times that he did not know how long the investigation would take. ""Timing-wise, I can't tell you. I just don't know,"" he said.
Trump said he thought a prolonged probe ""makes the country look bad"" but said it has energized his core supporters.
""What it's done is, it's really angered the base and made the base stronger. My base is strong than it's ever been,"" he said.
BREAK FROM GOLF
The interview was a rare break in Trump's Christmas vacation in Florida. He has golfed each day aside from Christmas Day, and mainly kept a low profile, apart from the occasional flurry of tweets.
He spent one day golfing with Republican Senator David Perdue from Georgia, who has pushed legislation to cap immigration numbers, and had dinner on Thursday with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, an international trade hawk.
Trump told the Times he hoped to work with Democrats in the U.S. Congress on a spending plan to fix roads and other infrastructure, and on protections for a group of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.
Trump spoke about trade issues, saying he had backed off his hard line on Chinese trade practices in the hope that Beijing would do more to pressure North Korea to end its nuclear and missile testing program. He said he had been disappointed in the results.
He also complained about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which his administration is attempting to renegotiate in talks with Mexico and Canada.
Trump said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had played down the importance of Canadian oil and lumber exports to the United States when looking at the balance of trade between the two countries.

""If I don’t make the right deal, I’ll terminate NAFTA in two seconds. But we’re doing pretty good,"" Trump said.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 12:42PM ET</span>",Syrian rebels depart enclave in south as army gains in north,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian rebels began to evacuate an enclave in southwestern Syria on Friday under a surrender deal with the government as the army thrust into the northwest -- the insurgents' main remaining stronghold. 
State television showed footage of the convoy of buses containing the rebels moving out of Beit Jin.
Government forces and allied Shi'ite Muslim militias have forced numerous rebel pockets to surrender since Russia brought in heavy air power to help them in 2015, pushing the insurgents into an ever smaller number of enclaves. 
The northwestern area around Idlib province is the rebels' most important territory. They also hold a large area bordering Jordan and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights near Deraa in the southwest, as well as scattered pockets elsewhere including eastern Ghouta near Damascus. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Red Crescent said on Friday they had finished a medical evacuation of 29 very sick people from eastern Ghouta as part of a swap deal for prisoners held by the rebels. 
Fighters and their families started to leave Beit Jin, 40 km (25 miles) southwest of Damascus, on Friday after losing nearby areas to the army and its allies in heavy fighting earlier this month, state television reported. 
Some were heading to Idlib in the northwest, an area controlled by jihadists and the destination for all previous evacuees from surrendered rebel pockets, others to rebel territory in the southwest held by nationalist insurgents. 
Beit Jin's location near Israeli-controlled territory made it a strategic flashpoint given the role of Lebanon's Hezbollah group -- Israel's sworn enemy -- in fighting the rebels there. 
Israel has bombed Hezbollah convoys and weapons caches several times in Syria this year and fired on military positions in Syria after projectiles landed in the Golan Heights. 
The Syrian army's advance against rebels in the northwest involved bitter fighting and intense air strikes on Thursday and Friday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor. 
Fighting killed dozens on Friday and is concentrated in the village of Abu Dali in southern Idlib after weeks of incremental government gains in adjacent areas of Hama province. 
The army has only recently advanced into Idlib for the first time since a string of rebel victories there evicted the government from the province in early 2015. 
The government's gains across many fronts have ended rebel hopes of ousting President Bashar al-Assad by force. 

On Friday his office distributed photographs of Assad meeting a family in Homs, a sign of his growing comfort traveling around Syria this year after years in which he mostly stayed in Damascus.

The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria fighting Islamic State. Mattis' comments are likely to anger Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has previously called U.S. troops ""illegal invader"" forces.
""What we will be doing is shifting from what I would call an offensive, shifting from an offensive terrain-seizing approach to a stabilizing... you'll see more U.S. diplomats on the ground,"" Mattis said.
He has previously stated that U.S. forces will stay in Syria as long as Islamic State fighters want to fight and prevent the return of an ""ISIS 2.0.""
This is the first time he has said that there would be an increase of diplomats in the parts of the country retaken from Islamic State militants. 
""Well when you bring in more diplomats, they are working that initial restoration of services, they bring in the contractors, that sort of thing,"" Mattis said.
""There is international money that has got to be administered, so it actually does something, it doesn't go into the wrong people's pockets,"" he added.
The contractors and diplomats would also be looking at training local forces to clear improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and holding territory to help ensure that Islamic State does not retake territory. 
""It is an attempt to move toward the normalcy and that takes a lot of support,"" said Mattis. It was not clear how many U.S. diplomats would serve in Syria and when. The United States has suspended diplomatic relations with Syria due to the civil war. 
Assad’s forces, helped by Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, have managed to reestablish control over most of Syria over the past two years.
The U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State in Syria has repeatedly said it does not seek to fight Assad’s forces, though Washington want the president to step down.
When asked whether Syrian government forces could move to disrupt the U.S. plans, Mattis said: ""That would probably be a mistake.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Hours after the explosion that tore through a Shi'ite cultural center in the Afghan capital Kabul on Thursday, desperate families were still searching for news, as burned bodies were brought in and wards at the nearby Istiqlal hospital filled up.
The explosion that tore through a cramped basement conference room killed at least 41 people and wounded more than 80 and there were hours of confusion as victims were rushed to nearby hospitals.
""Everyone was at the hospital but at first nobody knew where they were, they were lost,"" said Hasan Jan, whose nephews, Abdul Saboor Maqsoudi, 24, and brother Ali Paiman, 18, were among the dead. 
""We couldn't recognize him he was so burned and disfigured by smoke. We had to go back to the morgue three or four times,"" he said after the two brothers were buried side by side in the Karte Sakhi cemetery in western Kabul.
""Finally they recognized him because of a ring on his finger and his shirt and belt and his watch.""
The attack, claimed by Islamic State, was the latest in at least two dozen bombings on Shi'ite targets in the Sunni-majority country over the past two years in a brutal campaign by the movement that has killed and wounded hundreds. According to some witnesses, the bomber in Thursday's attack was a 10-year-old boy.
At the Tabian Social and Cultural Centre, in a large house down a lane in a mainly Shi'ite area of the city which also houses the Afghan Voice news agency, the windows are shattered and the floor is still stained with blood.
Heaped neatly in the courtyard, stands a pile of shoes belonging to victims, all that remains of the dead, many of them students attending a conference.
""They were just there for this discussion,"" Hasan Jan said of his two nephews. ""They wanted to learn about culture, the Quran and religion.""
""WHAT GOVERNMENT?""
In many ways, the short lives of the two brothers and the way they ended are emblematic of the lack of hope that has driven thousands of Afghans of their age to leave their country and try for a better life in Europe.
Abdul Saboor had studied civil engineering but like many young Afghans, he struggled to find work after graduation and had taken a job teaching English. His father died five years ago in another suicide attack and now that he and his brother are gone, his mother and sister are alone.
""He was the breadwinner,"" Hasan Jan said. ""Now the family has no support, there's no man in the family.""
Although the government of President Ashraf Ghani and its NATO allies have claimed some success against Taliban insurgents since the United States announced a more robust military strategy this year, high-profile attacks in the cities have continued.
The government itself is chronically divided, often appearing more concerned with personal rivalries between its leaders and maneuvering ahead of presidential elections in 2019 than in confronting Afghanistan's many problems.
Asked what more the government could be doing to ensure security and stability, Hasan Jan was scornful. 
""What government?"" he said. ""There are several governments in Afghanistan, what government do you mean?
""We've lost our way. What government is going to provide help? There is nothing. All we want is security forces for our country.""
But he was equally dismissive of the militants who carried out the attack, which Islamic State said was ordered because of what it said were the cultural center's links to Iran.
""Why are they doing it here? If America is the enemy, they should find Americans. If they want to attack English, they should find English. If they want to attack Iran, they should attack Iran,"" he said.

""These people are innocent. People haven't taken up arms. People being killed in mosques, in different places. No human could accept that. If they had even a small bit of humanity in them, they couldn't accept that.""

U.N. resident coordinator Jamie McGoldrick said on Thursday the 56 were among 109 civilians killed in Saudi-led strikes in the previous 10 days and he condemned as ""futile"" the nearly three years of war in the poorest Arab country.
It pits Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement against the internationally recognized government backed by the Saudi-led alliance, which has carried out thousands of air strikes to roll back the Houthis and fend off perceived expansion by arch-foe Iran.
But the government officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday's attack on the crowded market in Al Hayma sub-district of Attazziah in Taiz governorate appeared to target a Houthi military vehicle.
""A Houthi military truck passed through the market 10 minutes before the bombing ..., 32 people were killed and 25 injured,"" one official said, providing 30 of their names.
He added that the market was closed at the time, but an unusual number of people had gathered there to survey the damage from an air strike the night before that had also targeted a passing military vehicle.
The United Nations says the coalition campaign has killed hundreds of civilians. But a body set up by the alliance has set up its own investigating committee which has disputed U.N. casualty counting methods and largely attributed deadly strikes to the presence of Houthi combatants in targeted areas.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey and Russia on Friday signed an accord for Moscow to supply Ankara with S-400 surface-to-air missile batteries, Turkish authorities said, finalizing a deal set to deepen military ties between NATO member Turkey and the Kremlin.
The S-400 deal, reportedly worth some $2.5 billion and in the works for more than a year, has worried the West because the system cannot be integrated into NATO's military architecture.
As part of NATO's collective defense pledge, the allies integrate their ships, planes and weapons systems to make them work together, as well as sharing command across the alliance.
The accord is the latest in a series of moves by Ankara to boost its defense capabilities as it faces threats from Kurdish and Islamist militants at home and conflicts across its borders in Syria and Iraq.
In a statement late on Friday, Turkey's Undersecretariat for Defence Industries (SSM) said that Moscow would supply the S-400 missile batteries to Ankara in an initial delivery planned for the first quarter of 2020.
On Wednesday, Sergei Chemezov, head of the Russian state conglomerate Rostec, told the Kommersant daily that Russia would supply Turkey with four batteries of S-400s under the deal.
However, the SSM said Turkey would buy two S-400 batteries from Russia under the agreement, with one being optional, and added the systems would be used and managed ""independently"" by Turkish personnel, rather than Russian advisors.
It said the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) would have full control over the systems, and added that the accord signed earlier on Friday included clauses on cooperation for technologic gains and joint development.
Turkey's purchase of the systems has unnerved NATO member countries, who are already wary of Moscow's military presence in the Middle East, as the system is incompatible with the alliance's systems. 
NATO officials have warned Turkey about unspecified consequences of purchasing the S-400, but Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said ties with NATO remain strong.
Chezmezov said Moscow was expected to begin the first deliveries in March 2020 and that Turkey was the first NATO member state to acquire the advanced S-400 missile system.
Earlier on Friday, Turkish newspapers cited Erdogan as saying Turkey would borrow in the Russian currency in a loan deal under the accord.
BORROWING ""IN RUBLES""
""We will not borrow in dollars in this loan, we will borrow in rubles,"" Hurriyet newspaper quoted Erdogan as telling reporters on his plane, returning from a trip to Africa.
According to Chemezov, Turkey would pay 45 percent of the cost of the agreement up front, with Russia providing loans to cover the remaining 55 percent.
The Russian Finance Ministry will finance a deal from the state treasury, while Russian banks will take part solely in the transfer of funds in the deal, a Russian banking source said.
Relations between Moscow and Ankara deteriorated sharply in 2015 after Turkey shot down a Russian air force jet that it said had crossed into Turkish airspace, but they have since repaired ties despite having backed different sides in the Syrian war.
They are now cooperating on Syrian peace efforts as well as projects in the defense industry and energy sectors.
While pushing ahead with the S-400 project, Ankara has sought to secure defense deals with other countries as well.
In November, Turkey signed a letter of intent with France and Italy to strengthen cooperation on joint defense projects. As a first step, the Franco-Italian EUROSAM consortium and Turkish companies will look into a system based on the SAMP-T missile systems.

Turkey has also invested heavily in the development of its domestic defense industry, with projects encompassing areas including combat helicopters, tanks, drones and warships.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 10:48AM ET</span>","Special Report: In a hospital ward in Yemen, the collapse of a nation","By Selam Gebrekidan
ADEN (Reuters) - Nahla Arishi, chief pediatrician at the al-Sadaqa hospital in this Yemeni port city, had not seen diphtheria in her 20-year career. Then, late last month, a three-year-old girl with high fever was rushed to Arishi's ward. Her neck was swollen, and she gasped for air through a lump of tissue in her throat. Eight days later, she died.
Soon after, a 10-month-old boy with similar symptoms died less than 24 hours after arriving at the hospital.
Two five-year-old cousins were admitted; only one survived.
A 45-day-old boy, his neck swollen and bruised, lasted a few hours. His last breath was through an oxygen mask.
One morning in early December, 16-month-old Sameh arrived at the hospital carried by his aunt and delirious with fever. Arishi immediately recognized a new case of diphtheria. ""Put on your mask,"" she ordered the aunt.
Sameh's father, a fighter in Yemen's three-year war, rushed in, grabbed his son, yanked off the baby's shoes and threw them on the floor. ""Sameh is the light of the house,"" he wailed, feeling the boy's feverish brow and body.
This is the emergency ward to a nation. After three years of warfare, cholera and hunger, Yemen faces a new battle: In the past four months, doctors across the country have recorded at least 380 cases of diphtheria, a bacterial disease that last appeared here in 1992.
Arishi, like her country around her, is struggling to cope. Every month, she and her team drip-feed dozens of Yemen's half a million severely malnourished children. Her ward has also treated hundreds of the one million people infected by cholera.
This spring, Arishi and her colleagues reopened an abandoned wing of al-Sadaqa hospital, fenced it with chicken wire and created a makeshift cholera treatment center. Now, they are converting part of that center into a diphtheria ward, cordoning off isolation units by barring hallway doors.
But with rusty oxygen tanks and only two functional ventilators in a different part of the hospital – and with the expectation that the cholera epidemic will worsen in coming months — her triage upon triage is no longer working.
""We're getting more patients but we can't deal with them. We don't have supplies. We don't have money,"" said Arishi, ""This war has got to end.""
For the past three years, Yemen has been the combat zone of a struggle for regional supremacy between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Riyadh and some of its Arab allies jumped into Yemen's civil war in 2015 to help quell an uprising by the Houthis, an Islamic political-religious movement backed by Iran. In addition to airstrikes, Riyadh – with U.S. and U.N. backing – has positioned ships in Yemeni waters as a way to stop arms reaching Houthi militia.
But the blockade has ended up isolating a country that was already the poorest in the Middle East. Vital provisions – food, medicine, fuel, medical equipment, batteries, solar panels and more – are not getting through. Humanitarian shipments of food and medicine have mostly been allowed into the country. Yet Saudi-led forces have severely delayed aid shipments or closed ports outright, especially in northern Yemen where fighting and the humanitarian crisis are most acute.
The war and blockade have also thwarted Yemen's vaccination programs.
Seven years ago, 80 percent of children were fully immunized with three doses of diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus vaccine, or DTP as the combined shot is called, according to Zaher Sahloul, a critical-care specialist who cofounded a nonprofit called MedGlobal. Now, he says, that has dropped to 60 percent.
Poor record keeping means there are discrepancies in data related to vaccine coverage. Yemen's Ministry of Health says 85 percent of Yemeni children have been immunized against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, Hepatitis B and bacterial influenza since the beginning of the conflict, a mere two percentage point drop from pre-war years.
In late November, the U.N.'s World Health Organization (WHO) sent a shipment of diphtheria antitoxins - designed to treat those already infected - and vaccines to the capital Sanaa. The vaccines were delayed by the Saudi blockade for a week, the WHO said.
In July, the Geneva-based International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision earmarked a million cholera vaccines for Yemen. An initial shipment of 500,000 doses was sent to the African Horn country of Djibouti, and was ready to send on to Sanaa. But the WHO and local authorities in Sanaa decided together to scrap the vaccination plan, citing logistical and technical issues.
""Yemen needs a Marshall Plan,"" said Sahloul, who was visiting al-Sadaqa's treatment center in December. ""It is difficult to foresee an optimistic scenario if the current conditions persist,"" he said.
   
DISEASE AFTER DISEASE
Arishi began her medical career in the mid-1990s after Yemen unified following years of conflict between communist and pro-western forces. She joined the al-Sadaqa hospital, which was built in the 1980s with funds from the Soviet Union.
In her two decades at the hospital's pediatric ward, Arishi has seen Yemen slowly come apart again. Even in the mid 2000s, the country faced widespread hunger because of rising food prices. The feeding center of al-Sadaqa's hospital, she said, was crowded even before the new civil war began.
In the spring of 2015, Houthi forces, aided by the now-deceased former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, advanced south from their stronghold in the Yemeni capital Sanaa and took over Aden's airport. It was then that the coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia joined the war and began launching airstrikes against Houthi-held enclaves. Fighting raged until troops backing the officially-recognized government wrenched Aden from Houthi control in July of that year.
During the first months of fighting, al-Sadaqa filled with hundreds of wounded children and adults.
By the middle of 2016, another group of patients began pouring into the hospital. A cholera outbreak that started in Sanaa had spread to Aden. Dehydrated children, their condition made worse by malnutrition, flooded into her pediatric ward. Many did not survive, Arishi said.
Cholera can kill because patients quickly lose their fluids through vomiting and watery diarrhea. When caught early, it can be treated by replacing fluids.
When a second wave of cholera infections swept Yemen in April this year, Arishi and her colleagues decided to set up the new treatment center. They picked a building away from the main wings of the hospital to avoid contamination and repaired it with funds from the WHO and medical aid group Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Converting the building, which had been abandoned for two years after the war, required ""heavy cleaning work, electricity, water system repairs as well as installing air conditioners,"" according to MSF.
Yet, like the country itself, al-Sadaqa was overwhelmed by the cholera epidemic. Nationwide, a million people have been infected, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The WHO says cholera has killed more than 2,200 people.
Most of the infected were in the populous north of the country. But al-Sadaqa, which took in patients from across south Yemen, was also unprepared. Arishi and her colleagues had expected 10 patients at a time. Instead, by the summer, they were treating more than a hundred, mostly adults, a day.
Since September, the spread of cholera across the country has abated. However, doctors agree that a new wave of infections is likely in March, when the country's rainy season returns. Cholera spreads more easily in wet weather, because the bacteria live in rivers and coastal waters which swell with the rain. Rain brings sewage into sources of drinking water.
In August, a new disease began to emerge. In Ibb governorate, 170 km south of Sanaa, a 17-year-old boy was diagnosed with diphtheria, according to the WHO.
Diphtheria is caused by bacteria that mainly infect the throat, nose and airways and send toxins into the bloodstream. It has largely receded as a global health threat, because much of the world's population is protected through routine immunization.
But the disease is highly contagious once it takes root, doctors say, since it spreads in the droplets from coughing and sneezing. Small children are particularly vulnerable because toxins from the bacteria build up a coating of dead tissue that blocks their small airways.
Since the mid-August case, more than 380 patients have been admitted to hospitals across Yemen with diphtheria-like symptoms, according to the WHO. Doctors diagnosed the cases based solely on patients' symptoms. Close to 40 of the patients have died, by WHO estimates.
The first case of suspected diphtheria reached al-Sadaqa in November. Of the seven children who arrived within a fortnight, nearly all were initially misdiagnosed with mumps or flu. Four died.
Arishi faced the problem of isolating children with symptoms of diphtheria. She asked hospital administrators to block a hallway door with a cupboard. Behind it, she tried to isolate those who might infect others.
But she lacked basic resources to treat the new disease. Al-Sadaqa hospital, like most others in Yemen, does not have the reagents needed to test for diphtheria. In fact, none of Arishi's diagnoses has been confirmed by laboratory tests.
Marc Poncin, an MSF emergency coordinator in Ibb governorate, said the lack of recent experience means it could be harder to treat diphtheria.
""There has been a loss of knowledge regarding its treatment, because it's become something of a neglected and forgotten disease,"" he said.
After a diagnosis, treatment is far from easy. Doctors can prescribe antitoxins and antibiotics. But until a few weeks ago, Yemen had no such antitoxin stocks.
The United Nations Children's Fund and the WHO have imported more than 5 million doses of vaccines to immunize children in the worst affected areas. The WHO has already distributed antibiotics to patients and, as prophylactics, to their families.
Some diphtheria patients need emergency surgery to remove blockages from their airways or need machines to breathe. But most of Yemen's hospitals don't have such equipment. As of early December, only two of al-Sadaqa's three mechanical ventilators were working, and the hospital didn't have an isolated operating room for diphtheria patients.
The lack of resources has caused strains with the hospital's supporters. When Arishi cordoned off a part of the cholera ward for the incoming diphtheria patients a couple of weeks ago, the WHO was not happy with the decision, according to Hussein Hassan, head of the WHO's Aden office.
""We cannot confidently say that cholera is over. It is a seasonal problem and it may come back. What happens if another wave starts and the ward is filled with diphtheria patients?"" said Hassan.
   
""I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE MY KID""
Arishi says there is another sign that Yemen is breaking down: parents' waning faith.
She sees more examples of families that have not vaccinated their children because they distrust both their government and international organizations.
Earlier this month she confronted Saleh Khaled, the father of a five-year-old boy called Yasir, who arrived with severe diphtheria symptoms.
""Why did you not vaccinate your son?"" Arishi asked.
Yasir's first cousin, who was also five years old and unvaccinated, had died a few days earlier. When the first symptoms had appeared on Yasir's neck and chin, the boy's parents had given him honey.
Khaled said he had heard rumors, years earlier, about children who had died after healthcare workers had allegedly switched vaccine vials with insulin during a door-to-door vaccination campaign.
""I didn't want to lose my kid because of something like this,"" he said. ""We don't trust the people who work in the health department.""
Others in the al-Sadaqa ward that day echoed similar fears.
""We live only because of God's mercy,"" said Khaled Nasser, the father of 16-month-old Sameh. Nasser, a member of a local armed group that fights alongside Saudi-allied forces, said fellow fighters had helped him buy medicine when Sameh got sick.
Arishi herself barely ekes out a living. She makes $210 a month at al-Sadaqa and works at a private clinic three days a week to supplement her income. The mother of three treats neighbors and relatives without getting paid. Her husband, also a pediatrician, works at another clinic in Aden.
For Arishi, war is both burden and inspiration. She says it has made her commitment to medicine stronger.

""If I leave and my husband leaves and everyone leaves, who will stay to treat our patients?"" she said. ""Aden is my city. It is my responsibility.""

Turkey has identified 215,000 users of the ByLock messaging app and started investigating more than 23,000 of them. Ankara said many of those were re-directed to ByLock unwittingly via a different app developed by the plotters of the failed coup. An arrest warrant was issued for the developer of that app.
Ankara's chief prosecutor said earlier this week that using ByLock remains one of the biggest indications of collaboration with the plotters of the failed putsch in which 250 people were killed.
But he said he would ask for the release of 1,000 suspects unless there was any other evidence against them.
Ankara prosecutor's office said it would review the cases of 11,480 suspects who were re-directed to ByLock without their consent. 
Private broadcaster NTV said 161 suspects in Istanbul, 27 in the capital Ankara, and 14 in southeastern province of Diyarbakir were freed. Cases against 36 others in northwestern Yalova province were being re-evaluated, it said.
The list of those to be released included a former Justice and Development Party (AKP) member of parliament and the coach of a soccer team.
An accountant from the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet, who was in jail for 267 days, was also among those released. The case against 17 other employees of the newspaper continues.
Ankara said it would issue a decree calling for those released from prison to be returned to their jobs, state broadcaster TRT Haber said. 
Authorities say ByLock was widely used by followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who the government blames for orchestrating the failed military coup in which 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied any involvement.
Since the coup attempt, more than 50,000 people, including civil servants and security personnel, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs.

Rights groups say the crackdown has been exploited to muzzle dissent. The government says the measures have been necessary due to the security threats which Turkey has faced since the failed putsch.

The revised decree undid changes to the definition involving exhaustive working hours and degrading work conditions and also removed limitations on the publication of a ""dirty list"" of employers subjecting workers to conditions similar to slavery.
Human rights groups had criticized the original mid-October decree, backed by Brazil's powerful farm lobby, which narrowed the definition of slave labor to limiting the ability of workers to move freely while disregarding other abuses.
In Brazil, modern-day slavery has been defined as forced labor including debt bondage, degrading work conditions, and long work hours that pose a risk to a worker's health or life, and violate their dignity.
Rights groups estimate hundreds of thousands of people work in slave-like conditions on farms, sugar cane plantations and cattle ranches across Brazil's remote and jungle areas, as well as in urban factories and construction sites.
Temer said in late October that the government would reissue the decree with revisions in response to the criticism. Days later, the Supreme Court suspended the decree, saying it violated the constitution.
Outgoing Labor Minister Ronaldo Nogueira issued the latest decree, dated Oct. 28, one day after submitting his resignation. He is waiting to be officially replaced by Temer.

A deal between Merkel's conservative camp and the center-left (SPD) is her best chance of securing a fourth term in office but her possible coalition partners are angling for concessions before talks start in the new year.
The CSU said in a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Friday it wanted defense spending to reach NATO's target of 2 percent of national output and more money spent on the military, drones and transportation infrastructure.
""Getting the best possible equipment, training and care for the soldiers as well as strengthening and modernizing the army costs money,"" read the draft, which urged an increase in the defense budget to achieve these goals.
But more defense spending demanded by the CSU on Merkel's right flank could make a deal with the SPD on her left harder.
The SPD has rejected NATO's defense spending target and accused Merkel and her conservatives of kowtowing to the demands of U.S. President Donald Trump. 
The document was skeptical about deeper European integration, rejecting the idea of ""ever closer union"" as advocated by SPD leader Martin Schulz, who has called for a ""United States of Europe"" to be achieved by 2025.
On immigration, where the two parties also disagree, the CSU draft said Germany can no longer be the main destination for refugees and the European Union mission that rescues refugees' boats cannot be a shuttle service to Europe.
The party also proposed that African countries that agreed to take back refugees could be rewarded with more investment.

""In plain language: if you cooperate, you profit,"" the draft said.

Oskar Groening, known as the ""bookkeeper of Auschwitz"" for his job counting cash taken from the camp's victims, was sentenced to four years' jail in 2015, but wrangling over his health and age have delayed the start of his sentence.
The constitutional court rejected the argument by Groening's lawyers that imprisonment at his advanced age would violate his right to life, adding that the gravity of his crimes meant there was a particular need for him to be seen to be punished.
""The plaintiff has been found guilty of being accessory to murder in 300,000 related cases, meaning there is a particular importance to carrying out the sentence the state has demanded,"" the judges wrote, upholding the Celle regional court's ruling.
There is no further appeal to the constitutional court's ruling. The ruling does leave open the possibility that Groening could be released if his health deteriorates.
In a 2015 court battle seen as one of the last major Holocaust trials, prosecutors said although Groening did not kill anyone himself while working at Auschwitz, in Nazi-occupied Poland, he helped support the regime responsible for mass murder by sorting bank notes seized from trainloads of arriving Jews.
Groening, who admitted he was morally guilty, said he was an enthusiastic Nazi when he was sent to work at Auschwitz in 1942, at the age of 21.
He came to attention in 2005 after giving interviews about his work in the camp in an attempt to persuade Holocaust deniers that the genocide had taken place.

Some 6 million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust carried out under Adolf Hitler.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's election in March pits the center-right group against the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement because the ruling left-wing party lags in polls under the country's third prime minister since the last election, center-right leader Silvio Berlusconi said on Friday.
Polls suggest no one will win an outright victory but an alliance around Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) looks set to take the highest number of seats. 
On Thursday, the government of Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni set March 4 as the date for a vote expected to produce a hung parliament, instability and possible market turbulence in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
Parties across the spectrum are pledging to voters that they will change or abolish European Union budget rules, cut taxes and spend more to boost the economy which is slowly picking up steam.
Immigration is also set to be a central issue, with right-wing parties warning of an ""invasion"". The center-right also wants a parallel currency, while 5-Star says it will call a referendum on euro membership if EU partners refuse to budge on the Fiscal Compact. 
Gentiloni's Democratic Party (PD) has been in power since 2013. 5-Star is set to be the best-performing individual party, and the PD looks set to come third.
""The challenge is between moderates like us ... and rebellious, poverty-perpetuating vigilante movements like the followers of (Beppe) Grillo,"" Berlusconi said in an interview with Corriere della Sera, referring to the stand-up comedian who founded 5-Star.
Berlusconi's main coalition partner is the far-right Northern League, which is allied with France's Marine Le Pen in the European Parliament and is only slightly behind Forza Italia in the polls.
Forza Italia is polling at about 16 percent compared with 13 percent for the League.
Five years after Europe's debt crisis brought down his fourth government, the 81 year-old media mogul burst unexpectedly back on to the political scene last year, although he cannot become prime minister due to a tax fraud conviction.
He locked horns this week with 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio, 31, whose party's support is stable at around 28 percent, over their respective proposals for income support programs for Italy's growing ranks of poor people.
Di Maio accused Berlusconi of copying 5-Star's ""citizens' wage"" proposal which would top up the income of 9 million poor Italians, with a ""dignity wage"" aimed at the 15 million poorest.
Berlusconi hit back in an interview on La 7 television: ""If we copied it from anyone, it was from a great liberal economist like Milton Friedman, certainly not the 5-Star."" 
With all signs pointing to a hung parliament, Berlusconi has not yet given full backing to any one leader to take the center-right bloc into the election, and has even said the current government should stay on as caretaker if there is no winner.
League leader Matteo Salvini said in an interview with Libero newspaper on Friday that he was waiting for ""clarity"".

""It's not his put-downs that bother me, it's when he talks about another Gentiloni (government) that my hair stands on end,"" Salvini said.

The Hong Kong Bar Association said the decision would ""severely undermine"" confidence in the rule of law in the former British colony which returned to Chinese rule 20 years ago with the promise of a high degree of autonomy.
China's parliament on Wednesday said part of a high-speed railway station being built in Hong Kong would be regarded as mainland territory governed by mainland laws under a so-called cooperation agreement.
Chinese and Hong Kong officials both argue such a joint immigration checkpoint is necessary for passengers' convenience.
Hong Kong operates under a ""one country, two systems"" principle which allows it to run its own police force, immigration controls and an independent, British-style judicial system, with lawyers split into barristers and solicitors.
The city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, explicitly states national laws, with a few exceptions, do not apply in Hong Kong.
""This plainly amounts to an announcement by the NPCSC (National People's Congress Standing Committee) that the cooperation agreement complies with the constitution and the Basic Law 'just because the NPCSC says so',"" the bar association said.
""Such an unprecedented move is the most retrograde step to date in the implementation of the Basic Law, and severely undermines public confidence in 'one country, two systems' and the rule of law.
""The integrity of the Basic Law has now been irreparably breached.""
The prospect of Beijing interfering in the financial hub has already stoked social tensions and protests including the 2014 ""Occupy"" street demonstrations that demanded, in vain, full democracy for the city of 7.3 million.
The abduction of Hong Kong-based booksellers in 2015 who later showed up across the border in Chinese custody also touched a raw nerve.
The high-speed rail station is due to open next autumn in the heart of the city, next to the Victoria Harbour, one of the most famous views in the world.
The Hong Kong government said it respected the rule of law.
""Under each system, there must be the highest and ultimate organ of power (and this must be necessary),"" it said in a statement.
""Under 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy accorded by the Basic Law, but we must also respect the national constitution and the NPCSC's status and authority under the country's constitutional system.
""This decision... has legal effect. It is not, as some comments suggest, simply an administrative decision ... and much less reflects a 'rule of man' situation or a retrograde move in the implementation of the Basic Law."" 
Elsie Leung, deputy director of the Basic Law Committee in the NPCSC and the city's former legal chief, also disputed the association's comments. 
""I think their understanding of the Chinese constitution is insufficient,"" Leung told reporters in comments carried by Hong Kong's Cable Television.
""If you insist on using only common law principles to interpret the Basic Law, that is wrong."" 
At a cost of more than HK$84 billion ($11 billion), Hong Kong's Express Rail Link will link up with the rest of China's high-speed rail network. 

The plan is expected to sail through Hong Kong's legislature in the first half of next year as opposition lawmakers have lost their veto power after a series of controversial court cases.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's Constitutional Court ruled on Friday that parliament had failed to hold President Jacob Zuma to account over a scandal related to state-funded upgrades to his home, and must launch proceedings that could remove him from office.
The ruling is the latest judicial setback for Zuma, who has faced widespread public demands to step down as president of Africa's most industrialized economy before an election in 2019.
While the ruling comes nowhere near starting an impeachment process against Zuma now, it gives parliament six months to make provision for the removal of a president.
It was not immediately clear what specific steps parliament would take, and whether any concrete action would be completed before the election, but analysts said the decision would add to the mounting pressure on him to step down. 
The rand currency was almost 1 percent firmer on the last day trading day of the year.
Zuma, 75, is already in a weakened position after Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was narrowly elected leader of Zuma's ruling African National Congress (ANC) last week - although Zuma's faction still retains key positions in the party and he has already survived no-confidence votes. 
""We conclude that the assembly did not hold the president to account ... The assembly must put in place a mechanism that could be used for the removal of the president from office,"" Judge Chris Jafta said, handing down the judgment, which was supported by a majority of the court, and shown on live television.
""Properly interpreted, Section 89 implicitly imposes an obligation on the assembly to make rules specially tailored for the removal of the president from office. By omitting to include such rules, the assembly has failed to fulfill this obligation.""
The court ruled that parliament, where the ANC holds a commanding majority, needed to act within 180 days. 
""The court is saying that there is no mechanism in place to implement the provision regarding impeachment ... They must make a provision within the rules for that to happen,"" said Lawson Naidoo, the executive secretary of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution, an NGO.
CELEBRATIONS
The ultra-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and other small opposition parties had taken the issue to the Constitutional Court. Dozens of EFF supporters, clad in their trademark red shirts and berets, danced and sang outside the court after the judgment was delivered. 
Daniel Silke, director of Political Futures Consultancy, said the ball was now in the ANC's court.
""The pressure will come from within the ANC to engineer a dignified exit for President Zuma ... this judgment hastens or adds substantial pressure for an early retirement by Zuma,"" he told Reuters.
""It is not about him anymore, it about the party trying to chart a new course without the divisiveness that the Zuma issue brings,"" he said. 
Zuma, an earthy politician with scant formal education who spent a decade in prison with Nelson Mandela for fighting apartheid, has faced numerous corruption allegations throughout his presidency. He has denied wrongdoing.
He has also been politically hobbled by a dismal economy that was hit by damaging ratings downgrades earlier this year after he sacked a respected finance minister. 
""The ANC will study the judgment and discuss its full implications when the National Executive Committee meets on the 10th January 2018,"" the party said in a statement.
The judgment stemmed from a scandal that had faded from view in recent months as new allegations of corruption have swirled around Zuma.
In March 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled that Zuma pay back some of the roughly $15 million in state money spent upgrading his private home on a sprawling compound in rural KwaZulu-Natal province. 
The upgrades included a cattle pen, chicken run and a swimming pool that the police ministry famously described as a ""fire pool"" required for fire-fighting purposes.
The unanimous and stinging ruling by the 11-judge court said Zuma had failed to ""uphold, defend and respect"" the constitution by ignoring the findings of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, whose office is an anti-graft watchdog with a strong constitutional mandate.
Zuma has since repaid 7.8 million rand ($631,000) - the sum determined by the Treasury as the ""reasonable cost"" he should bear - while also surviving a no-confidence motion in parliament where members of own his party voted to oust him.
But opposition parties argued that parliament has not done enough, given the gravity of the court's findings.
An impeachment motion was brought to a vote in parliament shortly after the judgment but the court ruled that this was not enough. 

""The assembly simply debated and voted on the motion ... Therefore, we conclude that the assembly did not hold the president to account,"" Jafta said.

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania has threatened to revoke the registration of religious organizations that ""mix religion and politics"" after a cleric criticized President John Magufuli's leadership in a Christmas sermon.    Opposition leaders in Tanzania say tolerance for dissent has been rapidly disappearing since Magufuli took office in late 2015 with pledges to reform East Africa's third-biggest economy and crack down on large-scale corruption.     Tanzania's constitution protects freedom of worship, but religious organizations must register at the country's Home Affairs Ministry to get a license to operate legally.    ""Recently, some leaders of (religious) societies have been using their sermons to analyze political issues, which is contrary to the law,"" the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Projest Rwegasira, said late on Thursday.     ""Any violation of the law could lead to cancellation of the registration of the concerned religious society,"" he said in a statement.    The warning was issued just days after the head of a Pentecostal church in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam criticized Magufuli's leadership, saying his government was closing democratic space.    Zachary Kakobe, self-proclaimed bishop and founder of the Full Gospel Bible Fellowship Church, accused the Tanzanian government of ""quietly turning the country into a one-state rule by systematically banning political activity.""    The Home Affairs Ministry responded by issuing a public notice to religious organizations after the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party accused Kakobe of mixing religion and politics.    Tanzanian police banned political protests and rallies indefinitely in June last year, saying political activity would only be allowed during elections.    Magufuli, nicknamed “the Bulldozer” for pushing through his policies, has won some praise from Western donors for an anti-corruption campaign and cuts to wasteful public spending. But opponents accuse him of increasingly undermining democracy by curbing dissent and stifling free speech.     Magufuli has publicly denied the allegations, saying he is no dictator. But several newspapers have been shut and more than a dozen suspects prosecuted for allegedly insulting the president via WhatsApp and other social media platforms.     

The CCM won 42 of 43 local government elections in November, prompting the main opposition parties to announce a boycott of several parliamentary by-elections early next year, citing foul play. Smaller opposition parties will participate in the polls.     Tanzania, one of sub-Saharan Africa’s most stable democracies, has held five relatively peaceful multi-party elections since 1995, all won by the CCM.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's counter-terrorist police force is to get 600 extra personnel next year to monitor Islamic State networks and head off so-called lone wolf attacks, the chief of police in the world's largest Muslim-majority country said on Friday.
Hundreds of investigators and surveillance personnel will join an existing force of about 500 officers at Detachment 88, a police unit tasked with uprooting militant networks and foiling attacks. 
""We will do this to monitor terrorist networks more closely since ISIS networks remain in Indonesia and Southeast Asia,"" National Police Chief Tito Karnavian told Reuters, referring to Islamic State.
""It's more due to increasing 'lone wolf' activity and the dynamics of ISIS networks around the world,"" he said, when asked if the increase in personnel was in response to a specific threat.
Indonesia has seen a resurgence in homegrown militancy in recent years, largely inspired by Islamic State. Hundreds of Indonesians are believed to have traveled to Syria to join the group, but many have returned as it has lost territory.
Authorities worry militants returning from the Middle East may include battle-hardened fighters who could pass on what they have learned about weapons and attacks.
Karnavian, a former chief of the counter-terrorism unit himself, said the extra personnel will be deployed to certain provinces where ""we perceive ISIS networks exist"".
The counter-terrorist force was set up in 2003, after bomb attacks on the holiday island of Bali in 2002 killed more than 200 people. 
It was initially trained, funded and equipped by Australia and the United States. 
Islamic State-linked militants killed for people in a gun and bomb attack in the heart of the capital, Jakarta, in 2016, but the assault, and a series of others since then, have been poorly planned and executed. 
The counter-terrorist unit, known as Densus 88, foiled several attacks and arrested dozens of suspected militants this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investigators in New York City searched early on Friday for the cause of a blaze that ripped through an apartment building in the Bronx and killed 12 people including four children, in the city's deadliest fire in at least a quarter of a century. 
The fire broke out a little before 7 p.m. (0000 GMT) on the first floor of a brick building and quickly spread upstairs, city Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told a news conference with Mayor Bill de Blasio. The cause was under investigation.
""We're here at the scene of an unspeakable tragedy. In the middle of the holiday season is a time when families are together. Tonight, here in the Bronx, there are families that have been torn apart,"" de Blasio said. 
Children ages one, two and seven and an unidentified boy died in the fire along with and four men and four women, local media reported. 
Four people were in hospital in critical condition ""fighting for their lives,"" the mayor said. Authorities said firefighters rescued 12 people from the building.
""People died on various floors of the apartment, ranging in age from 1 to over 50,"" Nigro told reporters. ""In a department that is surely no stranger to tragedy, we're shocked by the lives lost."" 
Two of the dead were found in a bathtub, according to cable news station NY1.
""People were screaming and that's how we knew there was trouble,"" eyewitness Kimberly Wilkins told WCBS-TV, an affiliate of CBS News. ""People were screaming, 'Fire. Help. Fire. Help.'""
The blaze erupted in the Belmont section of the Bronx, a primarily residential, close-knit neighborhood known as the ""Little Italy"" of the borough, adjacent to the Bronx Zoo and Fordham University.
New York is going through a bitter cold snap with temperatures in the low-teens Fahrenheit and high winds, which according to one media account, stoked flames inside the building as residents flung open doors and windows.
Wherever fire hoses sprayed, the ground was covered with sheets of ice, according to an NY1 reporter.
One witness, Rafael Gonzalez, who lives across the street from the building, told television station WCBS-TV, an affiliate of CBS News, he saw some youths on a fire escape of the burning building as the fire raged.
""What woke me up was the smoke, because I thought it was my building,"" he said. 
More than 160 firefighters responded to the four-alarm blaze, the New York City Fire Department said.
Pictures posted on Twitter by the fire department showed two fire trucks with aerial ladders extended to the upper floors of a brick building bathed in flood lights, and firefighters on the fire escape outside what appeared to be a second- or third-floor unit.

The number of civilian fire fatalities in New York City last year dropped to 48, the fewest in the 100 years since record-keeping began, the FDNY said on its website. Data on 2017 fire fatalities was not immediately available.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Friday China's military ambitions are becoming more apparent and tension between Taiwan and the mainland must not be resolved through military force.
Tsai has faced increasing hostility from China since she won election early last year, with China stepping up military drills around Taiwan. 
China suspects Tsai, from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, wants to push for the self-ruled island's formal independence, a red line for Beijing, which considers Taiwan a wayward province and sacred Chinese territory.
""China's military activities don't only impact the situation in the Taiwan Strait, but also in all of East Asia ... This is not a problem being faced alone by Taiwan,"" Tsai told reporters.
""All countries in this region who want to see peace and stability, have a consensus ... and China can't ignore this, that cross strait issues absolutely can't be resolved through military force but through peaceful means,"" Tsai said during a news conference on a stage flanked by two models of fighter jets. 
Tsai, however, said her island would not be passive in the face of a more hawkish China. 
""Over the past year, the morale of our military is steadily improving, support for our military is also continuously increasing. This is the most gratifying thing since I've become president. I hereby solemnly announce that our annual defense budget will grow steadily within a reasonable range."" 
Taiwan's defense ministry warned in a white paper this week that China's military threat was growing by the day, with the Chinese air force carrying out 16 rounds of exercises close to Taiwan over the past year or so.
Beijing says the drills are routine and that Taiwan had better get used to them.
""We live in a fast changing geopolitical environment; China's ambition in military expansion in the region is becoming more apparent, as evident by the People's Liberation Army's frequent aerial and naval activities,"" Tsai said.
China has warned Taiwan against ""using weapons to refuse reunification"" and China's state media has prominently featured pictures of Chinese jets flying close to the island.
Tsai has stressed she wants peace across the Taiwan Strait, but has pledged to defend Taiwan's security and way of life.
Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S.-made weapons, but has been pressing Washington to sell more advanced equipment.

Democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by Beijing. Taiwan's government has accused Beijing of not understanding what democracy is about when it criticizes Taipei.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has spent less than a quarter of the funds available for a program to clean up the Ganges river over the last two years, a federal audit has found, citing lapses in planning and financial management of a flagship scheme. 
The government had only used $260 million of the $1.05 billion earmarked for the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) program between April 2015 and March 2017, according to the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The water quality in eight of 10 towns surveyed along the Ganges did not meet outdoor bathing standards.
""The performance audit revealed deficiencies in financial management, planning, implementation and monitoring, which led to delays in achievement of milestones,"" the auditor said in its 160-page report which was presented to parliament last week.
The water resources ministry, which runs the NMCG, did not respond to a request for comment.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration committed $3 billion in 2015 for a five-year project to clean the 2,525-km (1,570-mile) river that remains heavily polluted despite being a water source for 400 million people.
Modi, who represents the holy city of Varanasi on the banks of the Ganges, had made a clean-up of the Ganges one of his key campaign promises in the 2014 presidential election. 
The Ganges is arguably one of the most revered rivers in the world - and one of the most polluted. It is worshipped by Hindus, who make up about 80 percent of India's 1.3 billion people. They call it Ganga Mata, or mother Ganga, and believe a dip in the river absolves a lifetime of sins. 
But the river, which stretches from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, is also a destination for waste produced by hundreds of factories - over three-quarters of the sewage generated in the towns and cities of India's crowded northern plains flows untreated into the Ganges.
When a Reuters reporter visited northern Kanpur city in March, the river in most parts of the town appeared black in color, with its many factories and tanneries dumping waste into the Ganges. The federal auditor's report contained pictures of untreated sewage being discharged directly into the river in several states.
SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS
The NMCG had set a target to award contracts for all sewage treatment plants by last year, but even by August this year it hadn't approved projects to treat nearly 1,400 million liters of sewage daily, the report said. ""Without stopping sewage going into the river, we cannot imagine a clean Ganga. That should be the top priority,"" said Rakesh Jaiswal, head of a Ganges-focused environmental group in Kanpur since 1993. ""(The report) is a sad commentary on the government's efforts to clean the river."" The NMCG told the auditor the sewage treatment problem would be resolved to an extent once projects under construction are completed, but it remained ""silent"" about its failure to meet its targets, the auditor's report said. Modi has been concerned about the slow pace of the Ganges clean-up drive and his personal secretary had demanded regular updates from project officials to track its progress, Reuters reported in April. (http://reut.rs/2nmX1X2) Modi's office didn't respond to a request for comment. India had set a 2018 deadline to clean the river, but local media in October quoted the government's new water resources minister as saying that the Ganges' water quality will likely only improve by March 2019. Environmentalists doubted that.  ""Meeting the (2019) target seems to be very difficult,"" said Sushmita Sengupta of the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment. ""Nothing has been done in a constructive way on the ground.""

598,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 02:30AM ET</span>","China ban on ivory sales begins Sunday, aims to curb elephant poaching","HONG KONG (Reuters) - A ban on ivory sales in China, the world's largest importer and end user of elephant tusks, takes effect on Sunday with wildlife activists calling it a vital step to reducing the slaughter of the endangered animals.
China has made a big push to eradicate ivory sales and demand has fallen since early 2014 because of a crackdown on corruption and slower economic growth. 
Public awareness campaigns featuring celebrities have helped boost awareness of the bloody cost of ivory. Wildlife groups estimate 30,000 elephants are killed by poachers in Africa every year.
""It is the greatest single step toward reducing elephant poaching,"" said Peter Knights, chief executive of the group WildAid.
China has allowed the sale of pre-convention ivory, which refers to products such as carvings and crafts acquired before the 1975 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), as long as it is accompanied by certificates.
The trade in pre-convention ivory has been legally thriving in China and Hong Kong since 1975, and environmental activists have long asserted that it has spurred demand for all ivory.
The ban on all ivory sales has already led to an 80 percent decline in seizures of illegal ivory entering China as well as a 65 percent decline in raw ivory prices, said conservation group WildAid.
Under the ban, China's 172 ivory-carving factories and retail outlets will also close. Some factories and shops started closing in March.
Illegal ivory supplies have also been rife in unlicensed shops and online across China.
This year, ivory prices in China were about 65 percent lower than 2014 levels, said WildAid, with retailers in some places trying to sell off stocks and offering heavy discounts before the ban.
The Chinese ban has been hailed by activists but they warn that Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, remains a big obstacle to the eradication of elephant poaching.
China's ban on sales down not apply in the former British colony, which has the largest retail market for ivory and has traded it for more than 150 years.
Hong Kong is a prime transit and consumption hub for ivory with more than 90 percent of consumers from mainland China.
Since 2003, Hong Kong has intercepted about 40 tonnes of illegal ivory, only about 10 percent of what is believed to have been smuggled in, WildAid said in a paper to the city's legislature in May.
Hong Kong set a timetable for a ban on ivory trading last year, with a phase-out time of five years. A final vote on the ban is expected in the city's legislature in early 2018.
Conservationist Zhou Fei said the Chinese ban could be a catalyst for the closure of ivory markets across Asia. 

However, Kenya-based conservation group Save the Elephants said this year that neighboring Laos has expanded its retail market more rapidly than any other country.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Phnom Penh court on Friday found veteran opposition chief Sam Rainsy guilty of defaming Prime Minister Hun Sen and ordered him to pay damages of $1 million, the latest blow to an opposition crippled by legal cases this year.
Sam Rainsy's opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved by the Supreme Court last month in a decision that also banned more than 100 CNRP lawmakers from politics ahead of a 2018 general election.
Rights groups have decried an ongoing crackdown against the political opposition and independent media. One group called the CNRP's dissolution the death of democracy in the country.
Hun Sen filed a $1-million defamation lawsuit against Sam Rainsy in January and accused him of defamation over claims he made in France that month that Hun Sen bribed an activist to break up the CNRP.
A judge at the Phnom Penh Municipal Court on Friday found Sam Rainsy guilty and ordered him to pay Hun Sen $1 million in damages and a fine of $2,500. It gave him a month to appeal.
Sam Rainsy, who resigned from the CNRP in February but rejoined last month, lives in exile in France.
Defamation convictions that he calls politically motivated drove him to flee Cambodia for France in 2015. 
In an interview with Reuters last month, Sam Rainsy said Cambodia was at a ""tipping point"".
Sam Sokhon, a lawyer for Sam Rainsy, said Friday's decision was unjust.
""I think that the court's verdict this morning did not provide justice to His Excellency Sam Rainsy"", Sam Sokhon told Reuters. ""I will discuss with him to appeal.""
Earlier this week Hun Sen vowed to extend his more than 30 years in power by at least another decade.

Metro Manila's top officer Oscar Albayalde said the vehicle, which was carrying seven people, including a woman who had been shot earlier that night, was on its way to a hospital when police opened fire after mistaking it for one driven by the woman's assailant. 
Albayalde said the police officers from Mandaluyong city, part of greater Manila, may have been given wrong information because they were told by village officials that the passengers of the vehicle were armed. 
""We can't totally blame them,"" Albayalde told a media briefing. 
Albayalde also relieved the chief of Mandaluyong police of his command pending the investigation.
""We are not hiding anything here. We're not discounting the possibility ... that there may be overkill or violation of our POP,"" Albayalde said, referring to Police Operational Procedures (POP).
Philippine police are already facing unprecedented scrutiny due to concerns about their conduct during anti-narcotics operations. Several opinion surveys have indicated dwindling trust of police accounts of operations that have killed close to 4,000 people.
Human rights groups and political opponents say executions of drug users and small-time peddlers have been widespread, but police insist those killed were all dealers who put up violent resistance.

Some 500 police officers took part in simultaneous raids across the Turkish capital, and many of those detained were foreign nationals, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported.
It said prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 46 people and that materials seized in the raids indicated some of the suspects had made preparations for an attack over New Year.
During New Year's celebrations a year ago, a man with an assault rifle shot dead 39 people including Turks and visitors from several Arab nations, India and Canada at an exclusive nightclub in Turkey's largest city Istanbul. 
Islamic State claimed responsibility for that shooting, one of a series of attacks believed to have been carried out by the jihadists and also by Kurdish militants in Turkey in the last couple of years. A trial of those allegedly involved in the nightclub attack began this month.

(Reuters) - Myanmar on Friday freed two journalists for Turkey's state broadcaster, their local interpreter and a driver after they completed a two-month jail sentence for violating an aircraft law by filming with a drone, a prison official said.
Cameraman Lau Hon Meng from Singapore, reporter Mok Choy Lin from Malaysia, Aung Naing Soe - a local journalist who was interpreting for the pair - and driver Hla Tin were released from a prison at Yamethin, near the capital Naypyitaw.
Police detained the two journalists on assignment for the TRT World television station and the two Myanmar men on Oct. 27, when they attempted to fly a drone near Myanmar's parliament building.
A court last month sentenced them to two months in prison under the colonial-era Anti-Aircraft Act. All four were until this week also facing an additional charge for importing the drone, and the two foreigners were also facing immigration charges.
""We released Aung Naing Soe and the crew at 7:20 am today because immigration and police have dropped the charges,"" said Aung Myo Chun, chief of Yamethin prison.
""They have served their two-month prison sentence under the Anti-Aircraft Act.""
A police officer told Reuters on Tuesday he had been ordered to drop the charges because the four had not intended to damage national security and to improve Myanmar's relations with the journalists' home countries, Singapore and Malaysia.
A local photographer said the two foreign nationals left Yamethin prison by car but Aung Naing Soe and Hla Tin walked out of the prison compound.
Later, Aung Naing Soe told Reuters by phone that the release was a surprise.
""We have been arrested unexpectedly, and now we are so glad to be unexpectedly released like this,"" he said. ""We didn't know that we would be released in the morning until last night.""
The case came amid tensions between Buddhist majority Myanmar and mostly Muslim countries like Turkey and Malaysia over Myanmar's treatment of the stateless Rohingya Muslim minority.
In early September, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused Myanmar of genocide in the western state of Rakhine, a charge that Myanmar denies. The United Nations has said an estimated 655,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine for Bangladesh since the military launched a crackdown on militants in the state in late August.
Two Reuters journalists, who had covered events in Rakhine, were arrested on Dec. 12 and are still in detention over accusations they violated the Official Secrets Act, also a hangover from British colonial rule in Myanmar.

Their families said at a news conference on Thursday that the reporters, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, told them they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents by policemen who had invited them for a meeting.

Australia earlier this year removed pilots from a list of eligible professions allowed to work in the country as so-called skilled migrants amid a crackdown to promote ""Australia-first"".
With a global shortage of pilots, Australia's international carriers have lost staff to competitors, forcing them to recruit from domestic carriers, who are in turn employing trained pilots from smaller regional airlines.
Unable to source enough pilots, Australia's regional carriers have been forced to cancel flights, but Mike Higgins, chief executive officer of the industry body, the Regional Aviation Association of Australia, said the country's government has told him it will ease restrictions in January.
""The government has said it will add pilots to the skilled migrant visa list in January and they will be able to work in Australia for two years,"" said Higgins.
Representatives for Australia's minister for home affairs Peter Dutton did not immediately respond to request for comment.
A relaxation of visa restrictions would be provide some relief to Australia's rural travelers, which have been beset by frequent flight cancellations.
According to Australian government data, 3 percent of domestic flights were canceled in November, the highest monthly level in nearly six years. Cancellations of Australian domestic flights hit a high of more than 5 percent in December 2011 when a volcanic ash cloud from Chile grounded flights.
The carriers that had the most cancellations were Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd and QantasLink, the regional carrier of Qantas Airways Ltd, the data showed.
Representatives for both companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Australia's center-right government can ill-afford to alienate rural voters, a central voter block for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who is struggling to keep his grip onto power. 
Australia's opposition Labor Party welcomed the likely visa relaxation but said the government must do more to improve the ability of locals to train as pilots.
""We need to make sure we can keep our planes in the air, you can't train pilots in just a day or a week or a month,"" Anthony Albanese told reporters on Friday.

""The problem is training enough Australian pilots to fulfill our domestic aviation needs.""

The size and impact of the protests could be an indication of whether the uproar over the pardon locks Kuczynski's already weak government into a political crisis, or peters out as he revamps his Cabinet and seeks new allies in Congress.
At least 40,000 people were expected to march in the capital Lima, and demonstrations were also planned in cities across the country and in foreign capitals, said Jorge Rodriguez, a representative of one of the activist groups organizing the protests.
""This isn't just a march against the pardon, it's also against President Kuczynski. We want him and all corrupt politicians out,"" he said.
Kuczynski cited medical grounds when he announced the pardon for the 79-year-old Fujimori, erasing his convictions for graft and human rights abuses less than halfway into a 25-year prison sentence, and shielding the former president from a pending trial. The timing, three days after Fujimori's loyalists in Congress unexpectedly saved Kuczynski from a motion to oust him, sparked speculation among critics that it was payback.
Fujimori, 79, governed Peru with an iron fist for a decade after being swept to power by a populist wave in 1990 elections. While many consider him a corrupt and ruthless dictator, others credit him with pulling Peru from economic ruin and quashing a violent leftist insurgency.
U.N. human rights experts called the pardon a major setback for the rule of law in Peru and an appalling ""slap in the face"" for Fujimori's victims.
Kuczynski, 79, reiterated on Thursday that the pardon was not the result of a political pact, saying it was fundamentally about forgiveness. ""The country can't remain divided by political struggles that only hold the country back from continuing to make progress,"" his office said in a statement.
On Tuesday, Fujimori apologized to the Peruvians he said he ""disappointed."" Speaking from a hospital bed in a video message, he thanked Kuczynski for the pardon and promised to support the president's call for national reconciliation.
Fujimori's opponents said it was too little, too late.
""We suffered from his murders...he still hasn't acknowledged his crimes,"" said Norma Mendez, the mother of a journalist killed in 1991 in what Peru's truth commission deemed an extrajudicial attack by government agents.
Protests against the pardon over Christmas ended in clashes.

Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, survived last week's effort by opposition members of Congress to remove him over alleged links to a corruption scandal. The president denied any wrongdoing.

608,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 11:00PM ET</span>",China says U.S. should do more to cut its 'enormous' opioid demand,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States should take action to reduce demand for the drugs fuelling its deadly opioid crisis rather than simply accusing China of being the major source, a top Chinese drug control official said.
""The biggest difficulty China faces in opioid control is that such drugs are in enormous demand in the U.S.,"" Yu Haibin of the China National Narcotics Control Commission said at a news briefing, the China Daily reported on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in October and said he discussed with Chinese President Xi Jinping how to ""stop the lethal flow"" of the drugs during his visit to China last month.
Opioids include prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic drug 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.
American law enforcement agencies and drug control experts say most of the fentanyl distributed in the United States, as well as its precursor chemicals, come from China.
While Chinese officials dispute that assertion, the government has taken steps to crack down on the production and export of them, and has placed fentanyl and other related compounds on its list of controlled substances.
Yu said the United States should intensify law enforcement and share more police intelligence with Chinese authorities to combat the problem.
China's drug control agency said on Thursday that five more precursor chemicals that can be used to produce fentanyl and methamphetamines had been added to its list of controlled substances, the China Daily reported. 
Wei Xiaojun, the deputy secretary-general of China's National Narcotics Commission, said last month that China did not ""deny or reject"" that some fentanyl produced in China had made its way to the United States but there was not enough evidence to say most of it originated from China.
The U.S. Department of Justice indicted two major Chinese drug traffickers in October on charges of making illegal versions of fentanyl and selling the highly addictive drug to Americans over the internet and through the international mail.

609,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 10:06PM ET</span>",Trump says China's stance on North Korea influences his trade policy,"By David Brunnstrom and Susan Heavey
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he had ""been soft"" on China on trade issues and said he was not happy that China had allowed oil shipments to go into North Korea.
""I have been soft on China because the only thing more important to me than trade is war,"" Trump said in an interview with The New York Times.
Earlier on Thursday, Trump said on Twitter that China has been ""caught"" allowing oil into North Korea and said such moves would prevent ""a friendly solution"" to the crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear program.
""Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!"" Trump wrote.
In The New York Times interview, Trump explicitly tied his administration's trade policy with China to the country's perceived cooperation in resolving the North Korea nuclear crisis.
""When I campaigned, I was very tough on China in terms of trade. They made — last year, we had a trade deficit with China of $350 billion, minimum. That doesn't include the theft of intellectual property, O.K., which is another $300 billion,"" Trump said, according to a transcript of the interview.
""If they're helping me with North Korea, I can look at trade a little bit differently, at least for a period of time. And that's what I've been doing. But when oil is going in, I'm not happy about that.""
China earlier on Thursday said there had been no U.N. sanction-breaking oil sales by Chinese ships to North Korea after a South Korean newspaper said Chinese and North Korean vessels had been illicitly linking up at sea to get oil to North Korea.
An official of the U.S. State Department said the U.S. government was aware of vessels engaged in such activity involving refined petroleum and coal.
""We have evidence that some of the vessels engaged in these activities are owned by companies in several countries, including China,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper this week quoted South Korean government sources as saying that U.S. spy satellites had detected Chinese ships transferring oil to North Korean vessels around 30 times since October.
U.S. officials have not confirmed details of this report.
The Trump administration has led a drive to step up global sanctions on North Korea in response to Pyongyang's efforts to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.
Washington says the full cooperation of China, North Korea's neighbor and main trading partner, is vital to the success of this effort, while warning that all options are on the table, including military ones, in dealing with North Korea.
The U.N. Security Council last week unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test, seeking to further limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.
The U.S.-drafted U.N. resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year.
It also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Security Council to further reductions if Pyongyang conducts another nuclear or ICBM test.
Documents seen by Reuters this month showed Washington called on the Security Council to blacklist 10 ships for circumventing sanctions by conducting ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels or transporting North Korean coal.
China and Russia subsequently asked for more time to consider the proposal.
The ships targeted for blacklisting were the Xin Sheng Hai (flag unknown); the Hong-Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore; the Togo-flagged Yu Yuan; Panama-flagged Glory Hope 1 (also known as Orient Shenyu), Kai Xiang and Billions No. 18; and the North Korean-flagged Ul Ji Bong 6, Rung Ra 2, Rye Song Gang 1, and Sam Jong 2.
In September, the Security Council put a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum products exports to North Korea.
China has repeatedly said it is fully enforcing all resolutions against North Korea, despite suspicion in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo that loopholes still exist.
Asked at a regular briefing whether Chinese ships were illegally providing oil to North Korean ships, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang reiterated that China, including the military, strictly enforced U.N. resolutions.
""The situation you have mentioned absolutely does not exist,"" he said.
A State Department spokesman, Michael Cavey, reiterated on Wednesday that the United States had called on all countries to cut economic ties with North Korea.
Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the conservative Center for the National Interest, said China would ""never, ever enforce the sanctions to the satisfaction of President Trump,"" in spite of the effort the U.S. president had invested in developing a personal relationship with China's president, Xi Jinping. 
""With President Trump's latest Tweet it seems the 'Bromance' between him and President Xi is finally over,"" he said.
""This was always bound to happen. China is actually more afraid of North Korea than America,"" Kazianis said, citing Chinese concerns about instability or collapse in North Korea if sanctions were fully applied.
U.S. Democratic Senator Ed Markey, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Twitter the North Korean threat had only increased since Trump took office and he had to find a way to get China to cut off crude oil supplies. 

""The solution is a coherent strategy, not bluster,"" he said.

610,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 08:40PM ET</span>",Indian state tense ahead of citizens list targeting 'illegal Bangladeshis',"By Zarir Hussain and Krishna N. Das
GUWAHATI, India/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has mobilized around 60,000 police and paramilitary troops in a sensitive border state ahead of the publication of a list of citizens it says will be used to detect and deport illegal immigrants - mainly Muslims - from neighboring Bangladesh.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took power in the eastern state of Assam for the first time last year, vowing to act against illegal Muslim residents who take away jobs from local Hindus.
On Sunday the state government will release a draft National Register of Citizens (NRC) after a census carried out for the first time since 1951.
The exercise could lead to communal tensions in Assam, which has the second highest percentage of Muslims of any Indian state. Muslims leaders have called the NRC a tool to make them stateless, likening themselves to Myanmar's persecuted Rohingya minority. (http://reut.rs/2l3As6G)
""The NRC is being done to identify illegal Bangladeshis residing in Assam,"" Himanta Biswa Sarma, Assam's finance minister who is also in charge of the citizenship register, told Reuters. ""All those whose names do not figure in the NRC will have to be deported. We're taking no chances and hence all security measures have been taken.""
Sarma said Hindu Bangladeshis who faced persecution there would be given shelter in India, in line with federal policy.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi had no immediate comment.
Bangladesh's Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said Dhaka had no knowledge of any plans to deport people. ""We didn't receive any information from the Indian government, neither formally nor informally,"" he said.
It is estimated that there are more than 2 million Muslims in Assam who trace their roots to Bangladesh.
To be recognized as Indian citizens, they must be able to produce documents proving that they or their family lived in the country before March 24, 1971. 
""My grandparents and my parents were all born in India but today we are finding it difficult to provide documents to support our claims that we are Indians,"" said Asiful Rahman, a teacher at an Islamic seminary in a Muslim-majority district of Assam.
""Our parents and grandparents were illiterate and did not keep any legal documents, and for that we are facing the test of proving our Indian nationality now.""
Tens of thousands of people fled to India from Bangladesh during its war of independence from Pakistan in the early 1970s. Most of them settled in Assam, in India's north-east, and the neighboring state of West Bengal, where there are similar demands to send back illegal Muslim immigrants.
""BAGS PACKED""
When Modi's BJP swept to power nationally in 2014, the election was marred by sectarian violence in Assam that killed more than 40 people. During that campaign, Modi told illegal immigrants in states bordering Bangladesh to have their ""bags packed"" ready to be sent home should he win. (reut.rs/1nt01vI)
Since taking office, meanwhile, the government has been making it easier for Hindus, Buddhists and Christians from Bangladesh and Pakistan to gain citizenship in India.
Proposed changes to the law would mean no Hindu or other minority from those countries who arrived in India before the end of 2016 would be considered illegal immigrants.
Modi's administration also plans to nearly halve the number of years Hindus and other minorities from the neighboring countries need for naturalization to six years, in line with a long-held belief on the religious right that India is the home for all Hindus. 
A pilot project to update the NRC in Assam in 2010, under the previous Congress government, had to be stopped due to what the government called ""law and order problems"". The current process is being monitored by the Supreme Court and it could be months or years before the list is finalised.
The Assam government has stepped up security after a senior Muslim leader told a news conference last month that any registration of citizens on the basis of religion would be ""devastating"" for the country and there could be ""unrest"".

""One needs a number of documents to prove the family lineage and nationality,"" said Rafiqul Ali, a college student in the Muslim-dominated Barpeta district of Assam. ""I know many of my friends and relatives who were unable to submit all the documents required to get names enlisted in the NRC.""

611,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",New York police poised to thwart New Year's Eve suicide bombers,"By Daniel Trotta
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Police Department is providing officers with specialized training to stop any suicide bombers at Sunday's New Year's Eve celebration, when up to 2 million people will flood the streets of Times Square (NYSE:SQ), officials said on Thursday.
The stepped-up training is in response to an attempted bombing in a Times Square subway station walkway on Dec. 11. It comes on top of increasingly stringent security for the city's New Year's Eve celebration in the years since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
The New York Police Department will also deploy observation teams trained to spot snipers, increase the number of explosive-detecting dogs and position more officers throughout the area this year.
Police have said they will incorporate lessons learned from what they have labeled as three terrorist attacks in the city in the past 15 months, in addition to their ongoing analysis of all attacks worldwide.
That intelligence will form part of the massive security operation for the ""ball drop"" celebration, a tradition that dates to 1907 and is now televised around the world.
""You will see an increase in heavy weapons, bomb squad personnel, radiological detection teams, and our technology to include over 1,000 cameras in and around the area of Times Square for the event,"" the NYPD's chief of counterterrorism, James Waters, told a news conference, two days before the event.
Officers involved in the New Year's Eve security operation will receive a tactical bulletin and a training video on suicide bombers that they will be able to review on their department-issued phones starting Friday.
""We owe it to the cops to give them some kind of guidelines,"" Waters said.
The training material will include instructions on protecting bystanders if officers suspect someone has a bomb and guidance on apprehending and disarming suspects with the assistance of the bomb squad, he said.
Police will also be on the lookout for snipers in response to the mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival on Oct. 1, when a 64-year-old American opened fire from his 32nd-floor hotel room, killing 58 people and wounding some 500.
Detectives posted in hotels will keep an eye on guests, and additional emergency services and critical response teams will be on hand, Police Commissioner James O'Neill said.
O'Neill declined to say how many of the department's 36,000 officers will work on New Year's Eve, in order to keep would-be attackers guessing.
People who want to see the New Year's Eve musical acts and other entertainment up close in Times Square will have to pass by dogs trained to detect explosives and heavily armed officers, go through a magnetometer to check for weapons, have their bags inspected, and then repeat all those steps a second time.
Police will again use dump trucks filled with sand, police cars and cement blocks to close streets starting at 11 a.m. on Sunday. About 125 parking garages in the vicinity will be emptied of all cars and sealed. 
Even so, police acknowledged a possible suicide bomber could manage to get close to large crowds of people before the checkpoints are set up, as evident by the Dec. 11 attack.
On that day, police said, a Bangladeshi man set off a homemade pipe bomb strapped to his body in a subway pedestrian tunnel beneath Times Square, wounding himself and two bystanders.

Asked how to stop someone with such an intent, Waters said, ""As a last resort: deadly physical force.""

MONROVIA (Reuters) - Former soccer star George Weah has won Liberia's presidential run-off election and will succeed incumbent Ellen Johnson Sirleaf next month, the country's first democratic transition in over 70 years. 
With 98.1 percent of the vote counted, Weah led with 61.5 percent to Vice President Joseph Boakai's 38.5 percent, National Elections Commission Chairman Jerome Korkoyah told reporters in the capital Monrovia on Thursday. 
At his party headquarters outside Monrovia, tears streamed down Weah's face as he greeted supporters from a balcony. Below, hundreds of young people sang and danced to a live performance of Hipco, Liberian hip hop music popular with the country's impoverished youth. 
""Success for George Weah is victory for the whole country,"" a 47-year-old engineer named Randall Zarkpah said as he walked home with his young son through streets ringing with honking car horns and loud cheers as dusk fell. 
""When you feel sick for some time and you receive proper medication - that is how I feel now. He will be good for our country. He is King George!"" 
Weah grew up in Clara Town slum in Monrovia and went on to become the only African to win FIFA World Player of the Year, starring for AC Milan, Paris St Germain and Chelsea.
His popularity at home fueled a previous run for president, in 2005. He won the first round then but lost the second round to Johnson Sirleaf, whom he will now succeed. 
His rags-to-riches story helped him tap into dissatisfaction with Johnson Sirleaf's 12-year tenure. She drew a line under years of civil war but drew criticism for failing to root out corruption or persistent poverty.
""My fellow Liberians, I deeply feel the emotion of all the nation,"" Weah wrote on Twitter after the results were announced. ""I measure the importance and the responsibility of the immense task which I embrace today. Change is on.""
Weah's critics, however, say he has offered few concrete policy proposals. His choice of running mate has also raised eyebrows: Jewel Howard-Taylor, the ex-wife of Charles Taylor, a former president of Liberia who is serving 50 years in a British prison for war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone.
""I think Weah is not fit for the work. He will see it,"" said Anthony Mason, 34, who had huddled around radios at the headquarters of Boakai's Unity Party for the results. 
Weah looked set to sweep 14 of Liberia's 15 counties in the run-off. Turnout in Tuesday's vote stood at 56 percent, the election commission said.
Earlier on Thursday, Boakai said he doubted that the vote was ""free, fair and transparent"", without elaborating. He did not say whether he might challenge the eventual result. 
The second round was delayed by more than a month after the third-place finisher in October's first round, backed by Boakai, alleged fraud. The Supreme Court ultimately rejected the challenge. 
The U.S.-based Carter Center and National Democratic Institute said on Thursday there were notable improvements in the handling of the run-off, echoing positive assessments from other international observers. 

Founded by freed U.S. slaves in 1847, Liberia is Africa's oldest modern republic. But the last democratic transfer of power occurred in 1944, a military coup took place in 1980 and a 14-year civil war ended only in 2003.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 06:30PM ET</span>","Reuters reporters held in Myanmar were handed papers, then arrested: families","YANGON (Reuters) - Family members of two Reuters reporters detained in Myanmar said on Thursday the pair had told them they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents by policemen they had gone to meet.
Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were arrested on Dec. 12 on suspicion of violating the country's Official Secrets Act. The Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying they were ""arrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces"".
The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.
In the first account of the circumstances of the arrests from the journalists themselves, Wa Lone's wife, Pan Ei Mon, told a news conference her husband said that he and Kyaw Soe Oo had a meeting at a restaurant on Dec. 12 with two police officers they had not met before.
The policemen handed them two rolled-up papers and said they could take the documents home and open them there, Pan Ei Mon said, quoting her husband.
""They took the two rolled papers and paid the bill and went out from the restaurant,"" she said. ""They were immediately grabbed by around seven or eight policemen who handcuffed them and arrested them. He told me that.""
Nyo Nyo Aye, Kyaw Soe Oo's sister, told the news conference that her brother had given her a similar account of the incident.
Police were not immediately available for comment.
On Wednesday, Lieutenant Colonel Myint Htwe, a senior staff officer from the Yangon Police Division, said: ""We took action because they committed the crime. It needs to be solved in court.""
The government has said that two policemen were arrested along with the two journalists, but has not given any information since on what has happened to them. It was not clear whether the two policemen arrested were the same two men the reporters met.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were remanded for a second two-week period in custody by a court on Wednesday and sent to Yangon's Insein prison. During the court hearing, they were allowed to meet their families and a lawyer for the first time since being arrested.
The families and lawyer Than Zaw Aung, who has been retained by Reuters, were also allowed to meet the journalists for about half an hour at the prison on Thursday.
Than Zaw Aung said at the news conference that the two journalists told him they were being held in the same block as prisoners facing murder and drugs charges, and were afraid to leave their cells. 
On Wednesday, the reporters said they had not been mistreated in custody.
""The situation is okay,"" Wa Lone said. ""We will face it the best we can because we have never done anything wrong. We have never violated the media law nor ethics.""
The British colonial-era Official Secrets Act carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
Government officials from some of the world's major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have previously called for the release of the two journalists. Several NGOs and journalist organizations have called the arrests an attack on the freedom of the press.
On Wednesday, a Reuters spokesperson reiterated demands that the journalists be freed.

""These two journalists are being held for simply doing their jobs and have done nothing wrong. It is time for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo to be released,"" the spokesperson said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An arctic blast sent most of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest into a deep freeze that set record lows in several spots on Thursday as forecasters warned the frigid temperatures could last through the New Year holiday.
A cold front bearing down on the Pacific Northwest was expected to dump as much as 3 feet (1 m) of snow from Friday morning in parts of Washington state and the northern Rocky Mountains, the National Weather Service said. 
The weather is set to test the mettle of hundreds of thousands in New York's Times Square (NYSE:SQ) as they ring in the New Year on Sunday night. Forecasters said the temperature is likely to dip under 10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 C), well below the typical average low for the day.
In Times Square, thousands were bundled up for a chill that hit the city. ""It's really cold but I love it. My fingers feel like they're going to break but it's OK,"" said Tashena Eason, 28, a registered nurse from Miami, Florida.
For a time, the hashtag #ItSoCold was the top trending U.S. topic on Twitter on Thursday. 
Meanwhile, Tioga, North Dakota, about 200 miles (320 km) north of Bismarck, was one of the coldest spots in the continental United States on Thursday at minus 15 F (minus 26 C) early on Thursday afternoon. 
For most of the region encompassing New England, northern Pennsylvania and New York, the National Weather Service issued wind chill advisories or warnings as temperatures were expected to be below 10 degrees F in a wide area.
For upstate New York, east of Lake Ontario, the NWS warned of ""dangerously"" cold wind chills of minus 5 F to minus 30 F through Friday. 
Erie, a city of about 100,000 on the shores of Lake Erie in northwest Pennsylvania, was expecting a fresh round of winter storms that could bring as much as an additional 10 inches (25 cm) of ""lake effect"" snow, forecasters said. The area is already buried under more than 65 inches from a record-breaking storm earlier this week.

At Erie's UPMC Hamot hospital – the only trauma center in the area – employees used their own four-wheel-drive vehicles to ferry snowbound workers to the hospital to ensure it could continue to operate. Some employees stayed overnight to avoid getting stranded, Jim Donnelly, the hospital's chief nursing officer, said on Thursday.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The head of Brazil's Supreme Court suspended parts of a Christmas decree from President Michel Temer granting pardons to convicted criminals on Thursday, saying Temer's actions needed further examination by the court.
Cármen Lúcia ruled largely in favor of a legal challenge by Brazil's top prosecutor, Raquel Dodge, who said on Wednesday that the pardons were unconstitutional and threatened a probe into the country's largest-ever corruption scandal.
The pardons traditionally granted by the Brazilian president around Christmas are applied to criminals meeting certain conditions, including having already served part of their sentence. 
But Temer drew sharp criticism from public prosecutors and on social media with his Dec. 21 decree that made the rules more generous and extended them to include people convicted of corruption-related crimes.
Justice Minister Torquato Jardim told Reuters on Thursday that the ministry would examine ways to rejig the pardons to allow them to go into effect, despite the judge's ruling.
""The president recommended that we study a way to accommodate those Brazilians who were excluded by the Supreme Court ruling,"" he said.
Prosecutor-General Dodge had requested the injunction on Wednesday to stop parts of the decree from going into effect. She said the pardons undermined the separation of powers and would grant impunity to those guilty of graft. 
""In her decision, Cármen Lúcia acts as a guardian of the Constitution, underlining the understanding that outside of their humanitarian purpose, pardons cannot be awarded,"" Dodge said in a statement after the ruling on Thursday.
A nearly four-year corruption investigation in Brazil, known as Operation Car Wash, has resulted in dozens of powerful business leaders and politicians being jailed for kickbacks, usually involving private enterprises paying billions of dollars in bribes to win contracts with state-run companies.
Temer's decree ordered that, with some caveats, non-violent, first-time offenders who have already served one-fifth of their sentence are eligible for pardon, compared to one-quarter previously. The decree also eliminated prior terms that barred prisoners with sentences longer than 12 years from being pardoned.

In a newspaper editorial, Jardim wrote that the decree was aimed at pardoning criminals such as the more than 70,000 people jailed for theft and not the 50 or so imprisoned for corruption. Only one of those imprisoned for corruption would likely be eligible for pardon under the decree, he said.

Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Sunday some of the 1,400 Italian troops now stationed in Iraq could be transferred to the Sahel region in West Africa - which includes Niger - after victories against Islamist militants in Iraq.
Gentiloni said the redeployed troops could also help to combat terrorism in the Sahel.
The General Staff said in a statement that a reconnaissance mission was underway in Niger to help decide the scale of the assistance, which the African country's government has requested but which still needs to be approved by Italy's parliament.
If the necessary approval is given, Italy would aim to gradually send up to 470 troops, probably posting an average of 250 over the course of a year, the statement said.
""The aim of the mission is to increase the operational capacity of the Niger forces and put them in a position to guarantee stability in the area and fight illegal trafficking of migrants,"" it added.
Italy's president dissolved parliament on Thursday ahead of an election due in March, but lawmakers will continue to meet, and could approve Gentiloni's request to transfer the personnel.
Italy is especially keen to help tackle the people-smuggling gangs because it has borne the brunt of seaborne illegal migration to Europe from Africa.

More than 600,000 people have made the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean from Libya in the past four years. Arrivals have fallen sharply since officials working for the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli persuaded smugglers to stop boats leaving and the Libyan coastguard stepped up interceptions at sea.

618,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 04:40PM ET</span>","Italy to vote on March 4, with hung parliament feared","By Gavin Jones and Isla Binnie
ROME (Reuters) - Italy will vote on March 4 in an election expected to produce a hung parliament, instability and possible market turbulence in the euro zone's third largest economy.
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni's cabinet set the date of the vote after the president dissolved parliament on Thursday, formally opening an election campaign which in practice has already been raging bitterly for weeks.
With opinion polls suggesting no one will win a parliamentary majority, Gentiloni said he would remain in office and ensure continuity until a new administration was in place.
As things stand, a center-right alliance around Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) looks set to take the largest number of seats - potentially catapulting the 81-year-old four-times premier back to center stage even though he cannot become prime minister due to a tax fraud conviction.
Gentiloni told reporters at the end of his one-year spell in power that Italy should not fear uncertainty, noting that it was now common to many European countries.
""We mustn't dramatize the risk of instability, we are quite inoculated against it,"" he said, in reference to Italy's frequent changes of government, adding that elsewhere in Europe there has been ""an Italianisation of political systems"".
Germany is locked in talks to produce a new government after inconclusive elections, while Spain and Portugal have minority governments and Britain is in tangled negotiations over its exit from the European Union.
However, Italy, with the largest public debt in the euro zone after Greece's and one of the bloc's highest jobless rates, is considered particularly vulnerable. 
Its economy is on course this year for its firmest growth since 2010, but it remains among the most sluggish performers in Europe as it has been since the start of monetary union in 1999.
REVOLVING DOORS
Gentiloni is the third prime minister since the last election in 2013, which also produced no clear winner. His predecessor, Matteo Renzi, quit in December 2016 after voters threw out his planned constitutional reforms in a referendum. 
Speaking earlier on Thursday at the prime minister's traditional year-end news conference, Gentiloni appealed to parties not to peddle fear and make unrealistic promises.
All the main political forces are pledging to raise the budget deficit and slash taxes despite record high public debt, and immigration is set to be a central theme of the campaign, with right-wing parties frequently warning of a migrant ""invasion"".
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement leads opinion polls with about 28 percent of the vote, followed by the ruling Democratic Party (PD), of which Gentiloni is a member, on around 23 percent.
However, most seats in parliament are seen going to a conservative alliance, with Berlusconi's Forza Italia on around 16 percent and the right-wing Northern League and Brothers of Italy on 13 and 5 percent respectively.
The PD's support has been falling, hurt by banking scandals and internal splits, and there has been speculation that Gentiloni may take over from its leader Renzi as its candidate for prime minister at the election.
Gentiloni, whose popularity ratings are higher than Renzi's, refused to be drawn on this, but advised the PD to reject populism and run a sober campaign as ""a tranquil party of government"".
""This is the message the PD has to give, and if it does so I think it will regain support,"" he said.
Although the presidency is usually a mainly ceremonial role, President Sergio Mattarella is likely to become a central figure if the election produces no clear winner. 
He is expected to ask the center right to try to form a government if, as expected it is the largest coalition. But if it cannot muster a majority then the second chance may fall to the maverick 5-Star if it is still the largest party.

Its leader Luigi Di Maio said on Thursday he would work for a policy deal with other parties after the election, shifting away from the movement's previous refusal to form alliances.

Saul Galindo, a lawmaker for the opposition center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution, headed the justice committee in the Jalisco state congress, according to its website.
Galindo was at home in the town of Tomatlan when gunmen arrived and shot him, a spokeswoman from the state attorney general's office said. Galindo was running for mayor of Tomatlan, according to his Twitter feed.
Tomatlan lies in the western part of the state, an area where the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of the country's most powerful drug gangs, has a strong presence.
Mexico holds a string of national, state and local elections on July 1, including in Jalisco and its 125 municipalities.
The motive for the slaying was unclear, said the office of the state attorney general, who is investigating the case.
Earlier this week, an activist for the center-left Citizens' Movement, the party which holds the mayoralty of state capital Guadalajara, was also shot dead in Jalisco.
Elections in Mexico can cause violence in areas where gangs seek to influence local politics.

620,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 04:17PM ET</span>","At least 109 civilians killed by Saudi coalition's raids, U.N. says","GENEVA (Reuters) - A Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen has killed 109 civilians in air strikes in the past 10 days, including 54 people at a crowded market and 14 members of one family on a farm, the top U.N. official in the country said on Thursday. 
The fighting is futile and absurd, U.N. resident coordinator Jamie McGoldrick said, in unusually direct criticism of the campaign being waged by the coalition against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement.
The Saudi-led coalition, which is backed by the United States, Britain and others, denounced the charges, saying the information lacked credibility. McGoldrick appeared to be taking the Houthi side in the conflict, the Saudis said. 
Citing initial reports from the U.N. human rights office, a statement by McGoldrick said air strikes hit a crowded market in the Al Hayma sub-district of Attazziah in Taiz governorate on Tuesday, killing 54 and injuring 32. 
Eight of the dead and six of the injured were children, according to the reports.
On the same day, an air strike on a farm in Attohayta district of Hodeidah governorate killed 14, and air strikes elsewhere killed a further 41 civilians and injured 43 over the past 10 days.
""These incidents prove the complete disregard for human life that all parties, including the Saudi-led coalition, continue to show in this absurd war that has only resulted in the destruction of the country and the incommensurate suffering of its people, who are being punished as part of a futile military campaign by both sides,"" McGoldrick said.
Under international law, the warring sides must spare civilians and civilian infrastructure, he added.
A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said he regretted the information that came in McGoldrick's statement.
""This statement creates a continuous state of doubt about the information and data used by the United Nations, and challenges its credibility,"" the coalition spokesman said in a statement carried by Saudi state news agency SPA.
""As the coalition spokesman condemns this biased stand, he asserts the need for the United Nations to review the mechanism of humanitarian work and the competence of its employees working in Yemen and to monitor their performance,"" SPA said, citing the statement.
The United Nations has no up-to-date estimate of the death toll in Yemen. It said in August 2016 that according to medical centers at least 10,000 people had been killed. 

The United Nations says Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with about 8 million people on the brink of famine, a cholera epidemic that has infected 1 million people, and economic collapse in what was already one of the Arab world's poorest countries.

The battle for Benghazi, waged between forces led by General Khalifa Haftar and an array of Islamist militants and other fighters, has been part of a broader conflict since Libya slipped into turmoil following the 2011 fall of strongman Muammar Gaddafi.
Haftar had declared victory in July but fighting continued in one area, Khreibish.
Commander Wanis Bukhamada, head of army special forces, said the eastern forces now fully controlled the district.
""We declare in this moment the liberation of Benghazi from terrorists,"" he told Reuters. 
Haftar launched his ""Operation Dignity"" campaign in May 2014, slowly gaining the upper hand against Islamist militants and former rebels who fought Gaddafi in the 2011 uprising.
Haftar is aligned with a government and parliament based in eastern Libya. He has rejected a U.N.-backed government based in the capital, Tripoli, and indicated he wants to run for president in an election expected next year.
He is popular with some in the east tired of chaos but he remains a divisive figure in the rest of the North African oil-producing nation.

The Dec. 15 incident in the occupied West Bank was captured on video and posted on the Internet, drawing attention on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide.
Palestinians hailed the teenager, Ahed Tamimi, as a hero. Israelis debated whether the officer, who along with another soldier was also kicked by her, had done the right thing by opting not to strike back.
The incident occurred at the entrance to Tamimi's family home in Nabi Saleh, a village in the West Bank, during what the army said was stone-throwing at soldiers. Weekly protests against Israeli settlement policy have been held there for years.
The military said in a statement that the officer ""acted professionally"" but right-wing Israeli politicians described his behavior as humiliating.
Three days after a video clip of the confrontation was broadcast on Israeli television, Tamimi - who can be heard on the video clip shouting at the soldiers to leave - was arrested. 
At Thursday's hearing, in a military courtroom in Ofer prison near the Palestinian city of Ramallah, prosecutors said they intended to indict the teenager on charges that include aggravated assault and insulting a soldier.
Prosecutors asked the court to extend her detention for several days to give them time to prepare the charge sheet.

Tamimi made news two years ago when she was pictured biting a soldier who tried to arrest her younger brother.

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Two sons of Saudi Arabia's late King Abdullah have been released from detention at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel, days after nearly two dozen other detainees in the kingdom's two-month-old anti-corruption campaign were also freed.
Saudi Arabia's attorney general approved the release of Prince Meshaal bin Abdullah and Prince Faisal bin Abdullah after they reached financial settlements with the government, a senior Saudi official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The source did not elaborate on the settlements.
The attorney general had not yet reached a decision on whether to release a third brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, the source said.
A related member of the royal family, Princess Nouf bint Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud, tweeted photos of the two princes and exclamations of thanks on Thursday.
Saudi security forces rounded up some 200 princes, ministers and business leaders and converted the Ritz-Carlton into a luxurious prison for them in early November in what Riyadh said was a crackdown on corruption.
The move was also widely seen by analysts as helping Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman consolidate his grip on power, after he ousted his cousin as heir to the throne in the summer.
The most powerful of King Abdullah's sons, former National Guard chief Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, was released last month after agreeing to pay the government $1 billion.
Prince Miteb had been the last member of Abdullah's Shammar branch of the family to retain a key position in the Saudi power structure, after Prince Meshaal and Prince Turki were relieved of their posts as governors in 2015.
Saudi newspaper Okaz reported on Tuesday that 23 individuals had been released after reaching deals with the government and that more were expected to follow in the days ahead.
Others who had not reached settlements would face trial, the report said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The United States and Turkey lifted all visa restrictions on Thursday after Washington said Ankara had kept to assurances no further U.S. mission staff would be targeted for performing official duties, following detention of two earlier this year.
But Turkey swiftly denied having granted such assurances in the affair that has tested relations since the two local employees of the U.S. consulate in Istanbul were held on suspicion of ties to last year's failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan.
The United States suspended visa services at its missions in Turkey in October and Turkey reciprocated. In November, Washington said it was resuming limited services upon getting assurances on the safety of its local staff.
""Based on adherence to these assurances, the Department of State is confident that the security posture has improved sufficiently to allow for the full resumption of visa services in Turkey,"" the U.S. Embassy in Ankara said on Thursday.
It said the United States continued to have concerns about the two employees detained.
Turkey, while announcing the end of restrictions on the issue of visas to U.S. citizens, took issue with the U.S. declaration.
""We do not find it right for the United States to claim it had received assurances from Turkey and misinform the U.S. and Turkish publics,"" the Turkish Embassy in Washington said in a statement.
Turkey's lira firmed to 3.78 against the U.S. dollar after the statement, its highest level since Oct. 31, and the main share index BIST100 climbed 2.08 percent to reach its highest closing level ever.
Relations between the two NATO allies have become strained in the last year with Turkey angered by what it sees as the U.S. reluctance to hand over Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for the coup attempt in July of 2016. 
Turkey was further annoyed by U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.

More recently, Turkey took a leading role in the United Nations to pass a resolution denouncing a U.S. move to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Hundreds of Venezuelans took to the streets in poor parts of Caracas overnight to protest a shortage of pork for traditional Christmas meals in the latest symptom of social discontent during a brutal economic crisis.
President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government had promised to provide subsidized meat to Venezuelans at the end of a fourth year of recession in the OPEC nation - but in many parts it did not materialize and frustration has boiled over.
Local media and Twitter users posted images of hundreds of people standing on streets and burning trash in Caracas late on Wednesday complaining about the failed pork deliveries. 
Some pockets of protests continued on Thursday morning, in what some social media users dubbed the ""pork revolution"".
Maduro, who has been alleging a foreign-led ""economic war"" against his government, went on state TV to blame Portugal for failing to deliver pork imports in time for Christmas. 
""What happened to the pork? They sabotaged us. I can name a country: Portugal,"" Maduro said.
""We bought the pork, signed the agreements - but they pursued the bank accounts of the boats,"" he added, without giving further details. 
Another senior official said Washington, which has imposed sanctions on the Maduro government, had leant on Lisbon.
""The Portuguese government certainly has no power to sabotage pork (deliveries). We live in a market economy. Companies are in charge of exports,"" Portugal’s Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva told Portuguese radio station TSF.
He added that he would seek information from the Portuguese embassy in Venezuela to clarify the situation.
There was no immediate response from the United States.
Maduro frequently blames the opposition, United States and other foreign powers for the country's economic and social crisis in which millions are suffering shortages of basic products, hyperinflation and a crumbling infrastructure.
The pork protests add to the scattered demonstrations and roadblocks around Venezuela during the Christmas holiday period over the shortages, power-cuts, high prices and fuel rationing. Twenty-eight people were arrested for looting in southern Bolivar state.
Critics blame the government's mishandling of the economy, plus rampant corruption and inefficiency, during nearly two decades of leftist rule in the nation of 30 million people. 
""With or without sabotage, no one will take away the happiness of Christmas from the people,"" Maduro said late on Wednesday.

Critics were scathing. ""They'll probably blame Christopher Columbus for hyper-inflation,"" scoffed one exiled opposition leader Antonio Ledezma.

The comments, made to al-Mayadin television channel during a long interview on Tuesday, had just started attracting attention. 
Lebanon has no official relations with Israel and tensions have risen this year between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah group. Israel and Hezbollah, the group it describes as the greatest security threat on its border, have fought wars against each other.
A former government minister called on Bassil to resign and a member of parliament also criticized him. 
Bassil's office later said al-Mayadin had distorted his comments through its editing of the interview, without explaining how. 
""We are not against Israel living in security,"" he was shown saying in a clip that circulated widely in Lebanon on social media. 
Israel has targeted Hezbollah positions several times this year in Syria, where the group, which is in Lebanon's coalition government, is fighting on the Syrian government's side in the civil war against rebels and Islamic State. 
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said this month that after the group's success in Syria, where rebels are on the back foot and Islamic State has been militarily defeated, it will focus on its confrontation with Israel. 
He called on allied Shi'ite militia in the region to join Hezbollah in developing a strategy against Israel. 
The al-Baqer Brigade, a militia in Syria, posted a picture on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Dec. 26 of what it said was one of its commanders identified as Haj Hamza Abu al-Abbas visiting the Israeli border in southern Lebanon. 
An Iraqi militia commander also appeared in a video recently on Lebanon's border with Israel, in what was seen in Lebanon as a demonstration of the growing clout of Hezbollah and its regional allies.

""A humanitarian pardon has been granted to someone convicted of serious crimes after a fair trial, whose guilt is not in question and who does not meet the legal requirements for a pardon,” they said in a statement. 
Kuczynski pardoned the ailing Fujimori three days after Fujimori loyalists in the opposition-ruled Congress saved Kuczynski from being ousted in a corruption scandal.
“We are appalled by this decision. It is a slap in the face for the victims and witnesses whose tireless commitment brought him to justice,"" said the statement, issued jointly by the U.N. working group on enforced disappearances and by U.N. special rapporteurs Agnès Callamard and Pablo de Greiff.
They are independent experts mandated by the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate extrajudicial executions and the promotion of justice respectively.
Fujimori had served 12 years of a 25-year sentence for corruption and human rights crimes in his 1990-2000 right-wing government. Kuczynski's decision cleared him of convictions and shields him from being tried in pending judicial processes.
The U.N. experts said his conviction for crimes including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and kidnapping had been hailed as a major achievement in the fight against impunity, and international law restricted the granting of pardons in such serious cases.
They said his pardon was politically motivated and undermined the work of the Peruvian judiciary and the international community to achieve justice, adding: ""It is also a major setback for the rule of law in Peru.""

Kuczynski's government has repeatedly denied that a pardon for Fujimori was part of political negotiations.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was the first such repatriation of French children from Iraq.
France, like other European nations, is wrestling with how to deal with suspected militants and their families seeking to return from combat zones in Iraq and Syria, as well as those in detention, after Islamic State surrendered huge swathes of territory under military pressure.
It has suffered a series of deadly militant attacks over the past three years and is grappling with the threat of homegrown militancy as well as the risks posed by Islamic State fighters slipping back across French borders. 
""Their return was organized in coordination with the authorities in Iraq,"" a foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters.
French media reported that the family had left France for Iraq in 2015. The father was killed during the battle for Mosul and Iraqi forces later detained the mother and her four children in July, media said.
She and her youngest child remain in detention in Iraq, said Vincent Brengarth, the lawyer acting on her behalf. Her three older children, aged between three and eight years, were now in foster care after arriving back on Dec. 18.
Reuters revealed in September that Iraqi authorities were holding about 1,400 foreign wives and children of suspected Islamic State combatants at a single camp after government forces routed the jihadist group from Mosul, its last major urban redoubt in Iraq.
It was not clear if the three children had been among the same group.
French officials have indicated a preference for their citizens held in Iraq and found to be affiliated to Islamic State to be prosecuted there, although in mid-November President Emmanuel Macron said the fate of women and children should be examined on a case-by-case basis.
The head of France's domestic spy agency last month said some 700 men and women either of French nationality or who had resided in France, as well as 500 children, were in Iraq and Syria and linked to the militants. Several hundred others have already slipped back into France.

Ten of the indicted men are already in detention, the Sarajevo state prosecutor's office said in a statement on Thursday.
""Fourteen defendants are accused of war crimes including murder of several dozens Serb civilians, both men and women of different age, torture, robbery and persecution of nearly the whole Serb population from the Konjic area.""
Bosnian Serbs, Bosniak Muslims and Croats alike committed war crimes during Bosnia's 1992-95 conflict, though the majority of those convicted by local and international war crimes courts have been Serbs.
The war began in 1992 when Bosnian Serb forces, in response to a Muslim-Croat vote for independence from Serbian-led federal Yugoslavia, attacked cities and towns aiming to carve out an ethnically pure Serb state.
Bosniaks joined forces with Croats in regions where they were in a majority, such as Konjic, from which they persecuted Serb inhabitants, but they later fought each other.
More than 100,000 were killed and about 2 million driven from their homes during the war.
Also on Thursday, the prosecutor's office indicted four Bosnian Serb army officers for alleged genocide against Muslims who were fleeing the eastern town of Srebrenica after it fell into Serb hands in July 1995. 
Serb forces commanded by General Ratko Mladic slaughtered more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys from Srebrenica, the worst atrocity in Europe since World War Two. Mladic was jailed for life for the massacre by a U.N. war crimes tribunal last month.
The four ex-Serb officers from the eastern town of Vlasenica are accused of stopping a convoy carrying Muslims fleeing Srebrenica, separating men from women and robbing them. 
""The women were raped and sexually molested, while more than 20 men were taken and detained in a nearby school, where...they were kept in inhuman conditions...and on July 13-14 (1995) taken and executed in the village of Mrsici,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
Earlier this month, it indicted another four Bosnian Serb former army officers from Vlasenica, including the town's current mayor, for murder, torture and persecution of nearly the whole Bosniak population in the town.

COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - The bride's hands are covered with decorative patterns inked in henna, the groom is perfumed and the guests feast and dance the night away in a colorful tent.
In most ways, the happiest day of Shofika Begum and Saddam Hussein's lives mirrors that of couples getting married the world over. 
The big difference is where the two are living and celebrating their wedding - at Kutupalong refugee camp, one of several sprawling settlements of bamboo poles and plastic sheets in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, where about 660,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, most of whom are stateless, have sought refuge since late August. (Click http://reut.rs/2E1hFAK to see a picture package of the wedding)
Rohingya militant attacks on Myanmar security forces on Aug. 25 triggered a brutal Myanmar counter-attack that the United Nations has called a textbook example of ethnic cleansing. 
That, in turn, sparked what the U.N. refugee agency has called the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis.
Myanmar's military says the crackdown was a legitimate counter-insurgency operation, exonerating its security forces of all accusations of atrocities in an internal investigation.
Both the bride and groom are from Kha Maung Seik, a village in Maungdaw township in Myanmar's Rakhine State. The village is known to the Rohingya as Foira Bazar for its market of about 1,000 shops.
Saddam, 23, and Shofika, 18, planned to marry even before the latest violence.
Saddam, whose family were shopkeepers in Myanmar, said they fled after military forces burnt their homes. He lost touch with Shofika for a couple of weeks during that chaotic period, but they were reunited in Kutupalong camp. 
Three months later, they are celebrating their wedding. 
A Muslim cleric officiates the prayers and performs the religious ceremony to marry the couple in a small tent decorated with blankets in vibrant patterns. Only men attend this ceremony. 
Shofika spends much of the wedding day in a separate tent, being attended to by female relatives. 
The party begins shortly after, with a large meal served in a big tent to 20 guests at a time. A cow was slaughtered the day before and a curry prepared for the feast. 
Men are served first, then the women sit down and lastly, the children eat. The free meal is distributed to children in plastic bags, but a scuffle that erupts means that some of it ends up in the mud. 
""Here, at least, we don't have to pay"", Saddam says, when asked how he feels about getting married at the camp, explaining that the administrator in their village had asked for a payment of 500,000 kyat ($370) from couples wanting to wed.
After everyone has had their fill, the long tables and plastic chairs are removed, and a loudspeaker is hooked up. 
It's time for a dance. 
A professional dancer and his two assistants take to the floor with flashy moves to warm up the crowd. Soon, everyone is clapping and getting on their feet. 
The happiness of their wedding day belies the uncertainty that Saddam and Shofika feel about their future in the overcrowded refugee camp. 
""We will wait to have children,"" Saddam said.

""We need to know whether we are staying here or going back to Myanmar first. I would only return if we are given Myanmar nationality.""

Duterte has called the huge island of Mindanao a ""flashpoint for trouble"" and atrocities by Islamist and communist rebels. He placed it under martial law in May after Islamist militants took over the city of Marawi.
The five-month siege was the majority-Roman Catholic Philippines' biggest security crisis in decades, killing more than 1,100 people, mostly militants.
Lawmakers this month overwhelmingly backed his plan to extend martial law there through 2018, which would be the country's longest period of emergency rule since the 1970s era of strongman Ferdinand Marcos.
The militarization had displaced thousands of the indigenous Lumad people and some had been killed, said Victoria Tauli-Corpuz and Cecilia Jimenez-Damary, the U.N. Human Rights Council's special rapporteurs on the rights of indigenous peoples and internally displaced people.
""They are suffering massive abuses of their human rights, some of which are potentially irreversible,"" the two said in a statement late on Wednesday.
""We fear the situation could deteriorate further if the extension of martial law until the end of 2018 results in even greater militarization.""
The Philippines was obliged by international law to protect indigenous people and ensure human rights abuses were halted and prosecuted. ""This includes killings and attacks allegedly carried out by members of the armed forces,"" they said.
The government fears that mountainous, jungle-clad Mindanao, a region the size of South Korea, could attract foreign militants.
The U.N. experts said they had information suggesting that 2,500 Lumads had been displaced since October, and that Lumad farmers had been killed by military forces on Dec. 3 in the province of South Cotabao.
""We fear that some of these attacks are based on unfounded suspicions that Lumads are involved with militant groups or in view of their resistance to mining activities on their ancestral lands,” the pair said, without giving further details.
In Manila, opposition members of the House of Representatives filed a petition with the Supreme Court questioning the legality of extending martial law.
They asked the court to declare the extension null and void ""for having been requested and granted without sufficient factual basis on the existence of an actual invasion or rebellion as required by the constitution"".
A spokesman for Duterte said the martial law extension was needed ""to quell the remaining terrorists who brought destruction to Marawi and its neighboring communities"". 
Its legal and factual basis had been ""clearly established based on the security assessment by our ground commanders"", Harry Roque added in a statement.
Since Duterte took power in June last year, the Philippines has also drawn international criticism for the killing of about 3,900 people in police anti-drugs operations. Police deny allegations by human rights advocates that many of the killings were executions.

""Actions like these are in direct contradiction to the priority of building military and political trust between Russia and Japan, and, unfortunately, will impact in a negative way on the whole atmosphere in bilateral relations, including negotiations over the peace treaty problem,"" Zakharova told a weekly briefing.
""In practice it will mean one more breach of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty by the Americans with, in fact, Japan's assistance"", she said.
Russia and Japan never formally ended their hostilities after World War Two because of a dispute over a chain of islands in the Pacific.

Concluding a peace treaty between Russia and Japan would involve Moscow examining how it could be affected by Tokyo's security commitments to its allies, Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month.

Navalny, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday announced a series of rallies across Russia on Jan. 28 to press home his call for a boycott of the election, in which he has been barred from running.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Navalny's move would be carefully studied.
""We have the appropriate agencies who, as you know, check such calls and plans to see if they are lawful,"" Peskov told a conference call with reporters. ""There is no doubt that this will be done.""
Polls indicate that Putin, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for 18 years, is on course to comfortably win re-election on March 18, but Navalny says his own exclusion makes a farce of the ballot. 
An election boycott could pose a problem for the Kremlin, which is keen to ensure a high turnout in the election to help confer legitimacy on Putin's expected victory amid some signs of apathy among voters.
Under Russian law, the time and place of public rallies must be agreed in advance with the authorities, who have often declined to authorize them in the past, citing conflicting events or security concerns. 
When the opposition has gone ahead anyway, the police have broken up rallies by force and detained participants.

Navalny, who has organized some of the biggest anti-government demonstrations in years, has been jailed three times this year and charged with breaking the law for organizing public meetings and rallies.

The evacuation, which started on Tuesday after a deal between Damascus and a rebel faction, involved letting some patients leave rebel-held eastern Ghouta in return for insurgents releasing detainees.
International aid agencies voiced concern about the terms of the deal. 
U.N. humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland told the BBC: ""It is a not a good agreement if they exchange sick children for detainees -- that means children become bargaining chips in some tug of war.""
Valerie Petitpierre, the ICRC's operations coordinator for the region, said the ICRC continued to insist that humanitarian action should not be used as a bargaining chip.
Last month, the United Nations called on world powers to help arrange the medical evacuation of 500 people, including 167 children, from eastern Ghouta, dubbing it a ""humanitarian emergency.""
The world body estimates 400,000 civilians have been under siege in eastern Ghouta by President Bashar al-Assad's forces. 
The enclave is a densely populated pocket of satellite towns and farms and the only major rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus. The military has steadily defeated pockets of armed rebellion in western Syria over the past year, with the help of Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias.
There were varying reports of how many people had been evacuated. 
Syria's state-run Ikhbariya television reported on Thursday that 35 medical cases had been evacuated by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) and 34 detainees held by the rebels released. 
The ICRC said it and SARC had started evacuating 29 serious medical cases late on Tuesday and the ICRC's Petitpierre said on Thursday that 16 had been evacuated so far. 
The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) said on Twitter that 12 children were evacuated from the area overnight to receive medical care in hospitals in Damascus. It earlier said four had been evacuated on Tuesday.
Yasser Delwan, a Jaish al-Islam political official in Ghouta, said on Wednesday that SARC had mediated between Damascus and the rebels for the swap.
""We worked to get them out through the Red Crescent, and we are working on evacuating the rest of the nearly 500 cases out,"" he said. But there was no indication of whether more evacuations would be allowed, he added.
On Sunday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was working with Russia, Assad’s ally, on the evacuations. Ankara has backed some rebel factions in the Syrian war.

Syrian state news agency SANA said on Thursday that hundreds of ""kidnapped"" still remain in eastern Ghouta, most of whom are women and children.

MANILA (Reuters) - Carrying firearms and search warrants, and prepared for fierce resistance, about 30 Philippine anti-drugs agents pour out of three vans in a dramatic raid in one of the capital's illicit drugs hotbeds.
Some wearing flak jackets, others carrying rifles, the agents burst into three suspected drug dens in Manila's Tondo area and in under an hour, arrest all four targets, without a drop of blood spilled.
The operation by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, or PDEA, was one of the success stories of an 18-month-old war on drugs. 
That campaign has faced intense criticism from United Nations' officials, some governments, and human rights groups, because it has led to the killing of nearly 4,000 mostly poor Filipinos, largely by the police. 
Human rights monitors allege that executions by the police have been commonplace. The police say that the killings have been in self defense.
In what he suggested was a move to appease such criticism, President Rodrigo Duterte in October put PDEA in charge of his signature campaign, challenging an agency with just a fraction of the manpower of the police. He has since ordered the police to play only a supporting role. 
Reuters journalists spent more than a week with a PDEA unit in Manila earlier this month and joined them in the Tondo operation, which agents said followed weeks of surveillance. 
Duterte's critics say his drugs war is targeting street-level dealers and lacks commitment to go after drug cartels behind the methamphetamine supply.
PDEA disputes that, and highlights the challenges it faces in going after kingpins with only 1,000 agents compared to the 190,000 personnel the police had drawn from.
Each agent juggles intelligence gathering, drug busts and raids, and often exasperatingly long court appearances that disrupt operations. Cases must be watertight, they say, as high-profile targets can afford to hire top lawyers.
""We see to it that we are morally convinced that the suspect is really involved in drugs,"" said an agent, known as ""Happy"", who requested his full name be withheld to ensure operations are not compromised.
PDEA insists it does everything possible to avoid bloodshed. It says that 28 drug suspects and 11 PDEA personnel were killed during its operations from the start of Duterte's campaign to the middle of October.
""If the suspect does not fight back, why would we kill them?"" said Christy Silvan, the acting deputy head of PDEA's special enforcement service.
""But if that person fights back and has a gun, then we would not allow our troops to be the first one killed.""
Founded in 2002, the agency specializes in gathering intelligence and its typical operations revolve around searching for mid-level to prominent drug suspects, making arrests, compiling evidence and supporting court proceedings.
According to ""Happy"", the threat remains even when criminals are in handcuffs, because agents have to appear in court to testify.

""If we got a big-time drug lord, they may hire a hitman to kill us,"" he said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey will more than double the number of police officers on duty in Istanbul to 37,000 and ban public celebrations in key districts on New Year's Eve for security reasons, a year after a gunman killed 39 people in a nightclub, officials said.
State media said police had also detained dozens of people for suspected membership of Islamic State (IS) though the arrests were not linked to New Year security preparations.
On New Year's Eve a year ago, a man with an assault rifle shot dead Turks and visitors from several Arab nations, India and Canada at the exclusive Reina nightclub. 
A year on, 37,000 police officers and some 4,000 gendarmes who maintain security in rural areas would be on duty over New Year, Istanbul governor Vasip Sahin told reporters on Thursday - more than double the usual daily deployment. 
""Virtually all our teams will be on duty. We will take all possible measures in Istanbul so that our citizens can mark New Year happily in peace,"" he said.
Authorities either banned or canceled public New Year's Eve celebrations in the central Istanbul districts of Beyoglu, Sisli and Besiktas due to security concerns, officials and media said.
Sisli municipality said it canceled a four-day event due to start on Thursday after the local governor requested it be curtailed for security reasons. Besiktas council was refused permission to stage an event, Haberturk newspaper said.
It said security was also being tightened in Taksim square, reportedly one of the initial sites the gunman last year planned to attack before he decided to target the nightclub.
""New Year (security) measures will be at the highest level. There won't be any celebrations,"" Haberturk cited Beyoglu police chief Ismail Kilic as saying. ""Gatherings will not be allowed.""
IS claimed responsibility for the nightclub shooting, one of a series of attacks believed to have been carried out by the jihadists and Kurdish militants. A trial of suspects in the Reina attack, including the gunman, began this month.
Turkish police on Thursday detained 38 people, some of them Syrian citizens, for suspected Islamic State membership in an operation in the northwestern province of Bursa, the state-run Anadolu news agency said.

In raids across Istanbul on Wednesday, police detained six Islamic State-associated foreign nationals believed to be planning an attack, a police statement said.

KABUL (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a Shi'ite cultural center and news agency on Thursday in the Afghan capital that killed dozens of people attending a conference.
Ismail Kawosi, a spokesman for the ministry of public health, said 41 people had been killed and 48 wounded in the latest in a series of attacks on media organizations in Kabul.
The attack, which involved at least three explosions, occurred during a morning panel discussion on the anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Sunni-majority Afghanistan at the Tabian Social and Cultural Centre, with many of those attending students, witnesses said.
It was also the latest in a series of attacks on Shi'ite targets by Islamic State, which claimed responsibility in an online statement.
The floors of the center, at the basement level, were covered in blood as wailing survivors and relatives picked through the debris, while windows of the news agency, on the second floor, were all shattered.
People running outside into the compound following an initial blast inside were caught by two further explosions which caused heavy casualties, witnesses said.
Photographs sent by witnesses showed serious damage at the building, in a heavily Shi'ite area in the west of the capital, and a number of dead and wounded on the ground.
Deputy Health Minister Feda Mohammad Paikan said 35 bodies had been brought into the nearby Istiqlal hospital. Television pictures showed many of the injured suffered serious burns.
President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman issued a statement calling the attack an ""unpardonable"" crime against humanity and pledging to destroy terrorist groups.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement on Twitter denying involvement.
The bloodshed follows an attack on a private television station in Kabul last month, which was also claimed by Islamic State.
Backed by the heaviest U.S. air strikes since the height of the international combat mission in Afghanistan, Afghan forces have forced the Taliban back in many areas and prevented any major urban center from falling into the hands of insurgents.
But high-profile attacks in the big cities have continued as militants have looked for other ways to make an impact and undermine confidence in security. Islamic State, which is opposed to both the Taliban and the Western-backed government, has claimed a growing share of such attacks.
""This gruesome attack underscores the dangers faced by Afghan civilians,"" rights group Amnesty International said in a statement from its South Asia Director, Biraj Patnaik. ""In one of the deadliest years on record, journalists and other civilians continue to be ruthlessly targeted by armed groups."" 
According to a report this month by media freedom group Reporters without Borders, Afghanistan is among the world's most dangerous countries for media workers with two journalists and five media assistants killed doing their jobs in 2017, before Thursday's attack.

According to Sayed Abbas Hussaini, a journalist at Afghan Voice, one reporter at the agency was killed in Thursday's attack and two were wounded.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singapore court has rejected a gay Singaporean doctor's bid to adopt his biological child because he was born by a surrogate mother in the United States through a procedure not available for unmarried couples in the island state.
Singapore is in many ways a vibrant, modern society but it remains socially conservative and sex between consenting males is a punishable crime with a maximum penalty of two years in jail, although prosecution is rare.
Singapore is also trying to boost fertility among its citizens, and offers generous incentives to couples to have babies, but in-vitro fertilization is allowed only for married couples and surrogacy services are not available for anyone.
The man, in a homosexual relationship with a partner, paid $200,000 for a woman to carry his child through in-vitro fertilization in the United States after he had learned he was unlikely to be able to adopt a child in Singapore as a gay man.
A Singapore court ruled against his bid to adopt the child this week saying the steps he had taken to have the baby in the United States would not have been possible in Singapore.
""He cannot then come to the courts of the very same jurisdiction to have the acts condoned,"" the court said. 
""This application is in reality an attempt to obtain a desired result ... by walking through the back door of the system when the front door was firmly shut.""
The child, who is about four years old and is legally an American citizen, will remain in the care of the man.
The man, whose name has been withheld because the case involves a minor, is exploring his options in relation to the decision, his team of lawyers said.
""The primary reason that motivates him is that like any father he wants the best for his son, he wants his son to be legitimate in the eyes of the law and to ensure that he has all the necessary benefits to set him on the right path,"" said one of his lawyers, Ivan Cheong.
Cheong said legitimacy would help with any future application for citizenship and access to certain welfare benefits, as well as removing a perceived stigma around illegitimacy ""that you can't really place a value on"".
Prime Minister Lee Hsieng Loong has said the country was not yet ready for same-sex marriage and he was prepared to live with the anti-gay sex law ""until social attitudes change"".
A Singapore lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights group, Pink Dot, said it was dismayed by the ruling.
""Singapore has chosen to reject a loving father’s application to adopt his own biological son based on an outdated view of what a family should constitute,"" the group said in a statement.

Sebastian Kurz's People's Party joined forces with the anti-Islam Freedom Party this month, vowing to increase the power of the security apparatus, to fight illegal immigration and to combat what they perceive as the Islamization of society.
Gerhart Holzinger, who has to step down as president of the constitutional court at the end of this year due to his age, told the newspaper Der Standard the new government's plans to tighten security were aimless ""legislative activism"".
When asked about the new government's plans to take away asylum seekers' phones and cash and allow their doctors to break with the rule of medical confidentiality, Holzinger said such issues would certainly end up with constitutional judges.
""In the sectors of asylum and migration, there is indeed a staccato-style lining up of new laws. It cannot work that way because the apparatus that is supposed to apply these laws is faced with new rules every month or half year,"" he said.
""But sometimes the consistent handling and application of laws is more tiresome than the publication of new party (political) projects.""
Austria had already tightened its asylum rules under the previous centrist government and some provincial governments have cut social services for refugees - laws that are currently under review by the constitutional court and the European Court of Justice.
Nevertheless, the conservative-far right coalition has promised to introduce these cuts nationwide.
The new government also wants to expand its security services' ability to monitor online communication, but similar projects were abandoned by its predecessors over privacy concerns.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday that a 2015 agreement with Japan over South Korean ""comfort women"" was seriously flawed after Japan said any attempt to revise it could damage relations.
A South Korean panel set up to investigate the deal concluded on Wednesday that it failed to meet the needs of the thousands of girls and women forced to work in Japan's wartime military brothels, many of them Korean, euphemistically termed ""comfort women"" by Japan. 
The announcement threw ties into doubt as both countries, important U.S. allies, seek to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. 
""The agreement cannot solve the comfort women issue,"" Moon said, calling the deal a ""political agreement that excludes victims and the public"" and violates general principles in international society, according to a statement issued by his office.
A Japanese foreign ministry spokeswoman said Japan had conveyed its position to South Korea through diplomatic channels following Moon's remarks, reiterating Foreign Minister Taro Kono's comment on Wednesday that any attempt to change the deal would be ""unacceptable"" and make relations ""unmanageable"".
Asked if Moon meant to declare the deal null and void, Park Soo-hyun, a spokesman for the president's office, known as the Blue House, said it was ""inappropriate"" for him to use that term at this point, adding the government would present its ""final position"".
Under the 2015 deal, Japan apologized to victims and provided 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) to a fund to help them. 
The two governments had agreed the issue would be ""irreversibly resolved"" if both fulfilled their obligations. 
Moon pledged to normalize relations and work toward ""future-oriented cooperation"" with Japan. 
Japan's Nikkei business daily on Thursday quoted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as telling people close to him that the agreement ""will not be changed by even one millimeter"".
""Regardless of the Japanese government's stance, we take the investigation results seriously and humbly,"" South Korean foreign ministry spokesman Roh Kyu-deok told a news briefing, adding Seoul would formulate follow-up measures as soon as possible that could help the victims ""regain honor and heal the wounds in their hearts"".
SENSITIVE LEGACY
Japan and South Korea, which share a bitter history including Japanese colonization, are key to international efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs that it pursues in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
The comfort women issue has regularly been a source of rancor between Japan and neighbors China and North and South Korea since the war. Japan colonized the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 and occupied parts of China before and during the war.
The legacy of colonial rule, especially the comfort women issue, remains highly sensitive in South Korea, while in Japan, some ultra-conservatives deny that the women were forced to work in brothels at all.
In 2014, the U.N. Human Rights Committee asked Japan to clarify the ""comfort women"" euphemism, with an independent expert on the panel calling for it to be replaced by ""enforced sex slaves"".
The liberal Moon came to power in May winning a snap election called after the removal of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, whose conservative government was criticized for failing to fully consult victims ahead of the 2015 settlement.
Moon pledged to renegotiate the agreement while on the campaign trail.
A poll in December last year showed 59 percent of South Koreans thought the deal should be nullified while 25.5 percent supported upholding it. 

Park was forced from power this year over a corruption scandal and is now on trial.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - China's frequent military activity is causing regional instability, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Thursday, adding that the island's forces have been keeping a close eye on what they are up to.
China considers self-ruled and democratic Taiwan to be its sacred territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring what it views as a wayward province under Chinese control.
China has taken an increasingly hostile stance toward Taiwan since Tsai, from the island's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year.
Beijing suspects her of pushing for the island's formal independence, a red line for China. Tsai says she wants peace with the mainland, but that she will defend Taiwan's security and way of life.
China's air force has carried out 16 rounds of exercises close to Taiwan in the past year or so, Taiwan's defense ministry said in a white paper this week. China's military threat was growing by the day, it warned.
Beijing has repeatedly said its drills, which have also taken place in the disputed South China Sea and the Sea of Japan, are routine and not aimed at any third party.
Tsai, speaking to senior military officers in Taipei, said the island wanted peace but could ""not have a single day without combat preparedness"". 
""In this period of time, the frequent military activities of mainland China in East Asia have already affected safety and stability in the region to a certain extent,"" Tsai said. 
""Our country has always been a contributor to safety and stability in the region, this is why the national army has to keep an eye on movements of the Chinese military and take appropriate actions when needed to guarantee the safety of the country and region.""
Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang, speaking in Beijing, said that the drills would not have any negative impact upon the region and that the military's training would continue and become regular.
""China's military development is a force for peace and stability in the region,"" Ren told reporters.
China has warned Taiwan against ""using weapons to refuse reunification"" and its state media has given a high profile to images of Chinese jets flying close to the island.
Tensions rose this month when a senior Chinese diplomat threatened that China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits there.
Taiwan is well-equipped with mostly U.S.-made weapons, but has been pressing Washington to sell more advanced equipment.

Proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China, and Taiwan's government has accused Beijing of not understanding what democracy is about when it criticizes Taipei.

Harumafuji retired last month for injuring fellow Mongolian wrestler Takanoiwa while drinking at a restaurant-bar with other wrestlers in Tottori, an incident that has threatened to taint the image of Japan's national sport just as it was regaining popularity.
The summary indictment was filed against the former ""yokozuna"" (grand champion) for causing a chop wound by hitting Takanoiwa on the head with a karaoke machine remote control, an official at the local prosecutors office said.
A report by the Japan Sumo Association's crisis management committee has found that Harumafuji, angered that Takanoiwa was checking his smart phone after being chastised for a bad attitude by yokozuna Hakuho, slapped and hit the younger wrestler with a remote control device. 
Following the summary indictment, Harumafuji's lawyer released a statement on his behalf.
""Because of this incident, my life as Harumafuji is now set to be sharply different from what I thought it would be. I have a feeling of chagrin, to be honest. But the responsibility is all mine,"" he said in the statement.

The incident has highlighted sumo's struggle to reform harsh conditions that can breed violence in its closed, hierarchical world, although some wrestlers say there have been improvements in the decade since a trainee was beaten to death.

The U.N. Security Council last week unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.
The U.N. resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year.
The U.S.-drafted resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Council to further reductions if it were to conduct another nuclear test or launch another ICBM.
China has consistently said it is fully enforcing all resolutions against North Korea, despite suspicion in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo that loopholes still exist.
Asked at a regular briefing whether Chinese ships were illegally providing oil to North Korean ships, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang reiterated that China, including the military, strictly enforced U.N. resolutions on North Korea. 
""The situation you have mentioned absolutely does not exist,"" Ren said, without elaborating.

Wu Gan, a blogger better known by his online name ""Super Vulgar Butcher"", was sentenced to eight years in jail on Tuesday for subversion. Before his detention in May 2015, he regularly championed sensitive cases involving suspected government abuse of power.
The U.S. and German embassies called on China to release Wu in a joint statement on Wednesday. They also called for rights lawyer Xie Yang, who was also sentence on Tuesday, to be allowed to freely resume his work.
Xie was found guilty of inciting subversion but avoided jail because he admitted to his crimes, the authorities said.
The two embassies had ""no right to criticize what was purely an internal affair of China's and a matter of China's judicial sovereignty"", foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing.
""We hope that the relevant diplomatic missions can take the correct position with regards to their own responsibilities,"" she said, adding that China is a country with rule of law and justice officials handled cases in line with the law.
Wu's sentence was the most severe in what rights groups have called an unprecedented attack on rights activists and lawyers, known as the 709 crackdown, which began in full force on July 9, 2015.

Kellerhals founded Media Markt with two business partners in 1979. Media-Saturn now has more than 1,000 stores in 15 European countries and is majority-owned by consumer electronics group Ceconomy, which split from Metro this year.
""He was a remarkable entrepreneurial figure to whom we all owe much gratitude,"" Media-Saturn's management said. 
Kellerhals, who held a stake of just over 21 percent in Media-Saturn, had for years been at odds with Ceconomy over the management of the business, most notably its move into the fast-growing online market as well as the split from Metro.
German magazine Der Spiegel reported this month that representatives of Kellerhals's holding company Convergenta had refused to approve Media-Saturn's annual accounts. 
Ceconomy shares rose almost 4 percent to a record high in early Thursday trading. A Frankfurt-based trader said this reflected hopes that Kellerhals's heirs would be able to reach an agreement with the company's management.
Ceconomy said in a statement: ""We send our sympathy and condolences to his family.""
Kellerhals died on Dec. 25 surrounded by family, the Convergenta spokesman said. He leaves behind his wife and business partner of over 50 years, Helga, and a son.
According to Forbes, Kellerhals was worth about $2 billion.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Thursday it ""humbly accepts"" there is no evidence North Korea diverted wages paid to its workers by South Korean firms in a now-closed border industrial park to bankroll its weapons programs as the previous government asserted.
The South's unification ministry was responding to the findings of a panel which contradicted claims of money being transferred by North Korea as it pursues its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. sanctions.
It said would take follow-up steps to boost transparency and public trust in its policy towards the North.
South Korea said last year that most of the cash that flowed into the jointly run Kaesong complex was being diverted. It made the claim when it pulled out of the joint venture in response to the North's launch of a long-range missile.
In July, two months after liberal President Moon Jae-in was elected, a South Korean government official said there was no hard evidence to back up the assertion.
The decision to suspend the Kaesong project was ""unilaterally and verbally"" made by Moon's predecessor, ousted president Park Geun-hye, a day after the missile test and without any formal discussions within the administration, the panel, appointed by the unification ministry, said. 
""The presidential office inserted the wage-diversion argument as major grounds, yet without concrete information, sufficient evidence and consultations with related agencies, mainly citing defector testimonies that lack objectivity and credibility,"" Kim Jong-soo, a priest who heads the panel, told a news conference. 
""This impairs the decision's legitimacy and could constrain our ground over a future restart of the complex, while hampering the companies' rights to protect their assets due to the hasty pullout process.""
About 120 South Korean companies paid about double the $70 a month minimum wage in North Korea for each of the 55,000 workers hired in Kaesong.
The project resulted from the first inter-Korean summit meeting in 2000, when leaders of the two Koreas vowed reconciliation and cooperation. It was the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean rapprochement amid frosty cross-border ties.
Moon has pledged to reopen the industrial park if there is progress on the North's denuclearization, but political tensions and the North's aloofness have tied the president's hands. 
Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North regularly threatens to destroy the South and its main ally, the United States.
A group of South Korean businessmen who own factories in Kaesong demanded a formal apology.
The companies together suffered losses of 250 billion won ($200 million) due to the closure, aside from equipment and raw materials left behind, the group said in February. 
""Now that the wage-diversion claim has proved groundless, the government must apologize for abusing state power to suspend the complex and make utmost efforts to reopen it,"" the group said in a statement after the conference.
North Korea’s state-run web sites said in October the country had restarted some operations in Kaesong on its own, saying it was ""nobody’s business what we do in an industrial complex where our nation’s sovereignty is exercised”.

653,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 03:50AM ET</span>","U.N. rights investigator calls for pressure on China, Russia over Myanmar abuses","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - The United Nations' independent investigator into human rights in Myanmar has called for international pressure on China and Russia to try to get them to oppose human rights abuses in Myanmar.
U.N. special rapporteur Yanghee Lee, who was last week barred by the Myanmar government from visiting the country, singled out China and Russia because they had failed to back some moves in the U.N. aimed at trying to halt the Myanmar military's crackdown on the Rohingya Muslim community in Rakhine province. 
""I’d like to ask the international community to continue to work with China and Russia to persuade them to stand on the side of human rights,"" Lee told Reuters in an interview.
Neither has joined the United States, the European Union, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in condemning the crackdown that has led to the exodus of what aid agencies estimate to be 655,000 refugees into Bangladesh. 
In response to Lee, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that ""external actors"" adding pressure over human rights will not help to resolve the issue, and may make it more complicated. 
This would not be in the interests of Myanmar, its neighbors or the international community, she said at a regular news briefing in Beijing on Thursday. ""We hope that countries or individuals external to the issue can create a positive environment that is more conducive to Myanmar resolving the issue for themselves,"" Hua added.
The Russian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
The Russian government has previously warned against interfering in Myanmar’s internal affairs. Russia’s ambassador to Myanmar, Nikolay Listopadov has said it is “against excessive intervention, because it won’t lead to any constructive results.” 
BARRIER TO ICC
The Myanmar armed forces are accused by members of the Rohingya community and human rights advocates of carrying out killings, rapes and village burnings, in what top officials in the United Nations and United States have described as ethnic cleansing.
The Russian and Chinese stance is particularly important because either of them can block the U.N. Security Council from referring allegations of crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The ICC cannot act against Myanmar without a referral because Myanmar is not an ICC member.
Myanmar has denied human rights abuses, saying its military is engaged in a legitimate counter-insurgency operation. The military exonerated itself of all accusations of atrocities in an internal investigation, which published its findings on Nov. 13.
Myanmar's foreign affairs ministry has said Lee was not objective or impartial in a report she issued in July, and it wanted a fair investigator.
Lee said there had to be a fair, partial and independent investigation.
""The families of the victims have a right to know what happened, and I think the people of Myanmar need to know what happened, because we’re seeing, in front of our eyes, the worst humanitarian crisis.""
Surveys of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh by aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres have shown at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in Rakhine State in the month after violence flared in late August, the aid group said last week.
The special rapporteur also criticized recent government crackdowns on media in Myanmar, including the arrest this month of two Reuters journalists who had reported on the crisis in Rakhine. 
She said that the authorities were creating ""a national gag"" that would prevent journalists from reporting what they see. ""That will have consequences on the general public too - people will not be able to speak as freely.""

Myanmar has said the reporters ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media.""

In August, the Supreme Court ruled as unconstitutional the law, which allows Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering the word ""talaq"" three times.
Muslim women had petitioned the court, arguing the practice of husbands divorcing them through ""triple talaq"", including by Skype and WhatsApp, not only violated their rights but left many women destitute.
""Only a law can explicitly ban triple talaq, we have to enforce legal procedures to provide allowance and protect custody of children,"" said Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.
The bill, if approved, would make the practice a non-bailable offense with a possible three-year jail term.
Muslims are the biggest religious minority in Hindu-majority India and relations between the communities have been occasionally strained since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party won a 2014 election.
India is one of the few countries where the practice of instant divorce has survived and some Muslim groups have said that while it was wrong, the law should be reviewed by the community itself.
Members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board said the government had no right to outlaw instant triple talaq, as it was directly interfering with the Muslim personal law. 
India's civil codes are designed to protect the independence of religious communities. Unlike most Hindu civil laws, which have been codified and reformed, Muslim personal laws have largely been left untouched. 

Zakia Soman, founder of a Muslim women's group, the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, said once triple talaq becomes a legal offense, victims could approach the police and the legal system to initiate action against offenders.

China is Cambodia's biggest foreign donor. The two countries have become increasingly close amid an ongoing crackdown by Cambodia's government on critics, civil society groups and independent media that rights group say amounts to the destruction of democracy.
The European Union and the United States withdrew their backing for the election after a court dissolved the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in November at the government's request.
In 2016 China, which has contributed to Cambodian elections since the reinstatement of national polls in 1993, donated vehicles and other supplies worth some $11 million.
Hang Puthea, spokesman for the National Election Commission, said China would provide 30 different types of equipment.
""This equipment is very important for processing the election,"" Hang Puthea told Reuters.
In a document on Wednesday, the NEC said China pledged the equipment on Tuesday, saying it would provide laptops, computers and voting booths, among other items.
""China promised to give more aid to the NEC to manage the election in order to have a good process, accuracy, transparency and accountability,"" the NEC said.
Reuters was not immediately able to contact China's embassy in Phnom Penh for comment.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled for more than 30 years, vowed on Wednesday to stay in power for at least another decade.

The European Union and Japan have been the biggest donors to Cambodia's election commission. Japan has said it will continue to give help.

In one case, sewage from 150,000 residents in Jingdezhen in southern Jiangxi province was directly discharged into rivers due to a lack of treatment facilities.
The vast majority of officials caught were local-ranking officials, said Liu Changgen, head of China's environmental inspection.
""In the next step, we will go through cases found during previous inspections and identify any higher-ranking officials for ill management,"" Liu, deputy director at the National Environmental Inspection Office, told reporters on Thursday. 
Concerned about the level of local pollution following three decades of breakneck economic growth, Beijing dispatched four rounds of environment inspectors across the country from February 2016 to uncover violations of anti-pollution measures.
In Shandong, one of China's most industrialized provinces, more than 10,000 companies were fined a total of 100 million yuan ($15 million) by inspectors in August-September.
Local government officials who turn a blind eye to offences in the hope of meeting economic growth goals were also targeted in the anti-pollution campaign. 
Entire cities have been blamed for causing spikes in air pollution, with the environment ministry attributing the problems to administrative failures.
""The names of the officials, their jobs and their violations will be reported up the chain of command, who will decide how the officials will be punished,"" Liu said, adding the inspections would continue.
""We will not let the inspection become a passing gust of wind,"" Liu said. ""It needs to keep blowing all the time.""
In a 143-page winter smog ""battleplan"" unveiled in August, the ministry said it aims to cut average concentrations of airborne particles known as PM2.5 by over 15 percent in the winter months in 28 cities in the northern, smog-prone provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong and Henan.
It also vowed to cut average PM2.5 to below 60 micrograms per cubic meter in Beijing by the end of this year, which remain a lot higher than China's official air quality standard of 35 micrograms. The World Health Organization recommends the level should be no more than 10 micrograms.
Northern China has also embarked on an ambitious program under which millions of households will switch from burning coal, a major contributor to air pollution in winter months, to natural gas for heating.

Counter-terrorism police carried out simultaneous raids on homes in various districts of Bursa, smashing doors open with battering rams and searching the properties, it said.
Islamic State militants have carried out gun and bomb attacks in Turkey. Many foreign fighters passed through Turkey in recent years on their way to join the jihadist group in territory it controlled in Syria and Iraq.

The so-called Recommendations Bill, approved in the final reading by a vote of 59-to-54, prevents police from announcing whether they have found enough evidence for an indictment before prosecutors decide whether or not to press such charges.
Netanyahu is a suspect in two cases. In one, he is alleged to have meddled in the media industry. The other concerns gifts he received from wealthy businessmen. He denies any wrongdoing.
Opposition lawmakers have said that the bill, tabled by Netanyahu's rightist Likud party, was designed to dampen public anger over the investigations, which has fueled weekly demonstrations in Tel Aviv and calls for the premier's ouster.
Netanyahu defended the bill on Dec. 3 as ""intended to prevent publication of police recommendations which would leave a cloud over innocent people, something that happens every day”. In 60 percent of cases where police recommend criminal charges, prosecutors decided not to indict, Netanyahu noted.
But the prime minister also called for the bill to be amended so it did not apply to the criminal investigations against him. 
The final draft stipulated that the law would not be in effect regarding investigations that predate its ratification.
That has done little to mollify the opposition.
""This law came about only because of the investigations against Netanyahu,"" Avi Gabbay, head of the center-left Zionist Union party, told Israel's Army Radio. 
""We don't know what investigations might be conducted in the future (against him).""

Israeli media had reported that police could go public with recommendations to indict Netanyahu as soon as early January, and a Dec. 23 TV poll found that 60 percent to 63 percent of the public would want him to resign over such recommendations.

(Reuters) - A storm that has dumped more than 65 inches (165 cms) of snow this week on Erie, Pennsylvania, is expected to slightly taper off on Wednesday after leaving drifts that buried cars, paralyzed the area and made the county declare an emergency.
But the respite for Erie, a city of about 100,000 in northwest Pennsylvania on the shores of Lake Erie, is expected to be short-lived, with a fresh round of winter storms coming Thursday night predicted to bring as much as 10 inches more snow, forecasters said.
""This is a crippling snow event,"" said Zach Sefcovic, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Cleveland. 
""They are no strangers to snow in that part of the state, but this much snow in that short a time is just unprecedented,"" he said in a telephone interview.
Large parts of the United States were gripped by freezing weather, with an area stretching from Montana to Maine expected to see temperatures below 10 degrees Fahrenheit (-12.2 degrees Celsius) early on Thursday, the National Weather Service said. 
The winter blast in Erie was caused by cold Arctic air moving over the lake, which had relatively mild water temperatures, forecasters said.
The storm broke a 59-year-old record for a two-day snowfall in Pennsylvania, topping the 44 inches that fell in 1958. Erie County Executive Kathy Dahlkemper issued a temporary disaster emergency declaration that mobilized resources to help the area.
Pictures of residents on social media showed drifts reaching beyond window-levels in houses and people clearing paths through chest-high accumulations. 
""Out of Doritos. Family is arguing. Dogs are getting ornery. It’s been 3 days since my last chicken wing. We are out of whiskey,” wrote Nicole Massari on her Instagram account @theworldaroundnikki, along with a video showing her Pennsylvania home surrounded by snow. 
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf deployed 21 Pennsylvania National Guard troops along with some all-terrain military vehicles to the region on Tuesday to help residents dig out and transport emergency responders around the area.

Erie resident Brian Sheridan on Wednesday posted a photo on social media showing the top of his mail box peeking out underneath a mound of snow. In a caption, he wrote: ""At this point, it just might be easier to put a hold on our mail until spring.""

Joy Villa, a vocal Trump supporter who wore a dress bearing the president's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan to the Grammy Awards this year, said on Tuesday she had contacted police in Washington on Sunday to file charges.
Villa told news website Politico and television channel CNN this week that Lewandowski touched her against her will while they posed for photographs at the Trump International Hotel. 
Villa's representative has not responded to a request for comment.
Lewandowski could not be reached for comment, and Reuters has not independently verified the allegations.
Asked about the allegation in an interview on Wednesday, Lewandowski told the Fox Business television network that the matter was under investigation.
""There is a process which they will go through to determine a person's innocence,"" he said. ""I'm not here to speak for Joy. What I am here to do is to speak for me. And what I am going to do is to let the process play forward.""
Villa's account first appeared in an interview published by Politico on Friday.
""I'm wearing this silver suit and stretchy pants, and after the photo, he smacks my ass really hard,"" she told Politico. ""It was completely demeaning and shocking.""
She said Lewandowski was dismissive when she confronted him and threatened to report him. He then smacked her buttocks again, she said. 
She said she was hesitant to go to police at first, but on Sunday filed sexual assault charges. 
Villa says she is considering running for a seat in the U.S. Congress representing Florida. 
Dustin Sternbeck, a spokesman for Washington's Metropolitan Police Department, said the allegations were still being investigated. 
In response to questions about the case, the department provided reporters with a copy of the so-called ""public incident report"" which contained scant details and did not name either Villa or Lewandowski.
While still working as Trump's campaign manager, Lewandowski was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery by police in Jupiter, Florida, after a reporter for Breitbart News said he grabbed and bruised her arm while she tried to question Trump at a campaign event. 
Lewandowski, who has also worked as a lobbyist and a political consultant, denied he had grabbed or hurt the reporter, and prosecutors declined to proceed with the case. Trump dismissed Lewandowski from his position as campaign manager a few months later.

According to the arrest warrant, police detained Jose Gonzalez Valencia, 42, a leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), with the intention of fulfilling a U.S. extradition request. 
Once a little-known gang, the CJNG has grown in recent years to challenge the Sinaloa Cartel of captured kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman for primacy of the drug trade in Mexico.
Gonzalez Valencia was arrested at a beach resort near the coastal city of Fortaleza and brought to the headquarters of the federal police for the state of Ceará, Brazilian prosecutors said in a statement. 
Gonzalez Valencia had been living in neighboring Bolivia for two years after fleeing Mexico and he had entered Brazil as a tourist using a Bolivian passport, the statement added.
An official at the state prosecutor's office in the western Mexican state of Jalisco said Gonzalez Valencia is the brother of Abigael Gonzalez Valencia, a CJNG leader captured in February 2015.
Jalisco is where the CJNG established itself and serves as a base for much of its operations.
The Jalisco official said Gonzalez Valencia was due to be extradited straight to the United States from Brazil.

Mercedes Araoz said Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street investor, had asked her to remain at the helm of the Cabinet and to look for ways to strengthen it.
""The president asked me to carry out a comprehensive review and we'll see what happens in coming days,"" Araoz said at a press conference, her first public appearance since the pardon on Christmas Eve.
In the past two weeks, the political situation in top metals exporter Peru has turned suddenly volatile, after the opposition-ruled Congress sought to oust Kuczynski in the wake of a graft scandal.
Kuczynski was saved from the vote by Fujimori loyalists. Two days later, he pardoned the ailing Fujimori, sparking violent protests and political resignations as opponents alleged the pardon was payback for keeping Kuczynski in office.
It was not clear which ministers may be vulnerable in any reshuffle, but a shake-up could herald a new rightward turn for Kuczynski's government, as Kuczynski's former left-leaning supporters denounced him as a ""traitor"" for pardoning Fujimori.
There was no plan to replace Finance Minister Claudia Cooper, a government source said.
Fujimori was in stable condition at a hospital in Lima, where he was rushed from prison on Saturday to undergo treatment for life-threatening blood pressure and heart problems, according to his doctor.
Araoz said she respected Kuczynski's decision to pardon Fujimori, and stressed he had been evaluating it long before the vote to oust him in Congress.
""Neither I nor any member of my Cabinet nor the ruling party Peruvians for Change took part in any negotiation to trade a humanitarian pardon (for votes)"", said Araoz.
Fujimori had served 12 years of a 25-year-sentence for graft and human rights crimes in his 1990-2000 rightwing government. Kuczynski's decision cleared him of convictions and shields him from being tried in pending judicial processes.
Fujimori is reviled by many who consider him a corrupt dictator, but admired by others who credit him with saving Peru from an economic crisis and leftist insurgency.
Earlier on Wednesday, culture minister Salvador del Solar announced his resignation on Twitter - the first Cabinet member to quit since the pardon was granted on Sunday.
A presidential adviser, at least three justice ministry officials and two state media personalities have also stepped down. Three ruling party lawmakers announced their resignations earlier this week, as the pardon triggered two days of unrest.

Fujimori's opponents planned a new protest on Thursday.

Nobody was injured in the early-morning blast at the Athens Court of Appeal. The explosion shattered windows and damaged the facade of the building. Shots were also fired in the direction of a security guard present.
In a statement, the Group of People’s Fighters (OLA) said the Court of Appeal had upheld the legality of austerity measures, such as cutting pensions and salaries, in return for bailouts from international creditors.

MORONI (Reuters) - The Comoros government has asked Interpol and the U.S. authorities for information related to foreigners, including two people accused of breaking sanctions on Iran, who have bought the country's passports to facilitate their activities, the foreign minister told Reuters.
Souef Mohamed El Amine also said Comoros would cancel 158 diplomatic passports that had been bought and scrap any nominations of honorary consulships that could not be justified in a review now under way by authorities.
""We are working closely with Interpol. Americans have come here, and we have asked them to provide any information they have that they can share to help us identify these people,” El Amine said late on Tuesday.
The statement is the first official reaction in Comoros to a Reuters article about the activities of a Belgian firm called Semlex, which supplies ID documents for countries across Africa, including the tiny Indian Ocean state.
The Reuters story highlighted how some Semlex staff and associates had acquired Comoros diplomatic passports and positions in various cities around the world.
It also identified two people accused by U.S. authorities of breaking sanctions against Iran who had bought Comoros citizenship.
Reuters was unable to establish how either obtained Comoros citizenship or whether either acquired it through Semlex.
If Semlex was confirmed to have played a role in the case involving the Iranians, Comoros would end its agreement with Semlex, El Amine said.
A lawyer for Semlex declined to comment, saying his client refuted all allegations against Semlex contained in two special reports published by Reuters in April and December this year.
The lawyer previously said an unidentified third party was manipulating Reuters with the aim of damaging Semlex and Albert Karaziwan, its chief executive officer.
The minister was referring to two Iranians – one accused of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars for Iran, the other accused of supplying equipment to Iranian forces in Syria – who had acquired Comoros citizenship in 2015, according to government documents seen by Reuters. 
Reuters was unable to contact either of the men listed on the Comoros documents. Neither of them have previously publicly responded to the U.S. accusations against them.
El Amine also said Comoros was working with authorities in the United Arab Emirates to establish how and to what extent a 2008 deal to offer stateless people in the Gulf Comoros citizenship in return for cash had been abused to sell passports via parallel networks. 
El Amine said that an investigation had been launched to check if passports or consular positions had been issued as a result of corruption or political pressure, but authorities had already identified at least 158 diplomatic passports that had been bought and would be canceled.
""We are cleaning things up,"" he added. ""We will simply cancel the passports. Any consul nominated through cronyism will be reversed.""

(Reuters) - Guatemala's recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital leaves President Jimmy Morales closer to the United States at a time his stock has fallen at home due to corruption allegations raised by U.N.-backed investigators.
Defying overwhelming international rejection of President Donald Trump's decision to move his embassy to Jerusalem, Guatemala and Honduras were the only nations in the Americas to back him in a U.N. General Assembly vote last week. 
Increasingly isolated at home, Morales won friends in Washington by aligning himself with Trump, although he runs the risk of backlash from Arab countries which import the costly spice cardamom from Guatemala.
Morales on Christmas Eve said he would follow Trump in moving Guatemala's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
""This is a pretty low-cost way for Morales to make sure the Trump administration is on his side,"" said Michael Shifter, head of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank.
Morales is no stranger to international controversy.
In August, the former TV comedian came under fire from the United Nations, the European Union and the U.S. ambassador in Guatemala for attempting to expel a U.N.-backed prosecutor seeking to put him on trial for alleged corruption. 
The investigation into allegations of illicit campaign financing - which followed separate graft probes into members of the president's family - had threatened to condemn Morales to impeachment.
Morales escaped that fate but he had to back down over a bid to eject the head of the U.N.-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, and his authority has been seriously undermined.
Morales, an evangelical Christian, says the Israel policy is a principled stand in the tradition of Guatemala's longstanding support of Israel.
""Even though there were only nine of us in the whole world who backed (Trump's position) we're totally sure this is the right path,"" Morales said of the U.N. vote. Eight other nations opposed the resolution condemning the United States for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and 128 voted for it.
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to any Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their own state.
GUATEMALAN REALPOLITIK
Backing Trump was also an exercise in realpolitik for Morales.
Trump threatened to cut aid to countries backing the U.N. resolution. Few in the Americas rely more on U.S. support than Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, which did not vote.
Pending U.S. approval, Guatemala is set to receive some $209 million from the Alliance for Prosperity Plan in the Northern Triangle, a U.S.-funded program, according to the government.
Guatemala also received almost $100 million from the United States Agency for International Development last year, and over $75 million in security aid between 2012 and 2015, according to the Security Assistance Monitor database.
The local economy benefits from money sent home by hundreds of thousands of Guatemalans in the United States, many of whom are unlawful immigrants that Trump has threatened to send home.
Remittances are this year set to top $8 billion, equivalent to roughly three-quarters of the Guatemalan budget.
Were those flows to dry up, it would aggravate discontent at Morales.
""These acts of good faith and support for Donald Trump's government could eventually turn into opportunities for political stability that right now aren't there,"" said Ricardo Barrero, political coordinator at the Guatemala City-based Central American Institute of Political Studies.
Israel has provided important training for Guatemala's military. 
But Guatemala also has other interests in the Middle East, not least demand from Arab states for cardamom, of which it is the world's biggest producer.
Former Guatemalan vice president Eduardo Stein recalled that in the mid-1990s, Guatemala also said it would move its embassy to Jerusalem - before backing off amid threats from Arab nations not to import cardamom, which is used in Arabic coffee.

""It's likely to happen again,"" said Stein, referring to possible cardamom curbs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite saying that the Syrian government is not doing enough to stop Islamic State militants from moving through its territory, the U.S.-led coalition fighting the group does not intend to target militants in those areas, a senior coalition official said on Wednesday.
The comments by British Army Major General Felix Gedney indicate that the coalition will rely on the Syrian government to go after Islamic State militants in areas controlled by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
U.S. officials have said in the past that the Syrian government forces are too few, too poor and too weak to fight Islamic State.
Gedney, the deputy commander of strategy and support for the coalition, said the fight against Islamic State was not over, and militants had been seen moving west of the Euphrates river.
""They seem to be moving with impunity through regime-held territory, showing that the regime is clearly either unwilling or unable to defeat Daesh within their borders,"" Gedney said, using an Arabic acronym for the militant group.
Syrian government forces and their allies, backed by Russian air power, are mostly on the western side of the Euphrates, while forces backed by the coalition are on the eastern bank. 
When asked whether the coalition will target the militants in areas controlled by the Syrian regime, Gedney said they did not plan to.
""We will continue to deconflict with the Russians, but we have got no intention to operate in areas that are currently held by the regime,"" Gedney said.
Russia and the United States have set up a communications channel to reduce the chance of fighting between the two rival campaigns against Islamic State.
""We would call on the Syrian regime to clear ISIS from those areas that are currently under their control,"" he added.
The coalition estimates that fewer than 1,000 Islamic State fighters remain in Iraq and Syria.
Iraq and Syria have both declared victory over Islamic State in recent weeks, after a year in which the two countries' armies, a range of foreign allies and various local forces drove the fighters out of all the towns and villages that once made up the militant group's self-proclaimed caliphate.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said the U.S. military will fight Islamic State in Syria “as long as they want to fight."" He said the U.S. military's longer-term objective would be to prevent the return of an ""ISIS 2.0.""

HORLIVKA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine and pro-Russian separatist rebels conducted the largest exchange of prisoners since conflict broke out in 2014, sending hundreds of captives home to their families on Wednesday ahead of New Year and Orthodox Christmas.
More than 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict and casualties are still reported almost daily despite a ceasefire that froze the frontlines in place since 2015.
""My son rang,"" the mother of a Ukrainian prisoner Oleksandr Oliynyk told the Ukrainian news channel 112.
""I have not heard his voice for three-and-a-half years, just letters. He said: 'Mum, I'm already here.' You cannot imagine what it means for a mother, to not see your child for three-and-a-half years, since August 2014."" 
According to the terms of the deal, Kiev was meant to hand over 306 prisoners to the rebels and receive 74 prisoners in return. A Reuters photographer at the scene saw the Ukrainian prisoners being loaded onto buses in the town of Horlivka and taken to territory controlled by the Ukrainian government. 
""All 74 Ukrainian hostages are already at home, on the territory controlled by our army,"" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko wrote on social media. 
According to Poroshenko, among the prisoners handed to Ukraine were a historian and a ""cyborg"" - the nickname Ukrainians gave to soldiers who defended Donetsk airport in one of the conflict's most intense battles in 2014. 
The exact number of prisoners exchanged is uncertain. Viktor Medvedchuk, Ukraine's representative to ongoing peace talks, said some captives held by Ukraine refused to return to rebel-held areas, according to the Russian news agency TASS. 
More prisoners are expected to change hands in 2018, TASS cited Medvedchuk as saying. The Ukrainian state security service said 103 prisoners remained in separatist hands.
There was no immediate comment from the authorities in Moscow, which Ukraine and its Western allies accuse of supporting the pro-Russian separatists with troops, cash and heavy weapons, an accusation Moscow denies.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron welcomes the exchange in a joint statement and called on both sides to release the remaining captives.
Germany's foreign ministry said it was a significant step in implementing the ceasefire agreement agreed in the Belarus capital Minsk. 
""Above all, it is also an important humanitarian gesture before the New Year and Orthodox Christmas,"" a foreign ministry statement said.
The Minsk agreements, intended to end the fighting in Ukraine, were signed by Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France in the Belarussian capital in early 2015.

The exchange came as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Russia to ""lower the level of violence"" in eastern Ukraine.

According to French news channel LCI, the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia detained three men on Dec. 17.
""Several French (nationals) were arrested in northern Syria in the Hassakeh area, near the Iraqi border,"" the source said, confirming the arrests. 
The source added there were more than three French nationals stopped, including Thomas Barnouin, an Islamist known to French security services who is believed to have gone to Syria in 2014 to join Islamic State.
Barnouin was sentenced to five years in prison in 2006 for running a jihadi recruitment network in the southwestern Toulouse region, and was close to Mohammed Merah, a gunman who killed seven people in the area in 2012, including three Jewish children. 
He is also close to brothers Fabien and Jean-Michel Clain, who were identified by officials as the voices in a jihadist audio message claiming Islamic State’s responsibility for attacks in Paris that killed 130 people in 2015.
The public prosecutor declined to comment. The French interior ministry said it could neither deny nor confirm the arrests.
The head of France's DGSI internal intelligence agency, Laurent Nunez, warned in November that security services were still worried militants could continue to plan attacks in France from Syria and Iraq despite Islamic State's loss of territory. 
France's foreign minister said on Dec. 9 that Paris estimated the number of French jihadists still in the region at about 500. 
It is unclear whether those caught in Iraq and Syria will be returned to their home country, although French officials have said they expect all adults to face local justice.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain plus non-GCC member Egypt cut off diplomatic, travel and trade ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of supporting militants and their arch-foe Iran.
Doha denies the charges and says their move is aimed at curtailing its sovereignty.
Western nations have called for the countries, which are all close U.S. allies, to settle their differences in talks.
The heads of state from the three boycotting countries skipped a GCC summit hosted by Kuwait's ruler in December, and the UAE called for the formation of a bilateral committee with Saudi Arabia on economic, political and military issues.
But Kuwait appears determined to preserve the loose union set up in 1980 as a bulwark against larger neighbors Iraq and Iran, and said its reconciliation efforts would proceed.
Despite the spat which appears to have no end in sight, the GCC's work ""will not be frozen or disrupted,"" Khaled Jarallah was quoted by state news agency KUNA as telling reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Kuwait.

The Syrian army, backed by Russian air power, Shi'ite militias supported by Iran and local fighters from the Druze sect have besieged the rebel enclave around Beit Jin for weeks. In recent days it captured various positions, leaving the rebels trapped inside the town itself.
""There is now negotiation on the departure of fighters and those who wish to leave with them,"" said Abu Kanaan, an official in a local rebel group.
""The militias are trying to convince them to evacuate to Idlib... There has been no agreement reached yet,"" said Ibrahim al-Jebawi, an official with a Free Syrian Army faction familiar with the situation. 
Syria's army and its allies have increasingly pushed for such evacuation deals for rebel enclaves near big cities or in other strategic locations after long periods of siege and bombardment. 
The area around Beit Jin is sensitive because of its location next to the Israel-controlled Golan Heights. 
Israel wants to keep Lebanon's Hezbollah, the most powerful of the Iran-backed militias aiding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against the rebel groups, far away from its border with Syria. 
It has repeatedly targeted military positions in Syria near the border after stray projectiles crossed into Israeli-controlled areas, and it has struck Hezbollah convoys and weapons caches inside Syria.

Russian space agency Roscosmos said last month it had lost contact with the newly-launched weather satellite - the Meteor-M - after it blasted off from Russia's new Vostochny cosmodrome in the Far East.
Eighteen smaller satellites belonging to scientific, research and commercial companies from Russia, Norway, Sweden, the United States, Japan, Canada and Germany, were on board the same rocket.
Speaking to Rossiya 24 state TV channel, Rogozin said the failure had been caused by human error. 
The rocket carrying the satellites had been programmed with the wrong coordinates, he said, saying it had been given bearings for take-off from a different cosmodrome - Baikonur - which Moscow leases from Kazakhstan.
""The rocket was really programmed as if it was taking off from Baikonur,"" said Rogozin. ""They didn't get the coordinates right.""
The Vostochny spaceport, laid out in the thick taiga forest of the Amur Region, is the first civilian rocket launch site in Russia.

In April last year, after delays and massive costs overruns, Russia launched its first rocket from Vostochny, a day after a technical glitch forced an embarrassing postponement of the event in the presence of President Vladimir Putin.

The number of people stuck in Libyan detention centers has risen dramatically this year after armed groups largely shut down the boat route to Italy from the smuggling hub of Sabratha.
The International Organization for Migration flew the Guinean migrants from two western cities to the city of Misrata, from where they boarded a plane for Conakry.
The deportations come in the wake of a CNN report on migrants being sold for slave labor that sparked an international outcry.
Migrant flows through Libya have surged since 2014. More than 600,000 people have crossed the central Mediterranean to Italy in the past three years, but departures from Libya's coast dropped sharply in July when armed groups in Sabratha began preventing boats from leaving.
After clashes in the western city in September, thousands of migrants held near the coast emerged and were transferred to detention centers under the nominal control of the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli.

Amnesty International said this month that up to 20,000 people are being held in detention centers and are subject to ""torture, forced labor, extortion, and unlawful killings"". Other human rights organizations have said similar things in recent months.

""Reagan was more powerful and smarter than Trump, and he was a better actor in making threats, and he also moved against us and they shot down our plane,"" Khamenei said in a speech carried on state television.
In 1988, a U.S. warship shot down an Iranian passenger plane over the Gulf, killing all 290 aboard, in an incident which Washington said was a mistake. Tehran said it was a deliberate attack on Iran, then at war with neighboring Iraq. 
""But Reagan is gone and, according to out beliefs, he now faces God's retribution ... while Iran has made great advances in all areas since Reagan's time,"" Khamenei added. 
""This trend will continue under the current American president and any hopes on their part that the Islamic Republic would back off or weaken is futile.""
Trump refused in October to certify that Tehran is complying with its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement.
He announced the shift in U.S. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for militant groups in the Middle East.

Under the nuclear deal, sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for Tehran rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb-making potential.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Opposition leader Alexei Navalny announced on Wednesday a series of rallies across Russia in January to press home his call for a boycott of next year's presidential election, a move likely to draw a sharp response from the Kremlin and police.
Navalny unveiled his plan hours after President Vladimir Putin, who polls suggest is a shoo-in for re-election, registered his candidacy at the central election commission ahead of the March 18 vote. 
The commission ruled on Monday that Navalny was not eligible to run against Putin due to a suspended prison sentence. 
A furious Navalny, who says the sentence was part of a fabricated case designed to thwart his political ambitions, responded by calling for an election boycott. That prompted the Kremlin to demand an investigation to determine whether his statement broke the law.
On Wednesday, Navalny upped the ante, saying he and his supporters would organize nationwide rallies on Jan. 28 in 85 towns and cities, including Moscow and St Petersburg, to support his call for an election boycott.
""We refuse to call the reappointment of Putin an election,"" Navalny said in a statement on his website. 
""We are not going to vote and will convince everyone around us not to vote. We are going to campaign (for a boycott) with all our might.""
TURNOUT
A boycott could pose a problem for the Kremlin which is keen to ensure a high turnout in the election to help confer legitimacy on Putin's expected victory amid some signs of apathy among voters.
Under Russian law, the time and place of rallies must be agreed with the authorities who have often declined to authorize them in the past, citing conflicting events or security concerns. When the opposition has gone ahead anyway, the police have broken up rallies by force and detained attendees. 
Polls show that Putin, who has led Russia for 18 years as either president or prime minister, is on course to comfortably win another six-year term, allowing him to rule until 2024, when he'll turn 72.
The former KGB officer is running as an independent, a move seen as a way of strengthening his image as a ""father of the nation"" rather than as a party political figure.
The ruling United Russia party, which he once led and which controls three quarters of seats in the lower house of parliament, has said it will support him, as will Just Russia, a pro-government center-left group.
Allies laud Putin for restoring national pride and expanding Moscow's global clout with interventions in Syria and Ukraine.
But Navalny says Putin has been in power too long and that his support is artificially maintained by a biased state media and an unfair system which excludes genuine opponents. 
Navalny has made a name for himself by successfully leveraging social media and conducting high profile corruption investigations into senior officials. He has also organized some of the biggest anti-government protests in years.

Opinion polls, whose accuracy Navalny dismisses, put his support in single digits while giving Putin an approval rating of around 80 percent.

TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - A Libyan crude oil pipeline blown up on Tuesday will take about a week to repair, the head of state oil firm NOC told Reuters on Wednesday.
A ""terrorist group"" was probably responsible for the explosion as such groups were roaming around in the desert where the remote field is located, said a spokesman for an eastern Libyan force tasked with protecting oilfields.
The blast, about 130 km (80 miles) south of the Es Sider terminal, cut output by between 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) and 100,000 bpd, according to NOC, which said the cause was unclear.
""It is estimated that the repair will take about one week from today,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanallah said in a written response to questions. ""The damage is estimated as 30 to 35 meters of a 24 (inch) pipeline."" 
""This will not have a major effect in the marketing program, only a little change,"" he added.
He did not give a production figure, but an industry source said Libya's output had dropped to between 900,000 bpd and one million bpd.
An official at NOC subsidiary Waha Oil, which operates the pipeline, said a team of senior executives and engineers would visit the site on Wednesday to assess the damage.
The pipeline was attacked after being uncovered by maintenance workers carrying our repair work to stop an oil leak, said Miftah Magariaf, commander of the oil protection force.
""That's the reason the pipeline became visible. Otherwise I don't think it would have been attacked,"" he said, adding security in the desert was shaky.
""Terrorist groups have been roaming in the desert and creating problems everywhere,"" he said.
Flows have been diverted, but at least one tanker's berth at Es Sider was canceled in the morning, an industry source said.
But a Libyan shipping agent said the tanker, Al Mabrouk, was likely to berth at the port in the afternoon. 
NOC may have to revise January loading programs for Es Sider due to the outage, and likely cancel some cargoes, according to two trading sources that lift Libyan crude.
A preliminary loading schedule for the terminal shows 13 crude tankers are due to load at the port next month, at a rate of around 252,000 bpd.
The blown-up crude pipeline lies in an area of poor security where Islamic State has operated in the past.

Kurdish groups have not taken part in any round of Syrian peace talks so far despite their control of more than a quarter of Syria. Turkey opposes their involvement in talks.
Moscow backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's six-year-old civil war while Turkey opposes him.

About 40 Syrian rebel groups, including factions that have taken part in other rounds of peace talks, said on Monday they would refuse to attend the Sochi congress.
Russia is the most powerful supporter of Assad. Its jets have helped him bring the rebellion against his rule near to an end, and rebels say Moscow has put no pressure on him to find a political solution.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A Saudi Arabian businessman whose family's commercial empire is involved in a multi-billion dollar debt dispute has been released from detention in the kingdom's Eastern Province, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Abdulaziz al-Sanea's release comes as the government steps up efforts to find a company to run a struggling 750-bed hospital owned by his family, a search that has turned the spotlight on the kingdom's effort to bring overseas investors into the healthcare sector.
Al-Sanea was freed late last week after being detained in October for unpaid debts, related at least in part to the hospital, according to the sources.
An arrest warrant, issued in October for his brother Mishal for the same reason, was also lifted, according to the same sources.
At the same time, the authorities approved a plan intended to restart operations at Saad Specialist Hospital in the city of Khobar in Eastern Province, which has been closed in recent weeks after being unable to pay staff and contractors, according to the sources.
A special committee, formed by the government to find solutions for the hospital's future, concluded that the facility should be operated under the guidance of the Ministry of Health for seven years, the sources said.
The revenue would be deposited into the account of the court handling the liquidation of Saad Group, the family's company that owns the hospital, the sources added. 
The Ministry of Justice did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
London-listed NMC Healthcare is among companies in talks with the government to take over the running of the hospital, one of the top cancer treatment facilities in the Gulf, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Maan al-Sanea, the owner of Saad Group and the father of Abdulaziz and Mishal, is still in a civil detention center in Khobar, according to the sources. He was also detained by authorities in October for unpaid debts.
Saad Group, which at its height employed about 12,000 staff and has interests in sectors spanning banking to healthcare, ran into difficulties in 2009 because of heavy debts, unleashing a series of long-running legal battles and a Saudi court-enforced liquidation of the company.
Reemas Group, a financial consultancy hired by Saad Group, last month outlined a proposed settlement covering $4 billion in debt under a plan to repay part of the money owed to creditors.
The legal action against the family is believed to be separate from a crackdown on corruption by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in which dozens of Saudi princes and businessmen are being held.
The kingdom has released 23 of the 200-or-so powerful individuals detained since November on corruption charges after they reached deals with the government, Okaz newspaper reported on Tuesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans differ widely in their views of what constitutes sexual harassment, with age and race as well as gender throwing up the dividing lines, posing a challenge for those who police for such conduct in the workplace.
The issue has been thrown into the national spotlight as a string of prominent men in U.S. politics, entertainment and the media have been felled by allegations of sexual misconduct in recent months.
A Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll, released on Wednesday, asked more than 3,000 American adults to consider eight different scenarios and then prompted them to decide if they would personally label each to be an example of sexual harassment. The variation in responses showed a need for employers to spell out expected standards, employment experts said.
While most adults in the Dec. 13-18 poll agreed that acts such as intentional groping or kissing “without your consent” amounted to sexual harassment, they disagreed over a number of other actions.
(Graphic on the poll: http://tmsnrt.rs/2BFmwWI) 
When asked about “unwanted compliments about your appearance,” for example, 38 percent of adults said this amounted to sexual harassment, while 47 percent said it did not.
Some 41 percent of adults said they thought it was sexual harassment when someone told you “dirty jokes” but 44 percent said it was not. And 44 percent of adults said that nonconsensual hugging was sexual harassment, while 40 percent said it was not.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that enforces workplace discrimination laws, says sexual harassment can include unwelcome sexual advances as well as other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that affects an individual's employment, interferes with their performance or creates an intimidating or hostile work environment.
But courts have disagreed on when individual actions cross the line into harassment. And many workplace sexual harassment cases are settled by employers before they ever reach a court, so there is not a constant judicial airing of standards.
TOUCHING AND HUGGING
Since people come to work with different ideas of what is appropriate, managers should train their employees and develop clear lines of conduct so that there are no misunderstandings, said Suzanne Goldberg, director of the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law at Columbia Law School.
“The onus is on employers” to set the tone, Goldberg said. “Even if the co-workers don’t object or go to management to complain.” 
In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, for example, 19 percent of men said that touching someone intentionally without their consent was not sexual harassment, compared with 11 percent of women. The poll did not specify exactly what was meant by non-consensual touching. 
Fifty-two percent of people from racial minorities said that they considered non-consensual hugging to be sexual harassment, compared with 39 percent of whites. 
While most adults said they thought that it was sexual harassment to send “pornographic pictures” to someone without their consent, younger people appeared to be more permissive.
Eighty-three percent of millennials, or those adults born after 1982, said it was sexual harassment, compared with 90 percent of gen-Xers (born 1965-1981) and 94 percent of baby boomers (born 1946-1964.)
Experts in sexual harassment law said it is understandable that women, especially women who are racial minorities, define sexual harassment differently than men, given that many have experienced it first-hand.
“Men do not cross the street to avoid people,” said Joanna Grossman, a law professor at Southern Methodist University who specializes in workplace equality. “Virtually all women do, whether or not they’ve been attacked before. It’s part of growing up in a group that’s been victimized for so long.”
WORKPLACE STANDARDS
Clear workplace standards would help everyone, including those who are accused of sexual harassment, said Minna Kotkin, director of the Brooklyn Law School Employment Law Clinic.
Kotkin, whose clinic provides legal help for people dealing with sexual harassment in the workplace, said she recently advised a man who said he was fired because he misunderstood where the line had been set. 
“He worked in retail, and this was a place where there was sexual banter going around,” Kotkin said. “And one day he made a comment about a co-worker’s breasts. And then later she claimed that he grabbed her by the waist.”
“He got fired, and he was really surprised,” she said. “He thought that conduct was part of their relationship ... But the question is, maybe this woman tolerated this all along and then finally had enough?”
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the entire sample. The credibility interval is higher for subsets based on gender, age and race, as the sample size is reduced.

688,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 09:30AM ET</span>","Turkey to review 11,480 cases linked to app used by coup suspects","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish prosecutors said on Wednesday they will review legal cases against 11,480 people after finding they had been re-directed unwittingly to a messaging app linked to suspects in last year's failed coup.
Turkey has so far identified 215,000 users of the messaging app ByLock, which was believed to be used by supporters of a U.S.-based cleric blamed for the failed July 2016 coup attempt. It launched investigations against more than 23,000 of them.
But on Wednesday the Ankara prosecutor's office said many of them had been re-directed to ByLock without their knowledge or consent, after downloading a different app which had functions for prayer times and music.
""As a result of a detailed examination, it has been determined that 11,480 GSM number users with similar properties in terms of connection data parameters were unwittingly re-directed to ByLock IPs, it said.
State-run Anadolu news agency quoted Ankara chief prosecutor Yuksel Kocaman as saying that he would ask for nearly 1,000 people to be released unless there was other evidence against them. 
He said an arrest warrant had been issued for the developer of the other app which had re-directed users to ByLock.
Authorities say ByLock was widely used by followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who the government blames for orchestrating the failed military coup in which 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied any involvement.
Since the coup attempt, more than 50,000 people, including civil servants and security personnel, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs.
Rights groups say the crackdown has been exploited to muzzle dissent. The government says the measures have been necessary due to the security threats which Turkey has faced since the putsch.

MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberian election officials began tallying votes on Wednesday from Tuesday's presidential election, as Liberians awaited results that should usher in the country's first democratic transfer of power in over seven decades. 
Election magistrates, in a soccer stadium outside the capital Monrovia, began compiling vote totals from the country's 15 counties after Tuesday's run-off between former soccer star George Weah and Vice President Joseph Boakai.
Weah's camp said its own tallies based on results from individual polling stations showed him winning with about 70 percent of the vote. Unofficial partial results announced on local radio stations also showed Weah in the lead. 
The election commission said people should wait for official counts. A news conference which had been expected to announce early results on Wednesday morning was postponed until the afternoon, with final results due on Thursday.
Turnout for Tuesday's poll seemed low but people in Monrovia expressed relief that the vote had gone smoothly, after a first round in October that several candidates said was marred by fraud.
The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed a legal challenge brought by the third-place finisher and backed by Boakai but the proceedings delayed the second round by over a month.
""The election was free, fair and transparent,"" said Kelly Johnson, a 29-year-old trader. ""No one was forced to do anything. We went there freely and we voted freely."" 
Weah and Boakai are vying to succeed outgoing President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, whose 12-year rule cemented peace in the West African country after civil war ended in 2003. 
Many Liberians have criticized Johnson Sirleaf for not doing enough to root out endemic poverty and corruption and are eager for fresh leadership.
Weah, who in 1995 became the first non-European to win European soccer's player of the year award, is widely considered the favorite, having taken 38.4 percent of the vote to Boakai's 28.8 percent in the first round.
""It is clear. We are only waiting for the (election commission) to announce the results and declare him president,"" Morluba Morlu, Weah's deputy campaign manager for operations, told Reuters.
""We are calling on... Boakai to concede defeat and congratulate George Weah,"" he said.
Officials from Boakai's ruling Unity Party were not immediately available for comment but at the party headquarters, supporters were more circumspect. 
""We are listening to the result that the radio is giving. At least we are satisfied with Lofa County results,"" said Jerry Mulbah, referring to Boakai's home county in northern Liberia, where unofficial results showed him in the lead.

The pair, appointed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, were elevated to similar positions in the ruling ZANU-PF party on Saturday. 
Chiwenga retired from the military this month. His appointment was expected as a reward for leading a de facto coup in November that ended Robert Mugabe’s 37-year rule and brought Mnangagwa to power.
It also adds to signs of a consolidation of power for the army since it turned against the 93-year-old Mugabe. Mnangagwa has appointed several senior military officers to his cabinet and the ruling party's top decision-making body, the Politburo. 

Mnangagwa is under pressure from opposition parties and the public to implement political reforms.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A senior UAE diplomat said on Wednesday the Arab world would not be led by Turkey, the Gulf State's first comment on Ankara since a quarrel broke out last week over a retweet by the Emirati foreign minister that President Tayyip Erdogan called an insult.
Anwar Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, said there was a need for Arab countries to rally around the ""Arab axis"" of Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
""The sectarian and partisan view is not an acceptable alternative, and the Arab world will not be led by Tehran or Ankara,"" he wrote on his official Twitter page.
Last week, Turkey summoned the charge d'affaires at the UAE embassy in Ankara, after UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahayan shared a tweet that accused Turkish troops of looting the holy city of Medina a century ago.
Erdogan himself lashed out: ""Some impertinent man sinks low and goes as far as accusing our ancestors of thievery ... What spoiled this man? He was spoiled by oil, by the money he has,"" the Turkish leader said at an awards ceremony.
Turkey's state-run Anadolu newspaper reported on Saturday that Turkey planned to rename the street where the UAE embassy is located in Ankara after Fakhreddin Pasha, the commander of the Ottoman Turkish troops at Medina in 1916. Medina, the holiest site in Islam after Mecca, is now in Saudi Arabia.
The UAE sees itself as a bulwark against political forms of Islam, and views Erdogan's Islamist-rooted ruling AK party as a supporter of groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, which it opposes.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel wants to name a train station after Donald Trump to thank him for recognizing Jerusalem as its capital, but the site of the planned building could be as divisive as the U.S. president's declaration.
Transport Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday he had chosen a proposed subway stop near the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City - right in the middle of the area that the Palestinians want as their own future capital.
""I have decided to name the Western Wall station ... after U.S. President Donald Trump for his courageous and historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish people and the State of Israel,"" Katz said in a statement.
The envisaged underground extension of a high-speed rail link between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem is still on the drawing board and a transport ministry spokeswoman said other departments still needed to approve it.
The announcement was quickly condemned by Palestinian leaders already angered by Trump's Dec. 6 decision to overturn decades of U.S. policy on the city.
""The Israeli extremist government is trying to race against time to impose facts on the ground in the city of Jerusalem,"" Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Executive Committee, told Reuters.
Trump has said he was simply acknowledged the reality on the ground by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital - but the Palestinians and most world powers have said he undermined the long-held position that Jerusalem's status must be settled by future negotiations.
A ministry spokeswoman said the proposed station and underground extension still required the approval of various governmental planning committees, and gave no date for when a final go-ahead might be given. She said she did not know where funds for the estimated $700-million rail add-on would come from.

Israel considers all of Jerusalem its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem - among whose shrines is Islam's third-holiest mosque, Al-Aqsa - as the capital of a state they seek in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.

693,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 08:40AM ET</span>",Myanmar says U.S. sanctions against general based on 'unreliable accusations',"By Shoon Naing and Simon Lewis
(Reuters) - Myanmar ""feels sad"" over a U.S. decision to sanction a military general, a government spokesman said, after Washington linked the commander last week to abuses against the Rohingya Muslim minority.
""This targeted sanction is based on unreliable accusations without evidence, as we have repeatedly said, so we feel sad for that,"" Zaw Htay, spokesman for Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, told Reuters by phone late on Tuesday.
The Trump administration announced on Dec. 21 that it was sanctioning Major General Maung Maung Soe, who was in charge of a crackdown on the Rohingya minority in the western state of Rakhine.
The United States, as well as the United Nations, have called the crackdown ""ethnic cleansing"". About 655,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine state and sought shelter over the border in Bangladesh, according to the United Nations. 
The United States said American officials had ""examined credible evidence of Maung Maung Soe's activities, including allegations against Burmese security forces of extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, and arbitrary arrest as well as the widespread burning of villages"".
The military and the civilian government of Suu Kyi have denied allegations of widespread abuse in Rakhine. 
The testimonies of Rohingya refugees were only ""talking stories"", Zaw Htay said, adding that Myanmar would act if it received ""reliable and strong evidence"" that its troops committed crimes.
""We have told international governments and human rights groups including the U.N. that the current government is committed to protecting and promoting human rights,"" said Zaw Htay.
The U.S. Treasury said Maung Maung Soe, former chief of the army's Western Command, would have his U.S. assets frozen and Americans could no longer deal with him.
Reuters was unable to determine if Maung Maung Soe had business interests in Myanmar or elsewhere.
Maung Maung Soe was transferred from his post in Rakhine and ""put in reserve"", an army spokesman told Reuters on Nov. 13. No reason was given, but the military said the same day action would be taken against officials who were ""weak in acquiring information"" and who allowed the militant Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) to spread through Muslim villages in Rakhine.
Reuters was unable to contact Maung Maung Soe. Major General Tun Tun Nyi of the military's public relations division, the True News Information Unit, said he had no comment on the sanctions and declined to answer questions on Maung Maung Soe.
MODERN FORCE
As well as dominating the country's politics for decades, Myanmar's army - known as the Tatmadaw or ""Royal Force"" - has gained notoriety for brutal counter-insurgency tactics employed against rebels seeking autonomy in the borderlands since independence from Britain in 1948, according to historians and human rights monitors. 
But since it began ceding power in 2011 - albeit under a constitution that keeps soldiers in key posts - the army has sought to burnish its image as a modern fighting force.
It has defended its actions in Rakhine, with military investigators concluding that troops adhered to rules of engagement and sought to minimize civilian casualties while responding to ""terrorist"" provocations.
But the spiraling Rohingya crisis has dashed hopes of expanding engagement with Western armies, Andrew Selth, an academic who has researched Myanmar's armed forces, wrote in September.
""This is a significant loss for the Tatmadaw, which is keen to learn about foreign military policies and practices,"" Selth wrote on the website of the Sydney-based Lowy Institute. ""Such contacts would have also helped its officers learn about international norms of behavior and the role of armed forces in democracies.""
CLEARANCES
Myanmar's military does not provide detailed biographies of senior officers.
In February last year, a state media report said Maung Maung Soe was a brigadier general in the far south of the country, near the border with Thailand. He was referred to as a major general in charge of the military's Western Command in October, 2016, shortly after ARSA attacked three border posts there, killing nine guards.
In the weeks after the attacks, Rohingya villagers told Reuters of gang rapes by soldiers and extrajudicial killings.
Two military sources told Reuters that Maung Maung Soe oversaw battalions Nos. 352, 551, 564 and 345, which led the so-called ""clearance operations"", and he reported directly to a Bureau of Special Operations in the capital Naypyitaw.
His forces were again in combat following more widespread ARSA attacks on Aug. 25 this year, although troops from elite units that report straight to Naypyitaw were airlifted into Rakhine ahead of those attacks.
New York-based Human Rights Watch said in October that Battalion 564 was identified by villagers as taking part in an alleged massacre of scores of people in the village of Maung Nu, close to the unit's base in the Buthidaung area.
The day Maung Maung Soe's replacement as the commander in Rakhine was announced, the military released a report saying its own internal investigation had exonerated security forces of all accusations of atrocities, including in Buthidaung.

Turkey has demanded the removal of Assad from power and backed rebels fighting to overthrow him, but it has toned down its demands since it started working with Assad's allies Russia and Iran for a political resolution. 
""Assad is definitely a terrorist who has carried out state terrorism,"" Erdogan told a televised news conference with his Tunisian counterpart Beji Caid Essebsi in Tunis. 
""It is impossible to continue with Assad. How can we embrace the future with a Syrian president who has killed close to a million of his citizens?"" he said, in some of his harshest comments for weeks.
Though Turkey has long demanded Assad's removal, it is now more focused in Syria on the threat from Islamist militants and Kurdish fighters it considers allies of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), who it says have formed a ""terror corridor"" on its southern border. 
Turkey says the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara views as an extension of the outlawed PKK which has fought an insurgency in southeast Turkey since the 1980s, cannot be invited to Syrian peace talks in the Kazakh capital Astana.
The YPG is the main element in a force that Washington has assisted with training, weapons, air support and help from ground advisers in the battle against Islamic State. That U.S. support has angered Ankara, a NATO ally of Washington.
Despite its differences with Russia and Iran, Turkey has worked with the two powers in the search for a political solution in Syria.
Ankara, Moscow and Tehran also brokered a deal to set up and monitor a ""de-escalation zone"" to reduce fighting between insurgents and Syrian government forces in Syria's rebel-held northwestern Idlib province.

""We can't say (Assad) will handle this. It is impossible for Turkey to accept this. Northern Syria has been handed over as a terror corridor. There is no peace in Syria and this peace won't come with Assad,"" Erdogan said.

696,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 08:29AM ET</span>",Mexico presidential hopeful hemmed in by ruling party legacy,"By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mired in allegations of corruption, Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has thrown its weight behind an untainted outsider in a bid to clean up its image and hang on to the presidency in elections next July.
But having never been a member of the party, former finance minister and PRI presidential hopeful Jose Antonio Meade faces a delicate balancing act persuading undecided voters he will cut out graft without alienating the grassroots support he needs to win.
It is proving to be a tough job.
The awkward symbiosis limits Meade's ability to play to the strengths that PRI grandees hope will overcome the accusations of embezzlement, fraud and vote buying that have plagued the party under President Enrique Pena Nieto.
Reliant on the PRI machinery to deliver votes, Meade must wrap himself in the party banner, while distancing his campaign from the failures of the outgoing government he also represents.
""He's between a rock and a hard place,"" said Andres Rozental, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister.
Pena Nieto is constitutionally barred from re-election, and the centrist PRI will not formally elect its candidate until Feb. 18. However, the party has lined up behind Meade, who held various cabinet posts across two opposing administrations before announcing his run late last month.
Meade, a technocrat with a sharp command of the minutiae of the economy, launched his campaign for the PRI candidacy in a straw sombrero festooned with red and green streamers in the poor southern town of San Juan Chamula on Dec. 14.
Meade acknowledged Pena Nieto in his speech, which called for a ""secure and just Mexico."" But he did not detail policies or directly address corruption. Like the president, he has said graft must be attacked by strengthening institutions.
In subsequent outings to rally the PRI faithful, he has continued to frame his vision in general terms - prompting expressions of dismay by some of his supporters.
""It's a typical PRI campaign,"" said one pro-Meade lawmaker, shaking his head, and speaking on condition of anonymity.
CORRUPTION CONUNDRUM
Polls show Meade has plenty of work to do.
A survey by polling firm Parametria published on Dec. 19 put him 11 percentage points behind leftist front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor who has spent years railing against corruption and inequality.
Another survey, by pollster Mitofsky, showed this month that 57.4 percent of voters reject the PRI, up nearly seven points from October, and 17 points more than any other party.
In December 2011, the same point in the previous campaign, the PRI had a lead of about 17 points and only one in five voters rejected the party, according to Mitofsky data.
Serving in the cabinet for almost seven years running, Meade has sold himself as irreproachably honest and the safest pair of hands for the economy, painting Lopez Obrador and conservative rival Ricardo Anaya as risky bets for Mexico's stability.
However, his time in government has left the 48-year-old with a problematic legacy to defend.
Gang violence has worsened in the past couple of years, with murders hitting a record high in 2017. [L1N1ON0EQ]
Meanwhile the economy is growing at barely 2 percent annually, less than half the rate the government first targeted, inflation is near a 16-year high and the peso has depreciated by more than 34 percent against the dollar under Pena Nieto.
A study by the Pew Research Center in September identified crime and corruption as the top concerns for Mexicans.
As standard-bearer for an unpopular government, Meade has to present more compelling solutions to those problems than his rivals, said one senior official backing him. 
""It was one of this government's biggest mistakes not to see the damage that corruption could do to its reputation,"" said the official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The official said he believed Meade's policies could become clearer once he is formally invested as PRI candidate.
Meade's campaign did not reply to requests for comment.
Another government official closely following the campaign said that while Meade could recognize failings in the PRI, he could not be expected to attack the party. ""You can't take the PRI's core vote for granted,"" the official said.
With some PRI governors, lawmakers and Pena Nieto facing allegations of corruption, it could be ""suicidal"" for Meade to push a tough line on graft, said Juan Pardinas, general director of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a think tank.

""How could you (take) a strong stance against corruption, being the PRI candidate?,"" he asked. ""It's like (taking) a strong stance against racism at a Ku Klux Klan rally.""

697,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 08:23AM ET</span>","Special Report: A business where human bodies were butchered, packaged and sold","By John Shiffman, Reade Levinson and Brian Grow
PHOENIX (Reuters) - Sam Kazemi stood over the old man’s corpse. Nearby lay pliers, a scalpel and a motorized saw designed to cut drywall and pipe.
On a busy day, Kazemi might harvest body parts from five or six people who had donated their bodies to science. On this day in November 2013, the corpse before Kazemi typified the donors who gave their remains to his employer, Biological Resource Center.
The man was a retired factory worker with a ninth-grade education. He had lived with his wife in a mobile home in Mohave Valley, Arizona, and had died six days earlier, aged 75. His name was Conrad Patrick. 
But after he died and his body was donated, Patrick became a commodity, known by the company’s initials and a number: BRC13112103.
Reuters reviewed thousands of internal BRC records and confidential law enforcement documents containing profiles of Patrick and 2,280 other donors. The documents include invoices and inventories for thousands of body parts harvested from those people. They show how their bodies were dissected, which body parts were sent where, and why buyers obtained them. 
Kazemi helped cut up and package Patrick into seven pieces. BRC shipped Patrick’s left foot to a Chicago-area orthopedic lab. His left shoulder was sent to a Las Vegas company that holds surgical seminars. His head and his spine went to a project run by the U.S. Army. And Patrick’s “external reproductive organs” were sent to a local university. His right foot and left knee were placed in the company’s freezers, where they became part of BRC’s million-dollar inventory of flesh and bone.
For more than a year, Reuters has examined America’s body trade, a little-known and virtually unregulated industry. These businesses, which call themselves non-transplant tissue banks, are also known as body brokers. 
The operations can resemble meat-packing plants. At BRC, body parts from heads to fingernails were harvested and sold. On Saturday mornings, Kazemi taught college students how to dismember cadavers in the company lab. He also starred in a grisly training video, demonstrating how to carve out a man’s spine using a motorized saw.
The documents obtained by Reuters – along with dozens of interviews with investigators, former BRC workers and families of donors – offer an unparalleled look at how one of America’s major body brokers operated. 
The records, never before made public, also reveal how little the government or the donors themselves understood what was happening at the company, and show in graphic detail how a cadaver becomes a commodity. 
Sales invoices detail many of those transactions.
For $607, BRC sold the liver of a public school janitor to a medical-device company. The torso of a retired bank manager, bought by a Swiss research institute, fetched $3,191. A large Midwestern healthcare system paid $65 for two femoral arteries, one from a church minister. And the lower legs of a union activist were purchased by a Minnesota product-development company for $350 each.
For raw material, the industry relies in large part on people too poor to afford a funeral, offering to cremate a portion of each donated body for free. 
A Reuters analysis of BRC donor files from May 3, 2011 through January 20, 2014 confirmed how important the disadvantaged were to business. The vast majority of BRC donors came from neighborhoods where the median household income fell below the state average. Four out of five donors didn’t graduate from college, about twice the ratio of the country as a whole.
Before brokers accept a body, they typically present the donor or next of kin with a consent form. These agreements are often written in technical language that many donors and relatives say they find hard to understand. The documents give brokers the right to dismember the dead, then sell or rent body parts to medical researchers and educators, often for hundreds or thousands of dollars. At BRC, a whole body sold for $5,893, records show.
Since 2004, when a federal health panel unsuccessfully called on the U.S. government to regulate the industry, Reuters found that more than 2,357 body parts obtained by brokers from at least 1,638 people have ended up misused, abused or desecrated. 
Documents reviewed for this article indicate that those figures are vastly understated. The extent of BRC’s operation surprised even investigators who raided the Phoenix-based company in 2014.
There, agents discovered 10 tons of frozen human remains – 1,755 total body parts that included 281 heads, 241 shoulders, 337 legs and 97 spines. 
Applying a state forfeiture law, authorities hauled away the contents of BRC’s freezers, filling 142 body bags. One bag held parts from at least 36 different people. 
The seizure was so large that officials struggled to properly handle the body parts. When plans to cremate the remains stalled, officials brought three walk-in freezers to a military base and stacked the body bags inside, one atop another. Parts from 851 different people remained in those freezers for almost three years before they were cremated.
The raid on BRC was part of a broader federal probe into the suspected practices of one of its clients, Arthur Rathburn. A Detroit body broker, Rathburn has pleaded not guilty to charges of defrauding customers. During a 2013 search of Rathburn’s warehouse, federal agents found rotting body parts along with four preserved fetuses, confidential photographs reviewed by Reuters show. It is not clear how Rathburn acquired the fetuses or what he planned to do with them. He was indicted for allegedly selling diseased body parts without warning buyers. His trial is set for January.
After the BRC raid, the company went out of business. Its founder and former owner, Stephen Gore, later pleaded guilty to fraud – not for selling body parts but for misleading customers by shipping them contaminated specimens. His punishment: probation. He is expected to testify at the Rathburn trial. 
Gore’s attorney, Clark Derrick, said Gore always tried to act in the best interests of his donors. “At some point the business grew exponentially, we became shorthanded, we cut some corners, and for that I apologize and make amends,” Derrick said on Gore’s behalf.
PROFITING OFF THE POOR
Gore housed his business in a 9,000-square-foot building once occupied by an insurance agency – a one-story facility near two interstate highways and the Phoenix airport. From 2005 until early 2014, court records show, BRC received about 5,000 human bodies and distributed more than 20,000 body parts.
As Reuters reported last year, BRC also sold body parts to U.S. Army contractors for military experiments. A Pentagon spokeswoman said BRC provided the body parts “under false pretenses,” misleading the Army that consent had been secured for donors to be used in destructive tests.
Among the parts BRC sold for the Army experiments were the heads and spines of Conrad Patrick and Leon Small, a 71-year-old retiree who had once managed a furniture factory. 
On the consent forms Patrick and Small signed, each man checked a box stating that he did not wish to be used in military or destructive tests, records show. 
But just days after Patrick and Small died, a BRC employee called their widows and persuaded them to amend the forms so their husbands could be used by the military, according to recordings of the calls reviewed by Reuters. The widows said the calls came during a traumatic time. 
“I didn’t understand what they were talking about,” Dona Patrick said. “But I said ‘OK.’”
Bodies or parts from at least 20 BRC donors were used without their consent in Army experiments, Reuters found. Parts from Small and Patrick, however, were not. The military halted testing when it learned of the raid at BRC. 
The shoulders of both men were sent to a for-profit surgical training company in Nevada.
The widows, Karen Small and Dona Patrick, are among two dozen next of kin who said they were surprised to learn that BRC profited from a relative’s donated body. 
“They prey on people that have no money, that are poor, that have no insurance – like us,” Patrick said.
Family members of some donors said BRC employees led them to believe body donation was regulated by federal and state authorities, and that selling body parts is illegal. Based on those pitches, the relatives said they believed the remains wouldn’t be sold. In truth, there are virtually no regulations on the body trade.
“It’s a horrible thing,” Small said. “Sick.”
In a statement to Reuters last year, Gore said his employees took “great care to ensure that donors and their families were well-informed about the processes.” Gore acknowledged at his sentencing that he relied on books and the Internet for instruction on how to handle the bodies he sold. 
“HOMEMADE HORROR MOVIE”
In 2012, BRC hired lab technician Kazemi. He earned $21 an hour. Before joining the company, his resume shows, he spent the previous decade working as a real estate agent, a waiter at a Morton’s steakhouse and a manager for an Olive Garden restaurant. 
When he arrived at BRC, he was 35 and had just graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in kinesiology, the study of body movement. At ASU, he was a teaching assistant in an anatomy lab.
In 2013, Kazemi starred in a BRC instructional video. It opens with a jarring title, punctuated for emphasis: “Stripped Cervical Spine!”
The video begins with a close-up of Kazemi wearing a mask, gloves, goggles and a surgical gown. Then it pulls back to reveal a body face down on a table. The man’s shoulders and arms have already been sheared off. The head lolls from side to side until Kazemi holds it still. 
With a scalpel, he makes incisions along the neck and back, then peels away the man’s skin and scalp. About seven minutes into the video, Kazemi picks up a construction saw.
“On this one,” he says of the cadaver, “we are using a sturdy, thicker 9-inch blade. You want to make sure that the blade is long enough to reach from ear to ear across the back.”
In his interview with Reuters, Kazemi described the video as clinical and “not disrespectful to donors” in any way. It was meant for internal use only, he said. Kazemi also said he did not know how BRC acquired donors or where body parts were shipped.
In hindsight, Kazemi said using a motorized saw was wrong because it cannot be cleaned well enough to avoid spreading diseases.
“Would I do something like that now that I know better? No,” Kazemi said. “But at the time, that’s what was provided to me.”
Two retired investigators for the Arizona attorney general said even veteran prosecutors recoiled when they viewed the 24-minute video.
“It was like a homemade horror movie,” said Charles Loftus, the former assistant chief agent. 
“I couldn’t sleep at night after seeing that,” said Matthew Parker, another former agent who says he retired with a disability – post-traumatic stress disorder – related to his work on the case. “It looked like a junkyard chop shop where they are just ripping things apart.”
INTERNING AT BRC
Kazemi also spent Saturdays in BRC’s lab teaching college students about dissection. 
On one Saturday in late 2013, ASU junior Emily Glynn said she showed up for her first day at the lab. She was majoring in nutrition.
“I was really surprised when I got the internship because I didn’t have any experience,” said Glynn, then 20. “Just went in the first day and learned things on the job.”
That first day, under Kazemi’s direction, interns used pliers to remove fingernails from donors, Glynn recalled. 
“I don’t want to say it was barbaric, but it was weird,” she said. “One day, I found myself holding the hand of a 70-year-old woman and felt like I needed to apologize to her, to say, ‘I’m sorry.’”
Neither Glynn nor Kazemi knew how the fingernails were used, they said, and Reuters could not locate invoices for that order. But the news agency did identify fingernails from 22 other donors that were sold by BRC. They went to a North Carolina bioengineering research company, SciKon Innovation. 
SciKon CEO Randy McClelland said he was unaware that BRC was raided by the FBI. He said his business helps companies study how products enter the bloodstream through fingernails. “Like new cosmetics that go on your skin,” he said. 
On another Saturday, Glynn said, Kazemi gathered the interns around the body of another elderly woman. 
“He says, ‘Emily, you’ve never cut off a head before, and everyone else has, so do you want to try?’” Glynn recalled. “And I’m, like, ‘OK.’”
As she held the reciprocating saw, Glynn said, Kazemi steadied her grip. 
“It wasn’t a full-on chainsaw like you would see in a horror movie, but it was a smaller version,” Glynn said. “And then I just went for it. I was expecting lots of blood but there wasn’t much to it. It came right off,” she said of the woman’s head.
Kazemi said he doesn’t remember helping an intern cut off a head or any other body parts. The Saturday sessions, he said, were more akin to lectures during which he showed interns various organs and other body parts. 
In her senior thesis, Glynn described her time at BRC differently.
“Over the course of the internship, I stripped subcutaneous fat from the vertebrae of a cervical spine, practiced performing cricothyrotomies (incisions to the throat), sutured dismembered legs using an oversized needle and twine, and decapitated an elderly woman with what looked and sounded like a chainsaw from  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD),” Glynn wrote in her thesis. “Not once did I receive formal training or instruction.”
BODY PARTS TO MIDDLEMEN
BRC’s customers were not always directly acquiring body parts from the broker for their own medical education, research or training programs. According to invoices, some customers were middlemen – brokers who resold or leased body parts originally donated to BRC. The consent forms gave BRC the discretion to choose its customers, but the forms did not state that body parts could be resold by third parties.
In 2012 and 2013, BRC sold at least 961 body parts, including at least 224 human heads, to three such middlemen.
One was Innoved Institute LLC, a Chicago-area medical lab provider that also supplies human body parts. Innoved was among BRC’s best customers. It received at least 32 shipments with 277 body parts. Innoved executives did not respond to requests for comment. 
Another was Rathburn, the Detroit-area broker facing trial next month. He received at least 26 heads from BRC. Rathburn’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. 
A third middleman was Biological Resource Center of Illinois, another Chicago-area broker. Better known as BRC-IL, it received at least 658 body parts from BRC. BRC-IL operated independently from BRC. But it was also raided by FBI agents as part of the federal probe into suspected fraud against donors and customers. No one has been charged with a crime in the BRC-IL matter, and executives there did not respond to requests for comment.
One of the shoulders shipped to BRC-IL came from the body of Robert Louis DeRosier, a casino security employee. He died at age 64 after a long battle with diabetes.
His widow, Tama DeRosier, lives in a mobile home park in Mohave Valley, Arizona. She said her husband donated his body hoping it might contribute to diabetes research. She did not expect anyone to make money selling his remains.
“That’s morbid,” the widow said. “Greed is a terrible thing.”
Russell Parker Jr, who helped care for his dying brother Todd, said he was surprised to learn from a reporter that BRC sold Todd’s right knee and offered to sell Todd’s head. Friends had recommended BRC, he said. And when the company returned his brother’s ashes, everything seemed “all on the up and up, very professional.”
“Shame on BRC for showing such disrespect,” Parker said. “That’s so wrong. It’s like trafficking.”
CONFUSED CONSENT
The companion of one donor cited another area of confusion: BRC’s use of the term “tissue.”
In sales pitches and on consent forms, body brokers commonly talk about retrieving tissue from donors. To the medical community, “tissue” means any part of the body – from an organ to a torso. 
But in interviews with Reuters, family members of some donors said they believed “tissue” meant only skin samples. Though BRC did sell skin, those sales represented just 2 percent of its business, invoices show. 
Maureen Krueger said her partner of 42 years, Fidel Silva, told a female hospice worker in his final days that he wished to be cremated. 
“And that’s when she brought it up: ‘Would you be interested in donating tissues?’” Krueger recalled. 
The way she understood it, Krueger said, a few skin samples would be removed for research purposes. In return, BRC would cremate Silva for free. Silva, a 69-year-old construction worker with a high school degree, peppered the hospice worker with questions. 
“He asked, ‘Well, are you sure? What are they going to do?’” Krueger said. “He wanted to know. And that’s when she assured him it was only body tissues, they only took samples, they didn’t remove any organs or parts or anything. It was just tissues. And that’s when Fidel agreed.”
The conversation took place at the Hospice of Havasu in Arizona. Its executive director, Dan Mathews, said he could not discuss the matter due to patient-privacy laws. But he said the hospice, which offers its clients options to donate their bodies to science, “removed that company BRC from our list of providers” upon hearing it was under investigation. 
Internal BRC records show the body broker removed Silva’s head, and his right and left arms from shoulder to hand. Each was tagged with a tracking number and prepped for sale.
“Wow,” Krueger said. “I didn’t really realize they could do all that. I mean, I didn’t understand that’s what would happen with Fidel at all.”
BODY PARTS IN LIMBO 
After the raid of BRC by federal and state agents, the body parts seized by authorities remained in limbo for almost three years. Their fate, detailed in confidential state logs, sworn statements and photographs, has never been made public.
Logistical problems began the day of the raid, said former agents Parker and Loftus. Authorities were stunned to find so much human flesh inside BRC, they said.
“We expected two freezers and a few hundred pounds of body parts,” said Loftus, who’s now running for state representative. “Instead, we found 40 freezers with 10 tons of bodies and parts.”
Agents entered in hazmat gear and took biopsies from each body part to preserve as evidence. Records show the agents then placed the 1,755 parts into 142 body bags. 
The bags were sent to 10 local funeral homes so the remains could be cremated. But records and interviews show that BRC and others for whom it was storing body parts objected to their destruction. They argued that the parts had a value of more than $1 million. 
The cremation plans were put on hold, but authorities soon faced a pressing problem, according to former agents Loftus and Parker. Funeral homes could refrigerate but not freeze the body parts, and the mortuaries began to complain that some of the parts were starting to thaw.
As a solution, authorities obtained three walk-in industrial freezers and installed them at a military base used by the Arizona National Guard. Then, body bag by body bag, the mortuaries delivered the parts, and Loftus and Parker helped carry them into the freezers.
In an interview, Parker recalled feeling body parts sloshing around inside the bags as he moved them. Some bags leaked blood that stained his pants and shoes. The experience led to his PTSD diagnosis, he said.
“It’s not how you treat human beings, human remains,” Parker testified in a deposition as part of his PTSD claim. “You don’t throw them in a bunch of body bags and then throw them into a freezer like a pile of garbage.”
The spokeswoman for the Arizona Attorney General’s Office said the body parts were kept for federal authorities “as evidence in ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions across the country.” An FBI spokesman declined to comment. In February, after almost three years in the containers, the remains were cremated and returned to families that requested them, the state spokeswoman said.
In response to the Gore case, the Arizona governor signed into law a bill that requires body brokers like BRC to be licensed and regularly inspected. The new law calls for brokers to follow a set of standards and to hire a medical doctor to supervise company practices.

Although the law was adopted a year and a half ago, it has yet to be enforced: The state health department still must create specific rules for brokers. It isn’t clear when it will. Health department officials, said a spokeswoman, “do not have an anticipated date of completion at this time.”

Polls show that Putin, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for the last 17 years as either president or prime minister, is on course to comfortably win another six-year term. That would allow him to rule until 2024, when he'll turn 72.
The former KGB officer is running as an independent, a move seen as a way of strengthening his image as a ""father of the nation"" rather than as a party political figure.
The ruling United Russia party and the Just Russia party have both said they will support him.
Allies laud Putin for restoring national pride and expanding Moscow's global clout with interventions in Syria and Ukraine.
But opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been barred from the election over a suspended prison sentence he says was fabricated, says Putin has been in power too long and that his support is artificially maintained by a biased state media and an unfair system which excludes genuine opponents. 

Navalny has called for a boycott of the election, raising the prospect of large-scale protests and clashes with the police.

An alliance of Corsica's two main nationalist parties swept a local election on Dec. 10 and has been pressing for talks with Paris. 
Its leaders want more autonomy on fiscal issues, an equal status for the French and Corsican languages, and the limiting of the right to buy property in some areas to people who have been resident on the holiday island for at least five years. 
The two-party ""Pe a Corsica"" (For Corsica) alliance won nearly two thirds of seats in the local assembly election. Support for their cause is driven by dissatisfaction with France's mainstream parties, mirroring a trend that has spurred secessionist ambitions elsewhere in Europe, such as Catalonia.
""Looking ahead, we could consider possible changes, and the prime minister has indicated this to Corsica's leaders,"" Macron said in an interview published by Spanish daily El Mundo on Wednesday. 
""But these would come, as elsewhere, within the framework of the constitution. This republican framework does not allow us to say yes to certain demands, such as on residency rights or recognizing Coriscan as the official language alongside French.""
Corsica's nationalists are split between those who seek greater autonomy and those who see full independence as the ultimate goal. 
Corsica makes up two of France's 101 ""departments"" - local administration areas. Unlike in Catalonia, its nationalists downplay any immediate ambitions for independence, saying the island - where Napoleon was born in 1769 - lacks the Spanish region's demographic and economic clout.
While Macron did not say what he might be prepared to negotiate, it is the first time he has touched on the subject since the vote. France is a highly centralized state and Corsica's demands for more autonomy have often been met with irritation and a refusal to negotiate by past governments.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 07:20AM ET</span>","North Korean defectors may have been exposed to radiation, says South","By Yuna Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - At least four defectors from North Korea have shown signs of radiation exposure, the South Korean government said on Wednesday, although researchers could not confirm if they were was related to Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.
The four are among 30 former residents of Kilju county, an area in North Korea that includes the nuclear test site Punggye-ri, who have been examined by the South Korean government since October, a month after the North conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told a news briefing. 
They were exposed to radiation between May 2009 and January 2013, and all defected to the South before the most recent test, a researcher at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, which carried out the examinations, told reporters.
North Korea has conducted six nuclear bomb tests since 2006, all in tunnels deep beneath the mountains of Punggye-ri, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and international condemnation.
The researcher cautioned that there were a number of ways people may be exposed to radiation, and that none of the defectors who lived had lived in Punggye-ri itself showed specific symptoms.
A series of small earthquakes in the wake of the last test - which the North claimed to be of a hydrogen bomb - prompted suspicions that it may have damaged the mountainous location in the northwest tip of the country.
Experts warned that further tests in the area could risk radioactive pollution.
After the Sept. 3 nuclear test, China’s Nuclear Safety Administration said it had begun emergency monitoring for radiation along its border with North Korea.
And in early December, a state-run newspaper in China’s Jilin province, which borders North Korea and Russia, published a page of “common sense” advice on how readers can protect themselves from a nuclear weapons attack or explosion.

Cartoon illustrations of ways to dispel radioactive contamination were also provided, such as using water to wash off shoes and using cotton buds to clean ears, as well as a picture of a vomiting child to show how medical help can be sought to speed the expulsion of radiation through stomach pumping and induced urination.

The United States has accused Russia of flouting the Open Skies Treaty, an agreement designed to build confidence between the countries' militaries which entered into force in 2002, and said it plans to take measures against Moscow.
The Wall Street Journal newspaper reported in September that this would include restricting Russian military flights over American territory in response to what it said was Moscow preventing U.S. observation flights over its heavily militarized Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad.
The United States is reported to have been keen to restrict Russian flights over Alaska and Hawaii as well as limiting the distance of Russian observation flights.
RIA on Wednesday cited Georgy Borisenko, a senior foreign ministry official, as saying Moscow would take reciprocal steps to respond to the new U.S. measures from Jan. 1 and limit the territory which U.S. observations flights can fly over.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan said on Wednesday any attempt by South Korea to revise a 2015 deal meant to have resolved a row over ""comfort women"" forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels would make relations ""unmanageable"" after Seoul said the agreement had failed.
The two U.S. allies, which share a bitter history including Japanese colonizations, are key to international efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs that it pursues in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha apologized for the controversial deal on Wednesday, as a panel investigating the negotiations leading up to the agreement unveiled its results.
The investigation concluded that the dispute over the comfort women, a Japanese euphemism for the thousands of girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in wartime brothels, could not be ""fundamentally resolved"" because the victims' demand for legal compensation had not been met.
South Korea wants Japan to take legal responsibility and provide due compensation.
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said the 2015 settlement, which includes a 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) fund to help the victims, resulted from ""legitimate negotiations"", warning any amendment may complicate relations.
""If (South Korea) tries to revise the agreement that is already being implemented, that would make Japan's ties with South Korea unmanageable and it would be unacceptable,"" Kono said in a statement.
Kang apologized for ""giving wounds of the heart to the victims, their families, civil society that support them and all other people because the agreement failed to sufficiently reflect a victim-oriented approach, which is the universal standard in resolving human rights issues"".
Under the deal, endorsed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in's predecessor and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan apologized to former comfort women and provided the fund to help them. 
They agreed the issue would be ""irreversibly resolved"" if both fulfilled their obligations. 
Tokyo says the matter of compensation for the women was settled under a 1965 treaty. It says that in 2015, it agreed to provide the funds to help them heal ""psychological wounds"".
The South Korean government will review the result of the investigation and translate it into policy after consulting victims and civic groups that support them, Kang said. 
The comfort women issue has been a regular cause for contention between Japan and neighbors China and North and South Korea since the war. Japan colonized the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 and occupied parts of China before and after the war.
""(The Moon government) has said it will seek a two-track policy by separately dealing with the comfort women issue and the relationship in the face of North Korea's threats, but Japan may not agree with that"", Lee Sung-hwan, a professor of Japanese studies in Keimyung University in South Korea, told Reuters.
Japan wants South Korea to remove statues near the Japanese embassy in Seoul and the Japanese consulate in Busan city commemorating Korean comfort women. Seoul says the memorials were erected by civic groups and therefore out of its reach. 
According to the investigation, however, the sides struck a separate, secret deal in which South Korea promised to persuade the groups to relocate the statues, provide no support for their overseas statue-raising campaign and refrain from calling the women ""sex slaves"" on the world stage. 
In 2014, the U.N. Human Rights Committee requested Tokyo to clarify the ""comfort women"" euphemism, with an independent expert on the panel calling for it to be replaced with ""enforced sex slaves"".
""Such an issue of universal value and historical awareness as that of comfort women cannot be resolved through short-term diplomatic negotiations and a political bargain,"" said Oh Tai-kyu, a former journalist who led the investigation. 
Andrew Horvat, a visiting professor at Josai International University in Japan, said that the pact was flawed from the beginning because it failed to produce real reconciliation. 

""The agreement was not reconciliation, but an agreement not to talk about it anymore"", Horvat said.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 06:10AM ET</span>",New York removes misleading nuclear fallout shelter signs,"By Jonathan Allen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City has quietly begun removing some of the corroding yellow nuclear fallout shelter signs that were appended to thousands of buildings in the 1960s, saying many are misleading Cold War relics that no longer denote functional shelters.
The small metal signs are a remnant of the anxieties over the nuclear arms race between the United States and the former Soviet Union, which prompted U.S. President John F. Kennedy to create the shelter program in 1961 in cities across the nation. The signs, with their simple design of three joined triangles inside a circle, became an emblem of the era.
While some New Yorkers may barely notice them today, to others they can be an uneasy reminder that the threat may have altered and diminished, but it has not vanished. Although the Cold War era has long ended, North Korea continues working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States amid bellicose rhetoric from Washington and Pyongyang.
A nuclear explosion is now seen as even less likely than during the Cold War. But should catastrophe ever strike, the signs, which still linger in their thousands, would be best ignored, city officials and disaster preparedness experts say. 
In the aftermath of a nearby nuclear explosion, any survivors counting on the signs to lead them to safety from radioactive fallout after needlessly dashing outside would likely find themselves rattling locked doors or perhaps breaking into what is now a building's laundry room or bike-storage area. Maintenance of the shelter system, which once entailed federal funding to stock shelters with food and water, ended decades ago. 
The removal of some of the signs from public school buildings, which has not previously been reported, is intended to partly reduce this potential confusion, according to the city's Department of Education.
Michael Aciman, a department spokesman, confirmed that any designated fallout shelters created in the city's schools are no longer active and said that the department is aiming to finish unscrewing the signs from school walls by roughly Jan. 1.
Although some of the tens of thousands of fallout shelter signs placed around the city by the federal government's Office of Civil Defense have vanished as old buildings have been renovated or demolished, city officials say this is the first coordinated effort to remove them. The Office of Civil Defense was eventually abolished in the 1970s, subsumed into the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Aciman declined to say whether, given the signs are technically federal property, the U.S. government was consulted.
But FEMA said it did not mind anyway. ""FEMA does not have a position regarding the signs,"" Jenny Burke, a FEMA spokeswoman, wrote in an email on Tuesday. Although the agency does not maintain lists of the old shelter locations, she added, ""as a part of an ongoing planning effort, the agency is conducting research to retrieve Office of Civilian Defense records."" 
The city's removal appeared somewhat haphazard: on one Brooklyn street, a sign on a school photographed by Reuters this month was subsequently removed, while a second school a few blocks away still had its sign attached, albeit with a screw missing.
As a history buff, Jeff Schlegelmilch is fond enough of the signs that he stuck a replica on his office door at Columbia University's National Center for Disaster Preparedness, where he is deputy director.
""I love seeing the signs, but, as a disaster planner, they have to come down,"" he said. ""At best, they are ignored, at worst, they're misleading and are going to cost people's lives.""
The consensus now, from the federal government downward, was that designated shelters were an outmoded concept, and updated contingency plans have been widely adopted since al Qaeda's attack on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, Schlegelmilch said. 
Were a nuclear explosion ever to happen, those far enough from the blast center to survive would do well to head to the lower interiors of any standard residential or commercial building, ideally a windowless basement, to shelter from radioactive particles outside, which can burn skin and cause serious illness and death.
Cars, on the other hand, ""are terrible,"" Schlegelmilch said: the particles sail right through a vehicle's thin exterior.
NYC Emergency Management, the agency that runs the city's disaster preparations, was not involved in the decision but staff there welcomed the signs' removal. Nancy Silvestri, the agency's press secretary, said even once the signs are gone from schools, many would remain on apartment buildings and other structures. City officials are uncertain who has jurisdiction over those, she said. 
Eliot Calhoun, the agency's Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives Planner, sees the signs as unhelpfully muddying the waters. 
He has spent years endlessly finessing a message, designed to flash as an alert on cellphones, that he hopes he will never have to send.
In the nerve center of the agency's Brooklyn headquarters, he called up onto a screen its current form: ""Nuclear explosion reported. Shelter in basement/center of building, close windows/doors.""

""Every single time I look at it I change it a little bit,"" he said. ""When you only have 90 characters and you're trying to save lives you can really think too much about it.""

Iraq and Syria have both declared victory over Islamic State in recent weeks, after a year that saw the two countries' armies, a range of foreign allies and various local forces drive the fighters out of all the towns and villages that once made up their self-proclaimed caliphate.
The United States has led an international coalition conducting air strikes against Islamic State since 2014 when the group swept across a third of Iraq. U.S. troops have served as advisers on the ground with Iraqi government forces and with Kurdish and Arab groups in Syria.
""Due to the commitment of the Coalition and the demonstrated competence of our partners in Iraq and Syria, there are estimated to be less than 1,000 ISIS terrorists in our combined joint area of operations, most of whom are being hunted down in the desert regions in eastern Syria and Western Iraq,"" the U.S.-led coalition told Reuters in an emailed statement.
ISIS is an acronym used for Islamic State.
The figure excludes areas in western Syria under the control of President Bashar al-Assad's government and his allies.
Assad's main ally Russia also said on Wednesday the main battle with Islamic State in Syria was over. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the key task in Syria was now destroying another Islamist group, the Nusra Front.
The U.S.-led coalition had said on Dec. 5 that there were less than 3,000 fighters remaining. Iraq declared ""final victory"" over the group on Dec. 9.
Most of the fighters had been killed or captured over the past three years, the coalition said on Wednesday. It would not respond to a question on whether some fighters could have escaped to other countries, saying it would not ""engage in public speculation"" but said it was working on preventing that.

""We can tell you that we are working with our partners to kill or capture all remaining ISIS terrorists, to destroy their network and prevent their resurgence, and also to prevent them from escaping to bordering countries,"" it said.

Since taking power five years ago, President Xi Jinping has overseen a sweeping modernization of the People's Liberation Army, the world's largest military, laying off troops, streamlining its organization and investing in advanced weapons.
In a brief report, the official Xinhua news agency said that from midnight on Jan. 1 the People's Armed Police would no longer fall under the purview of the State Council, or cabinet, and instead report to the Central Military Commission.
Xi heads the Central Military Commission in his role as armed forces chief and commander in chief. Xi has steadily consolidated his power over the military, and has appointed allies to key positions of power in the armed forces.
Xinhua did not provide any details on how the new reporting structure would work or why the government had made the decision. 
The People's Armed Police serves as a backup for the military in times of war, and domestically has a role in putting down protests and counter-terrorism as well as border defense and fire-fighting.
Xi has radically overhauled the old Soviet-era command structure of the military to make the armed forces nimbler and better able to respond to crises at home and abroad.
That has included condensing the command structure and giving greater emphasis on new capabilities including cyberspace, electronic and information warfare.
China's military has not fought a war in decades, but faces what the government calls a complex security environment, such as nuclear-armed North Korea and territorial disputes in the South China Sea and over self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by China as its own.

Merkel's conservatives won a national election in September, setting her up for a fourth stint in office.
But they bled support to the far right, and talks on a three-way coalition with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats collapsed in November.
Merkel is now pinning her hopes on cutting a deal with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), who finished second in the election but have so far given a lukewarm response to the idea of renewing the 'grand coalition' that governed Germany between 2013 and 2017.
The YouGov survey, commissioned by Germany's DPA agency and published in Wednesday's Die Welt newspaper, showed 47 percent of respondents wanted Merkel to step aside before 2021, when her fourth term would end - up from 36 percent in a poll taken at the beginning of October.
By contrast, 36 percent want her to serve a full four years, compared to 44 percent three months ago.
The SPD, which lost ground among voters after the coalition with Merkel, has been reluctant to commit to a re-run as it looks to keep a skeptical rank and file on board. 
SPD Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a former leader of the party, adopted a tough tone on Wednesday in top-selling daily Bild.
""If the chancellery continues to reject all the proposals for EU reform, there will be no coalition with the SPD,"" he told the paper.
The SPD's current leader, Martin Schulz, has championed deeper euro zone reform, calling for a United States of Europe by 2025.
Gabriel also said the conservatives needed to reform the health system to close the gap between private and state care.
An INSA poll in Bild put Merkel's conservatives up 2 points at 33 percent and the SPD down 0.5 percent at 20.5 percent.
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) which, capitalizing on voters' fears about growing inequality and the impact on Germany of Europe's migrant crisis, entered parliament for the first time in September, was down 1 point at 13 percent.
Many commentators have suggested the AfD would make gains if new elections were held due to a failure on Merkel's part to form a government.

Merkel's conservatives and the SPD have said they will start exploratory coalition talks on Jan. 7.

Patrice Nganang, a poet, professor and author who lives in New York, was arrested on Dec. 7 as he prepared to board a Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi and accused of insulting President Paul Biya. 
The government later said Nganang had threatened Biya in posts on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
His supporters said the accusations were politically motivated and related to a Dec. 5 piece he wrote for Paris-based Jeune Afrique, in which he criticized a government crackdown on Cameroon's English-speaking west. 
Since last year, the Francophone-dominated government has repressed peaceful protests by Anglophones against alleged social and economic marginalization. Dozens of civilians have been killed while the unrest has fueled support for separatists seeking an independent state. 
Some have begun to launch armed attacks on state forces, stoking a conflict which has become the most serious challenge to Biya's 35-year reign. Thousands of people have fled across the border into neighboring Nigeria. 
Nganang's lawyer, Emmanuel Simh, told Reuters that a judge dismissed the government's charges and ordered his client released, although he had yet to be freed.
Cameroon's linguistic divide harks back to the end of World War One, when the League of Nations divided the former German colony of Kamerun between the allied French and British victors, and has been a source of periodic tension. 
The past year's violence is the latest example of how Biya's rule has grown increasingly intolerant of dissent, with opposition activists, journalists and intellectuals routinely arrested and sometimes prosecuted.
A Cameroonian reporter for Radio France Internationale was released from prison last week after more than two years behind bars for contact with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, in a case that drew international condemnation.

The purge followed criticism of the ministry by Mirziyoyev last week over what he described as a poorly drafted state budget, failure to finance important projects in various provinces and embellishing economic data.
The ministry employs about 3,000 people in all.
According to the UzA report, the sacked officials were holdovers from ""a previous minister"", a clear reference to Rustam Azimov, former minister of finance and deputy prime minister sacked by Mirziyoyev in June. The report did not identify Azimov by name.
Mirziyoyev was elected president last December following the death in September 2016 of Islam Karimov, who had ruled the country since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
He has reshuffled the cabinet during his first year in power and implemented some economic reforms such as the liberalization of foreign exchange regulations.

Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto, 54, was found with more than 1 kg of methamphetamine in her backpack while in transit in Kuala Lumpur enroute to Melbourne from Shanghai in December 2014.
Under Malaysian law, anyone found guilty of possessing more than 50 grams of illegal drugs is considered a trafficker and faces a mandatory death penalty. 
The law was amended last month to do away with the mandatory death sentence, allowing judges to use their own discretion. But the changes have not yet come into effect.
Exposto's lawyers said she was the victim of an internet romance scam and was lured into carrying a bag containing drugs unknowingly by a friend of her online boyfriend, who claimed to be a U.S. soldier serving in Afghanistan. 
""I agreed with the defense's argument that the accused had no knowledge of the drugs that were in her bag,"" Judge Ghazali Cha said on Wednesday. 
Exposto's conduct during her arrest showed ""she was naive and her behavior was that of an innocent person,"" he said. 
The judge referred Exposto to Malaysia's immigration department for deportation. 
""I'm happy now that I'm free,"" Exposto said in brief comments to reporters. 

Three Australian nationals have been executed by Malaysia for drug trafficking: Kevin Barlow and Brian Chambers in 1986, and Michael McAuliffe in 1993.

Judge Ohn Myint granted the 14-day extension in the case of the journalists, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, at the request of the police, who then took them to Yangon's Insein prison. They were previously being held in a police compound.
When they appeared at the Mingaladon court for the proceedings, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were allowed to meet their families and their lawyer for the first time since their arrest.
The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where - according to United Nations' estimates - about 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.
They were detained on Dec 12 after they had been invited to meet police officials over dinner. The Ministry of Information has said they “illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media” and faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
The two journalists said they had not been mistreated in custody. 
""The situation is okay,"" Wa Lone said after the hearing.
""We will face it the best we can because we have never done anything wrong,"" he said. ""We have never violated the media law nor ethics. We will continue to do our best.""
A Reuters spokesperson said they should be freed.
""These two journalists are being held for simply doing their jobs and have done nothing wrong. It is time for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo to be released,"" the spokesperson said.
Government officials from some of the world's major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have previously called for their release.
FAMILIES TRAVEL TO PRISON
Dozens of reporters and cameramen were outside the courthouse in a northern district of Yangon for the appearance of the two journalists. They were brought in a white van, rather than a police truck, dressed in casual clothes and were not handcuffed. 
Their lawyer, Than Zaw Aung, who has been retained by Reuters, also said the two had only been doing their job as journalists.
""They are being accused under this charge while doing their work as media,"" he told reporters.
Lieutenant Colonel Myint Htwe, a senior staff officer from the Yangon Police Division, said: ""We took action because they committed the crime. It needs to be solved in court.""
Only their lawyer and the families of the two journalists, along with police and government lawyers, were allowed into the courtroom. The families were later allowed to travel in the van as the two journalists were taken to prison.
""I believe that he didn’t commit any crime,"" Pan Ei Mon, Wa Lone's wife, told Reuters. ""I would like to request the government to consider releasing them.""
Nyo Nyo Aye, a sister of Kyaw Soe Oo, said her brother told her he had not committed any offense. ""I believe that he can come home soon,"" she said.

General Valery Gerasimov's allegations, made in a newspaper interview, center on a U.S. military base at Tanf, a strategic Syrian highway border crossing with Iraq in the south of the country.
Russia says the U.S. base is illegal and that it and the area around it have become ""a black hole"" where militants operate unhindered.
Islamic State has this year lost almost all the territory it held in Syria and Iraq. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday the main part of the battle with Islamic State in Syria was over, according to the state-run RIA news agency.
The United States says the Tanf facility is a temporary base used to train partner forces to fight Islamic State. It has rejected similar Russian allegations in the past, saying Washington remains committed to killing off Islamic State and denying it safe havens.
But Gerasimov told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper on Wednesday that the United States was training up fighters who were former Islamic State militants but who now call themselves the New Syrian Army or use other names.
He said Russia satellites and drones had spotted militant brigades at the U.S. base.
""They are in reality being trained there,"" Gerasimov said, saying there were also a large number of militants and former Islamic State fighters at Shadadi, where he said there was also a U.S. base.
""They are practically Islamic State,"" he said. ""But after they are worked with, they change their spots and take on another name. Their task is to destabilize the situation."" 

Russia has partially withdrawn from Syria, but Gerasimov said the fact that Moscow was keeping an air base and naval facility there meant it was well placed to deal with pockets of instability if and when they arose.

715,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 03:50AM ET</span>",China says part of Hong Kong rail station to be subject to mainland laws,"By Christian Shepherd and Venus Wu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's parliament on Wednesday said part of a Hong Kong high-speed railway station being built in the city center would be regarded as Chinese territory, an unprecedented move that critics say further erodes the financial hub's autonomy.
Hong Kong reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, when it was granted a high degree of autonomy under a ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, giving it a separate police force, immigration controls, an independent judiciary and freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China.
Following a meeting of the standing committee of China's largely rubber stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, delegates voted to approve the plan to allow the enforcement of mainland Chinese laws within part of the station that will link up with the rest of China's high-speed rail network. 
""It is appropriate ... that the Mainland Port Area within the West Kowloon station would be regarded as belonging to mainland China,"" according to the legislative document released by parliament on the decision. 
Critics say the ""co-location"" arrangement, also known as ""one land, two checks"" in Chinese, sets a dangerous precedent as it violates the city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, in which article 18 explicitly states national laws, with a few exceptions, do not apply in Hong Kong.
But the document passed by parliament says since mainland officials' operations will be strictly confined to specific areas in the station, it is ""different from"" the article which governs the whole of Hong Kong.
""Setting up a Mainland Port Area inside the West Kowloon station does not change the administrative area of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, does not affect the HKSAR's right to a high degree of autonomy accorded by the law, does not reduce or harm (Hong Kong) residents' rights and freedoms accorded by the law,"" the document added.
Hong Kong's legislature will have to enact local laws to implement the plan, but the process is expected to proceed without strong resistance after a series of controversial court cases stripped the opposition pro-democracy camp of its veto power.
The prospect of Beijing tightening its grip on the financial hub has already stoked social tensions and protests including the 2014 ""Occupy"" street demonstrations that demanded, in vain, full democracy for the city of 7.3 million.
The abductions by Chinese agents of several Hong Kong-based booksellers in 2015 who later showed up across the border in Chinese custody also touched a raw nerve.

At a cost of more than HK$84 billion ($11 billion), the high speed Express Rail Link will roughly halve the journey time between Hong Kong and the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou to 48 minutes, according to the Hong Kong government.

Turkey will pay 45 percent of the cost up front with Russia providing loans to cover the remaining 55 percent, Chemezov said. Moscow expected to begin the first deliveries in March 2020, he said.
The deal has caused concern in the West because Turkey is a member of NATO but the Russian missile system cannot be integrated into NATO's military architecture. Relations between Moscow and the Western military alliance are fraught.
Chemezov told Kommersant that Turkey was the first NATO member state to acquire the advanced S-400 missile system.

He said the Russian and Turkish finance ministries had already completed talks on financing the deal and that the final documents just needed to be approved.

Wu Gan, a blogger better known by his online name ""Super Vulgar Butcher"", regularly championed sensitive cases of government abuses of power, both online and in street protests. He was detained in May 2015 and charged with subversion.
In a separate case, also on Tuesday, rights lawyer Xie Yang avoided criminal punishment despite being found guilty of inciting subversion, because he admitted his crimes.
""We call on the Chinese authorities to release Wu immediately,"" the U.S. and Germany embassies in China said in a joint statement.
""As Xie has been exempted from punishment, we urge China to allow Xie to resume his professional activities without preconditions and be free of any restrictions.""
China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Beijing frequently denounces foreign concern about rights cases as an interference in China's internal affairs and says China is a country with rule of law.
Wu's sentence was the most severe in what rights groups have called an unprecedented attack on China's rights activists and lawyers, known as the 709 crackdown, which began in full force on July 9, 2015.

Miftah Ismail has been made an adviser to the prime minister for finance, with the status of a federal minister, the government said in a notification.
""Although I will have stewardship of the Ministry of Finance for only 5 months, the prime minister has tasked me to help him implement a very ambitious agenda,” Ismail said in a post on Twitter.
He was referring to general election due next year and widely expected in May, though no date has been fixed.
The former fiance minister, Ishaq Dar, was relieved of his portfolio on Nov. 22 amid mounting headwinds for the $300 billion economy battling to stave off balance of payments pressures due to dwindling foreign currency reserves and a widening current account deficit.
Dar, who was widely credited with navigating Pakistan out of a 2013 balance of payments crisis, is facing corruption charges in connection with accusations he amassed wealth beyond his known sources of income.
Dar has denied all charges. He is receiving treatment in London for a heart condition.
Ismail is a member of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's political party, which is still the ruling party even though Sharif was ousted amid corruption allegations in July. 
Sharif has also denied any wrongdoing.
The party has been reluctant to allow the rupee to weaken ahead of elections as it may stoke inflation, though many investors and economists say a weaker rupee is needed to shore up lagging exports.
Samiullah Tariq, director of research at Arif Habib Limited, said he expected Ismail would let the rupee soften if he though it necessary.
""Basically, he's pro-business, if he feels that a stronger rupee is hindering exports, he will let it weaken,"" Tariq told Reuters.
""He has plans to introduce tax reforms, rationalize tax rates, create a scheme to release refunds and initiate a scheme to bring back and declare foreign assets owned by Pakistanis,” Tariq added.

It said the police had arrest warrants for a total of 171 academics and staff from Istanbul's former Fatih University, which was regarded as having close ties to Gulen. The cleric has denied any involvement in the failed putsch of July 15, 2016.
Fatih University was shut under a state decree following the coup attempt and Anadolu said staff there were found to have been users of ByLock, an encrypted messaging application which the government says was commonly used by Gulen's supporters.
Since the coup attempt more than 50,000 people, including civil servants and security personnel, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs.

Western Japan's Osaka Prefectural Police Department said Airi Kakimoto's body was found in a state of extreme malnutrition after her parents reported the death on Saturday. She was 145 cm (4.76 ft) tall and weighed just 19 kg (42 lb).
Police said Yasutaka Kakimoto, 55, and Yukari Kakimoto, 53, had confessed that they fed their daughter only once a day and kept her in a 3-square-metre room for some 15 years.
""Our daughter was mentally ill and, from age 16 or 17, she became violent, so we kept her inside the room,"" police quoted her parents as saying.
People with mental and physical disabilities and their families can still suffer stigma and shame in Japan despite some changes in public attitudes.
Police said the parents added the small room - fitted with a camera and a double door that could only be unlocked from the outside - to their house and equipped it with a makeshift toilet and tube to a water tank outside.
About 10 surveillance cameras were installed outside the single-storey home, which was surrounded by a 2-metre high fence, police said.
The parents found their daughter dead on Dec. 18 but they reported the death Saturday. ""We wanted to be together with our daughter,"" police quoted them as saying.
Police said the couple were arrested on suspicion of illegally disposing of a body, a step that often precedes more serious charges.

Fighting deeply ingrained graft has been a key policy plank for President Xi Jinping in his first term in office, and that battle will take on a new hue with the setting up of the National Supervision Commission as he begins his second term.
Trial work has already begun for that commission, which is likely to be formally codified in law in March at the meeting of China's largely rubber stamp parliament.
The new body will take over from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and merge multiple anti-graft units into a single body. It will also expand the graft campaign's purview to include employees at state-backed institutions rather than just party members.
In a short report, Xinhua news agency said the party's politburo, one of its elite ruling bodies, had met and decided to hold two important meetings next month - one on amending the state constitution and the other specifically on fighting corruption.
Xinhua gave no details of what the constitutional amendment might entail, but Chinese legal scholars have said the country needs to amend its constitution before it can set up the new supervision commission to ensure there is a proper constitutional basis for its powers.
The constitution clearly defines China's top political institutions, such as the judiciary and the prosecutor, in order to grant them state power and changes need to be made to these definitions to make room for a similarly powerful supervision system, scholars argue.
The party will discuss the amendment, or amendments, at a plenum next month, Xinhua said without giving an exact date or saying whether it was one amendment or more.
The constitution, which is different from the party constitution, was last amended in 2004 to include guarantees to protect private property and human rights.
The other meeting, a full session of the anti-corruption watchdog the CCDI, will be held from Jan. 11-13, the report added, again without giving details.
Xi has vowed that his war against graft will not ease until officials at all levels dare not, cannot and do not want to be corrupt.
Xi told top party leaders in October revision of the anti-graft architecture would include the scrapping of a controversial ""shuanggui"" system of secret interrogations, and the introduction of a new detention system.

The latest draft of the new Supervision Law, unveiled last week, adds protections for graft suspects as part of efforts to revise the interrogation system.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen vowed to extend his more than 30 years in power by at least another decade on Wednesday, weeks after the highest court dissolved the main opposition party ahead of a 2018 general election.
The Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved in November at the request of Hun Sen's government, signaling what one rights group called the ""death knell"" for democracy in the Southeast Asian country.
Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge cadre who defected from the genocidal group and helped drive it from power in 1979, is credited with helping Cambodia achieve economic growth but has also been criticized for his crackdown on civil society groups and the media.
China, Cambodia's biggest backer, has said it supports the government's attempts to maintain Cambodia's national security.
At a speech given to thousands of garment workers on Wednesday at a pagoda on the outskirts of Phnom Penh, Hun Sen said he would stay in power for another two terms and asked workers to vote for his Cambodian People's Party (CPP).
""I will continue to be the elected Prime Minister for another two mandates which is not less than 10 years,"" Hun Sen said. 
""I hope that you as well as your parents and grandparents, if they are alive, and your families continue to vote, to support CPP on July 29, 2018.""
Garments are Cambodia's biggest export by far and garment workers are a politically powerful group. In 2016, garment exports were worth $6.3 billion and reached $4.9 billion in the first seven months of 2017.
Hun Sen has been courting garment workers ahead of the vote. He has promised money for female workers who give birth, among other things.
""You have to remember that if you want to keep jobs ... you should not give opportunity to anyone, including Cambodians and foreigners, to destroy peace,"" Hun Sen said.

Concerns about the impact of next year's election and competition from lower-cost Asian rivals will slow the growth of Cambodia's garment industry next year, the main manufacturers' group said earlier this month.

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian authorities said on Tuesday a former prime minister and top official have been banned from leaving the country as prosecutors lead a corruption probe in which 12 people, including government officials, have been arrested. 
Former Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, who served from 2009 to 2011, and former justice minister Camille Edouard Jr., who served in 2016, cannot travel abroad while an investigation proceeds into corruption-related charges, Haiti's prosecutor Clame-Ocnam Dameus said. 
Bellerive, who was premier during a catastrophic earthquake, was ordered to remain within Haiti by a judge who is investigating the 2009 disappearance of a public procurement official and the 2012 death of a construction manager allegedly connected to the case. 
Bellerive denied any connection to either incident, or to other acts of corruption. 
""I believe all this is part of a political lynching,"" he told Reuters. ""No one can show me where I've enriched myself or acquired unjustified properties.""
Corruption has plagued Haiti for generations and President Jovenel Moise has pledged to fight it as a way to improve the impoverished Caribbean country's social and economic development.
Dameus said Edouard could potentially face charges of money laundering as well as misappropriation of public funds and properties. 
Edouard did not respond to a request for comment. 
The dozen others arrested between November and December, a group comprised mostly of government officials, face corruption charges that include the misappropriation of public funds, Dameus said.

China considers democratic Taiwan to be its sacred territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring what it views as a wayward province under Chinese control.
It has taken an increasingly hostile stance toward Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen, from the island's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year and has stepped up its rhetoric and military exercises.
Beijing suspects her of pushing for the island's formal independence, a red line for China. Tsai says she wants peace with China, but also that she will defend Taiwan's security and way of life.
Chinese state media has given broad coverage to ""island encirclement"" exercises near Taiwan this month, including showing pictures of Chinese bomber aircraft with what they said was Taiwan's highest peak, Yushan, visible in the background.
Asked about the continuing drills and the footage released by the air force, China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office said it and the defense ministry had repeatedly described the exercises as routine.
""Everyone will slowly get used it,"" spokesman An Fengshan told a routine news briefing, without elaborating. 
China's air force has carried out 16 rounds of exercises close to Taiwan in the past year or so, Taiwan's defense ministry said in a white paper this week. China's military threat was growing by the day, it warned.
Proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China, and Taiwan's government has accused Beijing of not understanding democracy when it criticizes Taipei.
Taiwan Premier William Lai told a year-end news conference in Taipei that the United States, Japan and South Korea were all paying close attention to the activities of China's air force.
Lai said his government would take its lead from the president, who was in charge of relations across the Taiwan Strait.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Medical evacuations have begun from the Syrian rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta to Damascus, the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria said early on Wednesday. 
Almost 400,000 people in Eastern Ghouta are besieged by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, and the United Nations has pleaded for his government to allow evacuation of around 500 patients, including children with cancer.
The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) said four patients were taken to hospitals in Damascus, the first of 29 critical cases approved for medical evacuation, and the remainder would be evacuated over the coming days. 
SAMS advocacy manager Mohamad Katoub said in a tweet that five had been approved for the first group of evacuations, part of a deal on an exchange of detainees between Assad's government and rebel group Jaish al-Islam. It was not clear why only four of the five had left.
The Syrian Red Crescent said the evacuations were the result of ""long negotiations"". An ICRC spokeswoman declined to give more details, citing the sensitivity of the operation.
On Sunday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was working with Russia, Assad's ally, on the evacuations.
Last week Jan Egeland, the United Nations humanitarian adviser for Syria, said 494 people were on the priority list for medical evacuations.
""That number is going down, not because we are evacuating people but because they are dying,"" he said. ""We have tried now every single week for many months to get medical evacuations out, and food and other supplies in.""
The United Nations has been waiting for months for the Syrian authorities to provide ""facilitation letters"" to allow the aid operation to get under way.
Forces loyal to Assad have carried out air raids on Eastern Ghouta, while besieged rebels have fired mortars into neighboring Damascus. 
""That has nothing to do with the right of evacuating, and obligation to evacuate civilians (and) wounded,"" Egeland said.

727,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2017 07:30PM ET</span>",Romanian ruling lawmakers propose looser anti-graft rules,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's ruling Social Democrats have filed a slew of new changes to the criminal code that would decriminalize several graft offences, including some abuse of office crimes, their second attempt this year to weaken a crackdown on corruption.
Transparency International ranks Romania as one of the European Union's most corrupt states and Brussels keeps its justice system under special monitoring, although it has praised magistrates for their efforts to root out high-level graft.
A draft bill released on Tuesday showed a group of Social Democrat lawmakers are proposing that abuse of office offences that cause financial damage of less than 200,000 euros ($237,100) should no longer be punishable.
Other changes include serving prison sentences of less than three years at home, lower sentences for bribe taking and other graft crimes, as well as decriminalizing taking a bribe for someone other than the accused. Another proposal would make using one's position to obtain sexual favors no longer a crime. 
If approved, the changes would put an end to an ongoing trial of Social Democrat Party leader and lower house speaker Liviu Dragnea, who is accused of abuse of office. 
Dozens of lawmakers and mayors across all parties stand to benefit from the changes. Romania's anti-corruption prosecution unit has sent 72 members of parliament to trial since 2006. 
A similar attempt to decriminalize some abuse of office crimes triggered the country's largest street protests in decades at the start of 2017. The ruling coalition backed down at the time but has revived the proposals.
Earlier this month, the ruling coalition has used its overwhelming parliament majority to approve a judicial overhaul that puts magistrates under political control.
They have also filed a different set of proposals to change the criminal code that could derail law and order.
Thousands of magistrates, centrist President Klaus Iohannis, the European Commission, the U.S. State Department and seven EU states have all criticized both the approved bills and the criminal code proposals.
The Social Democrats and their junior coalition partner ALDE have denied the changes would affect the independence of the judiciary and have stressed that parliament has the right to legislate however it sees fit.
The proposed changes place Romania alongside its eastern European peers Hungary and Poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, in defying EU concerns over the rule of law.

In a 656-page ruling, judge Julian Ercolini said there was sufficient proof to conclude that the shot to the head that killed Nisman in January 2015 was not self-inflicted. That marked the first time any judge has said the case was a murder.
Fernandez and others had suggested the death was a suicide, but a prosecutor investigating the case last year recommended it be pursued as a murder probe.
""Nisman's death could not have been a suicide,"" Ercolini wrote in Tuesday's ruling, which also charged Diego Lagomarsino, a former employee of Nisman's, with accessory to murder.
Lagomarsino has acknowledged lending Nisman the gun that killed him the day before he was to appear before Congress to detail his allegation against Fernandez. But he has said Nisman asked him for the gun to protect himself and his family.
Fernandez, now a senator, was indicted for treason earlier this month over Nisman's allegations that she worked behind the scenes to clear Iran of blame for the attack on the AMIA Jewish center, which killed 85 people, in an effort to normalize relations and clinch a 2013 grains-for-oil deal with Tehran.

Human rights groups and the former head of Interpol have criticized that indictment. Tehran has denied links to the attack.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian rebels pinned down in a strategic area where the Israeli and Lebanese borders meet with Syria were handed an ultimatum by the Syrian army and its Iranian-backed militia allies to either surrender or face certain military defeat, rebels said on Tuesday.
The Syrian army backed by local militias financed and equipped by Iran alongside Druze fighters from the area have been escalating a fierce assault against Sunni rebels in an enclave in the foothills of Mount Hermon, close to both the Israeli and Lebanese borders.
""They were given 72 hours to surrender with fighters to go to Idlib or those who want to stay have to reach a settlement,"" said Ibrahim al-Jebawi, a Free Syrian Army (FSA) official familiar with the situation on the ground.
Another rebel official who asked not to be named said they were told either to ""surrender or a military solution.""
The rebels have now been left encircled in Beit Jin, their main stronghold after losing strategic hills and farms around it this week after over two months of near daily shelling and aerial strikes.
Iran-backed Lebanon's Hezbollah's media unit said insurgents had agreed to negotiate surrender terms and said negotiations had already begun over their evacuation in the next few days to rebel-held Idlib.
The Syrian army has used similar tactics of pushing opponents to rebel areas further from the Syrian capital after a twin tactic of siege and months of strikes on residential areas.
There were also more than 8,000 civilians who have been trapped in the remaining enclaves with their plight worsening, according to rebel spokesman Sohaib Alraheel.
Israel, which Syria accuses of helping the rebels, is alarmed at the growing Iranian military influence in the Golan Heights and has stepped up its strikes against pro-Iranian targets inside Syria.
Israel has been lobbying both big powers to deny Iran, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and other Shi‘ite militias any permanent bases in Syria, and to keep them away from the Golan, as they gain ground while helping Damascus beat back Sunni-led rebels.
Early this month there was an Israeli strike on a base near Kiswah, south of Damascus, that was widely believed to be an Iranian military compound, a Western intelligence source said.
Hezbollah's bastion in southern Lebanon is only a few kms from the rebel enclave, and securing a supply line from its stronghold into Syria's Quneitra province was a major strategic gain, rebels and defense analysts say.
""Now Hezbollah will have a bigger foothold on the Syrian side of the Golan and it is desperate to link this area with southern Lebanon,"" al-Jebawi added.
Israel had warned Hezbollah against trying to open a front in the Golan Heights and was believed to be behind the killing a prominent commander in an air strike in 2015 whom the group later admitted had overseen a local Hezbollah presence in the area.
""This is an effort by Iran and its proxy Hezbollah to expand the lines of engagement with Israel. The question is will Israel allow that?"" said Fayez al Dweiri, a retired Jordanian general who follows Syria closely.

With less than three weeks until the Pope's arrival, Chilean authorities said they were working with the Roman Catholic Church to prepare for an onslaught of tourists at the peak of the austral summer, a traditional time for vacationing in both countries.
""We are going to see a record number of (foreign) visitors,"" Reginaldo Flores, the head of the interior ministry's border crossings unit, told reporters.
Starting in Chile on Jan. 15, the Argentine pontiff will go to the cities of Santiago, Temuco and Iquique, before heading to Peru, where he will stop in Lima, Puerto Maldonado and Trujillo.
A planned mass in the Chilean capital of Santiago is expected to attract more than 500,000 people. Thousands of police officers will be present, officials said.
Since his election to lead the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics in 2013, Francis, the first Latin American pope, has visited Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Cuba and Mexico, but has not made a pastoral trip to Argentina.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan families displaced from a town ransacked after the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 will be allowed to return home in February, the U.N.-backed government said on Tuesday after more than a year of negotiations.
The deal, if implemented, would be a step toward reconciliation in the North African oil producing country, which is heavily divided between competing factions, communities, tribes and governments since 2011.
Residents of the town of Tawergha were expelled by former anti-Gaddafi rebels in 2011 in retaliation for the strongman having used their settlement as a launch pad for attacks on the western city of Misrata during the uprising. 
They have been living in camps and makeshift settlements in poverty across Libya and were banned from returning home. They faced abuse and arbitrary arrest since videos surfaced purportedly showing some of them joining Gaddafi forces in 2011.
""Within the frame of achieving the national reconciliation ... as well as to develop the basics of state of law and institutions, I declare today the beginning of return of Tawergha families to their town on the first of February,"" the Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez Seraj said in a statement.
The town, which is east of Misrata, has been a ghost town since it was looted by Misrata forces in 2011. Some 40,000 people were displaced, according to Human Rights Watch's website.
The government will pay compensation to the relatives of those who were killed and to those who had been detained, wounded or whose homes were destroyed in the conflict, it said.

A spokesman for the Misrata city council confirmed the deal, saying it was up to the government to implement it.

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court in Washington on Tuesday upheld a lower court's decision to allow President Donald Trump's commission investigating voter fraud to request data on voter rolls from U.S. states.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) watchdog group, which filed the lawsuit, did not have legal standing to seek to force the presidential commission to review privacy concerns before collecting individuals' voter data.
EPIC had argued that under federal law, the commission was required to conduct a privacy-impact assessment before gathering personal data. But the three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously that the privacy law at issue was intended to protect individuals, not groups like EPIC.
""EPIC is not a voter,"" Judge Karen Henderson wrote in the ruling. 
Washington-based U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly first denied EPIC's injunction request in July, in part because the collection of data by the commission was not technically an action by a government agency so was not bound by laws that govern what such entities can do. 
Kollar-Kotelly noted that the commission, headed by Vice President Mike Pence, was an advisory body that lacks legal authority to compel states to hand over the data.
Most state officials who oversee elections and election law experts say that voter fraud is rare in the United States.
Trump, a Republican, set up the commission in May after charging, without evidence, that millions of people voted unlawfully in the 2016 presidential election in which he defeated Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton despite losing the popular vote. 
The commission's vice chair, Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state for Kansas and an advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification, asked states in June to turn over voter information.
The data requested by Kobach included names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories. 
More than 20 states refused outright and others said they needed to study whether they could provide the data.
Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have said the commission's eventual findings could lead to new ID requirements and other measures making it harder for groups that tend to favor Democratic candidates to cast ballots.

EPIC executive director Marc Rotenberg could not immediately be reached for comment.

PUERTO ORDAZ, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities said on Tuesday they had arrested 28 people in southern Bolivar state for looting and disorder over Christmas in the latest unrest during a severe economic crisis.
There have been scattered protests and roadblocks around the South American OPEC nation in recent days over food shortages, power-cuts, high prices and fuel rationing. 
Local chamber of commerce head Florenzo Schettino told Reuters 10 businesses - mostly liquor stores - were looted as dark fell on Christmas Day in Bolivar, which has seen unrest at various points over the last four years of brutal recession. 
In the western Andean states, police and soldiers were guarding gas stations, where there were large lines and customers were only allowed to fill up 35 liters per vehicle.
""We're wasting so much time ... The government is testing people's patience,"" said bus driver Pedro Pina, waiting for hours to buy fuel in Barinas state.
Critics blame President Nicolas Maduro and the ruling Socialist Party for Venezuela's economic mess, saying they have persisted with failed statist policies for too long, while turning a blind eye to rampant corruption and inefficiency.
The government says it is the victim of an ""economic war"" by political opponents and right-wing foreign powers, intent on bringing down Maduro in a coup. 
""This can only be reversed with deep economic reforms,"" said opposition legislator and economist Angel Alvarado.
In western Zulia state, several hundred thousand people were plunged into darkness on Christmas Eve, sparking fury among those who had scraped together money and hunted for products throughout the day to prepare a traditional family dinner.

LIMA (Reuters) - Former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori sought forgiveness from Peruvians ""from the bottom of my heart"" on Tuesday for shortcomings during his rule, and thanked President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski for granting him a Christmas pardon.
In a video on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Fujimori, 79, vowed that as a free man, he would support Kuczynski's call for reconciliation, hinting that he would not return to politics.
""I'm aware the results of my government were well received by some, but I acknowledge I also disappointed other compatriots,"" the ailing Fujimori said, reading from notes while connected to tubes in a hospital bed. ""And to them, I ask for forgiveness from the bottom of my heart."" 
The remarks were Fujimori's first explicit apology to the Andean nation that he governed with an iron fist from 1990-2000.
They came after two days of unrest as protesters slammed the pardon as an insult to victims and part of a political deal to help Kuczynski survive a scandal.
The pardon cleared Fujimori's convictions for graft and human rights crimes during his leadership of the rightwing government.
Late on Monday, Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, appealed to Peruvians opposed to the pardon to ""turn the page"" and defended his decision as justified clemency for a sick man whose government helped the country progress.

""I cannot keep from expressing my profound gratitude for the complex step that the president took, which commits me in this new stage of my life to decidedly support his call for reconciliation,"" Fujimori said.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Egypt said on Tuesday it had suggested to Ethiopia and Sudan that they all call in international experts to help settle a dispute on an Ethiopian dam project on the river Nile.
Egypt fears the hydroelectric scheme will restrict the waters flowing down from Ethiopia's highlands, through the deserts of Sudan to its fields and reservoirs. Ethiopia, which wants to become Africa's biggest power exporter, says it will have no such impact.
Ministers from Ethiopia and Egypt met on Tuesday to try to resolve a disagreement over the wording of a report on the environmental impact of the $4-billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is still being built. 
But Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said they had not managed to reach a breakthrough since the three nations last met in November.
""From a practical perspective, we have to recognize that technical deliberations ... have not (yielded) sufficient results to enable the process to move forward,"" Shoukry told journalists after the meeting in Addis Ababa.
He suggested the countries call in outside experts, without going into details. Officials who took part in the sessions said Egypt had suggested involving an international body such as the World Bank.
Ethiopia's foreign minister, Workneh Gebeyehu, told the same press conference he was looking for a win-win situation, but did not comment on the Egyptian proposal.
Countries that share the river have argued over the use of its waters for decades - and analysts have repeatedly warned that the disputes could eventually boil over into conflict.
Sudan and Ethiopia say Egypt has refused to accept amendments that they had put forward to the environmental report.
Another source of disagreement is whether Ethiopia should be allowed to complete construction of the dam before the negotiations over ensuring water flows have finished.

Egyptian officials say this would violate an agreement signed by all three countries in 2015 meant to ensure diplomatic cooperation.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Hundreds of Russian celebrities, sportspeople and politicians nominated President Vladimir Putin for re-election on Tuesday, hours after the Kremlin said it wanted opposition leader Alexei Navalny investigated for calling for a boycott of the vote. 
Navalny called for the boycott of the March 18 election on Monday after Russia's central election commission ruled he was not eligible to run for president due to a suspended prison sentence hanging over him.
The 41-year-old lawyer, who says he's being excluded on false grounds because the Kremlin is running scared, said he would use his campaign headquarters across the country to call the election's legitimacy into question and organize protests. 
The Kremlin, which points to polls that show Putin is the runaway favorite with Navalny trailing far behind, on Tuesday set the scene for possible police action against Navalny and his supporters whose protests have been broken up before. 
""The calls for a boycott will require scrupulous study, to see whether or not they comply with the law,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.
Declining to comment on the election commission's decision to bar Navalny, Peskov shrugged off allegations that the presidential poll would be a farce without the opposition leader who has made a name for himself by leveraging social media and conducting corruption investigations into senior officials.
""The fact that one of the would-be candidates is not taking part has no bearing on the election's legitimacy,"" said Peskov.
Hours later, Putin, 65, was feted by his supporters, almost 700 of whom pledged to back him for re-election -- above the minimum 500 required to initiate a presidential bid.
Putin's own schedule was too busy for him to attend the Moscow nomination event, the Kremlin said, though he is expected to personally submit the necessary paperwork to the central election commission in the coming days.
FATHER OF THE NATION
The former KGB officer is running as an independent, a move seen as a way of strengthening his image as a ""father of the nation"" rather than as a party political figure.
The ruling United Russia party and the Just Russia party have both said they will support him.
""I have worked under the leadership of the president for quite a long time so I know that everything will be alright for us with President Putin,"" Sergei Kislyak, Russia's former ambassador to the United States, now a senator, told Reuters at Tuesday's nomination meeting.
The commander of a nuclear submarine, Sergei Novokhatsky, told the same meeting that Putin had helped revive the Russian Navy, which he described as mired in apathy at the end of the 1990s with many of its ships stuck in ports.
Now, he said, wages were up and Russian ships served throughout the world.
""The course the motherland is on is the right one,"" Novokhatsky told the meeting.
If, as expected, he wins re-election, Putin, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for the last 17 years, will be eligible to serve another six years until 2024, when he turns 72.
Allies laud him for restoring national pride and expanding Moscow's global clout with interventions in Syria and Ukraine.
But Navalny, the opposition leader, says Putin's support is exaggerated and artificially maintained by a biased state media and an unfair system which excludes genuine opponents. 
Navalny, who says he could defeat Putin in a fair election, has been jailed three times this year and charged with breaking the law for organizing public meetings and rallies designed to bolster his presidential campaign.
He has said millions of voters will be disenfranchised unless the authorities relent and allow him to run. 
The European Union has also questioned the decision to bar Navalny.
""(It) casts a serious doubt on political pluralism in Russia and the prospect of democratic elections next year,"" the EU's External Action Service said in a statement on Tuesday.

""Politically motivated charges should not be used against political participation,"" it said, urging Moscow to ensure a ""level playing field"" for all Russian elections.

MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia went to the polls on Tuesday for a presidential election that voters hope will mark the country's first democratic transfer of power in over seven decades, despite it being tarnished by allegations of fraud.
Former world footballer of the year George Weah is squaring up against vice president Joseph Boakai, with both men promising a break with a heritage of poverty and corruption in a country where most citizens have no reliable electricity or clean drinking water.
They are bidding to succeed Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in a run-off vote delayed for over a month after Boakai and third-placed Charles Brumskine of the Liberty Party alleged widespread fraud in October's first-round vote, a challenge that the Supreme Court rejected this month.
There were no early reports of violence as voting proceeded under sunny skies in the capital Monrovia, with polling stations opening at 0800 GMT and election agents telling Reuters first indications pointed to a lower turnout than in the first round.
""It is great day for Liberia - a test day for democracy,"" said Boakai after casting his vote in Paynesville. ""We will accept the results provided they meet all the standards.""
Johnson Sirleaf's 12-year rule cemented peace in the West African country after civil war ended in 2003, and brought in much needed aid.
But critics, including much of the country's youth, say her administration was marred by corruption and that she did little to raise most Liberians out of dire poverty. 
Liberia was also racked by the Ebola crisis, which killed thousands in the country between 2014 and 2016, while a drop in iron ore prices since 2014 has dented export revenues. 
Tuesday's poll follows a month of political tensions fueled by claims that the first-round poll was rigged in Weah's favor.
Weah, world footballer of the year in 1995, won with 38 percent versus Boakai's 29 percent. 
""I voted George Weah because I believe that he will do better for me and my country. I want change,"" said Miama Kamara, a 32-year-old businesswoman, before casting her ballot in the capital. 
Boakai's ruling Unity Party had accused Johnson Sirleaf, who is herself a member of the party, of interfering in the October vote by holding private meetings with election magistrates.
Boakai has found it harder to convince voters that he will bring change, given that he worked alongside Johnson Sirleaf for 12 years. Weah, by contrast, has won the hearts of mostly young Liberians through his star performances for Europe's biggest football teams in the 1990s. 
His arrival at a polling station in Paynesville was met with cheers by a crowd of supporters. 
""My focus now is to win,"" he told reporters. ""From there, I am going to get on the drawing board with my team and then we'll put a plan together to move our country forward."" 
Some however are wary of Weah's lack of political experience, education and concrete policy.

""Boakai understands diplomacy,"" said McArthur Nuah Kermah, a school registrar in Paynesville. ""Weah is not experienced and doesn't know the workings of government.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India denounced Pakistan on Tuesday for its handling of the visit of the wife and mother of an Indian man on death row, saying they were harassed and prevented from talking to the prisoner freely.
A spokesman for Pakistan's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on the issue.
Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav, a former officer in the Indian navy, was arrested in March 2016 in the Pakistani province of Baluchistan, where there has been a long-running conflict between security forces and separatists, and he was convicted of planning espionage and sabotage.
His wife and mother were allowed to meet him behind a glass window on Monday, eight months after he was sentenced to death, but that gesture of goodwill appeared to have quickly descended into acrimony.
Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said Jadhav's family had been subjected to harassment when they arrived to meet him.
""The Pakistani press was allowed on multiple occasions to approach family members closely, harass and hector them and hurl false and loaded accusations about (Shri) Jadhav,"" Kumar said in a statement.
Ties between the nuclear-armed neighbors are in a deep chill and Jadhav's case has added to long-running tensions, with each accusing the other of supporting cross-border violence. 
India says Jadhav is innocent and won an injunction from the World Court to delay his execution, arguing he was denied diplomatic assistance during his trial by a military court.
CONFESSION
Pakistan authorities say Jadhav confessed to being assigned by India's intelligence service to plan, coordinate and organize espionage and sabotage activities in Baluchistan ""aiming to destabilize and wage war against Pakistan"".
On Monday, Pakistan released a picture of Jadhav's mother, Avanti, and wife, Chetankul, seated at a desk and speaking to him from behind the glass partition. Islamabad said it had honored its commitment to give access to the family. 
But India said the two women had been asked to change their dress and to remove personal jewelry and the red dot that Hindus wear on their foreheads on the pretext of security. Jadhav's mother was not allowed to speak in her native Marathi language and was frequently interrupted. 
Pakistani authorities also refused to return the shoes that Jadhav's wife had worn, Kumar said, warning against potential mischief. He didn't elaborate.
India and Pakistan often accuse each other of sending spies and several people are held in prisons for years in both countries, some of them on death row, to be used as bargaining chips in their troubled relationship.
Kumar said Jadhav appeared to be under considerable stress and under coercion during the meeting with his family. 

""Most of his remarks were clearly tutored and designed to perpetuate the false narrative of his alleged activities in Pakistan. His appearance also raises questions of his health and well-being,"" Kumar added.

President Nicolas Maduro's administration said it is freeing about 80 jailed activists in all, but giving them alternative punishments such as community service for crimes from violence to subversion during protests in 2014 and 2017.
Opponents say those being released - and the nearly 200 others still detained - are pawns of a ""dictatorship"" that unjustly punishes protest and dissent.
The local Penal Forum group confirmed 44 people have been released since Dec. 23, but criticized the government for manipulating their cases for political gain. 
Thirteen of those released were paraded in front of television cameras at a meeting with a senior official, Delcy Rodriguez, who harangued them but also wished them a happy Christmas.
The releases came days before Venezuela's government and opposition were due to resume stuttering mediation talks in the Dominican Republic in early January.

(Reuters) - Myanmar police said on Tuesday they would drop pending charges against two journalists working for Turkey's state broadcaster, their interpreter and driver, who were jailed in November for violating an aircraft law by filming with a drone.
Cameraman Lau Hon Meng from Singapore, reporter Mok Choy Lin from Malaysia, Aung Naing Soe - a local journalist who was interpreting for the pair - and driver Hla Tin were detained by police on Oct. 27 near Myanmar's parliament building in the capital Naypyitaw.
They are currently each serving a two-month prison sentence under a colonial-era aircraft law, but all four still face further charges for importing the drone. The two foreign nationals have also been charged with an immigration offence.
Police Lieutenant Tun Tun Win and an immigration officer - the complainants - appeared in a Naypyitaw courtroom on Tuesday and asked that the court drop the charges.
Tun Tun Win told Reuters higher police officials had ordered the case dropped because the four did not mean to endanger national security by flying the drone.
Additionally, he said, the decision was intended ""to forward the relationship between countries"", referring to the two journalists' home countries, Singapore and Malaysia.
A law officer - the government's prosecutor in the case - was expected to tell the court the charges were formally dropped in another hearing set for Thursday, defense lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told Reuters.
""The higher authorities already instructed to terminate with good intention, but the procedure can only be accomplished on that day (Thursday),"" the lawyer said.
The four are set to complete their sentences under the aircraft act on Jan. 9, but may be released earlier for good behavior, he added.
The case had raised concerns over freedom of the press in Myanmar, where a civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi took power last year but the military retains control of security matters, including the police.
Two Reuters journalists were arrested on Dec. 12 after they went to meet police officers for dinner on the outskirts of Myanmar's largest city Yangon. Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, have now been in detention for two weeks with no access to visitors or to a lawyer. 
They had covered the crisis in western Rakhine state that has driven 655,000 stateless Rohingya Muslims across the border to Bangladesh since August.

The reporters are being investigated under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Four civilians were killed in an attack by suspected Boko Haram militants on Monday in the Nigerian city at the center of a conflict with the Islamists, a resident and two officials told Reuters. 
Nigeria's army said on Monday evening it had repelled the assault on the outskirts of Maiduguri, the spiritual birthplace of Boko Haram. It was the first major attack on the northeast city since June. 
The army statement made no mention of casualties but Musa Alkali, a resident of the attacked area, Molai, told Reuters on Tuesday he saw four corpses.
""Boko Haram fought their way into Molai and burnt three houses before the military fighter jet arrived,"" he said.
""Three people were burnt in their houses, (then) I saw four dead bodies taken out of the area,"" said Alkali. He said the fourth person had been shot.
Two other people, a local vigilante group commander and a military officer, also told Reuters on Tuesday that four civilians had died. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they had been told not to speak to media and feared reprisal.
The military said that none of its troops had lost their lives. It said the attackers had come with trucks mounted with guns and suicide bombers, and when retreating had set fire to houses and vehicles.
Three Nigerian military spokesmen did not immediately respond to calls, texts and WhatsApp messages seeking comment.
Fourteen people were killed in an attack on Maiduguri in June when the group struck on the eve of a visit by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.
The government often says it is on alert for Boko Haram attacks during the Christmas period and other festivals for Christians and Muslims. 
The insurgency has in the past targeted places of worship such as churches and mosques during those times. Embassies regularly warn their nationals to be cautious and avoid public spaces at those times.
President Muhammadu Buhari's administration has been saying Boko Haram are almost defeated but the latest attack shows the group's continued ability to stage hit-and-run raids, prompting a renewed government push against the militants.
The Nigerian government approved the release of $1 billion last week from a state oil fund to help with the fight. 
Nigeria's long-term plan is to corral civilians inside fortified garrison towns, a move that effectively cedes the rural areas to Boko Haram.
Nigeria replaced its previous military commander of the fight against Boko Haram after half a year in the post. Military sources told Reuters this followed a series of ""embarrassing"" attacks by the militants.

ISTANBUL/KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Turkey will rebuild a ruined Ottoman port city on Sudan's Red Sea coast and construct a naval dock to maintain civilian and military vessels, Sudan's foreign minister said on Tuesday, as Ankara expands military and economic ties in Africa.
The restoration at Suakin was agreed during a visit to the ancient port by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour said.
Making the first trip by a Turkish president to Sudan, Erdogan said Turkey had been temporarily granted part of Suakin so it could rebuild the area as a tourist site and a transit point for pilgrims crossing the Red Sea to Mecca.
He said the Suakin deal was one of several, worth $650 million in total, agreed with Sudan, which emerged from two decades of U.S. sanctions in October and is seeking to attract international investment.
The countries also agreed ""to build a dock to maintain civilian and military vessels,"" Ghandour told reporters, adding that they had signed an agreement ""that could result in any kind of military cooperation"".
The agreements come three months after Turkey formally opened a $50 million military training base in Somalia as it exerts increasing influence in the region.
Suakin was Sudan's major port when it was ruled by the Ottoman Empire, but fell into disuse over the last century after the construction of Port Sudan, 35 miles (60 km) to the north.
Speaking on Monday in Khartoum, Erdogan said the refurbished port city would attract Mecca-bound pilgrims who would want to see the island's history, helping Sudan's tourism sector.
""Imagine, people from Turkey wishing to go on pilgrimage will come and visit the historical areas on Suakin Island,"" Erdogan said. ""From there ... they will cross to Jeddah by boat.""
The other agreements signed during Erdogan's visit include Turkish investment to build Khartoum's planned new airport and private sector investments in cotton production, electricity generation and building grain silos and meat slaughterhouses. 
Erdogan and Bashir said they aimed for trade between the two countries to reach $10 billion, Turkey's Foreign Economic Relations Board said.
In October, the United States lifted a trade embargo and other penalties that had cut Sudan off from much of the global financial system.
Sudan's state minister for investment has said he aims to attract investment of $10 billion a year, compared to $1 billion estimated by the United Nations for 2016.

747,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2017 08:33AM ET</span>","North Korea likely to pursue talks, South says in rosy New Year forecast","By Haejin Choi
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea predicted on Tuesday that North Korea would look to open negotiations with the United States next year in an optimistic outlook for 2018, even as Seoul set up a specialized military team to confront nuclear threats from the North.
The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new, tougher sanctions on reclusive North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, a move the North branded an economic blockade and act of war.
""North Korea will seek negotiation with United States, while continuing to pursue its effort to be recognized as a de facto nuclear-possessing country,"" South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a report, without offering any reasons for its conclusion.
The Ministry of Defence said it would assign four units to operate under a new official overseeing North Korea policy, aimed to ""deter and respond to North Korea's nuclear and missile threat"".
Tensions have risen over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House.
U.S. diplomats have made clear they are seeking a diplomatic solution but President Donald Trump has derided talks as useless and said Pyongyang must commit to giving up its nuclear weapons before any talks can begin.
In a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, North Korea said the United States was terrified by its nuclear force and was getting ""more and more frenzied in the moves to impose the harshest-ever sanctions and pressure on our country"".
China, the North's lone major ally, and Russia both supported the latest U.N. sanctions, which seek to limit the North's access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad, while on Monday Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called for all countries to ease tension.
On Tuesday, Beijing released customs data indicating China exported no oil products to North Korea in November, apparently going over and beyond U.N. sanctions. 
China, the main source of North Korea's fuel, did not export any gasoline, jet fuel, diesel or fuel oil to its neighbor last month, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.
China also imported no iron ore, coal or lead from North Korea in November.
In its 2018 forecast, South Korea's Unification Ministry said it believed the North would eventually find ways to blunt the effects of the sanctions.
""Countermeasures will be orchestrated to deal with the effects, including cuts in trade volume and foreign currency inflow, lack of supplies, and reduced production in each part of the economy,"" the report said.
The latest round of sanctions was prompted by the Nov. 29 test of what North Korea said was an intercontinental ballistic missile that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons.
The Joongang Ilbo Daily newspaper, citing an unnamed South Korean government official, reported on Tuesday that North Korea could also be preparing to launch a satellite into space.
Experts have said such launches are likely aimed at further developing the North's ballistic missile technology, and as such would be prohibited under U.N. resolutions. 
The North Korean Rodong Sinmun newspaper said on Monday saying that ""peaceful space development is a legitimate right of a sovereign state"".
North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, the United States and Japan, and says its weapons are necessary to counter U.S. aggression.

The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, and regularly carries out military exercises with the South, which the North sees as preparations for invasion.

Cevdet Ayaz requested asylum in Serbia earlier this year after fleeing Turkey, where he had been sentenced to 15 years in prison over alleged activities against the constitution, the Belgrade-based N1 TV quoted his lawyer Ana Trkulja as saying.
It also quoted her as saying that Ayaz had been extradited to Turkey on Monday and that his brother had been asked to contact a police station in Istanbul where he was being held. 
The U.N. Committee against Torture (UNCAT) issued a recommendation on Dec. 18 urging Belgrade to refrain from extraditing Ayaz.
The Serbian police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Serbian courts had ruled that all preconditions for the extradition had been met and that Justice Minister Nela Kuburovic had acted accordingly.
""The motion by the U.N. came after that (decision) ... The police only performed the extradition procedure,"" the official said.
Officials at Serbia's Justice Ministry, which approved Ayaz's extradition, were not immediately available for comment on the case.
On Monday UNCAT chairman Jens Modvig warned Serbia, a candidate for European Union membership, to adhere to its international obligations.
""Serbia is in the process of extraditing Mr. Ayaz to Turkey ... Serbia, please be aware of your UNCAT obligations,"" Modvig wrote on his Twitter account. 
Rights groups accuse Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan of using a state of emergency declared after the 2016 coup attempt to quash decades-long Kurdish dissent and political opposition.
Turkey, which is also a candidate for EU membership, denies using torture.
Serbia, the legal successor to the now-defunct Yugoslavia, has ratified the U.N. convention against torture, which came into force in 1987. 
Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic has sought to boost trade ties with Turkey, and Erdogan visited Belgrade in October.

CARACAS/CIUDAD GUAYANA, Venezuela (Reuters) - There was no way Jose Ramon Garcia, a food transporter in Venezuela, could afford new tires for his van at $350 each.
Whether he opted to pay in U.S. currency or in the devalued local bolivar currency at the equivalent black market price, Garcia would have had to save up for years.
Though used to expensive repairs, this one was too much and put him out of business. ""Repairs cost an arm and a leg in Venezuela,"" said the now-unemployed 42-year-old Garcia, who has a wife and two children to support in the southern city of Guayana.
""There's no point keeping bolivars.""
For a decade and a half, strict exchange controls have severely limited access to dollars. A black market in hard currency has spread in response, and as once-sky-high oil revenue runs dry, Venezuela's economy is in free-fall. 
The practice adopted by gourmet and design stores in Caracas over the last couple of years to charge in dollars to a select group of expatriates or Venezuelans with access to greenbacks is fast spreading. 
Food sellers, dental and medical clinics, and others are starting to charge in dollars or their black market equivalent - putting many basic goods and services out of reach for a large number of Venezuelans. 
According to the opposition-led National Assembly, November's rise in prices topped academics' traditional benchmark for hyperinflation of more than 50 percent a month - and could end the year at 2,000 percent. The government has not published inflation data for more than a year.
""I can't think in bolivars anymore, because you have to give a different price every hour,"" said Yoselin Aguirre, 27, who makes and sells jewelry in the Paraguana peninsula and has recently pegged prices to the dollar. ""To survive, you have to dollarize.""
The socialist government of the late president Hugo Chavez in 2003 brought in the strict controls in order to curb capital flight, as the wealthy sought to move money out of Venezuela after a coup attempt and major oil strike the previous year.
Oil revenue was initially able to bolster artificial exchange rates, though the black market grew and now is becoming unmanageable for the government. 
TRIM THE TREE WITH BOLIVARS
President Nicolas Maduro has maintained his predecessor's policies on capital controls. Yet, the spread between the strongest official rate, of some 10 bolivars per dollar, and the black market rate, of around 110,000 per dollar, is now huge. 
While sellers see a shift to hard currency as necessary, buyers sometimes blame them for speculating.
Rafael Vetencourt, 55, a steel worker in Ciudad Guayana, needed a prostate operation priced at $250. 
""We don't earn in dollars. It's abusive to charge in dollars!"" said Vetencourt, who had to decimate his savings to pay for the surgery.
In just one year, Venezuela's currency has weakened 97.5 per cent against the greenback, meaning $1,000 of local currency purchased then would be worth just $25 now.
Maduro blames black market rate-publishing websites such as DolarToday for inflating the numbers, part of an ""economic war"" he says is designed by the opposition and Washington to topple him.
On Venezuela's borders with Brazil and Colombia, the prices of imported oil, eggs and wheat flour vary daily in line with the black market price for bolivars. 
In an upscale Caracas market, cheese-filled arepas, the traditional breakfast made with corn flour, increased 65 percent in price in just two weeks, according to tracking by Reuters reporters. In the same period, a kilogram of ham jumped a whopping 171 percent.
The runaway prices have dampened Christmas celebrations, which this season were characterized by shortages of pine trees and toys, as well as meat, chicken and cornmeal for the preparation of typical dishes.
In one grim festive joke, a Christmas tree in Maracaibo, the country's oil capital and second city, was decorated with virtually worthless low-denomination bolivar bills.
Most Venezuelans, earning just $5 a month at the black market rate, are nowhere near being able to save hard currency.

""How do I do it? I earn in bolivars and have no way to buy foreign currency,"" said Cristina Centeno, a 31-year-old teacher who, like many, was seeking remote work online before Christmas in order to bring in some hard currency.

TUNIS (Reuters) - The UAE, which angered Tunisia by banning Tunisian women from its passenger flights, has intelligence that female jihadists returning from Iraq or Syria might try to use Tunisian passports to stage terrorist attacks, a Tunisian government official said.
Tunisia had demanded the United Arab Emirates apologize for the travel ban - saying that the UAE had provided no explanation - and on Sunday it suspended the Dubai-based airline Emirates from operating at Tunis airport.
Since then, Saida Garrach, an advisor at the Tunisian presidency, told local radio Shems FM that the UAE had ""serious information over the possibility of terrorist acts as part of returning fighters leaving Iraq and Syria,"" and that the two countries were now working together to address the threat.
""There are terrorist plots in several countries,"" Garrach said in an interview conducted on Monday and posted on the station's website.
""What concerns the United Arab Emirates is the possibility of terrorist acts committed by Tunisian women or by Tunisian passport holders,"" she said. 
Garrach criticized the way the threat had been communicated to Tunisia.
""We are fighting terrorism together with the United Arab Emirates and we are coordinating to solve this problem. But we cannot accept the way Tunisian women are treated and don't accept what has happened to Tunisian women at airports.""
Tunisia is among the countries with the highest per capita number of militant Islamists, a problem linked to widespread radicalisation among disillusioned youths and a loosening of security controls after Tunisia’s 2011 uprising.
The military defeat of the Islamic State group in most of Syria and Iraq this year has prompted many foreign militants and their families to go home. Islamic State has also lost its main stronghold in Tunisia's neighbor Libya.
More than 3,000 Tunisians are known to have traveled abroad to wage jihad, according to the interior ministry. A year ago the interior minister said 800 had come back to Tunisia, where they have been jailed, monitored or put under house arrest.

PARACHINAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A suspected U.S. drone attack along the Pakistani-Afghan border killed an Islamist militant commander and one of his associates on Tuesday, a Pakistani official in the remote area said.
It was not immediately clear whether the missile struck on the Afghan or Pakistani side or the border.
There have been multiple unverified U.S. drone strikes in the mountainous border region separating Pakistan's Kurram Agency from Afghanistan since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January. 
Trump has taken a hardline stance on Pakistan, which he says provides safe haven to terrorists including the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network carrying out attacks in Afghanistan. 
Tuesday's suspected drone attack targeted the vehicle of a militant commander named Jamiuddin, said a Pakistani official in the area, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Another witness reported seeing the strike near the Mata Sanghar area of Kurram agency, across from the Afghan province of Paktia. 
""I saw two missiles hit the vehicle and the people inside were killed,"" said witness Rehmanullah. 
The local official said it was unclear which side of the border the attack took place, but authorities were investigating.
More aggressive drone strikes that hit inside Pakistani territory are one of the steps that U.S. officials have said could be taken if Islamabad does not end safe havens for militants.
Pakistan has sought to downplay several recent drone strikes inside the border, with officials saying they were on the Afghan side even though local residents said they were in Pakistan.
In October, three suspected strikes in two days killed 31 people who officials said belonged to the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network, allied to the Taliban. 
Those attacks came days after a Canadian-American couple held hostage by the Taliban were freed from the area in Pakistan's northwest, striking a rare positive note in the country's often-fraught relations with the United States.

The announcement signals a desire to demonstrate a return to normality in the port, where top military commander Khalifa Haftar declared the end of a campaign to oust Islamist fighters in July.
Clashes have sporadically continued in some isolated areas, while life has returned in the rest of the city, though some districts were almost completely destroyed by shelling and air strikes.
A forum titled ""International Conference and Exhibition for rebuilding Benghazi city"" will be held from March 19-21, the organizers said in an invitation posted online, adding that a six-day exhibition would be held the same month.
Haftar is aligned with a government and parliament in eastern Libya which was listed as the conference's sponsor.
He has rejected a U.N.-backed government based in the capital, Tripoli, as he has gradually strengthened his position on the ground.
The United Nations has sought to bridge differences between the two sides, part of a conflict since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011. Talks were suspended in October.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines said on Tuesday it would investigate whether safety regulations were ignored at an office where a fire killed 37 call center employees and vowed to impose sanctions if firms had not met standards.
The remains of 37 employees of the U.S.-based Research Now SSI killed by Saturday's fire in Davao City have been recovered and a criminal investigation will be launched by the Justice Department.
Labour Secretary Silvestre Bello said he had instructed the government's workplace health and safety agency and the Labour Ministry's regional office in Davao, President Rodrigo Duterte's hometown, to investigate if there were lapses in safety standards.
The fire broke out at a furniture store on the third level of the 14-year-old New City Commercial Center and quickly engulfed an outsourcing business on the upper floor, based on an initial report from the city government. 
""We will immediately look into possible violations of some safety and health standards,"" Bello told Reuters.
""We may not issue any clearance to operate,"" he said when asked to clarify sanctions that could be imposed on the mall or call center management if culpable. 
The fire is a setback for the Philippines' $23 billion business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, which is an economic lifeline in the country of more than 100 million. The sector employs about 1.15 million people, with jobs forecast to grow to 1.8 million by 2025.
Along with remittances from overseas workers, BPO revenues are a major earner of foreign exchange for the country, driving what is one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.
The BPO Industry Employees Network (BIEN) has expressed concern about postings on social media that said the building was made of sub-standard materials, had locked its fire exits, and had not held fire drills. It was not possible to immediately check the accuracy of the postings.
BIEN said the government should look into every BPO firm's compliance with occupational health and safety standards.
SEEKING JUSTICE
""Justice must be served to the victims and those accountable must be penalized so as to avoid future workplace deaths,"" BIEN said in a statement.
On Monday night, Duterte told relatives of victims that the National Bureau of Investigation, police and fire protection bureau would get to the bottom of the disaster.
""The truth will come out,"" he said. 
Research Now SSI has confirmed 37 of its 500 employees in its Davao call center were ""lost"" in the fire.
It did not immediately respond to a Reuters query on Tuesday about safety protocols at its Davao office.
The company has offices in Texas, California, New York and Toronto and more than 3,500 market research, consulting, media, healthcare and corporate clients.
In a Sunday statement, it said it was helping to support funeral arrangements and would create a fund for contributions to help victims' families.
The Call Centre Association of the Philippines (CCAP) said it was waiting for a full report from Research Now SSI, but saw no problem with its members meeting workplace safety standards.
""We always comply with government safety regulations because our priority is the welfare of all our employees,"" CCAP President Jojo Uligan told Reuters.
But the Associated Labour Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP) said safety standards were not being adhered to and the labor department and companies were not living up to their responsibilities to enforce and comply.

""This deaths-causing fire could have been minimized to the barest damage to property,"" ALU-TUCP spokesman Alan Tanjusay said.

Britain secured the go-ahead from Brussels to start talks on its future relationship with the EU earlier this month, with London saying it aspires to a closer relationship as a former member than that of any other third country.
In an interview with the Funke newspaper group published on Tuesday, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said such a deal could offer a solution to the puzzle of how the bloc of 27 can manage its ties with two other large non-members.
""I can't imagine Turkey or Ukraine becoming EU members in the next few years,"" he said. ""If we get a smart agreement with Britain regulating relations with Europe after Brexit, that could be a model for other countries - Ukraine and also Turkey.""
Turkey, a candidate for EU membership for decades, already has a customs union with the EU which allows the trade of most goods without tariffs. 
One possibility would be to offer Ankara a ""new, closer form of the customs union"", Gabriel said, although he also said such a project would have to wait for changes in Turkey's political environment.
Thousands of people, including German citizens, have been detained in Turkey as part of a government crackdown since a failed coup in 2016.
An agreement between the EU and Ukraine on a ""deep and comprehensive free trade area"" formally came into force in September, aimed at allowing free trade of goods, services and capital, and visa-free travel for people for short stays.
Ukraine's desire for closer ties with the EU was one of the driving forces behind a popular revolt that toppled a pro-Russian president in 2014, leading Moscow to seize Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and back pro-Russian separatists in a still-unresolved conflict in the east of the country.

Gabriel's Social Democratic Party (SPD) is preparing for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on governing together for another four years.

The deal, signed on Jan. 18 will expand the Tartus naval facility, Russia's only naval foothold in the Mediterranean, and grant Russian warships access to Syrian waters and ports, Viktor Bondarev, head of the upper house security and defense committee, told RIA. 
RIA news agency separately quoted Sergei Shoigu as saying: ""Last week the Commander-in-Chief (President Vladimir Putin) approved the structure and the bases in Tartus and in Hmeimim (air base). We have begun forming a permanent presence there.""
The Tartus naval facility, in use since the says of the Soviet Union, is too small to play host to larger warships.
According to the RIA report, the agreement will allow Russia to keep 11 warships at Tartus, including nuclear vessels. The agreement will last for 49 years and could be prolonged further. 

The Hmeimim air base, from which Russia has launched numerous air strikes in support of President Bashar al-Assad during his war with rebels, can now be used by Russia indefinitely, according to the deal.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China sentenced a prominent rights activist to eight years in jail for subversion on Tuesday, his lawyer said, the harshest sentence passed in a government crackdown on activism that began more than two years ago. 
In a separate case, a rights lawyer avoided criminal punishment despite being found guilty of inciting subversion, because he admitted his crimes, the Chinese court trying him said.
Wu Gan, a blogger better known by his online name ""Super Vulgar Butcher"", plans to appeal against the eight-year sentence handed down by the Tianjin Municipality's No. 2 Intermediate People's Court, his lawyer, Yan Xin, told Reuters. 
The harshness of the sentence prompted the German embassy in Beijing to issue a statement expressing disappointment.
Wu regularly championed sensitive cases of government abuses of power, both online and in street protests. He was detained in May 2015 and charged with subversion. 
The activist criticized China's political system online and used performance art to create disturbances, as well as insulting people and spreading false information, according to a statement from the court posted on its website. 
""He carried out a string of criminal actions to subvert state power and overthrow the socialist system and seriously harmed state security and social stability,"" the court said. 
Before his arrest, Wu used his platform to cast doubt on the official version of events in an incident in early May 2015, in which a police officer shot a petitioner in a train station in northern Heilongjiang province.
Wu's refusal to bow to pressure or admit guilt likely explains his harsh sentence, said Kit Chan, Hong Kong-based director of China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group.
""Wu Gan is being punished for his non-conformity,"" she said.
His sentence is the most severe in what rights groups have called an unprecedented attack on China's rights activists and lawyers, known as the 709 crackdown, which began in full force on July 9, 2015.
The hardline approach to rights activism has shown no sign of softening as Chinese President Xi Jinping enters his second five-year term in office.
In the other case concluded on Tuesday, rights lawyer Xie Yang received no punishment after being found guilty of inciting subversion and disrupting court order, the Changsha Intermediate People's Court said on social media.
The court released a video of the proceedings, in which Xie said he accepted the outcome and would not appeal. He also thanked authorities and said he will be a law-abiding citizen.
Xie had worked on numerous cases deemed sensitive by Chinese authorities, such as defending supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests. In May, he confessed to the charges against him in what rights groups called a scripted ""sham"" trial.
In January, Xie's wife and lawyer released detailed accounts of torture suffered by Xie at the hands of the authorities, which were widely reported on in the international media.
Chinese state media branded those reports ""fake news"" and said the accounts were concocted as a means of gaining attention. Xie's lawyer told Reuters he stands by the account.
""In both cases these have been serious concerns about violations of due process of law,"" the German embassy in Beijing said in a statement. 
The decision to hand down both sentences the day after Christmas, when there would likely be less attention from diplomats and international observers, ""reeks of cynical political calculation"", said Patrick Poon, Hong Kong-based researcher for Amnesty International.

Asked about the verdicts, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing that Amnesty is biased when it comes to China and should not be believed, adding that China abides by the rule of law.

China considers self-ruled and democratic Taiwan to be its sacred territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring what it views as a wayward province under Chinese control.
China has taken an increasingly hostile stance towards Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen from the island's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party won presidential elections last year.
Beijing suspects her of pushing for the island's formal independence, a red line for China. Tsai says she wants peace with China, but that she will defend Taiwan's security and way of life.
In a lengthy report, Taiwan's defense ministry listed the number of times China's air force had drilled near the island since the end of October last year and which aircraft were involved, including bombers and advanced fighter jets.
Of the 16 drills, 15 of them were around Taiwan, flying through the Bashi Channel which separates Taiwan from the Philippines and near Japan's Miyako island, to the north of Taiwan. The other drill was through the Bashi Channel and out into the Pacific.
China has repeatedly said the drills are routine.
Taiwan's defense ministry said China was the island's biggest security threat.
""The Chinese military's strength continues to grow rapidly,"" it said. 
""There have been massive developments in military reforms, combined operations, weapons development and production, the building of overseas military bases and military exercises, and the military threat towards us grows daily.""
Chinese missiles can already cover all of Taiwan, and China has been improving its abilities in long-range anti-ship missiles ""to build an ability to resist foreign forces"", the ministry added.
Tensions rose earlier this month after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened that China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits there.
Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S.-made weapons, but has been pressing Washington to sell more advanced equipment.
The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, to China's distaste.
Proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China, and Taiwan's government has accused Beijing of not understanding what democracy is all about when it criticizes Taipei.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean police have arrested the owner and the manager of a building where 29 people died in a fire last week, accusing the pair of multiple safety lapses, including blocked exits and malfunctioning sprinkler systems.
On Thursday, a fire ripped through an eight-story high-rise in the small city of Jecheon. At least 20 of the victims were women who were overcome by toxic fumes in a second-floor sauna.
Jecheon police have only identified the owner by his last name of Lee, and the manager by his last name of Kim.
Both men are in custody in Jecheon after being arrested on Sunday, police announced on Tuesday.
Lee faces two charges of violating fire safety regulations and committing involuntary homicide by professional negligence, while Kim also faces the involuntary homicide charge.
If convicted of involuntary homicide, Lee and Kim could face up to five years in prison or 20 million won ($16,000) in fines. 
""The sprinkler system on the building’s first floor did not work properly when the fire erupted,"" a police detective, who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to speak on an ongoing investigation, told Reuters. ""If the sprinkler system worked, the fire probably would not have spread as fast as it did.""
Police said on Tuesday that Lee has retained a lawyer but declined to name the lawyer or firm. Police said Kim has not yet hired a lawyer.
Photos released by the Yonhap news agency showed a smoke-stained stairwell and a fire exit filled with shelves and supplies on the second floor, where most of the deaths occurred.
""The emergency exit on the building’s second floor was blocked by iron shelves and other miscellaneous items,"" the detective confirmed.
Officials are still investigating the cause of the conflagration.
According to police, both Kim and Lee had denied reports they were trying to remove ice on the ceiling of the first floor, where the fire appeared to have originated, but later changed their statements after police confronted them with evidence.
The Korea JoongAng Daily newspaper reported on Tuesday that Lee had at one point told police he did not alert the women in the sauna because they were undressed, however, the police detective told Reuters he could not confirm that as investigations were ongoing.
Anger mounted over the weekend at reports of shoddy construction, broken doors, blocked roads and other problems that may have contributed to the deaths.
A number of cars parked along the narrow roads around the building impeded the ability of firefighters to reach the fire, an official with the Jecheon fire department told Reuters, but noted that none of the parked vehicles appeared to have violated parking rules.
""Although vehicles can park there legally, it was quite difficult for fire trucks to go through to get to the scene, because the road was too narrow,"" said the fire official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak publicly.
Visiting the scene on Friday, President Moon Jae-in promised a full investigation.
""The government as a whole will thoroughly probe this accident's cause and process of response, and although after the fact, the investigation and measures will be such that, at least, there will not be lingering deep sorrow,"" he said.
On Monday, a separate fire at a construction site at an apartment complex south of Seoul killed one person and injured 14 others, according to Yonhap.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China and Pakistan will look at extending their $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday, part of China's ambitious Belt and Road plan linking China with Asia, Europe and beyond.
China has tried to position itself as a helpful party to promote talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, both uneasy neighbors ever since Pakistan's independence in 1947.
Their ties have been poisoned in recent years by Afghan accusations that Pakistan is supporting Taliban insurgents fighting the U.S.-backed Kabul in order to limit the influence of its old rival, India, in Afghanistan.
Pakistan denies that and says it wants to see a peaceful, stable Afghanistan.
Speaking after the first trilateral meeting between the foreign ministers of China, Pakistan and Afghanistan, Wang said China hoped the economic corridor could benefit the whole region and act as an impetus for development.
Afghanistan has urgent need to develop and improve people's lives and hopes it can join inter-connectivity initiatives, Wang told reporters, as he announced that Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to mend their strained relations.
""So China and Pakistan are willing to look at with Afghanistan, on the basis of win-win, mutually beneficial principles, using an appropriate means to extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan,"" he added.
How that could happen needs the three countries to reach a gradual consensus, tackling easier, smaller projects first, Wang said, without giving details.
Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said his country and China were ""iron brothers"", but did not directly mention the prospect of Afghanistan joining the corridor.
""The successful implementation of CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) projects will serve as a model for enhancing connectivity and cooperation through similar projects with neighboring countries, including Afghanistan, Iran and with central and west Asia,"" he said.
India has looked askance at the project as parts of it run through Pakistan-administered Kashmir that India considers its own territory, though Wang said the plan had nothing to do with territorial disputes.
China has sought to bring Kabul and Islamabad together partly due to Chinese fears about the spread of Islamist militancy from Pakistan and Afghanistan to the unrest-prone far western Chinese region of Xinjiang.
As such, China has pushed for Pakistan and Afghanistan to improve their own ties so they can better tackle the violence in their respective countries, and has also tried to broker peace talks with Afghan Taliban militants, to limited effect.
A tentative talks process collapsed in 2015.
Wang said China fully supported peace talks between the Afghan government and Taliban and would continue to provide ""necessary facilitation"".

The Belt and Road infrastructure drive aims to build a modern-day ""Silk Road"" connecting China to economies in Southeast and Central Asia by land and the Middle East and Europe by sea.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is considering refitting the Izumo helicopter carrier so that it can land U.S. Marines F-35B stealth fighters, government sources said on Tuesday, as Tokyo faces China's maritime expansion and North Korea's missile and nuclear development.
Japan has not had fully fledged aircraft carriers since its World War Two defeat in 1945. 
Any refit of the Izumo would be aimed at preparing for a scenario in which runways in Japan had been destroyed by missile attacks, and at bolstering defense around Japan's southwestern islands, where China's maritime activity has increased.
Three government sources close to the matter said the Japanese government was keeping in sight the possible future procurement of F-35B fighter jets, which can take off and land vertically, as it looks into the remodeling of the Izumo.
The 248-metre (814-feet) Izumo, Japan's largest warship equipped with a flat flight deck, was designed with an eye to hosting F-35B fighters. Its elevator connecting the deck with the hangar can carry the aircraft, the sources said. 
Possible refitting measures included adding a curved ramp at the end of the flight deck, improving the deck's heat resistance against jet burners, and reinforcing the ship's air traffic control capability, they said.
However, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said the government was not taking any concrete steps towards refitting the Izumo.
""Regarding our defense posture, we are constantly conducting various examinations. But no concrete examination is under way on the introduction of F-35B or remodeling of Izumo-class destroyers,"" Onodera told reporters on Tuesday.
The Izumo has a sister ship called the Kaga.
Japan has frequently conducted joint drills with U.S. aircraft carriers in recent months to boost deterrence against North Korea. 
One of the three government sources called such exercises ""a great opportunity to see with our own eyes how the U.S. military operates their aircraft carriers"" as Japan looks into the possible conversion of the Izumo into an aircraft carrier.
Regional tension has soared since North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in September. Pyongyang said a month later it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach all of the U.S. mainland.
Japan is also wary of China's long-range missiles, and would like to secure measures to launch fighters from aircraft carriers in case runways operated by U.S. forces in Japan or by Japan's Air Self-Defence Force were destroyed by missiles.
Article 9 of Japan's pacifist constitution, if taken literally, bans the maintenance of armed forces. However, Japanese governments have interpreted it to allow a military exclusively for self-defense.

Owning an aircraft carrier could raise a question of constitutionality, the sources said, so the government is set to address the issue in its new National Defence Programme Guidelines to be compiled by the end of 2018.

766,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2017 12:56AM ET</span>",Peru's Kuczynski urges people to accept Fujimori pardon and 'turn the page',"By Mitra Taj and Mariana Bazo
LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski defended his pardon for Alberto Fujimori on Monday as justified clemency for an ailing man whose authoritarian government in the 1990s helped the country progress, after Peruvians protested for a second day.
Addressing Peruvians for the first time since pardoning Fujimori on Christmas Eve, Kuczynski appealed to Peruvians protesting his decision to ""turn the page"" and accept it.
The pardon has pitched Kuczynski's center-right government into a fresh political crisis less than a week after Congress nearly removed him from office in the wake of a graft scandal.
Earlier on Monday, police fired tear gas to disperse crowds in downtown Lima in a second day of unrest, while a third lawmaker announced he was abandoning Kuczynski's political party.
Fujimori, who like Kuczynski is 79, is a deeply divisive figure in Peru. While many consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending a severe economic crisis and quashing a leftist rebellion during his decade in power.
The pardon cleared Fujimori of convictions for graft and human rights crimes, 12 years into a 25-year prison sentence.
Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker, reiterated that the pardon was a response to fears that Fujimori might die in prison. But - for the first time since running for office a year ago - he also defended Fujimori's decade in power.
""It's clear his government, which inherited a country submerged in a violent and chaotic crisis at the start of the 1990s, incurred in significant legal transgressions regarding democracy and human rights. But I also think his government contributed to national progress,"" Kuczynski said in a televised address.
The remarks placed Kuczynski more firmly on Fujimori's side of Peru's biggest political faultline, and triggered a fresh wave of criticism of Kuczynski from Fujimori's foes.
""You've got to be pretty stingy, President Kuczynski, to not say a word of solidarity for the victims and their loved ones,"" Gisela Ortiz, a Peruvian human rights activist, said on Twitter after his speech.
Just a week ago, Kuczynski fanned fears of a new rise of Fujimori's rightwing movement, denouncing its bid to remove him from office as a legislative ""coup"" attempt that threatened Peru's democracy.
Many of Fujimori's detractors, who helped Kuczynski win last year's runoff election, joined Kuczynski in calling for lawmakers to defeat the ""presidential vacancy"" motion.
But it was a rebel faction among Fujimori's supporters in Congress which unexpectedly saved Kuczynski from the vote, fueling speculation that it was part of a deal to trade votes for a pardon for Fujimori.
""The pardon's for President Kuczynski, it's not for Fujimori,"" leftist lawmaker Marisa Glave said on local TV channel Canal N.
The lawyer who defended Kuczynski before Congress last week, Alberto Borea, said he was opposed to the pardon and did not know it was in the works.
Chanting ""traitor"" and ""the pardon has got to go,"" many Peruvians marching on Monday called for Kucyznski to resign and new elections to be held.
So far, three ruling party lawmakers have announced their resignations from Kuczynski's party, which controls about a fifth of congressional seats. The deputy human rights minister has also resigned, a government source said.
Fujimori remained at a hospital in Lima, where he was taken from prison late on Sunday to treat a drop in his blood pressure and an abnormal heart beat, according to his doctor.

The frigate HMS St Albans departed on Dec. 23 to track the new Russian warship Admiral Gorshkov as it moved through the North Sea. The Royal Navy vessel monitored the Russian ship over Christmas and will return to dock in Portsmouth later on Tuesday.
UK defense minister Gavin Williamson said in a statement after the incident that he would ""not hesitate in defending our waters or tolerate any form of aggression"". 
Relations between Britain and Russia are strained, and UK foreign minister Boris Johnson said there was ""abundant evidence"" of Moscow meddling in foreign elections during a trip to Russia last week. His counterpart Sergei Lavrov said there was no proof for Johnson's claim.
While Johnson said he wants to normalize relations with Russia, Moscow blames London for the poor state of relations between the countries.

Britain's defense ministry said another ship, HMS Tyne, was called to escort a Russian intelligence-gathering ship through the North Sea and the English Channel on Christmas Eve. A helicopter was subsequently dispatched to monitor two other Russian vessels.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori late on Sunday, triggering Christmas Eve street clashes as protesters denounced the decision as part of a crude political deal.
The decision clears Fujimori of convictions for human rights crimes and graft when his right-wing government was in power from 1990 to 2000, and could define Kuczynski's legacy and rewrite political alliances.
At least two ministers in Kuczynski's cabinet who objected to the pardon told him they wanted to resign, and Kuczynski might reshuffle the cabinet as early as this week, a government source said.
Two ruling party lawmakers quit his party as his political group planned next steps.
Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker who vowed as a candidate not to pardon Fujimori, based his decision on a medical review that found Fujimori suffered from ""a progressive, degenerative and incurable disease"", according to a statement from the president's office.
Late on Sunday, Fujimori was taken to hospital from prison by ambulance to treat a drop in blood pressure and abnormal heart beat.
But many in Peru saw the pardon as part of a quid pro quo. Three days earlier, Fujimori's loyalists - led by his lawmaker son Kenji - unexpectedly saved Kuczynski from a vote in Congress that nearly removed him from office.
In a video Kenji shared on social media, a gray-haired Fujimori, connected to tubes in hospital, was seen smiling after reading Kuczynski's announcement of the pardon on a cellphone with Kenji.
""To save his own skin he cut a deal with Fujimori's supporters to infamously pardon a corrupt killer,"" said Veronika Mendoza, a leftist leader who competed against Kuczynski in last year's presidential election.
Kuczynski's center-right government has repeatedly denied that a pardon for Fujimori was part of political negotiations.
'BEST PRESIDENT' EVER 
Fujimori is a deeply divisive figure in Peru. While many consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending an economic crisis and bloody leftist insurgency when in power.
""He's the best president Peru ever had,"" said Maria Luisa Cuculiza, a friend and former minister of Fujimori, adding that he no longer had any political ambitions.
""He doesn't want to return to politics. He just wants to be a good grandfather,"" Cuculiza told Reuters by telephone.
Police fired teargas at scores of Fujimori's opponents in downtown Lima, who waved pictures of the victims of a bloody counterinsurgency campaign during his term. 
Officers in riot gear stood guard at Kuczynski's house in the capital's San Isidro financial district as protesters called for the march to make its way there.
Fujimori's family and supporters cheered the pardon as a long-overdue vindication for a misunderstood hero.
Holding a vigil at the hospital where Fujimori remained late on Sunday, his followers waved banners reading ""Freedom for Fujimori!""
But the pardon was a blow to the relatives of victims, prosecutors and human rights activists who helped put Fujimori behind bars in a lengthy judicial process that earned Peru global plaudits for fighting impunity.
Kuczynski, ""you've betrayed justice, democracy and victims. History will never forgive you,"" said Indira Huilca, a leftist lawmaker whose union leader father was shot dead in 1992 in what the Inter-American Court of Human Rights deemed an extrajudicial killing.
Kuczynski, who like Fujimori is 79, ran for office to cap a prestigious career in finance and public administration.
The pardon may expose him to allegations of ideological bias as he leads regional criticism of leftist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom he has called a ""dictator.""
'ETERNALLY GRATEFUL'
The pardon might also prompt one of the biggest political realignments in Peru since Fujimori fled to his parents' homeland of Japan in 2000 as a corruption scandal brought his decade in power to an end.
Fujimori was extradited back to Peru in 2007 and later found guilty of commanding death squads that massacred civilians, bribing lawmakers and having a hand in the kidnapping a journalist, among other crimes.
Despite his downfall, the right-wing populist movement that Fujimori built has remained one of the most potent political forces in Peru.
His eldest daughter, Keiko, leads the opposition party Popular Force that controls Congress, while Kenji has courted ties with Kuczynski's government as he challenges his sister's past decade of leadership of their father's populist following.
On Thursday, Kenji led a surprise defection in Popular Force that deprived Keiko's followers of the votes they needed to remove Kuczynski from office in the wake of a graft scandal.
""We're eternally grateful to you,"" Kenji told Kuczynski on Twitter, noting that he was speaking for Fujimori's family.
Kenji said Fujimori was recovering in intensive care and would not likely go home for a few days.
As the pardon inflamed long-dormant political tension in Peru, a representative of the political arm of the Maoist-inspired rebel group Shining Path called for Kuczynski to release its historic leader. 
""Freedom for Dr Abimael Guzman Reinoso!"" Guzman's attorney, Alfredo Crespo, wrote in a message to journalists. 

""Enough of hate and persecution!""

771,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2017 06:00PM ET</span>",Fujimori family pulls Peru back into political turmoil,"By Mitra Taj
LIMA (Reuters) - The Fujimori clan is at it again.
Nearly two decades since Alberto Fujimori and his family occupied Peru's presidential palace and gripped the Andean nation's attention during one of its most turbulent chapters, they are once more at the center of political upheaval.
Now an ailing and grey-haired 79-year-old, Fujimori became a free man on Christmas Eve thanks to a pardon from President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, clearing him of graft and rights convictions less than halfway into a 25-year jail sentence.
The decision, stunning Peruvians as they sat readied their holiday feasts, triggered clashes between police and protesters and could reshape Peruvian politics for years.
Fujimori had unsuccessfully sought a pardon from two previous presidents, but secured one from Kuczynski after benefiting from a political rivalry between two of his children, Keiko and Kenji.
The siblings lead separate factions of the rightwing party, Popular Force, which grew out of the populist movement their father founded in the 1990s and now controls Congress.
Last week, Kuczynski was nearly removed from office by loyalists to Keiko in the wake of a graft scandal, Kenji and nine of his followers saved the president with abstention votes.
Kuczynski denies the pardon was part of a pact, and Fujimori's supporters hail it as an overdue humanitarian gesture due to health problems they say put the former president's life at risk.
Yet what is undisputed is the central role that the Fujimoris, descendants of the Japanese diaspora, continue to play in Peruvian politics - long after Alberto's authoritarian government imploded in a graft scandal in 2000.
""The Fujimori dynasty will be with us for a while still,"" said Fernando Tuesta, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.
The family saga was a reminder of the enduring support authoritarian movements often enjoy long after they fall, especially when subsequent democratic leaders - bound by institutional limits - disappoint, Tuesta said.
Since first riding onto Peru's political scene on a tractor in Peru's 1990 election, Fujimori has been admired by many in Peru's poorer provinces, where he had schools and roads built and wielded an iron fist against leftist Maoist rebels.
KENJI AND KEIKO
Kenji, 37, was widely seen as having presidential ambitions after Keiko's two failed bids to reach Peru's highest office and may launch a bid in the 2021 race.
Once best known as the boy Fujimori publicly doted on during his decade in power, Kenji has since turned his carefree juvenile image into an asset that contrasts with the 42-year-old Keiko's more composed persona.
Miguel Campoblanco, Kenji's friend in school, recalled parties with classmates at the presidential palace and the occasional military helicopter ride to the jungle. 
""He always looked up to his father. I remember in sixth grade he used to say, 'I'm going to be president like my dad,'"" said Campoblanco.
After his father, Kenji may emerge as the biggest winner from the pardon. Having long led calls for his father's release, he has seized the spotlight in events surrounding the pardon.
On Saturday, Kenji rode in the passenger seat of an ambulance chased by news cameras as it rushed Fujimori to the hospital, and later shared a video that showed the father-and-son duo celebrating news of the pardon.
""He's the good son,"" said political analyst Ivan Lanegra. ""But his political career thus far had one goal: his father's freedom.""
The siblings might reconcile now that their father is free and it becomes politically convenient, added Lanegra.
Keiko has spent the past decade turning her father's populist following into the country's most powerful political party. At 19, Keiko became Peru's first lady after their parents' acrimonious divorce.
The secretary general of Keiko's party, Jose Chlimper - a former minister in her father's government - said she was paying the price for keeping a campaign promise to not seek her father's freedom through politics.

""Keiko doesn't lie,"" said Chlimper, betting she would eventually come out stronger for it. ""I worked with ex-President Fujimori. And I wonder if he's going to be happy leaving his unjust imprisonment in this way.""

In a statement by around 40 rebel groups who include some of the military factions who participated in earlier rounds of Geneva peace talks, they said Moscow had not put pressure on the Syrian government to reach a political settlement.
""Russia has not contributed one step to easing the suffering of Syrians and has not pressured the regime that it claims it is a guarantor by move in any real path towards a solution,"" the rebel statement said.
Russia, which has emerged as the dominant player in Syria after a major military intervention over two years ago, received backing from Turkey and Iran for holding a Syrian national dialogue congress in the Russian city of Sochi on Jan. 29-30.
""Russia is an aggressor country that has committed war crimes against Syrians... It stood with the regime militarily and defended its politically and over seven years preventing U.N. condemnation of (Syrian President Bashar) Assad's regime,"" the statement said.
Moscow says it targets militants but rebels and residents say the Russian air strikes conducted since a major aerial campaign over two years ago has caused hundreds of civilian casualties in indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas away from the frontline.
Some rebels said they had not yet made up their mind.

U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said that Russia's plan to convene the congress should be assessed by its ability to contribute to and support the U.N.-led Geneva talks on ending the war in Syria.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis used his Christmas message on Monday to call for a negotiated two-state solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, after U.S. President Donald Trump stoked regional tensions with his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Francis spoke of the Middle East conflict and other world flashpoints in his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) address, four days after more than 120 countries backed a U.N. resolution urging the United States to reverse its decision on Jerusalem.
""Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached, one that would allow the peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders,"" he said, referring to the Israelis and Palestinians.
""We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,"" he said in his address, delivered from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to tens of thousands of people.
It was the second time that the pope has spoken out publicly about Jerusalem since Trump's decision on Dec. 6. On that day, Francis called for the city's ""status quo"" to be respected, lest new tensions in the Middle East further inflame world conflicts. 
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent state, whereas Israel has declared the whole city to be its ""united and eternal"" capital.
Francis, leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, urged people to see the defenseless baby Jesus in the children who suffer the most from war, migration and natural calamities caused by man today.
""Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world ... Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus, 'there is no place in the inn,'"" he said.
OPEN HEARTS FOR REFUGEES
Francis, celebrating the fifth Christmas of his pontificate, said he had seen Jesus in the children he met during his recent trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh, and he called for adequate protection of the dignity of minority groups in that region.
More than 600,000 Muslim Rohingya people have fled mainly Buddhist Myanmar to Bangladesh in recent months. The pope had to tread a delicate diplomatic line during his visit, avoiding the word ""Rohingya"" while in Myanmar, which does not recognize them as a minority group, though he used the term when in Bangladesh.
""Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one’s head. May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem,"" he said.
He also urged the world to see Jesus in the innocent children suffering from wars in Syria and Iraq and also in Yemen, complaining that its people had been ""largely forgotten, with serious humanitarian implications for its people, who suffer from hunger and the spread of diseases"".
He also listed conflicts affecting children in South Sudan, Somalia, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Ukraine and Venezuela.

At his Christmas Eve Mass in St. Peter's Basilica on Sunday, Francis strongly defended immigrants, comparing them to Mary and Joseph finding no place to stay in Bethlehem and saying faith demands that foreigners be welcomed.

A Reuters photographer said the woman jumped over guard rails and rushed onto the larger-than-life Nativity scene shouting ""God is woman"". She had the same slogan painted on her bare back.
A Vatican gendarme stopped her from taking the statue and she was detained. The incident happened about two hours before Pope Francis delivered his Christmas message to some 50,000 people in the square.
The group's website identified her as Alisa Vinogradova and called her a ""sextremist"". It says the goal of the group, which was founded in Ukraine, is ""complete victory over patriarchy"".
A Femen activist staged a similar action on Christmas Day 2014 but managed to take the statue out of the crib before she was arrested.

Photos posted on social media showed the main house on the farm, located near the village of Musienene in North Kivu province in the east of the country, was gutted by fire. 
Kabila was not at the property during the attack which took place overnight from Sunday to Monday. 
It was not immediately known who was responsible for the raid. The body of the policeman who died was burned, a local government official said. 
Congo is embroiled in a political crisis linked to Kabila's refusal to step down as president when his mandate expired a year ago while militia violence and political unrest are increasing.
""We firmly condemn this barbarous act and call on the population ... to disassociate from any actions likely to compromise peace and development in this part of the country,"" lawmakers said in a statement. 
More than a decade after the end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died, mostly from hunger and disease, rebel fighters and local militias stalk Congo's mineral-rich eastern borderlands.
The armies of Congo and neighboring Uganda launched a joint operation against the Congo-based, Ugandan Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) last week.
The Islamist rebel group is suspected of being behind a Dec. 8 attack on a United Nations base in North Kivu that killed 15 Tanzanian peacekeepers and five Congolese soldiers. 

The ADF has been blamed for a wave of attacks and massacres in the area. Raids by local Mai Mai militia fighters are also growing increasingly frequent.

Major General Nicholas Rogers, who heads Nigeria's military operations against Boko Haram, told Reuters that the situation in Maiduguri, in the northeast of Nigeria, was under control.
He did not give further details.
The government says it is on alert for Boko Haram attacks during the Christmas period and other festivals for Christians and Muslims. Embassies regularly warn their nationals to be cautious and avoid public spaces at those times. 
Heavy gunfire was heard in the Molai area on the outskirts of the city on Monday evening, prompting residents to flee the district, two residents and an officer in a local vigilante group had said.
The vigilante commander, who asked not to be identified, said his group had joined the effort to repel the attackers.
There were no immediate reports of casualties nor any immediate claim of responsibility. It was also not immediately possible to identify the target of the assault.
Boko Haram has in the past targeted places of worship during religious celebrations, including attacking churches at Christmas or mosques during Muslim festivals or prayer times.
The last major Boko Haram attack on Maiduguri, a mainly Muslim city with a Christian minority, was in June, when the group launched an assault on the eve of a visit by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.
President Muhammadu Buhari's administration has previously said Boko Haram was almost defeated but the latest attack shows the group's continued ability to stage hit-and-run raids, prompting a renewed government push against the militants.
The Nigerian government approved the release of $1 billion last week from a state oil fund to help with the fight. 
Nigeria's long-term plan is to corral civilians inside fortified garrison towns, a move that effectively cedes the rural areas to Boko Haram.
Nigeria replaced its previous military commander of the fight against Boko Haram after half a year in the post. Military sources told Reuters this followed a series of ""embarrassing"" attacks by the militants.

Western nations and Latin American neighbors have been increasingly critical of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro this year, accusing him of stamping on democracy and human rights. 
Venezuela says foreign governments are trying to encourage a right-wing coup. On Saturday, it also expelled the Brazilian envoy.
Venezuela had already withdrawn its ambassador to Canada in protest over sanctions against the Maduro regime that Canada imposed in September. 
In a statement, Freeland said the ambassador was no longer welcome in Canada and that Venezuela's charge d'affaires is persona non grata.
Venezuela's expulsion of the Canadian diplomat over the weekend, she said, was ""typical of the Maduro regime, which has consistently undermined all efforts to restore democracy and to help the Venezuelan people. 
""Canadians will not stand by as the Government of Venezuela robs its people of their fundamental democratic and human rights, and denies them access to basic humanitarian assistance,"" she said in the statement.
Canada in September, following a similar move by the United States, imposed targeted sanctions against 40 Venezuelan senior officials, including Maduro, to punish them for “anti-democratic behavior.” The ministers of defense and the interior as well as several Supreme Court judges were also among those targeted by the measures. 

Canada is a member of the 12-nation Lima Group, which is trying to address the Venezuelan crisis and which next meets in Chile in January.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia should scrap the 13 percent profit tax on funds repatriated from abroad and renew an amnesty from penalties for businesses returning capital, as Washington moves toward tougher sanctions, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday.
Amid huge capital outflows in 2014, deteriorating relations with the West over the Ukraine conflict and weak oil prices, Moscow offered the amnesty for those returning capital to Russia. 
The amnesty, which expired in mid-2016, scrapped responsibility for past taxes and currency violations for those who declared assets abroad. But few agreed to take part in the amnesty.
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Friday that his ministry was proposing such an amnesty be restored in 2018 for at least a year.
Speaking at the meeting with the leadership of the Russian parliament, Putin said he had two proposals which he had not previously spoken about publicly.
""The first is to extend the amnesty timeline, I mean external restrictions are not easing, but, on the contrary, tending to rise,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law a new package of sanctions in August. One provision asked the U.S. Treasury Secretary to submit a report on the impact of expanding sanctions to cover Russian sovereign debt, with an outcome expected as early as February.
Putin's second proposal was to scrap 13 percent taxes for transfers of capital to Russia by businesses.
Among other tools to encourage the return of money will be a special bonds program. 
Russia plans to adjust the terms of a sovereign Eurobond issue next year so that businesses can use the bonds to repatriate funds in a way that would protect them from being damaged by new sanctions on Moscow.

Reuters reported earlier this month that wealthy Russians facing the prospect of targeted U.S. sanctions next year had floated the idea of a special treasury bond to help create favorable conditions for them to bring their cash home.

A man who was skiing close to the 2,844-metre high Hofathorn, in the southern canton of Wallis, died after being carried away by an avalanche on Monday morning.
The 39-year-old from the Wallis region was quickly found and recovered by his friends but was confirmed dead at the scene by emergency services.
Police in Graubunden, in the west of Switzerland, said a tourist who went missing on Saturday had also been found dead.
The 31-year-old Frenchman had tried to climb the Glattwang mountain alone on Saturday afternoon after skiing with his girlfriend.
When he did not return, a search was launched and the man's body was found in a ravine on Sunday morning. Police said he had triggered an avalanche on his descent which carried him more than a kilometer over rocky terrain.
Separately, one of three walkers buried by a snow drift in Wallis on Saturday has died, Swiss broadcaster SRF reported, quoting the police. 
The group was hiking at a height of 2,700 meters in the St Luc region when the accident happened. One of them managed to get free and make an emergency call which allowed the others to be rescued.
All three were flown to hospital, where one, a 29-year-old woman from the Swiss canton of Vaud, died of her injuries on Sunday evening, SRF said.

In an official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Sunday, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said he had chosen to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv - siding with the United States in a dispute over Jerusalem's status - after talking to Netanyahu. [L1N1OO0F7]
U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Dec. 6, reversing decades of U.S. policy and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies.
On Thursday, 128 countries rebuked Trump by backing a non-binding U.N. General Assembly resolution calling on the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem.
""God bless you, my friend, President Jimmy Morales, God bless both our countries, Israel and Guatemala,"" Netanyahu said, switching to English, in remarks to a weekly meeting of his Likud party faction in parliament.
Guatemala and neighboring Honduras were two of only a handful of countries to join Israel and the United States, which has pledged to move its embassy to Jerusalem, in voting against the U.N. resolution.
The United States is an important source of assistance to Guatemala and Honduras, and Trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that supported the U.N. resolution.
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they want to establish in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.
The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions.
The official Palestinian news agency WAFA quoted Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki as saying that Morales was ""dragging his country to the wrong side of history by committing a flagrant violation of international law"".
Prior to 1980, Guatemala - along with Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Haiti, The Netherlands, Panama, Venezuela and Uruguay - maintained an embassy in Jerusalem.
Israel's passage in June 1980 of a law proclaiming Jerusalem its ""indivisible and eternal capital"" led to a U.N. Security Council resolution calling upon those countries to move their embassies to Tel Aviv, prompting their transfer.

Israel's ambassador to Guatemala, Matty Cohen, said on Army Radio that no date had been set for the embassy move, ""but it will happen after"" the United States relocates its own embassy to Jerusalem. U.S. officials have said that move could take at least two years.

GAZA (Reuters) - The Red Cross said on Monday Israel has a duty to guarantee the safety and dignity of Palestinian families visiting prisoners, after a right-wing lawmaker was filmed shouting abuse aboard a bus taking relatives to a family visit in an Israeli jail.
The legislator, Oren Hazan, boarded the bus at the Gaza border with video crews in tow. He said on Twitter he told the relatives that the prisoners were ""terrorists who belong in the ground"". In a video clip on social media, he shouted at one prisoner's mother that her son was an ""insect"" and a ""dog"".
""An insect?,"" she yelled back. ""My son is the best of men. A dog is whoever calls him a dog.""
Hazan has a record of staging publicity stunts, including crashing a welcoming ceremony for visiting U.S. President Donald Trump. He once agreed to stage a fistfight at the border with a member of Jordan's parliament, only to cancel it on the orders of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The families on the bus were on their way to Nafha prison in southern Israel from the Gaza Strip in a convoy escorted by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In a statement, the ICRC said it ""takes very seriously what happened today"".
""Families have the right to visit their loved ones in a dignified manner,"" Suhair Zakkout, Gaza spokeswoman for the ICRC, said in the statement. ""It is the responsibility of the competent authorities to ensure that the visits take place safely and without interference.""
Hazan, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, said he confronted the relatives to promote legislation to cancel such family visits until Israeli prisoners in Gaza and the remains of Israeli troops were returned.
Hamas, the dominant militant group in the Gaza Strip, has acknowledged holding three Israeli civilians who crossed into the enclave. In addition, Israel is seeking the return of the remains of two soldiers it says were killed in a 2014 Gaza war. 
Hamas has demanded the release of its members who were re-arrested and imprisoned by Israel in 2014 for alleged security offences after being released in a 2011 swap for a captured Israeli soldier.
Israel's Prisons Service declined comment on the incident.
Maximum security Nafha prison, in the southern Israeli desert, is used mainly to hold Palestinians convicted of anti-Israeli security offences. The convoy completed its journey to the facility.
Qadoura Fares, chairman of the Palestinian Prisoner Club that advocates on behalf of Palestinians held by Israel, branded Hazan a ""fanatic"" but said Israel's government ""bears responsibility for this brutal action"".

The standoff between Astana and the government of former Kyrgyz president Almazbek Atambayev strained a Russian-led economic bloc and disrupted supplies of Kyrgyz goods to some European countries.
""We have established a constructive and trust-based dialogue in all areas,"" Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's office quoted him as telling his Kyrgyz counterpart Sooronbai Jeenbekov.
Jeenbekov was elected president last month. In the run-up the vote, his predecessor and backer Atambayev accused the Kazakh government of interfering in Kyrgyz politics and supporting an opposition candidate.
Astana denied those charges but introduced tough border controls that nearly halted the flow of goods out of Kyrgyzstan, which is landlocked and sends most of its exports out through Kazakh territory.
Kyrgyzstan filed complaints both to the Moscow-led Eurasian Economic Union, a post-Soviet bloc, and the World Trade Organization, accusing Kazakhstan of imposing a ""blockade"".
Bishkek also briefly suspended operations at a copper and gold mine operated and run by Kazakhstan-based and London-listed Kaz Minerals.
But tensions started easing after Jeenbekov, a former prime minister, took office this month. Last week, Bishkek informed the WTO it had settled its dispute with Astana.

""Kyrgyzstan will continue to carry out its foreign policy aimed at deepening and intensifying bilateral ties with Kazakhstan,"" Jeenbekov's office quoted him as saying at the meeting in Astana.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's bid to oust one of the country's most powerful provincial governors has run into strong resistance that has deepened political uncertainty just as Washington steps up its campaign against the Taliban insurgency.
Atta Mohammad Noor, governor of the strategically important northern province of Balkh, has refused to leave office, a week after Ghani's office said the president had accepted his resignation and named a replacement.
The standoff has underlined how uncertain central government control remains outside the capital and how volatile the political situation has become as maneuvering begins ahead of a presidential election scheduled for 2019.
One of a number of powerful regional leaders who command strong local loyalty while acting semi-independently of the government, Atta Noor has long sought a role on the national stage and is a potential candidate in the 2019 election.
Allies have warned that unless Ghani reverses his decision, he risks civil unrest that will threaten security and allow Taliban and Islamic State militants to gain a foothold in Balkh, a major economic hub which sits on lucrative trade routes to Central Asia.
""If President Ghani does not show flexibility, he will be responsible for the consequences,"" said Farhad Azimi, a member of parliament from Balkh province.
However he said no side had any interest in a confrontation that would cause violence or threaten security.
DIVISIONS
The standoff, which has alarmed Afghanistan's Western partners, has re-opened divisions that were only partially covered up by the U.S.-brokered agreement creating Ghani's unity government following a disputed presidential election in 2014.
After widespread claims of fraud by both sides in the election, Ghani was finally installed as president alongside his former rival Abdullah Abdullah from the Jamiat-i Islami party, who took the specially created post of chief executive.
Atta Noor, who has built a strong regional power base as Balkh governor, has received the backing of the party, which is supported mainly by ethnic Tajiks from northern Afghanistan, many of whom still resent Ghani, an ethnic Pashtun.
""Atta Mohammad Noor is the strongest figure in Jamiat,"" said Bresha Rabeh, another member of parliament from Balkh. ""He will not back down.""
However he has clashed bitterly with his party rival Abdullah, whom he called a ""serpent"" whose teeth he would break. After days of silence, Abdullah confirmed on Monday that he had backed the decision to remove Atta Noor.
The dispute comes as U.S. forces have stepped up air strikes against the Taliban and other militant groups as part of a beefed-up strategy aimed at forcing the insurgents to accept a peace settlement after 16 years of war.
U.S. commanders say the campaign has had significant success against the Taliban but the impact risks being diluted by political turmoil that has undermined public confidence in the Western-backed government.
As the turmoil has deepened, tensions between Tajiks and Pashtuns, Afghanistan's two largest ethnic groups, have intensified, undermining attempts to build national unity.

Parliamentary elections, officially scheduled for next year, are in doubt and opposition groups have stepped up pressure on the government, with former president Hamid Karzai calling for a 'loya jirga', or council of elders and political leaders.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan allowed the wife and mother of an Indian man convicted of spying to visit him on Monday in Islamabad, eight months after he was sentenced to death by a military court. 
Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav, a former officer in the Indian navy, was arrested in March 2016 in the Pakistan province of Baluchistan, where there has been a long-running conflict between national security forces and militant separatists. 
The case has added to tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors, who often accuse each other of violating a 2003 ceasefire along their disputed border in Kashmir, where the countries sometime engage in intense artillery duels. 
Pakistan released a picture of Jadhav's mother, Avanti, and wife, Chetankul, seated at a desk and speaking to him from behind a glass window. 
""The mother and wife of Commander Jadhav sitting comfortably in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Pakistan. We honor our commitments,"" a spokesman for Pakistan's foreign office, Mohammad Faisal, said in an earlier Twitter posting when the women first arrived at the ministry in Islamabad. 
India's foreign affairs office has not responded to a request for comment on the meeting. 
After Jadhav was sentenced to death in April, India asked the World Court for an injunction to bar the execution, arguing that he was denied diplomatic assistance during what it says was an unfair trial.
The World Court ordered Pakistan in May to delay Jadhav's execution, and said Islamabad had violated a treaty guaranteeing diplomatic assistance to foreigners accused of crimes. 
Pakistan authorities say Jadhav confessed to being ordered by India's intelligence service to conduct espionage and sabotage in Baluchistan ""to destabilize and wage war against Pakistan"".
Baluchistan is at the center of a $57 billion Chinese-backed ""Belt and Road"" development project that at first focused on Chinese companies building roads and power stations, but is now expanding to include setting up industries. 
In a transcript released by Pakistan of what it says is Jadhav's confession, the former naval officer says disrupting the Chinese-funded projects was a main goal of his activities.

ANKARA (Reuters) - A new emergency decree in Turkey could allow vigilantes to carry out political violence with impunity against opponents of the government suspected of involvement in last year's coup attempt, Turkey's main lawyers' groups said on Monday.
The government defended the emergency decree, issued on Sunday, which it said was intended to ensure that Turks who took to the streets to protect the elected government during the failed 2016 coup would not face punishment.
Turkey already granted officials immunity last year from prosecution for their official actions taken to suppress the coup. Sunday's decree extended that immunity to civilians ""whether they have an official title or not, and whether they have carried out official duties or not"". 
The lawyers' groups said the measure was vaguely-worded and could lead to violence.
""People will start shooting each other in the head on the streets. How will you prevent this?"" Metin Feyzioglu, the head of the Union of Turkish Bar Associations, said in a video response.
""So you have brought out an article that leaves civilians killing and lynching each other unpunished and without compensation. Are you aware of what you have done Mr. President?""
Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) said it would appeal the decree at the constitutional court.
In a rare show of opposition, Abdullah Gul, a former president and longtime ally of President Tayyip Erdogan, said the wording of the article was worrisome, adding that he hoped it would be revised to prevent problems in the future.
A separate decree on Sunday dismissed 2,756 more people from their jobs, accusing them of links to terrorist organizations. Turkey has already sacked or suspended more than 150,000 police, teachers, lawyers and other professionals from their jobs in the aftermath of the coup. More than 50,000 people have been arrested.
In a joint statement, the Ankara and Istanbul bar associations called Sunday's two decrees ""the last two nails in the coffin of the law"".
Erdogan says tough measures in the wake of the coup are necessary to root out the perpetrators. His government blames the failed takeover on followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish-born cleric based in the United States, who denies responsibility.
The lawyers said the decree granting immunity did not make clear what sort of actions could be seen as furthering the aims of the coup, for which civilians carrying out revenge attacks could now be protected from punishment. The government said the decree covered only the night of the failed military takeover itself, despite the date not being specified in the text.
""This regulation concerns solely the night of the coup attempt, July 15 2016, and its aftermath, which is the morning of July 16. This does not encompass terror acts that were carried out later,"" Mahir Unal, the spokesman for the ruling AK Party, told reporters at a televised news conference.

Ten ambulances, fire service personnel, and three medivac helicopters were on the scene, agencies reported.

The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad.
The U.S.-drafted resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Council to further reductions if it were to conduct another nuclear test or launch another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
North Korea on Sunday rejected the resolution, calling it an act of war.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the resolution appropriately strengthened the sanctions but was not designed to affect ordinary people, normal economic exchanges and cooperation, or humanitarian aid. 
Hua noted it also called for the use of peaceful means to resolve the issue and that all sides should take steps to reduce tension.
""In the present situation, we call on all countries to exercise restraint and make proactive and constructive efforts to ease the tensions on the peninsula and appropriately resolve the issue,"" she told a daily news briefing.
The North's old allies China and Russia both supported the latest U.N. sanctions.
Tension has been rising over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House.
In November, North Korea demanded a halt to what it called ""brutal sanctions"", saying a round imposed after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 constituted genocide.
North Korea on Nov. 29 said it successfully tested a new ICBM that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons.
U.S. diplomats have made clear they are seeking a diplomatic solution but proposed the new, tougher sanctions resolution to ratchet up pressure on North Korea's leader.

China, with which North Korea does some 90 percent of its trade, has repeatedly called for calm and restraint from all sides and for a return to talks.

The men, including one soldier, were accused of several militant attacks and of attempting to assassinate a commander of the Bahraini army, BNA said.
The court sentenced seven other people linked to the case to seven years in jail and revoked their citizenship, while five others were acquitted, BNA added, quoting a state prosecution statement.
BNA said the 18 men involved in the case include eight who were convicted in absentia, having fled to Iraq and Iran. It was not clear which of the absent eight were sentenced to death and which to jail.
Bahrain accuses mainly Shi'ite Iran of stoking militancy in the kingdom, a strategic island where the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet is based, charges Tehran denies. Bahrain has a Shi'ite Muslim majority population but is ruled by a Sunni royal family.
The rulings are subject to appeal, the statement said.
Bahrain in January executed three Shi'ite men convicted of killing three policemen, including an officer from the United Arab Emirates, in a 2014 bomb attack. They were the first such executions in over two decades and sparked protests.
Bahrain had seen occasional unrest since 2011 when authorities crushed protests mainly by the Shi'ite majority demanding a bigger role in running the country.

Police said the car, which crashed through the first set of glass doors of Willy Brandt House, the SPD's headquarters, was laden with petrol canisters and gas cartridges. The building's sprinkler system extinguished the resulting blaze.
Authorities did not identify the man, in part because of a policy of limiting public communications in cases involving suicide, attempted or otherwise, saying only that he was 58 years old.
A police spokeswoman said investigators had found nothing to cast doubt on the man's claim that he had been attempting to commit suicide. The incident did not appear to be an attack, she added.
It was unclear why he had chosen the SPD, which is about to start negotiations on governing for another four years in coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, as his target.

The man was taken to hospital for treatment for superficial injuries to his head. Nobody else was hurt. Police launched an arson inquiry and state security services were also investigating.

HANOI/MANILA (Reuters) - Authorities in Vietnam prepared to move a million people from low-lying areas along the south coast on Monday as a typhoon approached after it battered the Philippines with floods and landslides that killed more than 230 people.
Typhoon Tembin is expected to slam into Vietnam late on Monday after bringing misery to the predominantly Christian Philippines just before Christmas.
Vietnam's disaster prevention committee said 74,000 people had been moved to safety from vulnerable areas, while authorities in 15 provinces and cities were prepared to move more than 1 million.
The government ordered that oil rigs and vessels be protected and it warned that about 62,000 fishing boats should not venture out to sea.
""Vietnam must ensure the safety of its oil rigs and vessels. If necessary, close the oil rigs and evacuate workers,"" Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc was quoted as saying on a government website.
Schools were ordered to close in the southern commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City on Monday, a working day in Vietnam.
On Sunday, Tembin hit the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, parts of which are contested by several countries, including Vietnam and China. 
No casualties were reported in outposts there.
Vietnam, like the Philippines, is regularly battered by typhoons that form over the warm waters of the Pacific and barrel westwards into land.
Tembin will be the 16th major storm to hit Vietnam this year. The storms and other disasters have left 390 people dead or missing, according to official figures.
SCORES MISSING
In the Philippines, rescue workers were still struggling to reach some remote areas hit by floods and landslides that Tembin's downpours brought, as the death toll climbed to more than 230. Scores of people are missing.
The full extent of the devastation was only becoming clear as the most remote areas were being reached.
Health worker Arturo Simbajon said nearly the entire coastal village of Anungan on the Zamboanga peninsula of Mindanao island had been wiped out by a barrage of broken logs, boulders and mud that swept down a river and out to sea.
""Only the mosque was left standing,"" Simbajon said.
""People were watching the rising sea but did not expect the water to come from behind them.""
Manuel Luis Ochotorena, head of regional disaster agency, said he expected the death toll to rise.
""Many areas in Zamboanga peninsula are still without power and communications, some towns are cut off due to collapsed bridges, floods and landslides,"" he said.
Tens of thousands of people on Mindanao have been displaced by the storm, which struck late on Friday.
The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons a year and warnings are routinely issued.
But disaster officials said many villagers had ignored warnings this time to get out coastal areas and move away from riverbanks.
In 2013, super typhoon Haiyan killed nearly 8,000 people and left 200,000 families homeless in the central Philippines.

Paolo Duterte announced his resignation during a special session of the Davao City Council. Davao is President Duterte's hometown and its mayor is Paolo's younger sister, Sara Duterte-Carpio.
""There are recent unfortunate events in my life that are closely tied to my failed first marriage,"" the vice mayor said, in a statement made available to media. 
""These, among others, include the maligning of my reputation in the recent name dropping incident in the Bureau of Customs’ smuggling case and the very public squabble with my daughter.""
Paolo testified at a senate investigation in September into a seized shipment of around $125 million worth of narcotics from China after opponents of the president, who has instigated a fierce crackdown on the drugs trade, said they believe his son may have helped ease the entry of the shipment at the port in Manila, the Philippine capital. Paolo has denied any involvement.
More recently, he has been involved in an online spat with Isabelle, his 15-year-old daughter from his first wife. Paolo has called her ""embarrassing"" on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after she complained on Twitter about being treated badly by her father.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian army forces backed by Iranian-backed militias pushed deeper into the last rebel-held enclave near a strategic border area with Israel and Lebanon in a new expansion of Tehran's influence in the war-torn country.
The army and the Shi'ite forces advanced east and south of the Sunni-rebel held bastion of Beit Jin backed by some of the heaviest aerial bombing and heavy artillery shelling since a major assault began over two months ago to seize the area, rebels said.
The Syrian army said it had encircled the village of Mughr al Meer at the foothills of Mount Hermon as troops moved toward Beit Jin amid fierce clashes.
The enclave is the last rebel bastion left in the south west of Damascus known as the Western Ghouta that had since last year fallen under government control after months of heavy bombing on civilian areas and years of siege tactics that forced rebels to surrender.
A western intelligence source confirmed rebel reports that Iranian-backed militias including the powerful Lebanese Hezbollah Shi'ite group were playing a major role in the ongoing battles. 
""The Iranian backed militias are trying to consolidate their sphere of influence all the way from southwest of Damascus to the Israeli border,"" said Suhaib al Ruhail, an official from the Liwa al Furqan rebel group that operates in the area.
Worried by Iran's expanding influence in Syria after the defeat of Islamic State, Israel has in the last few weeks stepped up its strikes against suspected Iranian targets inside Syria.
Early this month an Israeli strike on a base near Kiswah, south of Damascus was widely believed to be an Iranian military compound, according to a Western intelligence source
Israel has been lobbying both big powers to deny Iran, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and other Shi‘ite militias any permanent bases in Syria, and to keep them away from the Golan, as they gain ground while helping Damascus beat back Sunni-led rebels.
The southwest of Syria is part of a de-escalation zone in southern Syria agreed last July between Russia and Washington, the first such understanding between the two powers.
The area has not seen Russian bombing unlike other ceasefire areas in Syria.
Diplomatic sources say several thousand Shi'ite fighters who have been amassing from outside the Quneitra province are pitted against hundreds of Islamist and mainstream Free Syria Army (FSA) rebels closing ranks under the banner of Itihad Quwt Jabal al Sheikh ""Union of fighters of Jabal al Sheikh"". They are mainly drawn from local fighters from the area.
With the army and Iranian backed offensive widening, the rebels have called on youths to enlist as mosque imams in Beit Jin called on people to take up arms and fight the army.
Rebels still have a sizeable presence in central and southern Quneitra, in the Syrian Golan Heights.
Western diplomatic sources say the crushing of the Sunni rebel presence in areas they have been in since 2013 will allow Lebanon's Hezbollah to open another secure arms supply line from its border in southern Lebanon into Syria.

Since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, Iran has had a growing presence in the country, deploying thousands of Shi'ite fighters who have fought against both mainstream Sunni rebel groups and more militant groups.

Sheikh Mohammed al-Jirani disappeared last December from outside his home in the Qatif region, which is home to about one million Shi'ite Muslims in the predominantly Sunni Muslim kingdom.
SPA said a security officer and one of the kidnappers were killed in a clash on Dec. 19 and a second kidnapper was arrested. It also said the judge's body had been found in the remote farming district of Awamiya but did not say when he had been killed. 
Authorities said earlier this year that three men being sought in connection with the abduction were already on a wanted list for their suspected involvement in ""terrorist attacks"" in eastern Saudi Arabia. 
Since 2011 the region has been shaken by frequent, though mostly peaceful, protests by the Shi'ite minority.
However, Shi'ite militants, angry over what they say is repression of their community, have sometimes attacked Saudi security forces in the oil-producing Eastern Province where Qatif is located.

KABUL (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a compound of Afghanistan's national intelligence agency in Kabul on Monday, that killed at least five people and wounded two.
The blast comes a week after the group claimed an attack on a training facility of the same agency, the National Directorate for Security, in Kabul that ended when the attackers were killed before causing significant casualties.
In a statement issued through the group's Amaq news agency, Islamic State said it was also behind Monday's attack. 
In Kabul, security officials said the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber who approached the agency's entrance on foot before blowing himself up. All the casualties reported were of civilian passersby.
Najib Danish, a spokesman for the interior ministry, said at least five people had been killed and two wounded.
Islamic State's local affiliate, which first appeared in eastern Afghanistan near the border with Pakistan in early 2015, has become increasingly active and has claimed several recent suicide attacks in Kabul.
It has frequently fought Taliban militants and has been heavily targeted by U.S. air strikes and Special Forces operations in its main stronghold in Nangarhar province.

But there remains considerable uncertainty about how the group operates and the exact nature of its connections with Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - On Christmas Eve, U.S. President Donald Trump took calls from children, asking them what they wanted most from Santa, and revealing what was on his own wish list.
One boy wanted building blocks. Another wished for his grandma to get out of the hospital. And as for Trump - who has sent a series of combative tweets since arriving at his Florida vacation home - he said he wants ""peace for the country.""
""We've got prosperity - now we want peace,"" Trump told a child named Ryan, who called the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to check on Santa's progress.
Every year on Christmas eve NORAD purports to track the flight of Santa and his reindeer-pulled sleigh, a tradition since 1955 when a department store misprinted a phone number, sending a flood of calls to a NORAD colonel, who played along.
Sitting in a gold chair beside first lady Melania Trump in an ornate, tapestried great room, the president enthusiastically chatted with youngsters and their parents. Reporters in the room could hear only the president's side of the conversation.
In his trademark brash style honed during a career in the New York real estate world, Trump predicted the kids would have the greatest Christmas ever.
""I'll make a prediction - Santa is going to treat you well. Really well. The best he's ever treated you,"" he told one child from Mississippi, throwing in an invitation to come to the Oval Office sometime.
Casper from Arlington, Virginia, was a child after Trump's own heart. ""Building blocks! That's what I always liked too,"" the president exclaimed.
""I predict that Santa will bring you building blocks, so many you won't be able to use them all,"" he said.
As for Ryan, he told Trump he wanted his grandmother to come home from the hospital.

""That is great. That's better than asking for some toy or something,"" Trump said.

Taiwan is one of China's most sensitive issues. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring what it considers a wayward province and sacred Chinese territory under its rule.
Writing in the influential state-run newspaper the Study Times, Liu Junchuan, who heads the liaison office of China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, said it was inevitable Taiwan would come under China's control. 
China's economic growth means its economy now far surpasses Taiwan's, and the trend would only continue, Liu wrote in the paper, which is published by the Central Party School that trains rising Communist Party officials.
""The swift development and massive changes in the mainland of the motherland are creating an increasingly strong attraction for the people of Taiwan,"" he said.
""The contrast in power across the Taiwan Strait will become wider and wider, and we will have a full, overwhelming strategic advantage over Taiwan,"" Liu added.
""The economic, political, social, cultural and military conditions for achieving the complete reunification of the motherland will become even more ample.""
The concepts of peaceful reunification and ""one country, two systems"" would become even more attractive to Taiwan's people and foreign forces will not be able to stop it, Liu said.
""The basic situation of the Taiwan Strait continuing to develop in a direction beneficial to us will not change, and time and momentum are on our side.""
China has long mooted taking Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems"" form of government, which is supposed to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, and applying it to Taiwan, though the people of the proudly democratic island have shown no interest in being ruled by the autocratic mainland.
Taiwan says Beijing does not understand what democracy is and that only Taiwan's people can decide the island's future.
Relations between Beijing and Taipei have soured since Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party won presidential elections last year, with China suspecting she wants to push for the island's formal independence.
Tsai says she wants peace with China but will defend Taiwan's security and democracy.
China has stepped up military drills around Taiwan and squeezed Taiwan's international space, siphoning off its few remaining diplomatic allies. 

Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists.

The number was broadly similar to one provided by a U.S. think tank earlier this month.
China has conducted extensive land reclamation work on some of the islands and reefs it controls in the South China Sea, including building airports, alarming its neighbors and Washington.
Beijing says the work is help provide international services such as search-and-rescue but admits there is a military purpose too. China also says it can do whatever it wants on its territory.
The new report, posted on a website run by China's National Marine Data and Information Service and the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, says China has enhanced its military presence there and ""reasonably"" expanded the area covered by the islands.
Apart from what it termed ""large radar"" - it was unclear if the report was referring to more than one - construction this year has included facilities for underground storage and administrative buildings.
There has been an increase in military patrols too, the report added, without giving specifics.
The report was released on Friday but appeared in the state-run newspaper the Global Times on Monday.
While attention in Asia has been distracted by the North Korean nuclear crisis in the past year, China has continued to install high-frequency radar and other facilities that can be used for military purposes on its man-made islands in the South China Sea, a U.S. think tank said this month.
That report, by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Chinese activity has involved work on facilities covering 72 acres (29 hectares) of the Spratly and Paracel islands, territory contested with several Asian neighbors.

More than $5 trillion of world trade is shipped through the South China Sea every year. Besides China's territorial claims in the area, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Taiwan have rival claims.

In a short post on his official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account, Morales said he decided to move the embassy from Tel Aviv after talking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.
This month U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing decades of U.S. policy and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies.
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to forging a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as their capital. 
The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions. 
On Thursday, 128 countries defied Trump by backing a non-binding U.N. General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem.
Guatemala and neighboring Honduras were two of only a handful of countries to join the United States and Israel in voting against the resolution on Jerusalem.
The United States is an important source of assistance to Guatemala and Honduras, and Trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that supported the U.N. resolution.
Morales, a former television comedian with an important base of conservative Christian support, earlier this year became embroiled in a bitter spat with the United Nations when a U.N.-backed anti-corruption body in Guatemala tried to impeach him.

Although Morales avoided impeachment, he failed in an attempt to expel the head of the body, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, after criticism from the United Nations, the United States and the European Union.

TELESKOF, Iraq (Reuters) - Inside the newly renovated Church of Saint George in the Northern Iraqi town of Teleskof, Hayat Chamoun Daoud led children dressed as Santa Claus singing ""Jingle Bells"" in Aramaic.
Like every other resident of Teleskof, this was Daoud's first Christmas back home in three years, since Islamic State militants overran her town and forcibly displaced its 12,000-strong Chaldean Christian community. 
""It's so special to be back in my church, the church where I got married, the church I raised my children in,"" the school headmistress said, tears in her eyes.
Faced with a choice to convert, pay a tax or die, Daoud, like many other Christians in the Nineveh Plains, chose to flee. Most sought refuge in nearby towns and cities, but many sought permanent asylum abroad. Though the militants were only in Teleskof for a few days, residents only began returning home earlier this year. 
On Sunday, they celebrated their first Christmas together again at the town's main church, which was overflowing. Hundreds of congregants, dressed in their finest, poured in to pray and receive communion from Father Salar Bodagh, who later lit the traditional bonfire in the church’s courtyard, a symbol of renewal he said.
'JOY SOAKED IN TEARS'
Despite the obvious joys of being able to celebrate openly once again, it was a bittersweet Christmas for most across the Nineveh Plains, the epicenter of Iraq’s ancient Christian communities which can trace their history in the country back two millennia.
Though Iraq declared full victory over the militants just two weeks ago after a brutal three-year war, the damage done to Christian enclaves was extensive, and left many wondering whether they could overcome their recent history.
Islamic State ravaged Christian areas, looting and burning down homes and churches, stripping them of all valuable artifacts and smashing relics. 
The damage in Qaraqosh, a town 15 km (10 miles) west of Mosul also known as Hamdaniya, was extensive, particularly to the town's ancient churches.
At the Syrian Catholic Church of the Immaculate, congregants gathered for midnight Mass on Sunday surrounded by scorched and blackened walls, still tagged with Islamic State graffiti. They also sat on donated plastic chairs - the church has not yet been able to replace the wooden pews the militants used to fuel the massive fire which engulfed the church.
Most families will require tens of thousands of dollars to repair their homes and replace their stolen goods. But most say they can overcome the material damage, unlike the forced separation of their families.
Before the militant onslaught, Qaraqosh was the largest Christian settlement in Iraq, with a population of more than 50,000. But today, only a few hundred families have returned. Entire congregations have moved overseas, such as the Syriac Orthodox congregation of the Church of Mart Shmony.
On Saturday afternoon, Father Butros Kappa, the head of Qaraqosh’s Church of the Immaculate was trying hard to summon any sense of hope to deliver his congregation during Christmas Mass.
""We'll have a Christmas Mass like in previous years, but this year, ours will be a joy soaked in tears, because all of our people have left Iraq,"" said Father Kappa. 
Holding Mass in the singed and upturned ruins of his church was therefore important, he said, ""to remind everyone that despite the tragedies that have befallen us, we're still here.""
'NO FUTURE FOR US'
In Teleskof, 30 km (20 miles) north of Mosul and itself one of the oldest continuing Christian communities in the world, some families were skipping Mass altogether upset at their forced dispersal. 
""We usually celebrate with our entire family,"" said Umm Rita, as she prepared the traditional Christmas Day dish of pacha (sheep's head, trotters and stomach all slowly boiled) at her home. ""But how can we be happy this year? Our brothers and sisters, even my own daughter, her husband and child I’ve never met have all moved away.""
Community leaders estimate more than 7,000 of Teleskof's residents are now scattered across Iraq and it's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region, the United States, Australia, Germany, Lebanon and Jordan. 
Amid ongoing tensions between the central government in Baghdad and Iraq's Kurds after a referendum on Kurdish independence was held over Baghdad's objections in September, Teleskof's residents fear violence once again. ""We just want to live in peace,"" said Umm Rita. ""We are more anxious now than when Islamic State was in our homes.""
""Our community has been gutted,"" said Firas Abdelwahid, a 76-year-old former state oil employee, of the thousands who have sought permanent shelter overseas. Watching children play by the church bonfire, he felt melancholy.

""But what do we expect? The past is tragic, the present is desperate and well, there is no future for us Christians in Iraq.""

804,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2017 05:09PM ET</span>","Pope, on Christmas Eve, says faith demands respect of immigrants","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis strongly defended immigrants at his Christmas Eve Mass on Sunday, comparing them to Mary and Joseph finding no place to stay in Bethlehem and saying faith demands that foreigners be welcomed.
Francis, celebrating his fifth Christmas as leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, led a solemn Mass for about 10,000 people in St. Peter's Basilica while many others followed the service from the square outside.
Security was stepped up, with participants checked as they approached St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) even before going through metal detectors to enter the basilica. The square had been cleared out hours earlier so security procedures could be put in place. 
The Gospel reading at the Mass in Christendom's largest church recounted the Biblical story of how Mary and Joseph had to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem to be registered for a census ordered by Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus.
""So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones,"" Francis said.
Even the shepherds who the Bible says were the first to see the child Jesus were ""forced to live on the edges of society"" and considered dirty, smelly foreigners, he said. ""Everything about them generated mistrust. They were men and women to be kept at a distance, to be feared.""
""NEW SOCIAL IMAGINATION""
Wearing white vestments in the flower-bedecked church, Francis called for a ""new social imagination ... in which none have to feel that there is no room for them on this earth.""
The 81-year-old pope, who was born of Italian immigrant stock in Argentina, has made defense of migrants a major plank of his papacy, often putting him at odds with politicians.
Austria's new chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, has aligned himself with central European neighbors like Hungary and the Czech Republic in opposing German-backed proposals to distribute asylum seekers around EU member states.
In elections in Germany in September, the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party made significant gains, with electors punishing Chancellor Angela Merkel for her open-door policy and pushing migration policy to the top of the agenda in talks to form a coalition government.
Italy's anti-immigrant Northern League, whose leader Matteo Salvini often gives fiery speeches against migrants, is expected to make gains in national elections next year. A law that would give citizenship to children born in Italy to migrant parents is stalled in parliament.
In his homily, Francis said, ""Our document of citizenship"" comes from God, making respect of migrants an integral part of Christianity.
""This is the joy that we tonight are called to share, to celebrate and to proclaim. The joy with which God, in his infinite mercy, has embraced us pagans, sinners and foreigners, and demands that we do the same,"" Francis said.
Francis also condemned human traffickers who make money off desperate migrants as the ""Herods of today"" with blood on their hands, a reference to the Biblical story of the king who ordered the killing of all newborn male children near Bethlehem because he feared Jesus would one day displace him.

The announcement came two days after Tunisian government officials said the UAE had banned Tunisian woman from flying to or transiting through its territory.
No reason was given for either decision.
Emirates said on Twitter it would stop its Dubai-Tunis connection from Monday following instructions from Tunisia.
The Tunisian transport ministry said in a statement earlier that Emirates flights would be suspended until the UAE airline found a way to operate according to international law and treaties.
The UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said on Twitter both countries had been in contact about the ""security measure information"", without elaborating.
He added that the UAE valued and respected Tunisian women.
In Tunisia anger has been building after women said they had been banned at Tunis airport from boarding Emirates flights to Dubai.
Tunisian civil organizations and political parties called on the government to act.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2017 04:40PM ET</span>",Pentagon must give access to American detained in Iraq -U.S. judge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to give the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) access to an American suspected of fighting for Islamic State and held in secret U.S. military detention in Iraq for more than three months.
In a ruling issued late on Saturday, U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan denied a government request to dismiss an ACLU challenge to the unidentified man's detention, rejecting the claim that the organization has no standing in the matter.
Chutkan ruled that the Defense Department should provide the ACLU with ""temporary, immediate and unmonitored access"" to the man to determine if he wants the organization to pursue a habeas corpus petition on his behalf and provide him with legal advice.
Using such a petition, a person can ask a court to review the legality of their detention.
The man surrendered in mid-September to U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters pursuing an offensive against Islamic State’s former stronghold of Raqqa, in northeaster Syria. He was turned over to the U.S. military, which classified him as an ""enemy combatant,"" and transferred him to a secret location in Iraq, according to Chutkan's ruling.
Aside from two visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the detainee has had contact only with U.S. government officials, according to the ruling.
The judge pointed out that in a Nov. 30 brief, the Defense Department disclosed that in an interview with FBI agents, the detainee said that he felt that he wanted an attorney present.
Chutkan dismissed as ""disingenuous at best"" a Pentagon argument that the ACLU has no standing in the case because it has been unable to confer or meet with the detainee, and cannot prove that detainee wants the group to pursue a habeas corpus petition on his behalf. 
The Defense Department is ""the sole impediment"" to the ACLU's access to the detainee, the judge said.
She also called ""remarkable and troubling"" the Pentagon’s contention that the detainee's request for a lawyer should be ignored until it decides what to do with him and when he should be given access to an attorney.

Chutkan barred the Defense Department from transferring the detainee to another location before the ACLU can interview him and then inform the court of his wishes.

Commuters will be charged a base fare of 2 Egyptian pounds (11 U.S. cents) for the first 9 stops, and an additional pound for 9 more stations, the newspaper, quoting Transport Minister Hisham Arafat, said. 
A maximum fare of 6 Egyptian pounds will be charged for commuters who ride one line from start to finish, though discounted rates for government workers and students will be maintained.
Currently, commuters can cover an unlimited number of stops and can even switch lines for the same base fare of 2 Egyptian pounds.
The move comes as part of an effort by the transport authority to cover operational costs after the floatation of the Egyptian pound, the newspaper said.

The government angered Cairo residents, already hit by a sharp rise in living costs, when it doubled the price of metro tickets in March for millions of commuters, an increase which followed losses of 500 million Egyptian pounds which have put the network at risk, media reported in March.

Fadoul has served as interim finance minister since Deby sacked his predecessor, Christian Georges Diguimbaye, last month. The appointment comes amid stalled negotiations with  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) over more than $1 billion in oil-backed loans Chad owes the commodities trader.
Glencore lent the West African country's state oil firm SHT about $1.45 billion in 2014 to be repaid with crude oil. The loan was subsequently syndicated with several banks. 
It was restructured in 2015 following the crash in global oil prices but Chad is again struggling to repay the debt. Funds from the International Monetary Fund depend on reaching new terms.
In October, Chad decided to redirect crude previously allocated to Glencore in a marketing agreement to  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) instead starting from January, which has made negotiations fraught.
Djimet Arabi, an adviser to Deby, was named the new justice minister in the reshuffle while Ahmadaye Abdelkerim Bokit takes over the security ministry. 
The new foreign minister is Mahamat Zene Cherif, Chad's former permanent representative to the United Nations.

A Christmas Eve video on Twitter showed Netanyahu against the backdrop of East Jerusalem, an area laden with Jewish, Christian and Muslim shrines that Israel captured in 1967 war and which Palestinians want as their own future capital.
In the message, titled ""Merry Christmas from Jerusalem, the capital of Israel!"" he described Israel as a haven for its 2-percent Christian minority because, he said, ""we protect the rights of everyone to worship in the holy sites behind me"".
In the one-minute video, Netanyahu named several Christian pilgrimage sites in Israel - including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in East Jerusalem's Old City.
Visiting such places, he said, would take Christians ""in the footsteps of Jesus and the origin of our Judeo-Christian heritage"".
""For those of you who come to Israel, I'm going to take a guided tour. In fact, I'll be your guide on this guided tour,"" Netanyahu said. This would happen Christmas next year he said, without going into the logistics. 
Trump's Dec. 6 announcement on Jerusalem reversed decades of U.S. policy on leaving the city's status to Israeli-Palestinian negotiation. The move angered Muslims and was rejected by most world powers. 

U.S. evangelicals who see God's hand in the modern-day return of Jews to a biblical homeland were buoyed. But Pope Francis called for the status quo in the city to be respects, and several other Christian denominations were opposed.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Three dozen opponents of Venezuela's socialist government were released from prison and reunited with their families on Sunday as part of a wider Christmas release, a local rights group said.
Lambasted by critics at home and abroad for holding around 270 activists in prison, President Nicolas Maduro's administration said on Saturday it was freeing 80 of them with alternative sentences like community service. 
Thirteen were paraded in front of TV cameras at a meeting with a senior official, Delcy Rodriguez. She harangued them for violence and subversion, but also wished them a happy Christmas. 
Alfredo Romero, whose Penal Forum group tracks the detention of activists and protesters, said 36 ""political prisoners"" had been freed by Sunday morning. But he criticized the government for not giving a blanket amnesty. 
""They should release not just some but all of them, and not imprison any more,"" he said.
The best-known among the released prisoners were former provincial mayor Alfredo Ramos, opposition electoral adviser Roberto Picon and a dozen policemen who worked for the opposition-run Chacao district of Caracas. 
""I'm happy to be free. I'm with my family,"" Ramos was quoted as saying in local media. 
""It was a tough ordeal, very difficult. It was an arbitrary detention, unjust. I didn't commit any crime.""
'CRUEL FARCE'
Maduro, the 55-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez, refutes the term ""political prisoners"", saying all of the jailed activists were there on legitimate charges of plotting to overthrow his government and promoting violence. 
Some 170 people died during two rounds of anti-Maduro street protests in 2014 and earlier this year. 
Opponents say they are fighting for freedom against a ""dictatorship"" that has destroyed the OPEC nation's economy and democracy. Maduro accuses them of being part of a global right-wing plot to topple him in a coup.
U.S. lawmaker Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a fierce critic of both Venezuela and Cuba's Communist government, called the pre-Christmas releases in Venezuela a hypocritical gesture.
""Maduro in Venezuela cynically 'releases' 80 political prisoners who were actually innocent, parades and humiliates several on state TV ... and expects thanks for Christmas 'mercy',"" tweeted the Republican U.S. representative from Florida.
""What a cruel farce.""
Nevertheless, the releases could inject life into stuttering mediation talks between Venezuela's government and opposition due to resume in the Dominican Republic in early January.
The releases ""concretely demonstrate the Revolution and President Nicolas Maduro's firm desire for dialogue,"" Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said. ""Let's hope the opposition knows how to interpret this and isolate its violent factors.""
Venezuela's best-known detained politician is Leopoldo Lopez, who remains under house arrest in Caracas, accused of spearheading violence in 2014.

""Though they have turned his house into a jail, I know his mind is strong and he will keep fighting tirelessly for a better Venezuela,"" said his mother Antonieta Lopez, lamenting he was spending a fourth Christmas detained.

Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said the army attacked first and rebel forces were now pursuing government soldiers towards the town. 
The world's youngest country plunged into war in late 2013 after President Salva Kiir sacked his deputy, Riek Machar. 
The dispute erupted into fighting that spread across the country, largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to Kiir, who is Dinka, and Machar, who is Nuer.

Dozens of Muslims from the village of Kafr al-Waslin attacked the church after Friday prayers, smashing the windows and breaking everything inside, the archdiocese of Atfih said in a statement.
The diocese had applied to legalize the status of the church, which has housed worshippers for 15 years after a church building law was passed in 2016, the statement said.
Those detained are accused of stirring sectarian strife, harming national unity and destroying private property, one judicial source told Reuters. 
The owner of the building was also in custody pending inquiries into the operations of the facility by state security and the interior ministry, the source added.
Egyptian Christians make up about a tenth of the country's almost 95 million population and are the Middle East's largest Christian community.
They have long complained of discrimination in the majority-Muslim country. The government does not make the official number of Christians public in its census and Christians have long complained of being undercounted.

It said their attacks had resulted in the deaths of a number of police and army personnel. 
""Upon raiding the farm, security forces were surprised by gunshots in their direction which were dealt with, resulting in the killing of nine,"" the ministry said.

Gentiloni said Italy's 1,400-strong military presence in Iraq could now be reduced after victories against Islamic militants and instead deployed in the Sahel region of West Africa.
""We have to continue to work, concentrating our attention and energies on the threat of people trafficking and terrorism in the Sahel,"" he said aboard the Italian ship Etna used in the European Union's ""Sophia"" operation to counter people smuggling in the Mediterranean.
""For this reason, part of our forces in Iraq will be deployed to Niger in coming months - this is the proposal the government will make to parliament,"" Gentiloni said.
He did not specify how many people would be sent to Niger. Newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano wrote on Sunday that the contingent would be ""at least 470"" as part of a commitment made to French President Emmanuel Macron.
Macron has thrown his weight behind a French-backed West African force known as the G5 Sahel, which includes the armies of Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad, which was set up in October to tackle Islamist militants.
To give the force a boost, Macron held a Paris summit on Dec. 13 attended by the leaders of the five participating countries, Germany and Italy as well as Saudi and Emirati ministers.

The newspaper said McCabe plans to retire in a few months after he becomes eligible for his full pension, citing ""people familiar with the matter."" The Post reported that McCabe will not become eligible for his full benefits until early March, and that he plans to retire as soon as he does.
A spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment.
Republicans in Congress have criticized McCabe and accused him of harboring bias against Trump. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, told reporters this week that he would like McCabe out of the FBI.
McCabe was interviewed behind closed doors on Tuesday by the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting one of the main congressional investigations into Russia, the 2016 U.S. election and whether Trump's election campaign colluded with Moscow.
He also appeared for a closed-door interview on Thursday with the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees after Republicans asked him to discuss the bureau's handling of a probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.
McCabe served as acting director of the FBI after Trump fired former FBI director James Comey in May. In a tweet in July, Trump asked why his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, did not replace McCabe, who Trump described as Comey's friend. The FBI is part of the Justice Department. Trump tweeted this month that the FBI's reputation ""is in Tatters.""
""FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!"" Trump tweeted on Saturday.
The Republican-led House Judiciary and Oversight committees announced in October they were launching new investigations into a number of long-standing political grievances, including concerns over the FBI's handling of the Clinton email investigation.
Republicans have said they want to get to the bottom of why Comey publicly discussed the Clinton investigation and announced that the bureau would not seek to bring charges.
Critics say the Republicans' focus on Clinton is merely a tactic to distract from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Moscow has denied any such activity, and Trump has dismissed talk of possible collusion as a ""witch hunt"" led by Democrats disappointed about his election victory.

MANILA (Reuters) - Rescuers in the Philippines searched on Sunday for survivors of a storm that triggered floods and landslides and killed about 200 people, left scores missing and thousands homeless, most of whom apparently ignored warnings to move to safety.
Misery in the largely Christian Philippines was compounded by the death of at least 37 people in a shopping mall fire, officials said on Christmas Eve.
The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons a year and warnings are routinely issued, but the level of destruction wreaked by tropical storm Tembin on the southern island of Mindanao from late on Friday came as a surprise. 
""It happened very fast, the flood waters quickly rose filling our house,"" farmer Felipe Ybarsabal, 65, told Reuters by telephone, saying he and his family had to run to higher ground. 
""We weren't able to save anything from the house. There was no help from anyone because it was so fast. Everything was two to three meters under water in less than an hour.""
Police and disaster officials said they expected the toll of about 200 dead to rise with more fatalities likely to be discovered in remote farm communities and coastal areas, as rescuers reached them and restored communication and power links.
Disaster officials said 159 people were listed as missing while about 70,000 had been forced from their homes.
Soldiers and police joined emergency workers and volunteers to search for survivors and victims, clear debris and restore power and communications.
Disaster officials said many villagers had ignored warnings to leave coastal areas and move away from riverbanks, and got swept away when flash floods and landslides struck.
The storm was moving west on Sunday, over some outlying Philippine islands and the South China Sea toward southern Vietnam, at a speed of about 20 kph (12 mph).
It intensified into a typhoon with winds of 120 kph (75 mph) as it moved out of the Philippine area of responsibility, the national meteorological agency said.
FIRE KILLS 37
The United Nations was ready to help the Philippines, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement.
Pope Francis offered his prayers for the people of Mindanao while delivering his weekly blessing to a crowd on St Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) at the Vatican.
""Merciful Lord, take in the souls of the dead and comfort those who are suffering as a result of this calamity,"" he said.
Last week, 46 people were killed in the central Philippines when a typhoon hit. In 2013, super typhoon Haiyan killed nearly 8,000 people and left 200,000 families homeless.
The south of the Philippines has been plagued by insurgencies by communist rebels and Muslim separatists for years, as well as often bearing the brunt of tropical storms roaring in from the Pacific.
The region was hit by another disaster on the weekend when fire swept through a shopping mall in the city of Davao, killing at least 37 people, most of them workers at a call center, city government officials said.
The vice mayor of the southern city of Davao, Paolo Duterte, said the chance of survival for any of the 37 people missing at the NCC Mall was ""zero"".
The fire broke out on Saturday at a furniture shop on the mall's third level and quickly engulfed an outsourcing business on the top floor, said a spokeswoman for the city government, Ma. Teresita Gaspan.
The cause was not known but an investigation was being launched as authorities searched for the bodies of the victims.
President Duterte, and his daughter, Sara Duterte, who is mayor of the city, visited the scene late on Saturday to meet anxious relatives of the missing and survivors.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A referendum in Switzerland to clarify the country's relationship with the European Union would be helpful, Swiss President Doris Leuthard said on Sunday, after ties between the two sides cooled this week.
Switzerland's frictions with the EU, of which it is not a member, arise as Britain negotiates its withdrawal from the bloc following a referendum in June last year and seeks a new trading relationship with its closest neighbors.
Talks on securing a new ""framework"" treaty to govern the Swiss-EU relationship have been underway for some time, with Brussels wanting to replace the more than 100 bilateral accords which regulate its relationship with Bern.
But relations soured this week when the EU granted Swiss stock exchanges only limited access to the bloc, prompting Swiss threats of retaliation for what it called discrimination.
""The bilateral path is important,"" Leuthard told Swiss newspapers Sonntags Blick. ""We therefore have to clarify our relationship with Europe. We have to know in which direction to go.
""Therefore a fundamental referendum would be helpful.""
Talks on the an all-encompassing agreement made headway last month after Switzerland agreed to increase its contribution to the EU's budget.
Such a deal would ensure Switzerland adopts relevant EU laws in return for enhanced access to the bloc's single market, crucial for Swiss exports.
But a deal would be opposed by the anti-EU Swiss People's Party (SVP), currently the biggest group in parliament. 
Leuthard, who steps down as president at the end of the year, said the latest row had not overshadowed her year in the rotating office.
""Of course, the differences with Brussels are now in focus. Here our attitude is clear - for the EU to link such a technical thing like stock exchange equivalency with a political question like the framework treaty, that is not possible,"" 
She said some countries were putting Switzerland in the same category as Britain, while others wanted to strengthen their own financial centers at Switzerland's expense.
""Others think we are cherry pickers who benefit too much from the single European market, they want to increase pressure for a framework agreement,"" Leuthard said.
Pressure from outside would did not contribute to a beneficial climate in Switzerland over a potential agreement, she said.
She said she understood Swiss scepticism towards the EU, but there was no alternative to finding an accommodation with the bloc which generates around two thirds of Swiss trade.

""We can strengthen the cooperation with India and China, but the EU remains central. We need a mechanism and regulated relationship with the EU, that would also prevent political games like we are having at the moment,"" Leuthard said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny cleared the first hurdle on Sunday toward taking part in next year's presidential election, even though the central election commission has previously ruled him ineligible to run.
Navalny, 41, is a fierce opponent of President Vladimir Putin, who is widely expected to win re-election in March, extending his 17 years in power.
On Sunday Navalny, a veteran campaigner against corruption among Russia's elite, won the initial support of 742 people at a gathering in a district of Moscow, above the minimum 500 required to initiate a presidential bid.
""There is no large-scale support for Putin and his rule in this country,"" Navalny told the gathering, describing himself as a ""real candidate"" for the election and threatening a boycott of the vote by his supporters if he is barred from running.
But Navalny now needs to be officially registered as a candidate by Russia's central election commission, which has previously said he is ineligible due to a suspended prison sentence that he says was politically motivated. 
Navalny has been jailed three times this year on charges of repeatedly organizing public meetings and rallies in violation of existing laws. He says the Kremlin is deliberately trying to thwart his political ambitions.
The European Court of Human Rights ruled in October that Navalny's conviction for fraud in 2014 was ""arbitrary"" and ordered Moscow to pay him compensation.
On Saturday Russia's ruling party United Russia pledged ""all possible support"" to the 65-year-old Putin in his bid to win a further six years in power in the March election.
Also on Saturday the Russian Communist Party named its presidential candidate, Pavel Grudinin, 57. The party came second after United Russia in the 2016 parliamentary elections. 
On Sunday Russian property developer Sergei Polonsky, who has been convicted of defrauding investors, also secured enough initial backing to seek clearance from the election commission to take part in the presidential race. 
Others planning to run include television personality Ksenia Sobchak, whose late father was Putin's boss in the early 1990s, journalist Ekaterina Gordon.

China has stepped up research on advanced military equipment as it adopts a more muscular approach to territorial disputes in places such as the disputed South China Sea, rattling nerves in the Asia-Pacific region and the United States.
State television showed live images of the AG600 lifting off from Zhuhai airport in the southern province of Guangdong, which sits on the South China Sea coast.
It returned about an hour later and taxied to its stand accompanied by martial music and greeted by crowds waving Chinese flags.
Xinhua news agency said the aircraft was the ""protector spirit of the sea, islands and reefs"".
It had previously been scheduled to make its first flight earlier this year but it is unclear why it was delayed after ground tests took place in April.
State-owned Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC) [SASADY.UL] has spent almost eight years developing the aircraft, which is roughly the size of a  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 and is designed to carry out marine rescues and battle forest fires.
However, state media has also noted its potential use in the South China Sea, where China, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Brunei all have overlapping claims.
The AG600's chief designer, Huang Lingcai, was quoted in the official China Daily earlier this month as saying it can make round trips without refueling from the southern island province of Hainan to James Shoal, claimed by China but which is located close to Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo.
Powered by four turboprop engines, the AG600 can carry 50 people during maritime search-and-rescue missions, and can scoop up 12 metric tons of water within 20 seconds for fire fighting trips, according to state media.
The aircraft has received 17 orders so far from Chinese government departments and Chinese companies. It has a maximum flight range of 4,500 km (2,800 miles) and a maximum take-off weight of 53.5 tonnes.
It can use conventional airports and also land and take-off from the sea.
China is in the midst of a massive military modernization program, ranging from testing anti-satellite missiles to building stealth fighters and the country's first indigenous aircraft carrier, to add to an existing one bought from Ukraine.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry will visit Addis Ababa next week for talks with his Ethiopian counterpart, a foreign ministry spokesman said, in a bid to end a standoff over a multi-billion dollar dam project on the Nile river.
The dispute, which also involves Sudan, centers on control of a share of the waters of the Nile that stretches 6,695 km (4,184 miles) from Lake Victoria to the Mediterranean and is the economic lifeblood of all three countries.
Cairo says the dam would threaten water supplies that have fed Egypt's agriculture and economy for thousands of years.
Ethiopia says the Grand Renaissance Dam, which it hopes will help make it Africa's largest power exporter, will have no major effect on Egypt. It accuses Cairo of flexing its political muscle to deter financiers from backing other Ethiopian power projects.
Delegations from Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia met in Cairo in November to approve a study by a French firm commissioned to assess the dam's environmental and economic impact.
But negotiations stalled when they failed to agree on the initial report with each blaming others for blocking progress.
Sudan's Irrigation Minister Moataz Moussa said Egypt was unwilling to accept amendments to the report put forward by Khartoum and Addis Ababa.
Sudan and Ethiopia had expressed concern over several points, especially the proposed baseline from which the study would measure the dam's impacts, Moussa said in November.
Another source of disagreement is whether Ethiopia plans to complete construction before negotiations over water flows have finished.
""It's clear they don't want to reach conclusions quickly. We believe they probably want to start filling the dam and complete construction while there are still some ongoing discussions,"" said Mahmoud Abou Zeid, Arab Water Council Chair and former Egyptian irrigation minister.
He said this would violate an agreement signed by all three countries in Khartoum in 2015 meant to ensure diplomatic cooperation and stem fears of a resource conflict.
Cairo fears the 6,000-megawatt dam, being built by Italy's largest construction firm, Salini Impregilo SpA, and due for completion next year, will reduce the flow it depends on for drinking water and irrigation.
Egyptian officials say safeguarding the country's quota of Nile water is a matter of national security.

""No one can touch Egypt's water ... (which) means life or death for a population,"" President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said last month.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2017 03:36AM ET</span>",North Korea says new U.N. sanctions an act of war,"By Ben Blanchard and Hyonhee Shin
BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - The latest U.N. sanctions against North Korea are an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade against it, North Korea's foreign ministry said on Sunday, threatening to punish those who supported the measure.
The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad.
The U.N. resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and, in a last-minute change, demands the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad within 24 months, instead of 12 months as first proposed.
The U.S.-drafted resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Council to further reductions if it were to conduct another nuclear test or launch another ICBM.
In a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, North Korea's foreign ministry said the United States was terrified by its nuclear force and was getting ""more and more frenzied in the moves to impose the harshest-ever sanctions and pressure on our country"".
The new resolution was tantamount to a complete economic blockade of North Korea, the ministry said.
""We define this 'sanctions resolution' rigged up by the U.S. and its followers as a grave infringement upon the sovereignty of our Republic, as an act of war violating peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the region and categorically reject the 'resolution',"" it said.
""There is no more fatal blunder than the miscalculation that the U.S. and its followers could check by already worn-out 'sanctions' the victorious advance of our people who have brilliantly accomplished the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force"", the ministry said.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Nov. 29 declared the nuclear force complete after the test of North Korea's largest-ever ICBM test, which the country said puts all of the United States within range. 
Kim told a meeting of members of the ruling Workers' Party on Friday that the country ""successfully realized the historic cause of completing the state nuclear force"" despite ""short supply in everything and manifold difficulties and ordeals owing to the despicable anti-DPRK moves of the enemies"".
North Korea's official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
South Korea's foreign ministry told Reuters it is aware of the North Korean statement on the new sanctions, again highlighting its position that they are a ""grave warning by the international community that the region has no option but to immediately cease reckless provocations, and take the path of dialogue for denuclearization and peace"".
'BALANCE OF FORCE'
The North Korean foreign ministry said its nuclear weapons were a self-defensive deterrence not in contradiction of international law.
""We will further consolidate our self-defensive nuclear deterrence aimed at fundamentally eradicating the U.S. nuclear threats, blackmail and hostile moves by establishing the practical balance of force with the U.S,"" it said.
""The U.S. should not forget even a second the entity of the DPRK which rapidly emerged as a strategic state capable of posing a substantial nuclear threat to the U.S. mainland,"" it added.
North Korea said those who voted for the sanctions would face its wrath.
""Those countries that raised their hands in favor of this 'sanctions resolution' shall be held completely responsible for all the consequences to be caused by the 'resolution' and we will make sure for ever and ever that they pay heavy price for what they have done.""
The North's old allies China and Russia both supported the latest U.N. sanctions.
Tension has been rising over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House.
In November, North Korea demanded a halt to what it called ""brutal sanctions"", saying a round imposed after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 constituted genocide.
U.S. diplomats have made clear they are seeking a diplomatic solution but proposed the new, tougher sanctions resolution to ratchet up pressure on North Korea's leader.
China, with which North Korea does some 90 percent of its trade, has repeatedly called for calm and restraint from all sides. 
China said on Saturday the new resolution also reiterated the need for a peaceful resolution via talks and that all sides needed to take steps to reduce tensions.
Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said on Saturday the tougher resolution was aimed at preventing war.
It suggested the United States had wanted an even harsher resolution, and noted there was no indication in the resolution that the United Nations could grant the United States permission for military action.

""The difference between the new resolution and the original U.S. proposal reflects the will of China and Russia to prevent war and chaos on the Korean Peninsula. If the U.S. proposals were accepted, only war is foreseeable,"" it said in an editorial.

Some 50,000 people have been arrested since a failed putsch in July last year and about 150,000 have been dismissed or suspended from their posts, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with the movement of U.S-based cleric Fethullah Gulen.
The government accused Gulen of organizing the attempted coup.
Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied the accusation and condemned the coup.
Rights groups and some Western allies fear President Tayyip Erdogan is using the attempted coup as a pretext to stifle dissent.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2017 10:10PM ET</span>","In 'China's Jerusalem', Christians say faith trumps official Sunday School ban","By Christian Shepherd and Stella Qiu
WENZHOU, China (Reuters) - When authorities in China's southeastern city of Wenzhou outlawed Sunday School earlier this year, Christian parents determined their children must still learn about Jesus and the Bible.
Churches in Wenzhou started teaching children in private homes or at other venues. Some billed Sunday School classes as daycare, not education, or moved them to Saturdays, more than a dozen local Christians told Reuters.
Wenzhou, sometimes known as ""China's Jerusalem"" due to its sizable Christian community, is at the forefront of a growing standoff between China's leadership and the country's devout over religious education for children.
The ruling and officially atheist Communist Party has increased efforts to curb the influence of Christianity, tightening restrictions on faith classes and warning against the religion's ""Western"" ideas.
But Christians say the resolve of the community in Wenzhou suggests the party will struggle to exert control over the next generation of the country's 60 million Christians.
In her house, ""faith comes first, grades come second,"" said one parent surnamed Chen, asking not to use her full name due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Immaculately turned out in a cream fur coat and wearing a giant turquoise ring, Chen is one of Wenzhou's numerous wealthy Christians who say their children must attend Bible classes because state education fails to provide sufficient moral and spiritual guidance. 
""Drugs, porn, gambling and violence are serious problems among today's youth and video games are extremely seductive,"" she told Reuters. ""We cannot be by his side all the time so only through faith can we make him understand (the right thing to do)."" 
In some districts of Wenzhou, in Zhejiang province, an official edict has prohibited Sunday Schools since August, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. 
The provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Henan and the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia have barred children from faith activities including summer camp, Christian news site World Watch Monitor reported in September.
Sources spoken to by Reuters were unaware if the policy was a local government initiative or centrally mandated. They also did not know of any similar bans in other regions of China. 
Also in September, new rules were released expanding state oversight of religious education nationwide in what officials say is an attempt to create a new generation of religious leaders loyal to the party.
China's State Administration for Religious Affairs and the foreign affairs office of the Wenzhou city government did not reply to faxed requests for comment. 
EXPLOSION OF BELIEF
In the last four decades of economic prosperity, China's faithful have multiplied rapidly. Official numbers say there are now around 30 million Christians, while independent estimates suggest the number is about 60 million, most of whom are Protestants. 
In Wenzhou, a small Christian community started by 19th century missionaries has bloomed to over one million Christians. Until recent years, they had enjoyed a relatively relaxed relationship with local officials, residents said.
Then, in 2014, a government campaign to demolish ""illegal"" churches and tear down the crosses that adorned them sparked an outcry from the Christian community and sowed mistrust of authorities among believers.
The campaign came shortly after President Xi Jinping, who had been communist party chief of Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007, was appointed General Secretary of the party.
But attempts to stem the rapid growth of believers has struggled in Wenzhou where churches, often funded by devout local business owners, are ubiquitous.
""Wenzhou government does not let churches register, because there are way too many, so there are lots of house churches and it is tough for the government to manage them,"" Zhao Gang, the minister at Wenzhou's Church of the Rose-tinted Clouds, told Reuters. 
Sunday School textbooks have been especially sensitive in the clampdown in Wenzhou, teachers said. The government restricts religious publications, and churches often use translated texts from overseas.
One teacher said classes resumed when they stopped using unsanctioned textbooks and avoided the words ""Sunday School"". 
FREEDOM FOR ALL
Chinese law officially grants religious freedom for all, including children, but regulations on education and protection of minors also say religion cannot be used to hinder state education or to ""coerce"" children to believe.
Local governments in troubled areas of China, such as the far western region of Xinjiang, ban children attending religious events, but Christian communities elsewhere rarely face blanket restrictions.
This year, the party has been unusually strict in warning university students, state-owned enterprise employees and officials themselves against celebrating Christmas, with admonitions such as to ""resist the corrosion of Western religious culture"", according to state media reports.
While parents in Wenzhou want to control their children's education, the government is working to create a new crop of religious leaders loyal to the party.
New rules governing religious schools from China's cabinet, due to take effect in February, are necessary to meet China's ""pressing need"" for patriotic religious leaders, Wang Zuoan, the head of China's official State Administration of Religious Affairs, told Reuters in written comments in October.
""We hope that the talent graduating from religious schools will be up to standard in both their political and religious character and will do a good job of combining love for the country with love for religion,"" he said.
But for many Christians allowing the party to control religious education is unacceptable, as it requires putting the party before God, according to Sarah Cook, a New York-based analyst at Freedom House, an advocacy group.
As such, the party can only do so much to control faith education.
""There are always going to be kids at home whose bedtimes stories are from the Bible,"" Cook said. 
For Chen in Wenzhou, faith should be at the forefront of education until believers outnumber atheists in China's young.

""There will definitely be more Christian believers in the next generation,"" she said. ""The ability for the Christian faith to be inherited and passed on is ever growing.""

830,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2017 10:00PM ET</span>","Peru's Fujimori taken to hospital from prison, life at risk: doctor","LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's former President Alberto Fujimori was rushed from prison to a local hospital by ambulance late on Saturday after suffering a severe drop in blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythm that put him at risk of dying, Fujimori's doctor said.
Cardiologists recommended that he be removed from prison immediately, Alejandro Aguinaga said. ""It looks complicated,"" he told journalists gathered outside the hospital.
Fujimori, 79, is serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes. He is a deeply divisive figure in Peru. While many consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending an economic crisis and bloody leftist insurgency during his 1990-2000 term.
The medical emergency will likely heap pressure on center-right President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to free the former leader, a move that could rewrite political alliances and spark protests in one of Latin America's most stable economies.
Three days earlier, a faction of Fujimori's supporters in Congress unexpectedly saved Kuczynski from a motion that would have forced him from office less than two years into his five-year-term.
The opposition said Kuczynski only survived the vote by promising 10 lawmakers that he would free Fujimori if they backed him. Kuczynski's government denies the allegations.
Fujimori fled Peru for his parent's native Japan as his government imploded in a graft scandal at the turn of the century. He was eventually extradited to Peru and was convicted for leading death squads that massacred civilians.
Despite Fujimori's downfall, the rightwing populist movement Fujimori started in the 1990s remains one of the country's most potent political forces.
His two adult children, Keiko and Kenji, lead rival factions of the rightwing party, Popular Force, that controls a majority of seats in Congress and pushed to oust Kuczynski this week.
Over the past year, Kenji has challenged his sister Keiko's leadership and he has led calls for his release, which could give him a boost if he is freed.
TV images showed Kenji, who led the faction that backed Kuczynski, riding in the ambulance that drove Fujimori to the Peruvian-Japanese Centenario Clinic for treatment.
""If a (presidential) pardon happens now, it's because there was a pact,"" Congresswoman Marisa Glave said on Twitter. ""A pardon can't be decided in an under-the-table deal.""
Glave is one of about 10 leftist lawmakers who - despite criticizing Kuczynski as a lobbyist - opted not to support the bid to oust him out of fear it would empower Popular Force.
Fujimori's well-organized foes were key to Kuczynski's razor-thin victory over Keiko in last year's presidential election, and to keeping Keiko's followers from ousting him this week.
Fujimori's supporters dismissed suggestions that his health troubles were a ruse to pave the way for a pardon.

""There's no circus,"" Luisa Maria Cuculiza, a former ruling party lawmaker during his government, said on local broadcaster RPP.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's leftist government prepared to release some 80 jailed anti-government activists on Saturday, and threatened to expel envoys from Canada and Brazil after criticism over rights. 
Delcy Rodriguez, head of the pro-government Constituent Assembly, told reporters the legislative superbody was recommending the detainees be given alternative punishments such as community service and compensation for victims.
Thirteen activists were later paraded in front of state TV cameras during a meeting with Rodriguez, a hardline ally of President Nicolas Maduro. They looked stony-faced as they sat listening to her admonishments in the formal surroundings of Venezuela's colonial-era foreign ministry.
Rights groups and foes of Maduro say authorities are unfairly holding 268 political prisoners for protesting against ""dictatorship."" Maduro, the 55-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez, says all jailed activists are there on legitimate charges of violence and subversion. 
""Let it be understood that the events promoted by the extremist Venezuelan opposition, which caused Venezuelans' deaths, must not be repeated,"" Rodriguez said.
Some 170 people died in violence around two bouts of anti-Maduro street protests in 2014 and earlier this year. 
The assembly president told the detainees at the meeting they would return to their detention centers for medical tests then be freed to spend Christmas with loved ones. 
CANADA AND BRAZIL ANGERED
The releases, albeit with alternative sentences, could inject life into stuttering political talks between the government and opposition due to resume in the Dominican Republic in early January.
Western nations and Latin American neighbors have been increasingly critical of Maduro this year, accusing him of stamping on democracy and human rights. The government says foreign nations are trying to encourage a right-wing coup.
Rodriguez said the Constituent Assembly - which various foreign countries refuse to accept - was also recommending Brazil's ambassador Ruy Pereira and Canada's charge d'affaires Craig Kowalik both be declared ""persona non grata.""
The Canadian government, which has imposed sanctions on Maduro's administration, said it would not be cowed into easing pressure on ""the anti-democratic Maduro regime"" in Venezuela.
""Canadians will not stand by silently as the Government of Venezuela robs its people of their fundamental democratic and human rights, and denies them access to basic humanitarian needs,"" said Global Affairs Canada, the government department that manages its foreign and trade relations.
Brazil's foreign ministry also responded sternly.
""If confirmed, the Venezuelan government's decision to declare Brazil's ambassador persona non grata shows once more the authoritarian stance of Nicolas Maduro's administration and its lack of willingness to engage in any dialogue,"" it said, promising reciprocal measures.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been especially critical of Maduro, also imposing sanctions on him and other senior Venezuelan officials this year.
Under new stewardship with the arrival of charge d'affaires Todd Robinson last week, Washington's embassy in Caracas called on Saturday for the freedom of all jailed activists.

""We urge Maduro's regime to respect human rights,"" it tweeted. ""Free them during this holiday time.""

When he was foreign minister, Kurz, a conservative now governing in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party, was a strong critic of Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open Germany's borders to more than a million fleeing migrants in 2015.
Since becoming Chancellor this week, he has aligned himself with central European neighbors like Hungary and the Czech Republic in opposing German-backed proposals to distribute asylum seekers around EU member states.
""Forcing states to take refugees doesn't take Europe any further. The discussion makes no sense,"" he told Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper. ""Migrants who set off for Europe don't want to go to Bulgaria or Hungary. They want to go to Germany, Austria or Sweden.""
Instead of doubling down on what he termed a ""failed"" policy, Kurz called for the EU to support, ""perhaps militarily"", efforts to help migrants in their countries of origin or in neighboring states.
""If that isn't possible, then they should be helped in safe areas on their own continent,"" he said. ""The EU should support that, perhaps even organize it, and back it militarily.""
It was not clear from the interview extracts, published by the newspaper, what kind of military support he envisaged.
But European leaders have on occasion suggested the EU contribute to peacekeeping operations to stabilize conflicts in Africa.
The question of how to deal with streams of migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa also divides Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) as they prepare for talks on forming a new government.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Myanmar military, which has been accused of ethnic cleansing against the country's Muslim Rohingya minority, has been invited back as an observer in a major multinational military exercise next year led by the United States and Thailand.        
Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, told Reuters that Thailand had invited Myanmar to take part in the annual Cobra Gold exercise, which involves thousands of U.S and Thai military personnel and participants from other Asian countries. 
Myanmar had been invited to observe the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief portion of the exercise, Logan said. 
A senior officer at the Directorate of Joint Intelligence of the Royal Thai Armed Forces told Reuters it was unclear whether Myanmar had accepted the invitation but Thailand was eager for them to join.
Asked why Thailand decided to invite Myanmar despite concerns over the crackdown against the Rohingya and whether this issue was part of their deliberations, the official said: “That never came up in the discussions. We separated that issue (the Rohingya). We focus on training, on education, on military cooperation. That is our wish, to have Myanmar involved.""
“That is politics. We are soldiers. This is a military exercise,” added the official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
The Myanmar military did not respond to several requests for comment.
When asked whether the U.S. military had attempted to apply pressure on Thailand not to invite Myanmar because of the international condemnation of its crackdown, the Pentagon declined to comment on internal deliberations.     
Myanmar's military cracked down on Muslim Rohingya from Rakhine state following Rohingya militant attacks on an army base and police posts in August. The crackdown has caused around 650,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh in recent months. 
The United States and the United Nations have described the campaign as ethnic cleansing of the stateless Rohingya people. 
The Myanmar military has said its own internal investigation had exonerated security forces of all accusations of atrocities in Rakhine.   
But earlier this week, the United States imposed sanctions on 13 ""serious human rights abusers and corrupt actors"" including Myanmar general Maung Maung Soe, who oversaw the crackdown against the Rohingya. 
Zachary Abuza, a professor at the U.S. National War College, said inviting Myanmar to the exercise was “outrageous” and sent the wrong message.
""To invite them after what the U.S. government has labeled ethnic cleansing, when the Treasury Department just yesterday designated the commander for these egregious violations of human rights, just seems wrong, and that is putting it too mildly,"" said Abuza, who focuses on Southeast Asia and security issues, including human rights.
In the 2017 Cobra Gold exercise, 29 nations either participated or observed the exercise, including Myanmar. It included about 3,600 U.S. personnel. Cobra Gold is an annual exercise in Thailand. The 2018 war games are expected to be held in February.
The United States and Thailand have carried out joint war games for decades, even though Bangkok's record on human rights and democracy has often been criticized in Washington.
The U.S.-Thai relationship cooled when the Thai military took power in a 2014 coup but has improved under President Donald Trump.
Two Reuters journalists were arrested in Myanmar on Dec. 12 and on Thursday appeared in court and have been remanded in custody.

Reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have been in detention for nine days with no detail on where they are being held. They have not had access to visitors or lawyers.

The men - described by police as tourists - were taken into custody on Friday, as Israel confronted a weekly surge in protests against U.S. President Donald Trump's Dec. 6 recognition of Jerusalem as its capital.
Bystander video appeared to show Israeli police detaining several fez-wearing men and boys in the walled Old City of East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and which Palestinians want as capital of their own future state.
Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the three Turks had tried to reach Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-most important shrine, where ""they planned on taking part in a demonstration"".
Jews revere the site as the vestige of their two ancient temples, and sometimes visit under the protection of Israeli police who also guard the compound entrances - a presence resented by many Palestinians.
Rosenfeld said the three Turks ""carried out an assault on police officers there"". He did not elaborate on the circumstances, other than to say there were no casualties. 
Brought before Jerusalem Magistrate's Court on Saturday, the men did not speak from the dock. Two of them flashed four-finger hand gestures that appeared to be the so-called ""Rabia sign"" of solidarity with Egypt's ousted Muslim Brotherhood. 
The Turks' Israeli defense lawyer, Nick Kaufman, said police asked the court to keep them in custody so charges of assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest could be brought.
""It was obvious that this was a politically charged case and the judge rightly released them,"" Kaufman told Reuters.

The U.S. State Department said on Friday the United States would provide Ukraine with ""enhanced defensive capabilities"" as Kiev battles Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.
U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the weapons included Javelin anti-tank missiles. Washington has argued in the past that such weapons would help stabilize the situation and cannot effectively be used to take territory. 
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Saturday the weapons would be used to protect Ukrainian soldiers and civilians.
Supplies of any weapons now encourage those who support the conflict in Ukraine to use the ""force scenario,"" Russia's RIA state news agency cited Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin as saying on Saturday.
Franz Klintsevich, a member of the upper house of the Russian parliament's security committee, said Kiev would consider arms supplies as support of its actions, Interfax news agency reported.
""Americans, in fact, directly push Ukrainian forces to war,"" Klintsevich said.
Since Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine and Russia have been at loggerheads over a war in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces that has killed more than 10,000 people in three years.
Poroshenko said in his Facebook post that he had confirmed the weapons deal with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, calling it ""a transatlantic vaccination against the Russian virus of aggression.""
""American weapons in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers are not for offensive, but for stronger rebuff of the aggressor, protection of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, as well as for effective self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter,"" Poroshenko said. 
Kiev accuses Moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region, which Russia denies.
The Russian foreign ministry said the U.S. decision once again undermines the Minsk agreements, TASS state news agency reported on Saturday.

The agreements, intended to end the fighting in Ukraine, were signed by Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France in the Belarussian capital in early 2015.

Jose Chlimper, secretary general of the right-wing Popular Force, said his party could eventually emerge stronger from this week's political crisis, despite failing to garner enough votes in the 130-member Congress to remove Kuczynski from office.
""For us having 71 lawmakers was an asset but also a liability. Because whatever Congress did was our fault,"" Chlimper told Reuters in a rare interview.
The party, which grew out of the populist movement of imprisoned ex-president Alberto Fujimori, sought to remove Kuczynski from office this week over business links he once denied having to a company at the center of a massive graft scandal.
Ten Popular Force lawmakers broke ranks to keep a ""presidential vacancy"" motion from succeeding.
Chlimper called the defections a painful ""betrayal"" but said the rest of Popular Force lawmakers have reaffirmed their commitment to staying in the party and voting as a bloc.
Kuczynski, on the other hand, could see the cross-party alliance that defended him this week evaporate going forward, said Chlimper. ""I don't see how he can come out stronger,"" he said.
Chlimper said Kuczynski lured the rebel Popular Force lawmakers with a promise to free their movement's political leader, Fujimori, from prison - an accusation denied by Kuczynski's government.
The dissident faction was led by Fujimori's youngest son, Kenji, who has challenged his sister Keiko's leadership of their father's following and who could receive a boost if the once-popular patriarch is released from prison.
Kuczynski would lose the support of Fujimori's left-leaning foes if he makes good on the deal to secure the elder Fujimori's release, said Chlimper.
""In coming days, the left may have achieved what Fujimori's supporters have been unable to: a pardon for Fujimori,"" Chlimper said.
At the same time, ongoing probes in Congress and in the attorney general's and comptroller's offices threaten to implicate Kuczynski in new allegations of wrongdoing, he added.
""His allies are going to have to explain themselves for the documents that will keep coming out,"" said Chlimper.
""This isn't a picture. It's a video. And we're going to keep seeing the scenery change in coming weeks and months,"" Chlimper said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Dozens of people gathered outside Beirut's national museum on Saturday evening to light candles for a British woman and three Arab women murdered in the past week in Lebanon. 
The killing of the British embassy worker Rebecca Dykes last week has sparked extensive media coverage in Lebanon, prompting activists to press for more attention to be given to widespread violence against women. 
Lebanese women's rights activists held the vigil to mourn the victims, demand better laws, and to protest against the violence - including the three reported murders in northern Lebanon alone over the past week. 
""Society refuses to listen to us or see us until our blood is spilled,"" Leen Hashem, an organizer, told the crowd from the steps of the museum. ""This violence is structural and systematic.""
""Justice is not only arresting the criminal. Justice is for all this not to happen to us in the first place,"" she said. 
""Don't tell me to cover up. Tell him not to rape me,"" one woman chanted through a megaphone, a demand repeated by people in the crowd. 
Participants laid white roses over pictures of the four women, and lined the steps with candles. 
Wafaa al-Kabbout stood on the sidelines, holding a framed photo of her 21-year-old daughter Zahraa, whose ex-husband shot her dead last year. ""Now my daughter is gone, she's not coming back,"" she said. ""But all these young women are our daughters. And there is still fear for the young women after them.""
""BEHIND CLOSED DOORS""
The United Nations says a third of women worldwide have suffered sexual or physical violence.
A 2017 national study by the Beirut-based women's rights group ABAAD said that one in four women have been raped in Lebanon. Less than a quarter of women who faced sexual assault reported it, the survey said. 
""Little by little, we are breaking the silence ... for women to come forward and talk about the violence they are facing,"" said Saja Michael, program manager at ABAAD. 
In the past five years, women have become more likely to report violence and seek help, she said, though sexual assault remains a bit more taboo. Part of the reason is that NGOs have set up new shelters and community centers, with psychological, legal, medical, and other services, Michael added.
""It's becoming more of a public discourse,"" she said. ""It's no longer what's happening behind closed doors.""
Lebanon's parliament passed a long-awaited law in 2014 that penalized domestic violence for the first time. But rights groups were outraged that authorities watered it down, and it fell short of criminalizing marital rape. 
Child marriage also remains legal in Lebanon. In August, parliament abolished a law that absolved rapists if they married their victims, joining other Arab states that repealed similar laws this year. Activists welcomed it as a major step, but said there was a long way to go on Lebanese legislation to protect women.
""ANY ONE OF US""
""Every day we are subjected to harassment, in college, on the street, everywhere,"" said Ramona Abdallah, a university student at the vigil. ""It really could be any one of us.""
Rebecca Dykes, 30, who worked at the British embassy in Lebanon, was found strangled beside a highway outside Beirut last weekend. A Lebanese Uber driver picked her up before assaulting and killing her, state media said. A security official said the suspect had confessed. 
Earlier in the same week, a Lebanese man killed his mother-in-law and wounded his wife by shooting them inside their home in the northern Akkar region, state news agency NNA said. Authorities have arrested him, it said. 
In another incident, Nazira al-Tartousi, a 15-year-old pregnant Syrian, was found dead with a bullet in her neck in the north, security sources said. Her husband, the suspect, has denied killing her, they said.

And Yaman Darwish, 22, died after sustaining a broken chin and gunshot wounds in another northern village, the security sources said. The investigation showed the Lebanese woman had also been hit on the head with a vase, and choked.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling Democratic Party (PD), hit by internal divisions and a banking scandal, is continuing to slide in opinion polls, with a new survey on Saturday putting it more than six points behind the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
The survey by the Ixe agency, commissioned by Huffington Post Italia, comes just days before parliament is expected to be dissolved to make way for elections in March.
It gives the center-left PD just 22.8 percent of voter support, down almost five points in the last two months, compared with 29.0 percent for 5-Star, which has gained almost two points in the same period.
Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!) is given 16.2 percent, with its right-wing allies the Northern League and Brothers of Italy on 12.1 percent and 5.0 percent respectively.
This bloc is expected to win most seats at the election but not enough for an absolute majority, resulting in a hung parliament.
With the PD's support eroding in virtually all opinion polls, several political commentators have speculated that its leader Matteo Renzi may choose or be forced to announce he will not be the party's candidate for prime minister at the election.
Renzi has given no indication so far he will take this step.
The PD has split under his leadership, with critics complaining he has dragged the traditionally center-left party to the right. 
Breakaway groups united this month to form a new left-wing party called Free and Equal (LeU), which now has 7.3 percent of support, according to Ixe.
The PD's popularity seems to have also been hurt by a parliamentary commission looking into the collapse of 10 Italian banks in the past two years. 

The commission's findings have put the PD on the defensive, allowing the opposition to claim a conflict of interest involving one of Renzi's closest allies who was active in trying to save a bank where her father was a board member.

Gruevski, 47, resigned earlier this month following an election defeat last year and unrest that rocked the small Balkan country in April. 
In his speech to the party's convention on Saturday, Gruevski said that a key reason for VMRO-DPMNE's fall from power was his refusal to yield to what he described as international and domestic pressure to accept a compromise in a dispute with Greece. 
Macedonia, which won independence in 1991 from then-federal Yugoslavia, has made little progress towards EU and NATO membership due to a long-running dispute with Greece which claims Macedonia's name represents a territorial claim to its province with the same name. 
""We wanted a fair compromise and a name solution, but not under dictate,"" Gruevski said.
Gruevski's successor Mickoski, 41, a relative novice in politics, became VMRO-DPMNE Secretary General earlier this year.
He served in Gruevski's government as the general manager of ELEM, Macedonia’s state-owned power plants managing company.

840,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2017 01:10PM ET</span>","Mexico murders hit record high, dealing blow to president","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has this year registered its highest murder total since modern records began, according to official data, dealing a fresh blow to President Enrique Pena Nieto's pledge to get gang violence under control with presidential elections due in 2018.
A total of 23,101 murder investigations were opened in the first 11 months of this year, surpassing the 22,409 registered in the whole of 2011, figures published on Friday night by the interior ministry showed. The figures go back to 1997.
Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 pledging to tame the violence that escalated under his predecessor Felipe Calderon. He managed to reduce the murder tally during the first two years of his term, but since then it has risen steadily.
At 18.7 per 100,000 inhabitants, the 2017 Mexican murder rate is still lower than it was in 2011, when it reached almost 19.4 per 100,000, the data showed. The rate has also held below levels reported in several other Latin American countries.
According to U.N. figures used in the World Bank's online database, Brazil and Colombia both had a murder rate of 27 per 100,000, Venezuela 57, Honduras 64 and El Salvador 109 in 2015, the last year for which data are available.
The U.S. rate was 5 per 100,000.
Still, Pena Nieto's failure to contain the killings has damaged his credibility and hurt his centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which faces an uphill struggle to hold onto power in the July 2018 presidential election.
The current front-runner in the race, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has floated exploring an amnesty with criminal gangs to reduce the violence, without fleshing out the idea.
Mexican newspaper Reforma said on Saturday that after a campaign stop in the central state of Hidalgo on Friday, Lopez Obrador again addressed the issue when asked whether talks aimed at stopping the violence could include criminal gangs.
""There can be dialogue with everyone. There needs to be dialogue and there needs to be a push to end the war and guarantee peace. Things can't go on as before,"" Reforma quoted Lopez Obrador as saying.
Such a strategy harbors risks for the former Mexico City mayor.
A poll this month showed that two-thirds of Mexicans reject offering an amnesty to members of criminal gangs in a bid to curb violence, with less than a quarter in favor.
The law bars Pena Nieto from seeking re-election.

France has been seeking to eventually withdraw from the poorly policed scrublands of the Sahel region - which abuts the Sahara to the north and has become a recruiting and training ground for Islamist militants - with the help of a new regional African force. 
The G5 Sahel, which began official operations in November, is made up of troops from Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania that will patrol the region in collaboration with 4,000 French troops deployed there since intervening in 2013 to quell an insurgency in northern Mali.
But Macron said on a visit to the Niger capital Niamey that the Sahel would remain a focus for the French army, should it be required in the future. 
""France is ready, not only to maintain, but if necessary to strengthen its engagement in the region because the fight against terrorism in the Sahel is essential, in my opinion,"" he said during a joint news conference with his Nigerien counterpart Mahamoudou Issoufou.
""The fight is not won today ... it is essential not only to maintain but to further improve our agility on the ground, to innovate more and to focus our priorities on the regions identified as the most vulnerable,"" he added.
Speaking during his visit to Niger, Macron also announced an additional 10 million euros to help educate girls, one of the priorities promoted by President Issoufou to curb migration.
This sum is on top of 15 million euros already invested by France to help education in Niger. Paris pledged in mid-December to spend 400 million euros over 2017-2021 to support Niamey.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Catalonia's separatist leader Carles Puigdemont called on Spain's government on Saturday to allow him to return home in time for the opening session of the Catalan parliament so that he can become the region's next president.
Puigdemont, who ruled in Catalonia until October and faces arrest in Spain for his role in organizing an illegal referendum on independence and proclaiming a Catalan republic, is currently in self-imposed exile in Belgium.
Separatist parties secured a parliamentary majority in a regional election on Thursday, though it is still unclear whether Puigdemont and other jailed leaders of the movement will be able to attend assembly sessions. 
""I want to come back to Catalonia as soon as possible. I would like to come back right now. It would be good news for Spain,"" Puigdemont told Reuters in an interview.
Asked if he would be back in time for the opening session which has to take place at the latest on January 23, he said: ""It would be natural. If I am not allowed to be sworn in as president, it would be a major abnormality for the Spanish democratic system.""
""I am the president of the regional government and I will remain the president if the Spanish state respects the results of the vote,"" he also said.
Puigdemont, who has called for dialogue with the Spanish government to resolve the current tensions between the turbulent region and the authorities in Madrid, said he was ready to listen to any proposal from Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy even if this offer fell short of an offer of independence.
""If the Spanish state has a proposal for Catalonia, we should listen,"" Puigdemont said, asking for a dialogue of equals.
Rajoy on Friday said he was open to dialogue but implicitly rejected Puigdemont's demand to meet soon, saying he would talk with whoever was Catalonia's president only once they have been elected by the new regional parliament. 
Before that, his first interlocutor should be Ines Arrimadas, whose centrist, anti-independence party scored most votes on Thursday, he said. Arrimadas does not have enough seats or allies to form a government, while separatist parties put together have a narrow majority.
Past calls for dialogue on both the separatist and unionist side in the past have failed to yield concrete results and the crisis is likely to keep haunting Madrid, as well as EU leaders, for a long time.

Negotiations to form a government in Catalonia are likely to open after Jan. 6 following the holiday break. Parliament must vote by Feb. 8 on putting a new government into place.

Political violence spiked in the Central African oil producer after a contested presidential election in April 2016 was won by President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who has ruled for 33 of the last 38 years.
A militia led by Frederic Bintsamou, better known as Pastor Ntumi, which fought Sassou Nguesso during and after a 1997 civil war, has been blamed by the government for deadly raids on police, military and government bases, and has also halted trade through the Pool region with blockades.
In return, the government has bombed the Pool region, including one helicopter raid last year on a residential area that Amnesty International said killed at least 30 people.
The unrest has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes and sparked allegations from human rights groups of abuse by government troops.
Ntumi's so-called Ninja rebels have clashed with the Congo government since 2002 and have long sought an end to government military intervention in the Pool region.
The peace agreement between the two sides was signed by Interior Ministry security advisor François Ndé and Pastor Ntumi's representative, Jean Gustave Ntondo. 
""Today is a great day for the Congolese. This is the day we have just signed the cessation of hostilities agreement,"" said Ntondo. 
Under the deal, the militias have agreed to hand over arms and allow the free movement of trade between the capital Brazzaville and the commercial hub of Pointe Noire. During hostilities, trains and cars were often halted by militias. 
The government will oversee a commission that will monitor the peace, and loosen security in the region to allow people to travel to and from their family homes.

Putin, 65, said earlier this month he would run for re-election as a self-nominated candidate, in a contest he seems sure to win comfortably, extending his grip on power into a third decade.
Speaking at an annual gathering of United Russia, Medvedev said the party was Putin's party, and his key political resource.

The appointments paved the way for the two to ascend to similar positions in government, officials said.
Mnangagwa, who took over last month from 93-year-old Robert Mugabe after the intervention of the military, is under pressure from opposition parties and the public to implement political reforms. 
Under Mugabe's 37-year rule political space was limited, with the latter part of his reign marked by the emergence of a ZANU-PF faction aligned to his wife Grace that threatened to usurp the army's central role in government.
Chiwenga, who retired from the army on Monday, is the latest in a string of senior military figures appointed by Mnangagwa to important political posts.

While coast of the south of the peninsula is peppered with Red Sea tourist resorts, North Sinai province is underdeveloped and lacks basic infrastructure and job opportunities. 
Security forces have battled Islamist militants in the mainly desert region, stretching from the Suez Canal eastwards to the Gaza Strip and Israel, since 2013. Militants have killed hundreds of police and soldiers. 
Sisi ordered armed forces to end the insurgency within three months after an attack on a mosque in North Sinai last month killed more than 300 people. It was the worst militant attack in Egypt's modern history.
""We have entrusted the ministry of housing and the engineering authority with a national project of comprehensive urban planning,"" Sisi said at a ceremony to inaugurate a development project in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia.

Reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have been in detention for 11 days in an undisclosed location and have had no access to their families, lawyers or colleagues.
They were arrested after being invited to meet police officials over dinner on the outskirts of Myanmar's largest city, Yangon on Dec. 12. The authorities are investigating whether they violated the country's colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which has a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
""After the first remand (expires), they will be able to meet their families. They will be sent to the court for testimonies,"" Tin Myint, permanent secretary of Ministry of Home Affairs, was quoted as saying by Radio Free Asia. 
In Myanmar, those remanded must be brought to court within 14 days. But it's not immediately clear when the pair was first remanded and whether the authorities will seek court approval to remand them for a second 14-day period. 
The Home Affairs Ministry did not responded to several requests for comments. 
Family members of the two journalists say they have not received any official communication about the question of remand or the investigation, and neither has Reuters. 
Tin Myint said the case against the two Reuters reporters will be ""transparent"" and the authorities will follow the rule of law, according to Daily Eleven newspaper. 
Major governments, including the United States, Britain and Canada, leading international political figures and top United Nations officials are among those who have demanded the release of the Reuters reporters.
The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.
A spokesman for Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week told Reuters that the police had almost completed their investigation and the two reporters will be treated in line with the law.

UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahayan retweeted last week accusations that Ottoman forces led by Fakhreddin Pasha stole money and manuscripts from Medina in 1916 during World War One when the city was under Ottoman rule.
Medina is now part of Saudi Arabia.
The mayor of the Turkish capital Ankara ordered preparations to change the name of the street where the UAE mission is located to that of the former commander and one-time governor of Medina, Anadolu said.
Without naming him, Erdogan suggested on Thursday that the UAE minister was ignorant. The UAE charge d'affaires in Ankara was also summoned to the Foreign Ministry over the issue.
UAE officials had no immediate comment on dispute.
The UAE, a close U.S. ally, sees Erdogan's Islamist-rooted ruling party as a friend of Islamist forces which the UAE opposes across the Arab world.
Ties were further strained by Ankara's support for Qatar after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on the Gulf nation in June over a dispute in which the Arab states accused Doha of supporting terrorism. Doha denies this.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's upper house Senate on Saturday gave parliament's final approval to the government's 2018 budget, clearing the way for national elections expected to be held in March.
The financial law, which had already passed in the Chamber of Deputies, aims to lower next year's fiscal deficit to 1.6 percent of gross domestic product from a targeted 2.1 percent this year.
It also introduces a ""web tax"" from 2019, obliging companies to pay a three percent levy on some Internet transactions.
The Senate passed the package in a vote of confidence by 140 votes to 97. Confidence votes allow the government to speed up legislation by curtailing debate on proposed amendments. 
If the government loses such a vote it has to resign, but with elections in any case imminent no parties had any real interest in scuppering the budget and bringing down Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni's administration.
President Sergio Mattarella is expected to dissolve parliament before the end of the year, after which the government will set the date of the election. Politicians often tout March 4 as the most likely date.
The European Commission says the budget may break EU rules because it raises previously agreed deficit targets and does too little to rein in Italy's huge public debt. 
At just over 130 percent of national output, Italy's debt is the highest in the euro zone after that of Greece.
Brussels will issue a final verdict on the budget in the spring, after the Italian election which opinion polls suggest will produce a hung parliament.
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement leads in the polls, with around 28 percent of the vote, but a center-right coalition of parties is seen winning most seats in parliament. The ruling Democratic Party has been hit by internal divisions and lags 5-Star by around four points in most polls.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A record crowd paid their respects to Japan's 84-year-old Emperor Akihito at Tokyo's Imperial Palace on Saturday, in his first birthday celebration since the date of his abdication was set.
The emperor's birthday is traditionally marked by a national holiday and an address at the Imperial Palace, which opens to the public on the day.
Well-wishers waved small Japanese flags and held up smartphones as Emperor Akihito, whose position is ceremonial with no political power, addressed them from a balcony, flanked by his wife and other members of the imperial family.
The crowd of 52,300, according to the Imperial Household Agency, was the largest birthday attendance during Akihito's symbolic 29-year reign, known as the ""Heisei"" era, which means ""achieving peace"" in Japanese.
""On this day as we face the cold, my thoughts go out to those who suffered from typhoons and heavy rains, as well as the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake who continue to lead difficult lives,"" he said, referring to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed and displaced tens of thousands on the country's eastern seaboard.
Along with Empress Michiko, Akihito has spent much of his reign addressing the legacy of World War Two, which was fought in the name of his father, Hirohito, and consoling victims of disasters such as the 2011 earthquake. 
Earlier this month, a 10-member Imperial Household Council agreed that Akihito would step down on April 30, 2019, before passing the Chrysanthemum Throne to his eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito.
In comments made to media, Akihito said he would use the remaining days of his reign to carry out his duties and prepare to ""pass the torch to the next era.""
Akihito has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer and said last year that he feared he would struggle to fulfill his royal duties due to his age.
Japan passed a law this year allowing him to step down in a one-off provision as existing law did not provide for abdication.
The last time a Japanese emperor abdicated was in 1817.

Throughout his reign, Akihito has consistently urged the Japanese never to forget the horrors of war. His conciliatory remarks contrast with gestures made by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has adopted a less apologetic tone over Japan's past military aggression.

The Thursday incident was the second serious vehicle attack in Australia's second biggest city this year.
Police said they had charged the man, former Afghanistan refugee Saeed Noori, after formally interviewing him about the attack that police had earlier described as a ""deliberate act"".
Police have said Noori, 32, is known to have mental health problems and to use drugs and they did not believe the attack was terrorism-related.
Police suspect Noori was behind the wheel of a white SUV when he deliberately sped up and drove into dozens of pedestrians crossing the road at one of the busiest intersections in Melbourne's central business district.
Noori appeared in the Magistrates Court later on Saturday where he was remanded in custody. He will next appear in court on Wednesday. The court also ordered that Noori be assessed by psychologists.
Islamist militants have used vehicles to attack people several times in Europe and the United States over the past couple of years.
In January, six people were killed in Melbourne's central business district when a man used his vehicle to mow them down. Police also ruled out terrorism for that attack.
Following the January incident, authorities installed 140 concrete bollards in the city center.
Victoria State premier Daniel Andrews said 12 people remained in hospital, including three who in critical condition.
He said there would be an increased police presence at Melbourne events, including the Boxing Day Test Cricket, carols and other major sports events.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 11:20PM ET</span>","German conservatives eye 65,000 cap on migrants","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany should cap the number of new immigrants to around 65,000 a year, the deputy leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives said, a position that could prove divisive in coalition talks with the Social Democrats (SPD).
Merkel is trying to forge a new governing coalition with the SPD after talks with two smaller parties collapsed last month. Exploratory talks are due to begin on Jan. 7, and Merkel hopes to reach a deal by mid-January.
Merkel has blamed Sept. 24 election losses on public concern at her 2015 decision to allow in over a million migrants, and now favors a tougher stance on deporting migrants accused of crimes.
Thomas Strobl, deputy leader of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), told the Heilbronner Stimme newspaper there could be no repeat of that wave of migrants and Germany needed to return to more ""normal"" numbers, below the limit of 200,000 that the CDU agreed with its Bavarian sister party in October.
""I'm not thinking of the much-discussed 200,000 per year,"" Strobl said in an interview published on Saturday. 
""The target should be the number from the year 2012 when 65,000 refugees came.""
The SPD opposes a cap on migration and efforts by conservatives to extend a suspension of family reunifications for migrants granted ""subsidiary protection"" rather than full asylum that is due to expire in March 2018.
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a top SPD member, on Friday told broadcaster ARD that his ministry would drop an appeal against a court ruling that allows the family of a 16-year-old Syrian migrant to join him in Germany.
Gabriel told the Funke newspaper group in a separate interview that Germany could not meet the needs of all those who wanted to move there, and urged steps to encourage other European Union members to take in more migrants.

He said it was also clear that Germany needed to deport migrants that entered illegally.

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who led the party until stepping aside earlier this year to make way for former European Parliament president Martin Schulz, said he supported Macron's call for a separate budget for the eurozone.
""We should be ready to invest more in our future,"" Gabriel told Germany's Funke newspaper group and the French newspaper Ouest-France in an interview published Saturday. Germany is the biggest winner of the EU and can afford to contribute more."" 
Gabriel said Macron's proposals to reform the European Union would be ""very important"" in the coalition talks, which are due to begin on Jan. 7 after Merkel failed to reach agreement with two smaller parties.
He said he was enthusiastic about Macron's core idea of strengthening the EU and making it a global player.
The SPD had initially hoped to go into opposition after suffering its worst election losses in the post-war era, but was persuaded to enter into negotiations with conservatives to avoid new elections.
Merkel earlier this month gave her strongest endorsement of Macron's proposals, but Germany has been hamstrung in taking more decisive action on any concrete proposals until it has a new government in place.
Merkel said she saw promising areas of common ground with Social Democrats on the future of Europe, and urged speedy action to work on EU reforms before the next European elections in 2019. This week she said she wants an initial coalition deal with the SPD by mid-January.
Macron hopes to make progress with Germany on ideas to reform the eurozone by March, once Germany has a new coalition government in place, with the goal of agreeing a ""roadmap"" with all eurozone leaders by June.

Gabriel also called for the EU to adopt programs that would encourage communities in poorer member states to accept more migrants by offering financial assistance.

The so-called Thomas fire has blazed through 273,400 acres (110,641 hectares), surpassing the previous record of the 2003 Cedar fire in San Diego County that scorched 273,246 acres and killed 15 people, they said.
The Thomas fire was 65 percent contained as of Friday evening and the natural spread of the blaze had been virtually halted days ago by fire crew, they said.
Incremental increases in burned acreage detected by daily aerial surveys since then have been largely due to controlled-burning operations conducted by firefighters to clear swaths of vegetation between the smoldering edges of the fire zone and populated areas. 
The fire has destroyed over 1,000 structures as it has scorched coastal mountains, foothills and canyons across Ventura and Santa Barbara counties northwest of Los Angeles, officials said. 
On Thursday, authorities canceled the last evacuation notices still in effect for Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.
One fatality directly related to the fire has been reported, a firefighter who succumbed to burns and smoke inhalation in the line of duty last Thursday.

QUETTA, Pakistan/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Christmas church services and other celebrations are being held this weekend under the gaze of armed guards and security cameras in many countries after Islamic State gunmen attacked a Methodist church in Pakistan as a Sunday service began.
Majority-Muslim countries in Asia and the Middle East were particularly nervous after U.S. President Donald Trump's recent announcement he intends to relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a decision that has outraged many Muslims.
In Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, police said they had stepped up security around churches and tourist sites, mindful of near-simultaneous attacks on churches there at Christmas in 2000 that killed about 20 people.
Muslim volunteers in Indonesia are also on standby to provide additional security if requested.
""If our brother and sisters who celebrate Christmas need ... to maintain their security to worship, we will help,"" said Yaqut Chiolil Qoumas, chairman of the youth wing of the Nahdlatul Ulema, one of the country's biggest Muslim organizations.
In Cairo, where a bombing at the Egyptian capital's largest Coptic cathedral killed at least 25 people last December, the interior ministry said police would conduct regular searches of streets around churches ahead of the Coptic celebration of Christmas on Jan. 7.
Egypt's Christian minority has been targeted in several attacks in recent years, including the bombing of two churches in the north of the country on Palm Sunday in April.
At the Heliopolis Basilica, a Catholic cathedral in northeastern Cairo, security forces had set up metal detectors at the main doors and police vehicles were stationed outside ahead of masses on Dec. 25, which marks Christmas Day for Catholic and Protestant Christians.
German police brought in experts and an explosives robot to investigate a suspicious package at a Christmas market in the city of Bonn late on Friday. 
Germany is on high alert a year after a failed Tunisian asylum seeker killed 12 people when he hijacked a truck and drove it into a Berlin Christmas market.
BOMBED-OUT CHURCH
In the Pakistani city of Quetta, members of a Bethel Memorial Methodist Church were repairing the damage done by a pair of suicide bombers who attacked during a service last Sunday, killing 10 people and wounding more than 50.
Broken pews and damaged musical instruments were still strewn around church grounds on Thursday, with about a dozen police standing guard.
""We're making efforts to complete repairs and renovation before Christmas, but it seems difficult in view of the lot of damage,"" said Pastor Simon Bashir, who was leading the service when the attackers struck. He was not hurt.
The government of Baluchistan province, of which Quetta is capital, plans to deploy 3,000 security personnel in and around 39 Christian churches this Sunday and Monday.
Provincial police chief Moazzam Jah Ansari told Reuters volunteers from churches were also being trained to conduct body searches and identify worshippers entering churches.
Pakistan's Christian minority, which makes up about 1 percent of the population of 208 million, has been a frequent target, along with Shi'ite and Sufi Muslims, of Sunni Muslim militants.
In the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, where an Easter Day bombing in a park last year killed more than 70 people, police Detective Inspector General Haider Ashraf said every church would be monitored with CCTV cameras as part of security measures.
Christian Kaleem Masih lost his aunt in the Easter attack, which was claimed by Islamic State, and his wife was wounded, but he said they would be attending Christmas services.
""Christmas is our holy day,"" Kaleem said. ""We will fulfill our religious duty by celebrating it with smiles on our faces.""
JERUSALEM ISSUE
In Malaysia, a police official said Trump's decision on Jerusalem increased worry about attacks.
""We are concerned not only with safety at churches and places of worship but also any threats by Islamic State or any other security threat following the Jerusalem issue,"" said Malaysia's Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun.
Jerusalem, revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, is home to Islam's third holiest site and has been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in an action not recognized internationally.
Protests across the Muslim world in Asia and the Middle East have largely been peaceful.
In Jerusalem itself, an Israeli police spokesman said there were no new security measures but police would deploy forces as usual around Christian holy sites including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and also secure convoys of worshippers from the West Bank city of Bethlehem, traditionally known as the birthplace of Jesus Christ and run by the Palestinian Authority.
Many Palestinian Christians oppose Trump's announcement and say they have no fear of attacks.

""Trump's decision offended all Palestinians, be they Christians or Muslims. Why would we feel threatened by Muslims?"" said George Antone, a Catholic who lives in Gaza, which is run by the Palestinian Hamas group.

""U.S. assistance is entirely defensive in nature, and as we have always said, Ukraine is a sovereign country and has a right to defend itself,"" the department said in a statement.
It said the decision was part of the U.S. effort to help Ukraine defend its territorial integrity and ""deter further aggression,"" but did not specify the capabilities being considered.
Earlier on Friday, ABC News reported that President Donald Trump was expected to approve the sale of anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, citing State Department sources. Any sale would need congressional approval.
Ukraine and Russia are at loggerheads over a war in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces that has killed more than 10,000 people in three years. Kiev accuses Moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region, which Russia denies.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in September that any decision by the United States to supply defensive weapons to Ukraine would fuel the conflict in eastern Ukraine and possibly prompt the separatists to expand their campaign there.
On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it was recalling officers serving at the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination (JCCC) in Ukraine, accusing the Ukrainian side of obstructing their work and limiting access to the front line.
Ukrainian officials, security monitors and Kiev's foreign backers warned on Wednesday that Moscow's decision to withdraw from a Ukrainian-Russian ceasefire control group could worsen the fighting in eastern Ukraine.
Earlier this week the State Department said it had approved an export license for Ukraine to buy certain light weapons and small arms from U.S. manufacturers.
Senator John McCain on Wednesday welcomed the small arms sale. McCain, a Republican, urged Trump ""to authorize additional sales of defensive lethal weapons, including anti-tank munitions, and to fully utilize security assistance funds provided by the Congress to enable Ukraine to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

German authorities evacuated part of a Christmas market in Potsdam near Berlin earlier this month after a package containing powerful firecrackers, wires and nails was delivered to a nearby pharmacy.
Officials later said that criminals had used the incident to try to extort millions of euros from logistics firm DHL, which had delivered the package.

WASHINGTON/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The United States on Friday backed the re-election of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez despite widespread misgivings about the vote count, prompting the opposition candidate to bow out of the race.
The Honduran electoral tribunal declared Hernandez winner of the Nov. 26 election last weekend amid strident opposition protests over the vote count in the impoverished Central American country, which is a major hub for drug trafficking.
The vote tally had initially clearly favored opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla, a center-leftist, but it swung in favor of the incumbent after a 36-hour delay. 
Nasralla contested the vote count, but after the United States backed Hernandez, he declared his bid for the presidency a ""lost cause.""
""The situation is practically decided,"" he said in an interview with TV network France 24. ""I no longer have anything to do in politics, but the people, which are 80 percent in my favor, will continue the fight.""
The United States followed Mexico and other Latin American countries in supporting Hernandez, who has been a reliable U.S. ally. 
The U.S. State Department congratulated Hernandez and said Honduras should pursue a ""long-term effort to heal the political divide in the country and enact much-needed electoral reforms,"" spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
The Honduras election tribunal's declaration in Hernandez's favor last week sparked violent protests in Honduras, and the Organization of American States (OAS) called for new elections to resolve the dispute, a proposal that was rejected by the Honduran government.
Although he has proclaimed an end to his political career, Nasralla still maintains that he is the rightful winner of the election.
""The Organization of American States has made clear that there was a monumental fraud,"" he said. 
Nasralla had been backed by former President Manuel Zelaya, a leftist who was ousted in a 2009 coup after he proposed a referendum on his re-election, which was barred by the constitution at the time.
""He is no longer with the Alliance,"" Zelaya said of Nasralla on Friday. 
The streets of the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa and other major cities were largely calm on Friday with a few protests cleared by the armed forces. By mid-week some 27 people had died in clashes, according to local human rights group COFADEH.
The State Department called for all sides to refrain from violence, for those who wish to challenge the result to use legal means, and for the government to ensure that security services respect the rights of peaceful protesters.
It also called for the electoral tribunal ""to transparently and fully review any challenges filed by political parties.""
Hernandez has led a military crackdown against gangs in the Central American country, and Honduras' notoriously high murder rate has slid since he took power in 2014.
Nasralla, a television host, traveled to Washington this week to urge the United States not to recognize the vote, but a senior State Department official said on Wednesday the government had not seen any evidence that would alter the vote's outcome.
Nasralla said the U.S. decision reflected Washington's strategic concerns over a leftist government in Honduras.

""They're afraid of losing Honduras,"" he told local television.

862,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 08:24PM ET</span>",Failed vote to oust president shakes up Peru's politics,"By Mitra Taj and Teresa Cespedes
LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski could end up the surprise winner of an attempt to oust him from power this week, after some opposition lawmakers broke ranks with party leaders to support him, opening a divide that might strengthen his hand.
Despite having a Congressional majority, the rightwing opposition party Popular Force was unable to push through a motion to remove Kuczynski from office on Thursday, after 10 of its own lawmakers broke ranks to save the president.
The vote cemented a growing divide in the opposition and looked to threaten its control over Congress, potentially aiding Kuczynski as he tries to restore political stability and revive investments in one of Latin America's most robust economies.
The surprise defection was the result of a deal struck between Kuczynski and Popular Force rebel lawmaker Kenji Fujimori to get his father and ex-president Alberto Fujimori out of prison, alleged Popular Force secretary general, Jose Chlimper.
Over the past year, Kenji has courted Kuczynski's center-right government while challenging his sister Keiko's leadership of the rightwing populist movement that their father formed in the 1990s.
In defiance of his sister, Kenji threw his support behind Kuczynski ahead of the vote on whether to remove him from office over unproven graft allegations. Nine other Popular Force lawmakers followed his lead.
""This is the birth of a serious and formal split (in the Fujimori movement),"" said Guillermo Loli, the head of political research for pollster Ipsos Peru.
""Everything points to a pardon,"" he added. 
Kuczynski's government denied that a pardon for Fujimori was part of its political negotiations.
In an address to the nation late on Friday, Kuczynski said he would spend the coming days reflecting on his year and a half in office. ""I'll be announcing to you changes to make sure 2018 is not just a year of greater growth, but politically different,"" Kuczynski said.
'TRAITORS'
Efforts to reach the Popular Force lawmakers who defected were not successful. One, Clayton Galvan, said on local TV channel Canal N that Alberto Fujimori called them from prison to ask them to help Kuczynski stay in power. 
Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes, is a deeply divisive figure in Peru. While many consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending an economic crisis and bloody leftist insurgency during his 1990-2000 term.
Freeing him would likely anger the well-organized foes of the Fujimori clan - a mix of technocrats, leftists, human rights activists and academics.
""The day (Kuczynski) signs a pardon, he loses all of those guys. Permanently,"" said Harvard University political scientist Steve Levitsky.
Support from the anti-Fujimori crowd was key to Kuczynski's razor-thin victory over Keiko in last year's presidential election, and to keeping the motion to oust him from succeeding.
""Kuczynski was saved by two diametrically opposed political groups: Kenji's group and the left, which opposes a pardon. He can't please both of them,"" said Levitsky.
Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former investment banker, took office amid hopes he would usher in cleaner government and faster economic growth. Instead, a graft scandal roiling Latin America has stalled investments and ensnared him in allegations of wrongdoing.
Before the vote on Thursday, Kuczynski fanned fears of a return to Peru's authoritarian past and described the motion as part of a legislative ""coup"" attempt by Keiko's supporters.
Popular Force denies the charge and says the bid to remove him was part of its fight against corruption and within the bounds of the constitution.
A hardline Popular Force lawmaker loyal to Keiko, Hector Becerril, said the Kenji faction represented ""traitors."" 
""If they have any sense of decency after this vote, the least they could do is present their resignations,"" Becerril told journalists on Friday. ""Hopefully today.""
With 10 votes fewer, Popular Force would command 61 seats in the 130-member, single-chamber Congress, less than an absolute majority, though it would still be the biggest voting bloc.

The political crisis has cost Kuczynski his interior minister, Carlos Basombrio, who announced his resignation on Friday. Kuczynski could make a decision about other Cabinet changes in coming days, his government said.

The engineer then applied the brakes but apparently not the emergency brake, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said in a statement after retrieving and reviewing data from the data recorder and inward- and outward-facing cameras.
Monday's crash south of Seattle killed three people and sent about 100 others to hospitals. All 12 cars and one of the two engines jumped the tracks at a curve, sending some cars tumbling from a bridge onto an interstate highway.
The board previously said the train was going about 80 miles per hour (129 km per hour) in a 30-mph zone. On Friday it said the final recorded speed of the locomotive was 78 mph. 
The train's video cameras were damaged in the crash but investigators were able to download the contents with the manufacturer's help at the NTSB lab in Washington, the board said in a statement.
""About six seconds prior to the derailment, the engineer made a comment regarding an over speed condition,"" the board said.
""The engineer's actions were consistent with the application of the locomotive's brakes just before the recording ended. It did not appear the engineer placed the brake handle in emergency-braking mode,"" the board said.
The cameras did not show the crew using any personal electronic devices, the board said. Such use is of interest since a Southern California Metrolink commuter train crashed into a freight train in 2008, killing 25 people and injuring 111 others. The board determined the engineer was distracted by text messaging.
Amtrak President Richard Anderson on Friday urged faster national rollout of another safety measure, Positive Train Control (PTC), that can automatically slow speeding trains and might have prevented the Washington accident.
PTC must be installed on all U.S. trains and tracks by the end of 2018. It was not operational on the track, owned by the Sound Transit commuter rail, where the Amtrak train derailed.
""It is imperative that the rail industry urgently work together to get PTC activated on the national network as soon as possible, and certainly by the December 2018 federal deadline, if not before,"" Anderson said in a statement.

About half of Amtrak's locomotives and two-thirds of its track had PTC as of June, U.S. data show.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitary groups have deployed to the frontier to back up border guard forces who came under fire from within Syria over the past three days, one of their commanders said on Friday.
There was no immediate word on who opened fire from Syrian territory, but forces arrayed against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria expect the group will resort to guerrilla warfare after losing its urban bastions earlier this year.
""After several Iraqi border guard positions came under several attacks by missiles, and backup from security forces was late, the 13th brigade of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) was deployed and targeted the origins of the launch,"" PMF commander for west Anbar, Qassem Mesleh, said in a statement.
""Operations command and the infantry brigade are now present on the Iraqi-Syrian border in border guard positions to repel any attack or movement by the enemy,"" Mesleh said. 
""This area is not within the PMF's remit but it is our duty to back up all security forces.""
The PMF is an umbrella grouping of mostly Iran-backed and trained Shi'ite militias that formally report to Iraq's prime minister but are separate from the military and police.
Sunni Muslims and Kurds have called on Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to disarm the PMF, which they say are responsible for widespread abuses against their communities.
An Iraqi military spokesman confirmed the deployment. Brigadier General Yahya Rasool told Reuters it was temporary, however, and ""very normal"" because it was the PMF's duty to back up government forces.
The PMF were officially made part of the Iraqi security establishment by law and formally answer to Abadi in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
Abadi has said the state should have a monopoly on the legitimate use of arms.
Iraqi forces on Dec. 9 recaptured the last swathes of territory still under Islamic State control along the frontier with Syria and secured the western desert. 
It marked the end of the war against the militants, three years after they overran about a third of Iraq's territory.
Rasool, the military spokesman, denied backup to the border guards had been late.
""The primary responsibility for the borders lies with the border guards and the army, however,"" said Rasool.
He said Iraqi forces coordinate with both the Syrian army, which is backed by Russia, Iran and Iran-backed Shi'ite militias, and the U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias known as the Syrian Democratic Forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
He said parts of Syria - including many areas on the border with Iraq - were still under Islamic State control.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Any move by Kosovo to scrap a war crimes court linked to its independence struggle would seriously undermine relations with friendly western nations, its main backer the United States said on Friday.
Lawmakers from the governing coalition, who hold a majority, are pressing for a vote to abolish the court, which the parliamentary speaker said was scheduled for later in the day.
The Specialist Chamber was established in The Hague in 2015 to bring to justice Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas alleged to have committed atrocities during the 1998-99 war that led to the country's secession from Serbia. It has yet to hear any cases.
The country's Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, President Hashim Thaci and parliamentary speaker Kadri Veseli are former KLA commanders.
The court's judges and prosecutors are foreign but it has been set up under Kosovan law, giving Pristina jurisdiction over it. 
Calling for the parliamentary vote to be halted, U.S. ambassador Greg Delawie said it would have ""extraordinarily negative implications"" for Kosovo.
""It is just a disgrace,"" he told reporters in Pristina. ""This will be considered by the U.S. as stab in the back. Kosovo will be choosing isolation instead of cooperation.""
There was no immediate response from Kosovo officials to Delawie's comments.
Washington has been Kosovo's leading political and financial backer since it declared independence in 2008.
The court was set up following U.S. and European pressure on the government to confront the alleged KLA crimes against ethnic Serbs.
According to Kosovo media, the court could indict or call as witnesses some of current government officials. It was set up in the Netherlands to minimize the risk of witness intimidation and judicial corruption.
Kosovo's war veterans' association earlier this week launched an initiative to hold a parliamentary debate to abolish the law that established the court. They gathered 15,000 signatures, Kosovo media reported. 
NATO air strikes on Serbia forced Belgrade to withdraw its troops from Kosovo in 1999, having killed around 10,000 Albanian civilians. NATO has around 5,000 troops stationed in Kosovo to keep a still fragile peace. 
Kosovo, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian and 5 percent Serbian, is recognized by more than 110 mainly by western countries but not by Serbia's key ally Russia or China.

Merkel and Poroshenko welcomed a decision by the parties to recommit to a ceasefire agreement signed in 2015 ahead of the Christmas holiday, and both agreed it should lead to a longer-term improvement of the security situation in the region.

A Russia-backed separatist insurgency erupted in 2014 and the bloodshed has continued despite the ceasefire. More than 10,000 people have been killed, with casualties reported on a near-daily basis.

The National Security Service (NSS), the local successor to the Soviet KGB, wielded sweeping powers under Karimov who died in September 2016 after a quarter century-long rule criticized for systematic abuses of human rights.
Rustam Inoyatov, NSS chairman since 1995, is the only Karimov-era senior security official still in his post, one year into Mirziyoyev's presidency.
Speaking to parliament on Friday, Mirziyoyev accused security bodies of rights abuses and called for deep reforms.
""To strengthen national statehood, sovereignty, peace and stability of the people ... it is time to reform the work of the National Security Service,"" he said, asking MPs to draft new legislation on law enforcement agencies.

""At the moment, the National Security Service bases its work on a statute passed by the government 26 years ago. The fact that this statute has remained untouched for a quarter of a century and that every problem was regarded as a threat to national security has led to a groundless expansion of this agency's powers.""

PRATICA DI MARE, Italy (Reuters) - The United Nations began bringing African refugees to Italy from Libya on Friday, evacuating them from detention centers whose conditions have been condemned by humanitarian groups as inhumane. 
Hundreds of thousands of migrants have fled conflict or poverty at home and are now trapped in Libya, where they had hoped to pay people smugglers for passage to Europe via Italy.
It is the first time the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Libya has evacuated refugees directly to Europe. An Italian C-130 military plane landed at an airport south the capital carrying 110 women and children, and a second flight is expected to bring more than 50 people later in the day.
The African migrants, including many small children, were covered in blankets or bundled in coats as they disembarked from the plane on a chilly evening.
""We really hope other countries will follow the same path,"" Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's Special Envoy for the Central Mediterranean, said in a statement after the first plane arrived. 
""Some of those evacuated suffered tremendously and were held captive in inhumane conditions while in Libya. Five of these women gave birth while in detention, with only the very limited medical assistance,"" Cochetel said.
The UNHCR estimates about 18,000 people are being held in detention centers for immigrants that are controlled by the Tripoli government and it aims to evacuate as many as 10,000 next year. [nL8N1OJ3EG]
Italy's Catholic Church will house many of the new arrivals in shelters across the country, Church charity Caritas said, as the migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen go through the country's asylum request process. 
Migrant arrivals to Italy have fallen by two-thirds since July from the same period last year after officials working for the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli persuaded human smugglers in the city of Sabratha to stop boats leaving.
Italy is also bolstering the Libyan coast guard's ability to turn back boats.[nL8N1OE34J]
Italy's move to open a safe corridor for some of the migrants follows criticism by rights groups who have condemned the country's efforts to block migrants in Libya in exchange for aid, training and equipment to fight smuggling.[nL8N1NK77C] 
""This should be a point of pride for Italians,"" Interior Minister Marco Minniti told reporters on the tarmac. ""This is the just beginning. We will continue to try to open this humanitarian corridor.""
Migrant smuggling has flourished since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with more than 600,000 making the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean in four years. 
Tens of thousands of migrants are estimated to be detained by smugglers, and the African Union says that as many as 700,000 migrants are in Libya. The UNHCR has registered more than 44,000 as refugees and asylum seekers.

The UNHCR classifies Friday's arrivals as ""vulnerable"" refugees, which means they are children, victims of abuse, women, the elderly or have disabilities.

ARD said Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a member of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), decided to drop an appeal filed just days ago, allow the ruling to take effect, following intense criticism by top SPD leaders. 
The ruling was the first to deal with the right of under-age migrants to bring their families to Germany and could set a new precedent, ARD reported. 
The foreign ministry had no immediate comment on the issue, but Gabriel told the broadcaster: ""We know that it is bad, of course, when minors are here without their parents. It's a good thing that we now have clarity.""
The ministry's reversal on the issue comes as Gabriel's party prepares to enter talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives about continuing the ""grand coalition"" that has ruled Germany for the past four years. 
Migration - and the issue of allowing migrants to bring family members to Germany - could be a key topic in the coalition talks, which are due to begin on Jan. 7. Merkel had failed to reach agreement with two smaller parties.
The case in question centers on a Syrian youth who arrived in Germany in the summer of 2015 with an older cousin, and was granted only ""subsidiary protection"" rather than full asylum.
In 2016, the government had decided to suspend family re-unifications for two years for migrants with ""subsidiary protection"", which is granted to people who are not considered as being persecuted individually but in whose home country there is war, torture or other inhumane treatment.
The court said that rejecting the family reunification in this case violated child welfare protections guaranteed under the European human rights convention and the U.N. Refugee Convention.

874,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 12:34PM ET</span>",Arab states believe U.S. aid secure despite defying Trump Jerusalem move,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi and John Davison
AMMAN/CAIRO (Reuters) - Leading Arab allies threatened with cuts in aid by Donald Trump said on Friday they had no choice but to defy the U.S. president over his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and did not believe he would follow through.
More than 120 countries, including every Arab nation, voted at the U.N. General Assembly late on Thursday to urge the United States to withdraw its decision, announced earlier this month.
Trump threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that voted in favor of the U.N. resolution, drafted by Egypt and supported by all members of the U.N. Security Council except Washington.
He repeated his threat on Friday, writing on Twitter: ""After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is time to start rebuilding our country!""
In Egypt and Jordan, among the top recipients of U.S. aid but long the most heavily invested in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Trump's threats were not taken seriously enough to backtrack on firm opposition to the U.S. move.
""The Americans know more than any one else that a stable Jordan is crucial for U.S. interests in the region,"" a government minister who asked not to be named said.
For its cooperation in defense and other fields, Jordan receives some $1.2 billion annually from Washington.
""We do not expect the American administration to touch assistance but if it does this will only add to Jordan's economic woes,"" the minister said.
UNPREDICTABILITY 
Former Jordanian prime minister Taher al-Masri said Jordan's role as an ally in a volatile region where unrest has led to attacks on U.S. soil would likely keep the aid safe.
""Trump is not giving us aid as charity. Jordan performs a regional role in stability that we have not gone back on delivering,"" he said.
In a sign of concern over Trump's unpredictability, some Jordanian officials privately expressed worry, however.
Masri said the U.N. resolution would have received many more votes from member states had Trump not made his threat.
For Arab and Muslim states, anything less than total rejection of Trump's Jerusalem decision would have been impossible, he said.
Nations around the world have criticized the move as damaging chances to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has rejected any further U.S. role in the peace process.
As home to major Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites, Jerusalem's status has long been fought over in rounds of failed negotiations, and ignited deadly conflict between Israeli and the Palestinians.
Jordan's monarchy is custodian of Jerusalem's holy shrines, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city.
SAFETY IN NUMBERS
Egypt, which led regional efforts to reject Trump's decision as having a ""negative impact"" on security in the region, has been a key broker of past peace deals. Egypt's foreign ministry and presidency could not be reached for comment after several attempts following the General Assembly vote.
H.A. Hellyer, an Egypt expert at the Atlantic Council, said Egypt likely felt secure over its $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid despite Trump's threats.
""I don't think Egypt will be worried ... certainly Trump's inner circle will not be too impressed - but I doubt that it will extend beyond that,"" he said.
Egypt is an important military partner for the United States and is fighting its own Islamist insurgency in part of the vast Sinai Peninsula.
Arab countries are unanimous in their rejection of Trump's Jerusalem move. Key allies such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq reiterated their stance at the General Assembly vote.
Iraq's foreign ministry described the result as a ""triumph for international law"".
Saudi Arabia's delegation said their vote on the Palestinian cause reflected a ""policy priority since the time of the founder (of Saudi Arabia), King Abdul Aziz.""
It is unclear if U.N. votes and strong rhetoric alone will force Washington to reverse course, however.
Israel, the closest U.S. ally in the Middle East, has heaped praise on Trump. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed his decision, which reversed decades of U.S. policy, as a ""historic landmark"".

Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city's eastern sector, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Callista Gingrich, wife of the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, on Friday became U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, which is at odds with Washington over immigration, climate change and Jerusalem.
Callista Gingrich, 51, an author, documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, presented her credentials to Pope Francis at the Vatican to officially assume her role.
Her husband Newt Gingrich was an early supporter and vocal ally of U.S. President Donald Trump. Newt Gingrich is expected to continue his role as a political contributor to Fox News from his new base in Rome.
Trump's nomination of Callista Gingrich to the post at the Holy See in May caused some controversy because of her marriage to Gingrich, with whom she became involved when he was still married to his second wife. Both are Roman Catholic.
On Thursday they attended the funeral at the Vatican of Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned as Archbishop of Boston 15 years ago after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests. 
The pope has implicitly criticized Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris accord on climate change.
He said last month that denying climate change or being indifferent to its effects were ""perverse attitudes"" that blocked research and dialogue aimed at protecting the future of the planet.
Francis is also opposed to Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The pontiff has called for respect for the city's ""status quo,"" saying new tension in the Middle East would further inflame world conflicts..
On Thursday at the United Nations, where the Vatican has permanent observer status, more than 120 countries defied Trump and voted in favor of a resolution calling for the United States to drop its recent recognition.

The U.S. embassy said in a statement that the new ambassador ""looks forward to working with the Holy See to defend human rights, advance religious freedom, combat human trafficking, and to seek peaceful solutions to crises around the world"".

GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli troops shot dead at least two Palestinians on Friday, a Gaza health official said, as protests intensified against Washington's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
A U.N. General Assembly resolution passed on Thursday, rejecting U.S. President Donald Trump's Dec. 6 Jerusalem declaration, did little to calm Palestinian anger over his reversal of decades-old U.S. policy on the contested holy city.
Instead, thousands of Palestinian protesters, many of them throwing rocks, confronted Israeli security forces along the Gaza border fence, in all of occupied West Bank's seven cities and in East Jerusalem. 
In Bethlehem, the traditional birthplace of Jesus, smoke from burning tires billowed in the street, just two days before Christmas celebrations.
Israeli gunfire killed two Palestinians in a confrontation in the southern Gaza Strip, a spokesman for the Palestinian Health Ministry said, putting the number of wounded at 40, half of them shot with live ammunition and the rest with rubber bullets. Others were overcome by tear gas.
In a statement, the Israeli military said some 2,000 Palestinians had faced off against the troops at the Gaza border fence. It said the crowd threw stones and rolled burning tires at soldiers, who responded with ""riot dispersal"" measures and ""fired live rounds selectively towards main instigators"".
Protesters chanted ""Trump is a coward. Trump is a fool"". Among the wounded was a man dressed as Santa Claus.
Palestinian health officials said at least one Palestinian suffered a live bullet wound in the West Bank and some 30 protesters were hit by rubber bullets. The military, putting the number of demonstrators at about 1,700 and the injured at six, said troops faced firebombs, rocks and burning tires.
Protests have been held daily since Trump's announcement. On Thursday, the U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution calling for the United States to drop recognition of Jerusalem, a city revered by Jews, Muslims and Christians, as Israel's capital.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in a Christmas message, called Trump's move ""an insult to millions of people worldwide, and also to the city of Bethlehem"". 
""HOUSE OF LIES""
Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city's eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. 
Most countries regard the status of Jerusalem as a matter to be settled in an eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, although that process is now stalled. 
Nine countries voted against the U.N. resolution and 35 abstained. Twenty-one countries did not cast a vote. 
Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for Gaza's dominant Hamas Islamists, called the U.N. vote a defeat for Trump, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected it as ""preposterous"" and branded the U.N. a ""house of lies"". 
But Michael Oren, Israel's deputy minister for diplomacy, seemed to play down the support for the resolution shown by many countries Israel considers friends.
""We have an interest in tightening our bilateral relations with a long list of countries in the world, and expect and hope that one day, they will vote with us, or for us in the United Nations,"" Oren said on Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM. 
""But I am not prepared to suspend all cooperation with important countries, such as India,"" he said. Netanyahu, who hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July, is due to visit New Delhi next month.
Friday's deaths in Gaza raised to 10 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli gunfire since Dec. 6, Palestinian health officials said. Dozens of protesters have been wounded.
Gaza militants have also fired rockets into Israel, and two gunmen were killed in an Israeli air strike after one such attack. There have been no Israeli fatalities or significant injuries.
Amnesty International on Friday called on Israeli authorities to stop using ""excessive force"". 
""The fact that live ammunition has been used during protests in Gaza and the West Bank is particularly shocking,"" it said. 
In the run-up to the U.N. vote, Trump threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that supported the resolution. His warning appeared to have some impact, with more countries abstaining and rejecting the document than usually associated with Palestinian-related resolutions.
But most of the European Union, Israel's biggest trading partner, and countries such as Greece, Cyprus and India, with which Netanyahu has pursued closer relations and economic ties, backed the resolution.

""I prefer we have tight bilateral relations over a situation in which we don't have close bilateral relations, and they vote in our favor in the United Nations,"" Oren said, describing India's vote as ""certainly disappointing"".

TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - A hundred meters from the office of Libyan Prime Minister Fayaz al-Seraj in Tripoli, guards at a detention center for migrants had a message for a visiting French delegation: no minister, no journalists, nobody is allowed in. 
    French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian went to Libya on Thursday to revive U.N. talks between rival groups controlling the west and east, with a view to stabilizing a nation in turmoil since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
But the Tripoli leg of the visit showed how difficult it will be to find anyone capable of imposing authority, with a weak U.N.-backed government depending on an array of armed factions, each with its own agenda.
After meeting Seraj in his impressive office, Le Drian was meant to visit the nearby detention facility to see conditions for African migrants caught as they try to reach Europe.
But after CNN aired a video appearing to show migrants being auctioned off as slaves, Libyan officials are on edge, with guards refusing to let the French visitors through the detention camp's thick steel door.
""What do you want to call it? "" said a visibly tetchy man
who described himself as the supervisor. ""It is a detention
center. Nobody is allowed. Not the minister and not journalists.
Not allowed.""
French officials played down the incident, saying there had been no time for a visit anyway.
But it was symptomatic of how Seraj's government is struggling to make an impact, failing to fix anything from electric power cuts to a collapsing currency.
Seraj promised to tackle migrant trafficking, but French officials say that will depend on which armed groups are prepared to help him. 
    
    POLISHED BOOTS
While armed factions are vying for control in Tripoli, power in Benghazi is in the hands of one man, General Khalifa Haftar, whose forces have driven out Islamist fighters.
""It's a lot more ordered here. There's no doubt here that
there is just one chief,"" said a European security contractor in Benghazi.
Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army is made up of different groups, which he struggles at times to control.
But the general, who hopes to run for the Libyan presidency next year, sought to impress his French visitor with as much fanfare as possible.
Soldiers stood at strategic points, uniforms spotless and boots polished, in contrast to other parts of Libya, where armed groups are more informally dressed in a mixture of uniforms and civilian clothes. 
Opponents accuse Haftar of Gaddafi-style high-handedness and of trying to revive a police state, something his supporters vehemently deny.
He did not leave his office during the French visit, leaving Le Drian to review air, sea and land forces as a military band struggled to play La Marseillaise.
Haftar's aides did not allow journalists to film his meeting with le Drian with their phones. 
""I appreciate the frankness of our exchanges,"" Le Drian said
after an hour-long discussion. ""That's quite natural,"" Haftar responded loftily.
    Haftar is attempting to position himself as a presidential candidate, but there is still sporadic fighting in Benghazi despite his having declared victory in July.
One diplomat recalled how Haftar was envious of Seraj
after he met U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington last month, perhaps sensing a shift in the Libyan balance of power.

    ""I don't know how comfortable he (Haftar) is feeling, because I sense that this time the security was much more stringent than when we were last here (in August),"" said a French official. ""He may be feeling some pressure.""

The ceasefire, that would allow humanitarian groups access to civilians caught in the fighting, formally comes into force on Sunday morning. [L8N1OL582] 
On Friday afternoon, a spokesman for the SPLA-IO rebel group said army forces had attacked a rebel base in Deim Jalab, in the western part of the country. Lam Paul Gabriel said two rebels and five government troops were killed in the fighting.
The army spokesman in the capital, Juba, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The war that began in late 2013 in the world's youngest nation has forced a third of the population to flee their homes. The United Nations describes the violence as ethnic cleansing. 
Earlier this year, pockets of the country plunged briefly into famine.
The latest round of talks in the Ethiopian capital, convened by the East African bloc IGAD, brought the warring sides back to the negotiating table after a 2015 peace deal collapsed last year during heavy fighting in Juba.
After the new agreement was signed on Thursday, South Sudan's Information Minister Michael Makuei Leuth told journalists: ""The cessation of hostilities will be effective 72 hours from now. As of now, we will send messages to all the commands in the field to abide by this cessation of hostilities.

The Scottish Court of Session has accepted a petition from the cross-party group of seven lawmakers, excluding British Prime Minister Theresa May's ruling Conservatives, to determine whether Brexit can be stopped if Britain, acting alone, decides to reverse the process.
The British government has three weeks to respond to the challenge, before the Edinburgh court - Scotland's supreme civil judicial body - sets a date to hear the case, a spokesman said.
The seven lawmakers from the Labour Party, Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens, want the Court of Sessions to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest court, to conclusively rule on the issue.
""We know it is possible to stay in the European Union if the other member states allow. But experts believe our parliament can withdraw the (leaving) notification without their permission,"" the Scottish lawmakers said in a statement earlier this week. 
""But there is only one way to be sure: a court has to decide what Article 50 means."" 
May formally notified the EU of Britain's intention to leave the EU by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29, starting a two-year exit process, and has said she will not tolerate any attempt in parliament to block it.
Brexit supporters argue that after last year's referendum vote to leave, any attempt to halt the process would be anti-democratic. But opponents say the country should have a right to pass final judgment on any exit deal negotiated, and the Scottish challenge is the latest legal attempt to try to ensure this happens. 
Article 50 does not specify whether the exit process can be unilaterally reversed although former British diplomat Lord Kerr who drafted it has said Britain can change its mind at any stage before the final exit date in 2019.
The referendum saw 52 percent of voters backing Brexit. The poll shook Britain's structure, as voters in Northern Ireland and Scotland backed remaining in the EU but those in Wales and England opted to leave.

However, a recent BMG opinion poll found that 51 percent of Britons would now keep EU membership versus 41 percent who still wanted to leave.

The Muslim-majority Southeast Asian country has been on high alert since gunmen linked to Islamic State launched multiple attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighboring Indonesia, in January 2016. 
The suspects were arrested in a counter-terror operation carried out in four states between Nov. 30 and Dec. 15, Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement. 
They include a 50-year-old Filipino suspected of recruiting his countrymen in Malaysia to join up with the Abu Sayyaf, a militant group notorious for kidnappings and beheadings in the southern Philippines. 
The man, who has been living in Malaysia since 2016, was believed to be a cousin of late Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon, a Malaysian intelligence source told Reuters.
Hapilon, the Islamic State's anointed ""emir"" in Southeast Asia, was killed in October by Philippine troops in Marawi city, where he had led a five-month siege. 
Police also arrested an Indonesian, suspected of being a leader of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, a pro-Islamic State alliance of Islamic militants, he said. 
The man was involved in a July 2017 bombing in Bandung, Indonesia, before traveling to Malaysia to escape arrest, Mohamad Fuzi said.

Diego García-Sayán, a special rapporteur mandated by the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the independence of judges and lawyers, said Poland's newly adopted laws threatened the independence of the judiciary.
“These new laws are part of a larger plan aimed at placing the judiciary under the political control of the ruling party,” García-Sayán said in a statement. 
He said Poland had been comprehensively reforming its judicial system since parliamentary elections in 2015, aiming to increase its effectiveness and restore public trust. Such reforms were a legitimate objective, he added.
“What is happening in Poland today, however, is a vicious attempt to place the whole judicial system under the control of the executive and legislative branches.”

BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Separatists looked set on Friday to regain power in Catalonia after voters rejected Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's attempt to defuse the independence movement, instead re-igniting the country's biggest political crisis in decades.
Spanish markets recoiled at a surprise result that is also a setback for the European Union, which must now brace for more secessionist noise as it grapples with the disruption of Brexit and simmering east European discontent. 
By risking an election in the wealthy region, Rajoy appears to have made the same mistake that leaders such as Greece's Alexis Tsipras, Britain's David Cameron and Italy's Matteo Renzi have made in recent years: betting that voters would resolve their troublesome domestic conundrums for them.

With the count from Thursday's Catalan parliament election almost complete, separatist parties had secured a slim majority, sending stocks down around 1 percent on fears that the euro zone's fourth-largest economy will be hurt by tensions with its richest region. 
After several strained months that saw secessionists organize an illegal referendum on Oct. 1, and police confiscate urns to try to prevent it from taking place, the regional election has failed to produce a solution to the standoff. 
Rajoy is weakened; the secessionists kept a majority, but it was reduced and they may have difficulty forming a government; and support for the unionist Ciudadanos has surged, but not enough to catapult them into power.
""Catalonia is back to square one,"" said Marco Protopapa, an analyst at JP Morgan, forecasting that tensions would quickly return between Madrid and an ""emboldened pro-independence camp eager to exploit the tactical advantage of a favorable election outcome"".
With Catalonia accounting for a fifth of its economy, Spain had already trimmed growth forecasts for 2018, and the prospect of prolonged uncertainty worries business leaders. 
""More companies leaving, less economic activity there - and worse for everyone,"" said the chief executive of a major listed Spanish company, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the tense climate of the independence debate.
More than 3,100 firms have shifted their headquarters out of the region since October's referendum.
REJECTION FOR RAJOY
Rajoy, who called the election after sacking the previous, secessionist government, had hoped to mobilize hitherto quiescent supporters of union with Spain and deal separatism a decisive blow.
Instead, his own party performed miserably, and the result raises the question of a return to power for Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan president he had deposed.
Puigdemont, who campaigned from Belgium after fleeing Spain to avoid arrest for sedition, said now was the time for dialogue between him and Rajoy.
""We've at least won the right to be heard,"" he said, adding that he was open to returning to Spain if guarantees were given that he could take his position as head of a potential new Catalan government. Currently he faces the prospect of arrest for his role in organizing the banned referendum.
Rajoy was due to make a statement at 1300 GMT. 
Secessionists say Catalonia pays an unfair share of taxes to Madrid, but investors fear independence would knock the indebted region out of the EU and the euro zone by default.
""There is a huge effect on investment from abroad. As there's a lack of stability here, people who were investing here are going to other cities and other regions,"" said Rafael Prisco, commercial director in a real estate agent in central Barcelona that deals mostly with foreign clients.
Overnight hotel stays rose 2.1 percent in Spain in November, but fell 7.3 percent in Catalonia, the National Statistics Institute said.
GERMANY AND FRANCE BACK RAJOY 
When the Catalan parliament declared independence after the referendum, Rajoy invoked constitutional powers to impose direct rule from Madrid. He promised to restore Catalonia's autonomy regardless of the election result, but could re-impose it if a new government again pursued secession. 
The EU's major powers, Germany and France, have backed his anti-independence stance despite some criticism of his methods at times.
Meanwhile, Puigdemont's attempts to gain international support in Brussels have failed so far. He has called the EU a ""club of decadent countries"" for declining to mediate a solution.
A German government spokeswoman on Friday urged reconciliation in Catalonia, adding that the Spanish constitution - which bars any territorial breakup - would have to be respected. 
Europe now ends the year having struggled to build on the integrationist Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential election in May. Germany faces months of political limbo, Brussels is mired in a nasty dispute with Poland's right-wing government and a far-right party has just entered the government in Austria.
Catalonia's separatist parties won 70 of the 135 seats, compared with 72 last time, with Puigdemont's Junts Per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) retaining its position as the largest separatist force.
Ciudadanos (Citizens) won the most votes, but other unionist forces -- Rajoy's People's Party and the Socialist Party -- registered a dismal performance.

""It's a bitter victory,"" said Paloma Morales, a 27-year-old student at a Ciudadanos rally. ""It means four more years of misery.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N refugee agency on Friday accused Australia of abandoning hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island and said it must take responsibility for the mess it created with its ""offshore processing"" system.
About 800 refugees are still in a precarious situation on Manus Island, having been forcibly removed from a holding camp last month when Australia decided to close it, UNHCR spokeswoman Cecile Pouilly told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva. 
""We are talking here about people who have suffered tremendously, extreme trauma, and are now feeling so insecure in the places where they are staying. There are many victims of torture, people who have been deeply traumatized, having no idea what is going to happen next to them,"" she said.
""In light of the continued perilous situation on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island for refugees and asylum seekers abandoned by Australia, UNHCR has called again this week on the Australian government to live up to its responsibility and urgently find humane and appropriate solutions."" 
Conditions in the camp, and another on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, have been widely criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups.
The two camps have been cornerstones of Australia's contentious immigration policy under which it refuses to allow asylum-seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores.
The policy, aimed at deterring people from making a perilous sea voyage to Australia, has bipartisan political support.
The closure of the Manus Island camp, criticized by the United Nations as ""shocking"", caused chaos, with the men refusing to leave the compound for fear of being attacked by Manus island residents.
Pouilly said that in the past four weeks, there had been at least five security incidents, including an attempt by three people armed with machetes and an axe to force their way into a site where 150 refugees and asylum seekers have been accommodated since the Australian facility closed.
Pouilly said that although Papua New Guinea now had to deal with the situation, the buck should stop with Australia.
""What we clearly are saying is that it’s Australia’s responsibility in the first place,"" she said.
""Australia is the country that created the situation by putting in place this offshore processing facility. So what we are asking is for Australia to find solutions for these people.""

Merkel needs the Social Democrats to agree to a re-run of the current ""grand coalition"" if she is to serve a fourth term. The SPD had previously said it intended to go into opposition after suffering its worst election result in more than eight decades in September. 
Peter Altmaier, acting finance minister and Merkel's right hand, told Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper he thought such an alliance was possible and had proven successful from 2005 to 2009 and again from 2013 to 2017.
Asked what offers the conservatives would make, Altmaier said: ""We'll of course talk with the SPD about problems in hospitals and nursing care, improvements for families and children, broadband expansion, qualification for new jobs and how we can reach full employment.""
There is overlap with the SPD on these areas, he said, adding that helping Germany's 900,000 long-term unemployed needed to be a key project - an idea likely to go down well with the SPD.
The SPD wants to scrap Germany's dual healthcare system of superior private care and more widely accessible public care to replace it with a single ""citizen's insurance"". The conservatives fear that would harm competition.
Germany's two biggest parties are set to start exploratory talks in January on whether to join forces for the next four years in government. They hope to decide by Jan. 12 whether to open full-blown coalition talks.
While the conservatives have made clear they are keen to govern again in such a coalition, the SPD has kept the option of tolerating a minority Merkel-led government on the table, though Merkel rejects that idea.
The conservatives want a coalition treaty to include a pledge not to raise taxes or increase debt but will not draw any red lines ahead of the talks, Altmaier said. The SPD tends to advocate more spending and investment.
Senior SPD member and Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the Funke newspaper consortium that some of his party colleagues favored a toleration set-up, but he worried about the implications for Europe's stability.

""I'm rather skeptical,"" he said. ""A shaky government in Germany would probably lead to an earthquake in Europe - but we need to talk about it.""

890,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 06:20AM ET</span>",UK PM May says she was unaware of allegations against sacked deputy,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday she knew nothing of allegations of inappropriate behavior by her most senior minister, forced to resign this week, until she read about them in a newspaper.
Damian Green, 61, has been accused of making a sexual advance towards academic Kate Maltby, the daughter of a family friend, in 2015, suggesting it might further her career.
May forced Green, one of her closest political allies, to resign on Wednesday night because of a separate scandal - lying about whether he knew pornography had been found on computers in his parliamentary office.
An internal investigation requested by May and conducted by a senior government official said on Wednesday it was not possible to reach a definitive conclusion on Maltby's allegations but said it found them plausible.
In an interview with the Daily Telegraph published on Friday, Maltby said she had told an aide in May's Downing Street office about Green's advances in 2016. 
However May said she had not been aware of the accusations about Green until they became public last month when Maltby wrote about them.
""I first learnt of these allegations when Kate Maltby wrote about them in the Times,"" May said in a television interview while visiting a British air base in Cyprus on Friday.
""I recognize that Kate Maltby was obviously extremely distressed by what had happened. Damian Green has recognised that, he said that in the letter that he wrote to me, and he has apologized. And I think that's absolutely the right thing to do.""
Green quit after the review said he had made inaccurate statements following reports last month in the Sunday Times newspaper that police had found pornography on his office computers in the Houses of Parliament in 2008.
He said he had not downloaded or viewed the pornography, but admitted making misleading statements.
Two former police officers who publicly disclosed details about Green's computers are themselves facing investigation over whether they breached data protection laws. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said their actions had ""the slight feeling of a vendetta"".

Green was appointed first secretary of state six months ago in a bid to shore up May's premiership following her disastrous June snap election that lost her party its majority in parliament, and is the third cabinet minister to quit in less than two months.

891,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 06:10AM ET</span>",Britain to bring back classic blue-and-gold passport as it leaves EU,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's classic blue passport, for many a key symbol of national sovereignty, will be reintroduced after the country leaves the European Union, the government said on Friday. 
Bringing back the old passport, just as Britain is negotiating the terms on which it leaves the EU in March 2019, will please both those who voted to leave the bloc and many of those who voted to remain, immigration minister Brandon Lewis said. 
""Even people who voted remain (...) still have this attachment to the passport of the past,"" Lewis told the BBC. ""Leaving the EU gives us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path for ourselves in the world.""
The dark blue and gold passport was replaced by the burgundy jacket of the European Union in 1988. The new document, which will be issued from October 2019, will also come with enhanced security features, Lewis said.
The color of the passport became another bone of contention during the EU referendum campaign, with many Brexit supporters highlighting it as a measure of Britain's lost independence, while their opponents mocked the attachment given the damage they believed leaving the bloc would do. 
The change will be introduced as old passports expire and come at no extra cost to the taxpayer.
Conservative lawmaker Anna Soubry, an opponent of Brexit in Britain's ruling party, tweeted: ""Stand by for street parties as blue passports return. Not sure they'll make up for broken #Leave promise of extra £350m a week for (British public health service) NHS."" 
She was referring to a Brexit slogan which promised more funding for Britain, such as for the health service, once Britain stopped contributing to the EU, in what became a touchstone for the debate.
Nigel Farage, a leading supporter of Brexit and former head of the United Kingdom Independence Party tweeted: ""Happy Brexmas!""
""A return to British passports means we are becoming a proper country again. We are getting our individuality and national identity back,"" he wrote.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran's justice ministry confirmed on Friday that authorities have opened a new case against British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been sentenced to five years in jail, and denied she might soon be released.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she was heading back to Britain with her two-year-old daughter after a family visit.
She was convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. 
British foreign minister Boris Johnson traveled to Iran this month to lobby for her release. 
""Iran’s judiciary cannot confirm any of the claims in Western media about this case,"" the head of the justice department in Tehran province, Gholamhossein Esmaili, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency on Friday.
""When a decision is made, it will be announced by the Islamic Republic's judiciary or through diplomatic channels,"" he said. 
Tasnim said he specifically denied reports of a swap deal, but did not make clear what reports he was referring to.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard Ratcliffe, who called on Iran to release his wife before Christmas, told the Guardian and other British media on Thursday that her lawyer said that her case has been marked as being eligible for early release.
The release of dual national prisoners in Iran in recent years has been mainly done through prisoner swaps. 
""Besides serving her current sentence, she has also another ongoing case against her in court... We do not know if she would be found guilty or not,"" Esmaili said.
His comments mark the first time a justice ministry official has acknowledged that a new case has been brought against Zaghari-Ratcliffe.
Her family said in October that the new case carried charges that could bring mean another 16 years in prison.
The new charges included joining and receiving money from organizations working to overthrow the Islamic Republic and attending a demonstration outside the Iranian Embassy in London, the family said.

Iran refuses to recognize dual nationals and denies them access to consular assistance. It has arrested at least 30 dual nationals during the past two years, mostly on spying charges.

The High Court ruled on Dec. 13 that Zuma must set up a judicial inquiry into influence-peddling within 30 days and that he should pay costs for an earlier legal challenge. 
Zuma's spokesman could not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters.
Zuma was seeking leave to appeal the High Court ruling on 20 grounds, including that he should pay legal costs, eNCA reported.
The influence-peddling inquiry was recommended in a report released a year ago by South Africa's Public Protector, whose job is to uphold standards in public life.
Zuma also sought to block the release of the report, entitled ""State of Capture"", which focused on allegations that Zuma's friends, the businessmen and brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers. 
Zuma and the Guptas have denied all accusations of wrongdoing.

Gao Yan was one of the targets of an executive order issued by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday blocking the property of foreigners involved in human rights abuses.
Gao had been in charge at Chaoyang Detention Centre in Beijing where a Chinese rights activist, Cao Shunli, was held and questioned prior to her death in hospital under police custody in March 2014. Rights groups say Cao was tortured and denied medical care.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing that China opposed the United States using sanctions to target other countries' citizens based on their own domestic laws.
""We urge the United States to impartially and objectively look upon China's human rights development and to stop acting as a so-called human rights judge,"" she said, adding that China's police maintain public security in accordance with law.
The head of the Russian republic of Chechnya and four other Russians and Chechens were also included on the list of individuals to be targeted under the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law which freezes the bank accounts of those targeted.
Hong Kong-based group Chinese Human Rights Defenders said in a statement that they welcomed Gao being named, but that they regretted the inclusion of only a low-level Chinese official, calling for Fu Zhenghua, a deputy minister of public security, to also be included.
""Other higher-level police officials, who had 'command responsibility' for Cao Shunli’s death in custody and for other incidents of torture and human rights violations, including arbitrary detention, continue to enjoy impunity,"" they said.
Beijing regularly rejects foreign criticism of its human rights record saying that its people are best placed to judge the rights situation in China and that the country is governed by law.
President Xi Jinping has presided over a crackdown on rights activists and lawyers that has seen hundreds detained or jailed since 2015 in what advocacy groups have called an unprecedented attack on human rights in China.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A Seoul court on Friday found Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin guilty of breach of trust and embezzlement and sentenced him to 20 months in prison, suspended for two years, leaving him free to try and revive the conglomerate after steep losses in China.
The Seoul Central District Court cleared the executive of some counts of breach of trust and one embezzlement charge.
""I apologize to the public,"" Shin said as he left court, without commenting further.
Prosecutors had sought a ten-year jail term for Shin on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust after a probe since 2016 into the retail-to-chemicals group. 
The ruling will come as a relief to Lotte at the end of a tough year during which it became the highest-profile corporate victim of a Beijing-Seoul spat over South Korea's installation of a U.S. missile defense system. 
South Korea's fifth-largest conglomerate said, ""We respect the court's decision. Lotte Group executives and employees will further unite to contribute to economic progress and do our best to meet our social responsibility."" 
The prosecution did not have an immediate comment. Legal experts said the prosecution was likely to appeal.
Shin is the subject of another ongoing trial related to a bribery scandal involving former President Park Geun-hye. Prosecutors are seeking a four-year jail term and a fine of 7 billion won ($6.49 million).
In the meantime, Friday's ruling means Lotte, with 110.8 trillion won worth of assets, avoids a leadership vacuum for the time being as it navigates mounting China losses and an uncertain recovery.
Shunned in China, its key market, after it was pressed by Seoul to provide land for the THAAD missile defense system, Lotte's third-quarter China hypermarket sales were nearly wiped out to about $278,000 from around $264 million a year earlier. 
Nearly all Lotte Mart stores in China have been shut for much of the year with local authorities citing fire safety issues, and the group has now put the business up for sale. 
But the sale is likely to be delayed past the end-2017 deadline Lotte had sought, Lotte Corp official Choi Min-ho said, without giving a reason. 
BATTENING DOWN THE HATCHES
Lotte's businesses in South Korea, including its major duty-free operations, that had counted on big-spending Chinese tourists, remain under pressure amid curbs on Chinese tour groups traveling to the country.
South Korea's credit rating agencies have downgraded or cut their outlook for corporate bonds of the group's flagship retailer Lotte Shopping and Hotel Lotte [HTLOT.UL], citing hurdles in improving their financial stability.
Lotte, which shelved plans for an estimated $4.5 billion IPO of Hotel Lotte amid the investigation, is now battening down the hatches as a difficult year draws to an end.
Lotte Shopping has frozen wages for its department store business this year for the first time since 2009, three Lotte officials said this week, declining to be identified as the matter was sensitive. 
While Lotte confirmed wages had been frozen, the retail-to-chemical conglomerate declined further comment. 

However, one of the officials from the department store business said: ""Wages have been frozen due to various factors, but the THAAD issue was one of them.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in comforted mourners in the small scenic city of Jecheon on Friday amid growing public anger at how fire ripped through an eight-floor building, killing at least 29 people, most of them taking a sauna.
All but one of the victims had been identified by Friday morning, including 20 women who were overcome by toxic fumes in the second-floor sauna, Jecheon fire chief Lee Sang-min said. 
""Our crew on the scene said the lockers inside the facility were installed like a labyrinth and it’s a glass building with few windows, which apparently made way for the smoke from the first floor to quickly fill up the second floor,"" Lee told reporters.
Anger mounted at reports of shoddy building construction, broken doors and other problems that may have contributed to the deaths.
One man shouted at officials visiting survivors in hospital, complaining that firefighters failed to break through to the trapped women in time.
Media reported that a glass door leading to the sauna had not been working properly for more than a month, and that emergency stairs were often used for storage. 
""Nothing has changed even after the Sewol tragedy,"" parliament member Ahn Cheol-soo said, referring to the 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people, mostly South Korean school children.
""I just cannot understand why the same type of accidents happen over and over again,"" he said, according to the Yonhap news agency.
Jecheon's mayor told reporters the city was considering a mass funeral and planned to cover most of the costs.
Investigators were still trying to find out the cause of the conflagration, but were focusing on a first-floor parking lot, Lee said.
""There were cars parked on the first floor, and as they were burning, a large amount of toxic gases were released."" 
Tragic stories began to emerge as victims were identified.
One man told Yonhap that he lost his mother, wife, and daughter. Another said he received a phone call from his trapped wife as she coughed in the gathering smoke, but was later unable to reach her again.
Heavy smoke charred glass facade of the building as firefighters struggled to extinguish the blaze, climbing up and down a ladder in a desperate search for survivors.
Organizers called off a leg of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games torch relay in Jecheon on what should have been a day of celebration ahead of the games.
""We thought that having a torch relay at a place where so many people died in a fire accident is just not right, and therefore canceled today’s event in Jecheon,"" Ryu Hoyon, the torch relay manager for the Pyeongchang organizing committee, told Reuters. ""We are planning to adjust further schedules with those who want to continue the relay.""

The decision to allow pilgrim David Britsch to return to Germany follows the release earlier this week of German journalist Mesale Tolu after nearly eight months in prison.
""Decisions such as these give hope that we can rebuild trust step by step and relax the bilateral relationship,"" Gabriel said in a statement released late on Thursday.
Gabriel said he had agreed with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu to continue talks given the ""difficult issues"" that still had to be resolved. Germany is home to some 3 million people of Turkish heritage.
""Following recent rulings in Turkey, six persons have now been released from prisons or allowed to leave,"" Gabriel said.
""And in the case of the imprisoned journalist Deniz Yucel, the Turkish judiciary has at least made the conditions for detention easier. The next urgent step here is the presentation of an indictment.""
The releases come two weeks after German federal prosecutors dropped an investigation against a dozen Muslim clerics who were suspected of spying in Germany on behalf of the Turkish government.
Tolu was charged with being a member of a terrorist organization and publishing terrorist propaganda following the July 2016 coup. She was released on the condition that she does not leave the country. 
German politicians have been outspoken critics of Turkey's security crackdown since the coup. Tens of thousands of Turks have been jailed, including around a dozen who hold German citizenship. 

Ankara has criticized Berlin for not handing over asylum seekers it accuses of involvement in the failed coup. It says U.S.-based cleric Fetullah Gulen was the mastermind of the coup, but Gulen denies involvement.

JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan denied on Friday that a businessman sanctioned by the United States was an adviser to President Salva Kiir, and said the decision to blacklist him was based on misleading information. 
Benjamin Bol Mel was among several individuals from different countries whom the United States placed under sanctions on Thursday. 
It said Mel had served as Kiir’s principal financial adviser as well as his private secretary, and that ABMC Thai-South Sudan Construction Company Limited, of which Mel is president, was suspected of getting preferential treatment in government contracts.
Ateny Wek Ateny, Kiir's spokesman, said the assertion that Mel had business ties with the president ""is not true"", and also denied that there were any official relations between the two men. 
""He is not an adviser to the president and he should be treated as an individual."" 
Ateny said most of the information the United States used to blacklist South Sudan officials was ""misleading"".
South Sudan has been battered by a four-year civil war triggered by a disagreement between Kiir and his then-deputy, Riek Machar. 
The fighting has left tens of thousands dead, displaced about a quarter of the population and left the oil-dependent economy moribund. 
Rights activists have accused mostly government troops of killings, mass rapes, and looting and destroying property. 
Several serving or former South Sudanese officials are already under U.S. sanctions for alleged roles in the conflict, including Malek Reuben Riak Rengu, the army's deputy chief of the defense staff for logistics; former army chief Paul Malong; and Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth. 
The U.S. Embassy in South Sudan said on Friday that Mel was being punished for his ""role, and that of his business network, in facilitating corruption"".

It said Mel was exploiting his connections with Kiir ""to regularly engage in large scale government contracts worth millions of dollars for construction work that was not completed"".

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has ordered 27 international aid groups to shut down for working in unauthorized areas, spurring human rights campaigners to denounce swelling constraints on free speech and humanitarian work. 
The Ministry of Interior gave the 27 NGOs 90 days to conclude operations, according to a list seen by Reuters. Among those being expelled are Action Aid, World Vision, Plan International, Trocaire, Pathfinder International, Danish Refugee Council, George Soros' Open Society Foundations, Oxfam Novib, and Marie Stopes. 
Talal Chaudhry, Pakistan's Minister of State for Interior Affairs, told Reuters the reason for shutting down the NGOs was because they were doing work in Pakistan ""which is beyond their mandate and for which they have no legal justification"". 
He declined to give specific examples, but said the targeted NGOs spend ""all their money"" on administration, are not doing the work they said they were doing, and are working in areas where they were not authorized.
The Pakistan Humanitarian Forum (PHF), which represents 63 international aid groups, said the ministry had issued 11 of its members ""letters of rejection"". All of them said they will appeal. No reason for the rejections have been provided, the forum said.
Plan International, which has worked in Pakistan since 1997, said it is supporting over 1.6 million children across Pakistan. Plan said it was given no reason for the ministry's decision and would appeal it.
""The organization is hopeful that the appeals process will make it possible for its work with vulnerable and marginalized children, especially girls, to continue in Pakistan,"" it said in a statement.
All the other NGOs on the list who responded to queries from Reuters also said they had been given no reason for being forced to shut down.
""They must be having reasons for every (NGO) and those reasons should have been shared with the organizations,"" said a representative from one NGO who declined to be identified.
AFTER 9/11
Chaudhry said the number of NGOs in the country ballooned after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. Many organizations arrived to provide humanitarian assistance after Islamabad allied itself with the United States in what was then known as the global war on terror.
""But there were also a number of NGOs that are used, knowingly or unknowingly for activities that conflict with Pakistan's national interests,"" Chaudhry said, adding that registration procedures are commonplace in other countries.
Pakistan has hardened its stance towards domestic and international NGOs in recent years, requiring them to undertake a painstaking registration process and clear multiple bureaucratic hurdles to continue working in the country.
The Save the Children aid group fell afoul of the government in 2011, when it was linked to a Pakistani doctor recruited by the CIA to help in the hunt that led to the killing of al Qaeda militant leader Osama bin Laden in the town of Abbottabad.
In January, the interior ministry ordered a dozen domestic groups working on women's issues and human rights to halt operations, a move later overturned in courts.
Pakistan is hardly alone in cracking down on foreign charities. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has since 2014 tightened surveillance of non-profit groups, saying they were acting against India’s national interests. Thousands of foreign-funded charities’ licenses have been canceled for misreporting donations.
In China, a law that went into effect on Jan. 1 this year grants broad powers to police to question NGO workers, monitor their finances, regulate their work and shut down offices.
THE DISAPPEARED
The clampdown on NGOs has come after a number of activists disappeared this year, some of whom have not been heard from. Reuters estimates at least 14 people have been picked up and interrogated from major urban centers including journalists, political workers, and social media activists.
Three members of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) have also disappeared in the past year, chairperson Mehdi Hasan told Reuters. 
Human rights campaigners say the crackdown on NGOs and disappearances of civil society activists are part of a wider campaign to quell free speech. 
""They both signify the shrinking space for free expression and activism in Pakistan and the diminishing tolerance the Pakistan state has,"" Saroop Ijaz, a representative for the Pakistan chapter of Human Rights Watch, told Reuters. 
Yusuf, who formerly served as HRCP chairperson, said Pakistan feels it has impunity in dealing with rights groups and activists. 
""Its the repositioning of Pakistan as a security state and perceiving all forms of dissent as a security challenge,"" Yusuf said. 
""It's creating a lot of fear in society.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson will tell his Russian counterpart on Friday that there can be no ""business as usual"" until Moscow stops ""destabilising"" Europe and that Britain is ready to retaliate against any cyber attacks. 
Johnson is due to hold talks in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during what is the first visit to Russia by a British foreign minister in five years. He is also expected to meet Kremlin critics, students, and gay rights activists. 
Johnson's visit comes at a time when relations between London and Moscow are strained by differences over Ukraine and Syria as well as by allegations, which Russia flatly denies, of it meddling in the politics of various European countries and of backing cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns.
“Our relations with Russia cannot be ‘business as usual’ whilst Russia continues to attempt to destabilise European states, including Ukraine,"" Johnson said in a statement released by his office before the talks.
While traveling to Moscow on Thursday, Johnson told reporters that Britain disapproved of many things that Russia had done. He singled out its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, what he called Moscow's destabilising of the western Balkans, and its cyber activities.
""As you would expect the UK has its own (cyber) capabilities and we are ready of course to defend our interests,"" he said. 
But Johnson also stressed his desire for London and Moscow to cooperate where they have common interests, saying it was vital for international security that the two countries talk to each other because not doing so risked potentially dangerous misunderstandings.
Johnson says he wants to discuss working with Moscow to preserve the Iran nuclear deal and the threat posed by North Korea, as well as security arrangements for next year's soccer World Cup which will be held in Russia.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday that the decision to scale back British-Russian dialogue had been London's however, and had been groundless and untimely.
Johnson riled Russian officials before his visit by likening Russia to the ancient Greek city state of Sparta in an interview with Britain's Sunday Times newspaper, saying Moscow was ""closed, nasty, militaristic and anti-democratic - like Sparta.""
Zakharova has previously called Johnson unprofessional, organized an online cartoon competition that mocked him, and strongly disputed his assertions about Syria.

When asked before his trip what she made of Johnson's statements criticizing Moscow, Zakharova said they had caused only laughter in Russia and were not worth getting upset about because they had come from Boris Johnson.

The OPEC member is locked in a deep political and economic crisis, with more than 125 people killed during months of opposition protests earlier this year, drawing condemnation from the United States and Europe.
Meeting in Beijing, Wang told Jorge Arreaza that stability in Venezuela was not only in his own people's interests, it was also the common wish of the international community, including China, China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
""China wishes that Venezuela maintains its trend of returning to stability, and encourages the resolution of the problems that exist via dialogue and consultation within a legal framework,"" the ministry cited Wang as saying.
""Every country's right to go down a development path that accords with its national conditions should be respected,"" he added.
China and oil-rich Venezuela have a close diplomatic and business relationship, especially in energy. China has repeatedly brushed off widespread condemnation from the United States, Europe and others about the situation in the country.
Last month, China, along with Russia, Egypt and Bolivia, boycotted an informal public U.N. Security Council meeting on Venezuela organized by the United States.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she would not blindly obey the orders of Communist Party leaders in Beijing, while admitting the government has no way to suppress skyrocketing prices in one of the most expensive property markets in the world.
Lam was sworn in by Chinese President Xi Jinping in July as the former British colony celebrated 20 years of Chinese rule under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", which promises the city a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed in the mainland. 
While a recent poll shows the new chief executive is more popular than her predecessor, some accuse her of being a puppet of Beijing amid perceptions of Chinese meddling in Hong Kong's affairs. Specifically, they criticize her for pushing an arrangement that will allow Chinese officials to enforce Chinese laws in a high speed railway station due to open next year.
Lam, in an interview with the government-funded RTHK, said she was accountable to both the Hong Kong public and Beijing, but she would not blindly obey the central authorities.
""Being accountable doesn't mean you have to do everything you're told,"" Lam said. ""So you can't say you'll do whatever the Central Government (says).
""If the Central Government asks me to do something that I think is beyond what Hong Kong people can bear or against Hong Kong's developmental interests, then of course I have the duty to tell the Central Government and fight for a more favorable arrangement for Hong Kong.""
Lam also said she did not plan to kickstart legislation for a controversial national security law in 2018, and urged people not to ""demonize"" it. 
Asked about Hong Kong's red-hot property market, where prices have shot up more than 12 percent over the past year and are expected to climb another 10 percent in 2018, Lam said the government was helpless in reversing the trend.
""The government really has no ways to curb property prices... The government has introduced a few rounds of cooling measures, but they did not suppress prices, and quite the contrary now some people say these measures have pushed up prices.""
The government's mixed bag of tax and regulatory policies, on top of eight rounds of mortgage tightening measures by the city's defacto central bank since 2009, has effectively locked up supply in the secondary housing market.
Lam also said that while she has never promised to suppress property prices, she would seek more land to boost long-term housing supply.
""I've never said I want to turn around the increase in property prices, because there are many factors contributing to that. But I want to turn around how supply falls short of demand, or, simply put, insufficient supply,"" Lam said.

It said the investigation, focused on the capital Ankara and spread across nine provinces, targeted serving officers in Turkey's gendarmerie force, which maintains security in rural areas. Other media carried similar reports.
More than 50,000 people, including security personnel and civil servants, have been jailed pending trial in the aftermath of the failed putsch, which the government blames on Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen. He has denied involvement.
Some 150,000 people have also been suspended or dismissed in a crackdown which rights groups say has been used as a pretext to muzzle dissent but which the government says has been necessary due to the security threats Turkey faces.

In a statement posted on its website, Jorge Madlos, alias Ka Oris, spokesman for the communist New People Army (NPA), said the truce would last from Saturday to Tuesday, when the group celebrates its 49th anniversary.
""All units of the NPA and the people's militias shall remain on active defensive mode in order to defend the people and revolutionary forces,"" Madlos said, adding the guerrillas will ""maintain a high degree of alertness and preparation against any hostile actions or movements by enemy armed forces"".
On Thursday, the defense department announced a truce over the same period to allow Filipinos to celebrate a ""stress-free"" Christmas season.
Both the government and the NPA have declared Christmas truces since the late 1980s when the two sides first agreed to peace talks, brokered by Norway. The tradition has continued even after negotiations stalled and now have been scrapped by President Rodrigo Duterte.
The NPA rebels, estimated to number around 3,000, have been fighting for nearly 50 years in a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people and stifled growth in resource-rich areas of the country.

Eight Australian men were charged with offences carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, police in Western Australia state said in a statement.
""We are striking at the top end of drug trafficking before it gets further down the distribution chain,"" Western Australia Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said.
The drugs were collected from a ship called the Valkoista, police said, and were then offloaded into a white hire van at a dock in Geraldton, about 375 km (230 miles) north of the Western Australia capital, Perth.
Tactical police intercepted the van as it reversed away from the dock.
Police arrested the van's three occupants, all from the eastern Australian state of New South Wales. Three others were arrested on the Valkoista and the remaining two were charged in Perth.
Police said they suspected the drugs were destined for Australia's more populous east coast.

911,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",China considers punishing those who slander heroes and martyrs,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is considering a law punishing those who slander heroes and martyrs or cause physical damage to their memorials, state news agency Xinhua said on Friday, the latest piece of legislation to protect the country's symbols of state.
Xi Jinping has ushered in new legislation aimed at securing China from threats both within and outside its borders since taking over as president in 2013, as well as presiding over a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech.
China's largely rubber stamp parliament amended its criminal law last month to extend punishments for publicly desecrating the national flag and emblem to include disrespecting the national anthem. Punishments include jail terms of up to three years.
The latest proposed legislation is aimed at protecting the reputation of martyrs - those who have given their lives for China or the Communist Party - and who are already publicly lauded in the country.
Memorials to those who fought against the Japanese during World War Two, or in the Chinese civil war against the Nationalists, and others are scattered across the country. School children learn about the feats of the most famous.
Xinhua said the new law would offer unspecified punishments to those who insult or slander heroes and martyrs or damage their memorials.
The law would also give a responsibility to the media and internet users to report any insults to the honor of martyrs, it said.
It is unclear when the proposal could be put into law, but Chinese laws normally go through at least two rounds of drafting before they are passed, meaning it could be some months away.
Party history is a sensitive subject in China because so much of the party's legitimacy rests on its position as claiming great historical achievements, such as leading China to victory over Japan during World War Two.
Disputes about party history already occasionally make it to Chinese courts.
A court ordered a former magazine editor to publicly apologize last year for two articles written in 2013 questioning the details of a well-known story about Communist soldiers fighting the Japanese in World War Two.
In the story, the five soldiers jumped off a cliff so the Japanese could not take them alive, although two of them survived.
The editor had expressed doubt about how many Japanese the Chinese soldiers killed, how the two survived and the location of the cliff.

President Xi Jinping has vowed that his war against graft in the ruling Communist Party will not ease until officials at all levels dare not, cannot and do not want to be corrupt.
Xi told top party leaders in October revision of the anti-graft architecture would include the scrapping of a controversial ""shuanggui"" system of secret interrogations, and the introduction of a new detention system.
Protection for detained suspects have been added to a draft national supervision law under review by the National People's Congress, China's legislature, according to the official Xinhua news agency. 
The latest version of the legislation says both families and employers of suspects must by notified within 24 hours of their detention, unless that might result in witness interference or evidence tampering, Xinhua reported.
Previously, either families or employers needed to be contacted and inspectors could keep a detention a secret if they feared any kind of interference, such as with witnesses or evidence.
Xinhua said physical checks of female suspects would be carried out by female workers under the new rules.
Rights groups have welcomed the proposed changes saying the old system allowed abuses and torture, but urged that the new system not simply repackage old ways.
The legislation is expected to be passed in March.
It will also legally empower a State Supervision Commission to oversee various anti-graft agencies and all civil servants.
Under the proposed new rules, assets frozen or seized from suspects and later found to be unrelated to the investigation should be unfrozen or returned within three days, Xinhua said.

Cases should be thrown out if no evidence of a crime is found, Xinhua said.

Authorities last month raised the alert status of Mount Agung in northeastern Bali to the highest level, imposing an exclusion zone of up to 10 km (6 miles) around its crater as it spewed clouds of ash, steam, and other volcanic material. 
Widodo will take the unusual step of gathering his cabinet in Bali as part of government efforts to assure visitors that the island is safe to come to and to stave off a major drop off in visitor numbers during the upcoming holiday season.
""For those who have plans to vacation in Bali, there's no need to doubt or be worried about the status of Mount Agung, Bali is very safe to visit,"" Energy Minister Ignasius Jonan said in a Twitter message after visiting an observatory overlooking the volcano, before the cabinet meeting.
President Widodo is expected to make a statement after the cabinet meeting.
The cabinet usually meets at the state palace in the capital Jakarta or on its outskirts in Bogor.
The relatively small island of Bali, famous for its beaches and temples, has an outsized importance for Indonesian tourism. In January-September, Bali received 4.5 million foreign tourist arrivals, nearly half of the 10.5 million arrivals in Indonesia.
Tourism Minister Arief Yahya said this week that Indonesia was expecting an estimated 15 trillion rupiah ($1.11 billion) in lost income and around 1 million fewer tourists because of the volcano, according to daily newspaper Kompas.
Many business operators and hotels have seen cancellations since authorities first raised the alert in September, and most expect the holiday season to be slower than in previous years.
Thousands of tourists were left stranded late last month when a volcanic ash cloud forced the closure of Bali's airport for several days.
Countries like Australia and Singapore have advised their citizens to be cautious when traveling to Bali.

Myanmar has detained at least 29 journalists in the 20 months since Suu Kyi came to power. While most have since been released on bail, the frequency of arrests - along with the detention last week of two Reuters reporters - has rekindled worries among some journalists trying to cover violence in Rakhine State.
""There are too many risks being added to journalists,"" said Sonny Swe, chief executive officer and co-founder of Yangon-based magazine Frontier. ""I feel that we are not moving forward, but going back in time for freedom of press and speech.""
As of December, there were five reporters, including the Reuters pair, behind bars.
Reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo - who had worked on Reuters coverage of the crisis in Rakhine - were arrested on Dec. 12 in Yangon. The Ministry of Information said they had ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"". They face up to 14 years in prison under the Official Secrets Act.
Myanmar authorities have said the case has nothing to do with press freedom.
""There are different views, based on where you stand ... There's press freedom in Myanmar as long as you follow the rules and regulations,"" Kyaw Soe, director general of the Ministry of Information, told Reuters by phone on Thursday. He declined to comment further.
A vibrant domestic media has sprung up since the transition from military rule began in 2011 and pre-publication censorship was lifted in 2012.
Nevertheless, this year Myanmar was ranked 131 out of 180 nations for press freedom by Reporters Without Borders - in the bottom third, but ahead of seven countries in the region: Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Laos and Vietnam.
""The authorities continue to exert pressure on the media and even intervene directly to get editorial policies changed,"" Reporters Without Borders said in a report this year.
Kyaw Zwa Moe, editor of Irrawaddy's English edition, said in a commentary last week that Myanmar does have press freedom, ""but with an invisible line"".
""No one can know where that line is because it's unseen. When you touch or cross it, you're finished,"" he wrote.
PRESS FREEDOM, SOMETIMES
Although she is Myanmar's de facto leader, Suu Kyi is forced to share power with the military, which runs security-related ministries and the police. 
Suppression of the media has hardened, rights groups say, since October 2016, when Rohingya Muslim militants attacked security posts in Rakhine state, triggering a military crackdown that right groups say included killings, rape and arson.
After further strikes by insurgents on Aug. 25, the military campaign intensified, touching off a mass exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh, where more than 800,000 now live in refugee camps. 
Some local journalists say they cannot report independently from Rakhine State due to harassment and threats from both the authorities and local people, while foreign reporters are denied access to the conflict zone.
When Moe Myint, a 29-year-old journalist for the online news site Irrawaddy heard about their arrest, his first thought was: ""It could've been me"".
""What if the police found out that I carry any controversial document?"" he said. ""It's a deliberate arrest in order to muzzle media coverage on conflicts in northern Rakhine.""
Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for New York-based Human Rights Watch, said Suu Kyi has ""shown scant understanding of the role an independent press plays in a democracy"".
""The ethnic cleansing in Rakhine state has made the government even more intolerant,"" he said.
Suu Kyi's spokesman, Zaw Htay, declined to comment on Myanmar's press freedom, but he told Reuters on Sunday: ""Your reporters are protected by the rule of the law.""
""FAKE NEWS""
Myanmar has denied most allegations against its security forces in Rakhine, rejecting charges by the United Nations, the United States and others that a campaign of ""ethnic cleansing"" was waged against the Rohingya.
The authorities have accused international media of putting out ""fake news"" about rights abuses in Rakhine and of ""working hand-in-glove"" with insurgents.
In October last year, spokesman Zaw Htay singled out English-language newspaper Myanmar Times special investigations editor Fiona MacGregor for criticism on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
Days later MacGregor, who had written a report about alleged gang rape by soldiers, was sacked by the paper.
When contacted this week, MacGregor declined to add to the comment she made in an interview with Reuters last year, when she said it was ""unacceptable that representatives of the democratically elected government would use social media and bullying tactics to suppress stories"".
Zaw Htay said at the time that he was sorry she had been fired. He said he had ""just highlighted she didn't reach other reliable sources and it led to a one-sided news article based on unreliable sources"".
Rights monitors say the erosion of press freedoms has not been limited to coverage of the Rakhine crisis. 
Since April 2016, 21 journalists have been charged or arrested under a telecommunications law that broadly prohibits the use of telecommunications networks to ""extort, defame, disturb or intimidate"". Critics say it is used to curb criticism of the authorities and reporting of corruption.

Suu Kyi's spokesman did not respond to further Reuters requests for comment.

President Xi Jinping has amassed power since taking office five years ago, tightening party control over all aspects of life and locking up rights activists and dissidents on subversion charges. 
Xi has also gone after competing power bases by jailing opponents for corruption, including the powerful former domestic security chief Zhou Yongkang and the popular one-time party boss of Chongqing, Bo Xilai.
The party under Xi's leadership has repeatedly warned that it will not tolerate dissenting voices, and the official People's Daily struck a firm note in pressing home that message against a phenomenon it termed ""de-centralism"".
""De-centralism is a way of thinking and behaving where each goes their own way, with only freedom and no discipline, only thinking of acting alone and ignoring everyone else,"" the paper wrote in a commentary.
""It is an extreme expression of individualism, and in its essence it's anarchy,"" it added.
The government has previously accused some of its disgraced former top officials, including Zhou and Bo, of seeking to establish ""independent kingdoms"". Both men are currently serving life terms for corruption.
Bo was well-known for his populist policies, including a high-profile crackdown on organized crime, investments in flashy infrastructure projects and quasi-Maoist practices like organizing mass sing-alongs praising the party.
Chongqing, one of China's most important cities and located in the country's southwest, has remained a hotbed of intrigue. Another former party boss, Sun Zhengcai, is currently awaiting trial in his own corruption scandal. He too is accused of paying lip service to orders from Beijing.
The People's Daily said that some party officials were too ""free and undisciplined"" in their thinking.
""Add to that is the encroachment of individualism, hedonism and the worship of money. A small number of these people slip into the morass of de-centralism and cannot extract themselves,"" it said.

Party members must do as they are told, as that is the only way to guarantee the authority of the central leadership, the paper added.

916,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 11:50PM ET</span>",Kansai Electric to scrap two reactors in latest blow for Japan's nuclear sector,"By Osamu Tsukimori
TOKYO (Reuters) - Kansai Electric Power Co said on Friday it will decommission two 38-year-old reactors at its Ohi nuclear plant as Japan's electricity industry struggles to cope with new safety standards imposed after the 2011 Fukushima disaster.
The widely expected announcement brings to 14 the number of reactors being scrapped since the meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. More than six years on, Japan is still turning away from nuclear power in the face of technical problems, public opposition, court challenges and unfavorable economics.
Most of Japan's reactors remain shut, with only four operating, while they undergo relicensing processes in a bit to meet new standards set after the Fukushima crisis highlighted shortcomings in regulation.
Kansai Electric will now scrap the No. 1 and No. 2 reactors at the Ohi plant, some 86 kilometers (53 miles) from Osaka, western Japan, where the utility is based. Shut since 2011, the reactors have capacity of 1,175 megawatts each, began operations in 1979 and were near the end of their standard operating life of 40 years.
A Kansai Electric spokeswoman said that costs in meeting the new safety standards were not a factor behind the decision, but technical difficulties were.
""The containment vessels of these reactors are smaller than other reactors in Japan, and a need to beef up the walls to meet the standards would make the work zones even more cramped, making it difficult for prompt repairs in case of troubles,"" the spokeswoman said.
The move means Japan is likely to soon be eclipsed by China as the third biggest nuclear power sector in the world - by reactor numbers - after the United States and France.
Japan now has 42 reactors, including the two to be decommissioned at Ohi, compared with 38 in China, which has nearly 20 more under construction, while the U.S. and France have 99 and 58 respectively, according to the International Energy Agency.
Kansai Electric was the most reliant on nuclear energy among Japan's atomic operators, using reactors for nearly half of its electricity generation before the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, when reactors melted down following a giant earthquake and tsunami. Two other reactors at the Ohi site remain closed.
While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government is keen to restore a power source that provided about a third of electricity supply before the Fukushima crisis, Japan's public remains deeply skeptical over industry assurances on safety.
Anti-nuclear campaigners and residents are increasingly using courts to block restarts and push for plants to close.
A Japanese court last week ordered Shikoku Electric Power Co not to restart one of its reactors, overturning a lower court decision in the first instance of a higher court blocking the operation of nuclear plant.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pulled off a surprise victory against the opposition's bid to force him from power as a graft scandal rocks Latin America, with a motion in Congress falling eight votes short of the 87 needed to oust him.
Before hours of debate in Congress, Kuczynski called on lawmakers to set aside his defects to help defend Peru's democracy from what he deemed a hasty ""coup"" attempt staged by the right-wing opposition Popular Force party.
Popular Force, which emerged under an authoritarian movement in the 1990s, sought to remove Kuczynski from office on grounds he was ""morally unfit"" to govern after discovering his past business connections to a company at the center of the region's biggest graft scandal.
Kuczynski survived thanks to 19 votes against the motion, 21 abstentions and another 10 lawmakers who failed to show up. A motion to start the ""presidential vacancy"" proceedings passed with 93 votes last week.

The final vote - widely unexpected just a few days ago - capped a week of intense political uncertainty in the world's second-biggest copper producer and one of Latin America's most stable and robust economies.

REAL, Philippines (Reuters) - The Philippines' coast guard said on Friday it had rescued 252 passengers and crew, including an Australian and his Filipino wife, and recovered five dead people from a ferry that capsized east of the capital Manila.
A Philippine vessel capsized on Thursday because of bad weather, highlighting frequent boat accidents in the Southeast Asian nation that is composed of more than 7,000 islands.
The Philippine Coast Guard has confirmed five deaths while 252 passengers including an Australian and his Filipino wife, were rescued, said spokesman Captain Arm and Balilo.
""All the passengers and crew are accounted for but as I have said we will re-evaluate based on the claims of the families of the missing passengers,"" Balilo told Reuters. The vessel was carrying 257 passengers and crew.
The boat left the port around 9 a.m. and capsized an hour later due to strong winds and giant waves.
A survivor said the passengers panicked when the boat started to take in water and went to one side, causing the ferry to tilt and capsize.
""The others waited on top of the ship while it was sinking, but I didn't do that because I know the ship will break down and I want to avoid getting hurt by that,"" Rene Ebuenga, a rescued passenger told Reuters. ""That's dangerous and the big waves can slam debris to your body.""
The ferry capsized and sank about 5 miles off Quezon province, east of the capital on the main northern island of Luzon.
The Philippine Coast Guard said it will conduct an inquiry to determine the cause of the incident and to verify possible oil spills.
In 1987, nearly 5,000 people died in the world's worst peacetime shipping disaster when an overloaded passenger ferry Dona Paz collided with an oil tanker off Mindoro island in the central Philippines.
Tropical storm Tembin, packing center winds of 80 kmh (49 mph), made landfall on the southern island of Mindanao early Friday. It weakened after hitting the land mass, the weather bureau said on Friday.

But, the weather agency warned of extensive flooding and landslides until the storm exits the Philippines on Sunday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government approved a record military budget on Friday but did not earmark enough extra money to stop a splurge on U.S.-made ballistic missile defense kit from putting a squeeze on funding for an ambitious domestic jet fighter project.
Japan's defense outlays for the year starting April 1 will rise for a sixth straight year, increasing by 1.3 percent to 5.19 trillion yen ($45.76 billion), according to a budget breakdown published by the government. The biggest ticket item is 137 billion yen to reinforce defenses against a possible North Korean ballistic missile attack. 
That includes purchases of a new longer range interceptor, the SM-3 Block IIA, designed to strike ballistic missiles in space, upgrades for the Patriot missile batteries that are the last line of defense against incoming warheads and preparations for the construction of two ground-based Aegis radar stations.
Japan will also spend 2.2 billion yen to begin acquiring medium-range air-launched cruise missiles able to strike sites in North Korea in a bid to deter any potential attack by Pyongyang, which continues to test ballistic missiles.
""It is essential that we have the latest, most capable equipment to bolster our defenses,"" Japanese Minister of Defence Intsunori Onodera said after he and other Cabinet members approved the new spending plan. 
The latest rocket launched by the North on Nov. 29 reached an altitude of more than 4,000 km (2,485 miles) before plunging into the Sea of Japan. 
A spending spree on mostly U.S.-made equipment means Japan's defense planners are being forced to curtail domestic programs that would help local defense contractors such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries maintain their military industrial base. That may force Japan to curtail its long-held ambition to build an advanced stealth fighter, dubbed the F-3.
In November, U.S. President Donald Trump called on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to buy more U.S.-made weapons as his administration pushes Washington's allies to contribute more to their joint defense.
Japan plans to allocate 279 billion yen of its next budget to buy defense equipment through the U.S. government's Foreign Military Sales system, 15 percent more than the current budget and more than double the amount spent in year that ended March 31, 2015. 
People who spoke to Reuters in November said Japan will delay a decision to develop the F-3, which is meant to counter military technology advances by China, putting on hold a project estimated to be worth more than $40 billion.
The latest defense spending plans provide the first concrete public indication that pause is underway.
A budget request submitted in August earmarked 7.4 billion yen for a new large jet engine test facility that Japan's defense ministry will need to test a prototype F-3 engine. That item was not included in the budget approved on Friday.
A proposed 2.4 billion for other F-3 research was also trimmed to 1.6 billion yen.

""Money is being spent in other areas and this is a sign that the government sees the F-3 as a low priority,"" a Japanese defense ministry official said. He asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Nearly half the 19 people injured when a driver with no known extremist links plowed into pedestrians in the southern city of Melbourne were foreign nationals, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday.
Police allege that the 32-year-old Australian man, a refugee from Afghanistan, had a history of mental illness and drove a car into Christmas shoppers on one of the busiest roads in Australia's second-largest city on Thursday.
The incident was a chilling reminder of attacks using vehicles in cities around the world. Four people were killed in a similar incident in Melbourne in January.
Turnbull and police said the driver had no known ties to extremist organizations, although they also said he had spoken of the perceived mistreatment of Muslims after his arrest.
Police have yet to interview, charge or identify the man.
Turnbull said nine of the victims were foreign nationals. He did not specify their nationalities but Australian media reported they included people from China, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, South Korea and Venezuela.
""This is a shocking incident to occur just on the eve of Christmas but we will not be cowed by it,"" Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.
Four people were killed and more than 20 injured in January when a man deliberately drove into pedestrians just a few hundred meters away from Thursday's attack. That was also not designated as a terror attack.
RETURN TO NORMAL
Police had cordoned off the area immediately after the incident but roads in central Melbourne were open and trams were operating as usual on Friday morning.
Reuters witnesses reported a heavy police presence around exits from nearby Flinders Street train station, with trauma support and Red Cross workers in the area. Department store staff said foot traffic was down from the day before.
""It's definitely quieter,"" said a saleswoman at a beauty counter in the David Jones department store, who declined to give her name.
""More people are coming in from the back entrance. I think they're trying to avoid Flinders Street Station,"" she said.
Workers at Walker's Doughnuts, which overlooks the site of the incident, said business was normal.
""We thought it would be less, but we're very busy,"" said store worker Bindu Kaki.
Police vehicles lined the streets and volunteers for the Victorian Council of Churches in Australia stood in high- visibility shirts with labels reading ""personal support"".
Community group the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Victoria issued a statement denouncing the incident and offering to donate blood to victims.
""As Australian Muslims it is not just a moral but also a religious duty to condemn in the strongest possible terms (the) horrific and senseless act of violence,"" it said.

Police said a second man arrested at the scene was released and was expected to be charged with possession of cannabis and a controlled weapon, although those offences were not linked to the car incident.

The United States and Britain implemented curbs on electronic items in the cabin in March on direct flights from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia in response to unspecified security threats.

922,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 07:36PM ET</span>","Pence visits Afghanistan, says U.S. will 'see this through'","By Jeff Mason
KABUL (Reuters) - Vice President Mike Pence made an unannounced trip to Afghanistan to meet its leaders and underscore U.S. commitment to the country four months after President Donald Trump agreed to an open-ended war against insurgents here.
Pence arrived on a military plane at Bagram Airfield under the cover of darkness on Thursday night after leaving Washington on Wednesday night. He then flew by helicopter to Kabul, where he met President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah at the presidential palace.
Pence told the leaders he hoped his presence there was tangible evidence that the United States was ""here to see this through.""
In a reversal of his campaign call for a swift withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, Trump in August pledged a stepped-up military campaign against Taliban insurgents and signaled the United States would send more troops to fight in what is the longest war in its history.
At the end of August, there were some 11,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan and more have since arrived.
Ghani expressed gratitude to the U.S. government and said Afghanistan's partnership with the United States was cemented in sacrifice.
Pence told reporters the strategy of increased troops on the ground and greater authorities for military leaders was paying dividends.
""The results are really beginning to become evident around the country,"" he said, adding that Ghani and Abdullah had said ""they've begun to see a sea change in the attitudes among the Taliban."" Pence said their hope was that ""eventually the enemy will tire of losing"" and be willing to talk peace.
Asked if more troops would be needed, Pence said that would be a decision for Trump in the days ahead.
Pence said he pressed the Afghan leaders for political reforms and Ghani assured him that an election commission was developing a framework for parliamentary elections in 2018.
Pence had originally planned to travel to Israel and Egypt this week, but he postponed that trip to remain in Washington while Congress passed legislation to overhaul U.S. tax law. 
The short visit to Afghanistan, originally part of the Middle East trip, was shrouded in secrecy for security reasons. Reporters traveling with the vice president were asked not to reveal his whereabouts until after the delegation arrived back at the air base from Kabul and Pence had addressed U.S. troops.
Pence almost did not make it to the presidential palace. The helicopters he and others were flying in came close to turning back to Bagram because of poor visibility, but the pilots were able to find a route in the end, a White House official said.
Pence, who coordinated the process that resulted in Trump's new Afghanistan policy, has been one of the main interlocutors between the White House and the Afghan leadership since Trump entered office in January. 
He repeated his promise of U.S. commitment to the region during remarks to troops at Bagram.
""Under President Donald Trump, the armed forces of the United States will remain engaged in Afghanistan until we eliminate the terrorist threat to our homeland, our people once and for all,"" Pence said.
Trump's views of the 16-year-long Afghan conflict have shifted since he came to power. 
As a presidential candidate he called for a swift withdrawal of U.S. forces, which were bogged down through the presidencies of Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama after a U.S.-led coalition overthrew the Islamist Taliban government for harboring al Qaeda militants who plotted the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington.
But Trump, while acknowledging the decision went against his instincts, argued in August that a hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for Islamic State and al Qaeda to fill. 
He declined to set a timeline for withdrawal or outline benchmarks for the new strategy's success.
Echoing Trump's comments when he unveiled the new strategy, Pence had sharp words for neighboring Pakistan, which he said had provided safe haven to the Taliban and other groups for too long. 
""Those days are over,"" Pence said. Pakistan had much to gain from partnering with the United States, and much to lose by harboring ""criminals and terrorists,"" he said at Bagram.
U.S. troops are involved in training Afghan security forces and carrying out counter-terrorism operations, hoping to reverse gains by the Taliban and prod it to negotiate for peace.

Some 2,400 U.S. forces have died in Afghanistan since the U.S.-led invasion.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 07:20PM ET</span>","Mexico prison population drops as police, prosecutors bungle cases","By Christine Murray and Lizbeth Diaz
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's prison population has fallen by a fifth from the peak in 2014 as fewer people are locked up under a new criminal justice system, with experts saying that cases are falling apart under a higher bar for police conduct and standards of evidence.
The number of people imprisoned has dropped 19.8 percent from a record of 258,563 in September 2014, according to the statistics from the National Security Commission (CNS), meaning for the first time in more than 20 years there are technically more beds than inmates.
The drop in the prison population has coincided with a spike in murders to record levels. Politicians have linked rising crime to the U.S.-backed 2008 reform, introduced to modernize Mexico's opaque and slow justice system.
It was adopted by many states by 2014 and was fully in force from mid-2016.
Data shows fewer people have been entering prison. Even justice experts who support the reform say police and prosecutors are struggling to make watertight cases due to a lack of training in the new system across the country. 
""They had eight years to make the transformation and they didn't do it,"" said Maria Novoa, a criminal justice expert at think tank Mexico Evalua. ""We don't have either the institutions or trained people.""
Novoa said police are not detaining people because they fear they could make mistakes and be held liable. She also said prosecutors are overusing a rule that allows suspects to face the criminal process at liberty rather than trying to ask a judge to detain them.
In 2016, 37 percent fewer people entered state prisons than in the prior year, according to the latest data from national statistics institute INEGI. And contrary to political rhetoric, fewer were also let out, the data shows.
Neither Mexico's attorney general's office nor the Federal Police returned a request for comment.
The 2008 reform moved Mexico to an adversarial justice system with oral trials from an inquisitive one mostly done on paper, with a deadline of June 2016.
It radically changed the role of the police and prosecutors, by giving police greater responsibility and raising the evidentiary standard that prosecutors must reach to get a conviction.
It also limits pre-trial detention, bringing an end to a practice where people were locked up for years without trial. 
In 2017, for the first time in more than 20 years, the country has enough space for all prisoners. But their uneven distribution across the country and a number of federal inmates in state facilities mean prisons in at least 13 states still have overcrowded facilities.
Think tank CIDAC estimated last year that the reform would take 11 years to take hold properly, due to lack of police training in high quality investigations.
""We always knew that for the new system to work people would have to be trained, but there was a lot of resistance and lack of interest from state governments,"" said Vicente Sanchez, a professor at the College of the Northern Border.

""Now governors and prosecutors blame the new system and want to undo it.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a U.S.-drafted resolution that seeks to toughen sanctions on North Korea in response to its latest intercontinental ballistic missile launch, diplomats said. 
The draft, seen by Reuters on Thursday, seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum product exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and demand the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad within 12 months. 
It would also cap crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year. The United States has been calling on China to limit its oil supply to its neighbor and ally. 
The text was circulated to the 15-member council on Thursday. While it was not immediately clear how China would vote, traditionally a draft on North Korea is not given to all members until it is agreed by Beijing and Washington.
The United States has been negotiating with China on the draft resolution for the past week, diplomats said. If adopted, it would be the 10th resolution imposing new sanctions on North Korea over its missile and nuclear programs since 2006.
To pass, a resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China.
The United States late last month warned North Korea's leadership it would be ""utterly destroyed"" if war were to break out after Pyongyang test-fired its most advanced missile, putting the U.S. mainland within range.
During a speech on Thursday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “stressed that nobody can deny the entity of the DPRK which rapidly emerged as a strategic state capable of posing a substantial nuclear threat to the U.S.,” according to North Korea's official KCNA news agency.
DPRK is the acronym for the country's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman visited Pyongyang earlier this month - the first senior U.N. official to do so since 2011 - and said North Korean officials did not commit to talks, but he believes he left ""the door ajar.""
The U.S.-drafted resolution repeats previous language by reaffirming the council's ""support for the Six Party Talks, calls for their resumption."" So-called six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program stalled in 2008.
In a bid to further choke North Korea's external sources of funding, the draft resolution also seeks to ban North Korean exports of food products, machinery, electrical equipment, earth and stone, including magnesite and magnesia; wood; and vessels. 
It would ban exports to North Korea of industrial equipment, machinery, transportation vehicles, and industrial metals. 
The draft resolution would subject 19 new North Koreans and the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces to a global asset freeze and travel ban. 
It also seeks to allow countries to seize, inspect and freeze any vessel in their ports or territorial waters that they believe was carrying banned cargo or involved in prohibited activities.
Separately, China and Russia on Thursday asked for more time to consider a U.S. proposal to blacklist 10 ships for transporting banned items from North Korea, diplomats said. It was unclear how much more time would be given.
The vessels are accused of ""conducting illegal ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels or illegally transporting North Korean coal to other countries for exports,"" the United States said in its proposal.

Countries are required to ban blacklisted ships from entering their ports. The council's North Korea sanctions committee in October designated four ships as banned for carrying coal from North Korea.

Once there, she looked for ways to humanize the plight of more than 2 million people trying to survive the famine amid fields of withered crops and the brittle skeletons of livestock. 
See the photographs https://widerimage.reuters.com/photographer/zohra-bensemra
In a makeshift camp for displaced people, Bensemra met Zeinab, a 14-year-old girl forced to marry an older man offering $1,000 as her dowry. Zeinab had wanted to become an English teacher, but that small fortune made it possible for her extended family to travel to a Somali town on the Ethiopian border where international aid agencies providing food for drought refugees.
Bensemra found similar stories during a nearly two-week trip through the Horn of Africa. “Photography opens eyes to what’s going on in the world,” says Bensemra, who was named agency photographer of the year by the Guardian, a U.K.-based newspaper. “It’s not about nationalism or religion but about human beings.” 
The Guardian recognized Bensemra’s 2017 work covering some of the planet’s most dire situations: the fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria; the Rohingya refugee crisis; and the drought in Somalia, among others.

In Bensemra’s role as an eyewitness to war, human rights abuses and other atrocities, she says it is crucial to remain unbiased. “It’s important to stay neutral if we want people to believe us and trust us,” Bensemra says. “We have to be in the middle. We don’t take sides.”
Based in Algeria, Bensemra says she believes being a woman in the field has its advantages. For one, people are more likely to open up to her and share their stories. 

One of her most memorable photographs of the year shows an exhausted Khatla Ali Abdallah, 90, fleeing a battle with Islamic State outside Mosul in February. Bensemra had tears in her eyes as she shot the photograph, imagining the woman as her own grandmother, but unable to help. “When you see people suffering and living very, very hard lives, I imagine myself in their place,” she says.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - More than 120 countries defied President Donald Trump on Thursday and voted in favor of a United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its recent recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that voted in favor. A total of 128 countries backed the resolution, which is non-binding, nine voted against and 35 abstained. Twenty-one countries did not cast a vote. 
Trump's threat appeared to have some impact, with more countries abstaining and rejecting the resolution than usually associated with Palestinian-related resolutions.
Nevertheless, Washington found itself isolated as many of its Western and Arab allies voted for the measure. Some of those allies, like Egypt, Jordan and Iraq, are major recipients of U.S. military or economic aid, although the U.S. threat to cut aid did not single out any country.
A spokesman for Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the vote ""a victory for Palestine."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the vote. 
Earlier this month, Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy by announcing the United States recognized Jerusalem - home to major Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites - as the capital of Israel and would move its embassy there.
""The United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the 193-member General Assembly ahead of Thursday's vote.
""We will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world's largest contribution to the United Nations, and so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit,"" she said.
Later on Thursday, Haley asked the 64 countries who voted no, abstained or did not cast a vote to come to a Jan. 3 reception ""to thank you for your friendship to the United States,"" according to the invitation seen by Reuters. 
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who were furious over Trump’s move. The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the full city.
French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre said in a statement: ""The resolution adopted today only confirms relevant international law provisions on Jerusalem."" France voted in favor. 
'PREPOSTEROUS'
Netanyahu described the resolution as ""preposterous."" ""Jerusalem is our capital, always was, always will be. But I do appreciate the fact that a growing number of countries refuse to participate in this theater of the absurd,"" he said in a video on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Israel captured East Jerusalem in a 1967 war and Palestinians want it as the capital of a future state they seek.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet the vote was a clear international rejection of the Trump administration's ""thuggish intimidation.""
Among countries that abstained were Argentina, Australia, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda. 
Guatemala, Honduras, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo joined the United States and Israel in voting no.
Honduras’ vote against the motion comes after the United States signaled it would recognize President Juan Orlando Hernandez as the winner of an election the Organization of America States said should be scrapped over fraud claims. 
Since Trump’s election, Mexico has aligned its foreign policy more closely with Washington in what diplomats say is an attempt to curry favor in face of threats to withdraw from the NAFTA free trade agreement. 
Trump's rhetoric on cutting aid startled some U.S. allies but State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Thursday's vote was just one factor that Washington would take into consideration in its foreign policy.
""I just wanted to reiterate what the president had said yesterday and that that was the U.N. vote is really not the only factor that the administration would take into consideration in dealing with our foreign relations and countries who have chosen to vote one way or the other,"" she told reporters.
According to figures from the U.S. government's aid agency USAID, in 2016 the United States provided some $13 billion in economic and military assistance to countries in sub-Saharan Africa and $1.6 billion to states in East Asia and Oceania.
It provided some $13 billion to countries in the Middle East and North Africa, $6.7 billion to countries in South and Central Asia, $1.5 billion to states in Europe and Eurasia and $2.2 billion to Western Hemisphere countries, according to USAID.
The General Assembly vote was called at the request of Arab and Muslim countries after the United States vetoed the same resolution on Monday in the 15-member U.N. Security Council.
The remaining 14 Security Council members voted in favor of the Egyptian-drafted resolution, which did not specifically mention the United States or Trump but which expressed ""deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem.""
Thursday's resolution ""affirms that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded.""
The U.N. action comes a year after the Security Council adopted a resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements.

That was approved with 14 votes in favor and an abstention by former U.S. President Barack Obama's administration, which defied heavy pressure from longtime ally Israel and Trump, who was then president-elect, for Washington to wield its veto.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Tearful family members paid tribute to Canadian pharmaceutical billionaires and philanthropists Barry and Honey Sherman before thousands of people on Thursday, less than a week after news of the couple’s mysterious deaths shocked the nation.
The Shermans were found hanging by belts around their necks from a railing beside a pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion, a friend of the family told Reuters. 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended the memorial service in Toronto, as did hundreds of Apotex Inc employees wearing blue, the official color of Barry Sherman's company. 
The Sherman's son Jonathan began an emotional eulogy by saying the family was frustrated with the way Toronto police have handled the case, referencing Canadian media reports that said investigators were working on the theory that Barry Sherman, 75, had killed his 70-year-old wife and then himself.
“We've had to navigate through a terrifying maze of non-information and unfounded speculation,” Jonathan Sherman said. ""I kept expecting my parents to walk through the front door and say, 'Everything will be fine. We’ve taken control of the situation.'""
Police have confirmed that the Shermans died of ligature strangulation and that there were no signs of forced entry to the couple’s home. 
Homicide detectives are leading the investigation, but the deaths have not been declared a homicide. Police have not detained any suspects and have not said if they are looking for any.
Family, friends, colleagues and political leaders remembered Barry Sherman as a brilliant man.

RUSAPE, Zimbabwe (Reuters) - The last time white Zimbabwean farmer Rob Smart left his land it was at gunpoint, forced out in June by riot police armed with tear gas and AK-47 assault rifles.
He returned on Thursday to ululations and tears of joy from former workers and their families who were also kicked out - a jubilant return and the first sign that the president who has replaced Robert Mugabe is making good on a vow to stop illegal land seizures and restore property rights.
Scores of jubilant black Zimbabweans nearly knocked the 71-year-old off his feet as he and his two children stepped out of their car and onto their land for the first time in six months.
Smart's case was taken up by Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe's then vice-president who heard of Smart's violent eviction while at an investment conference in Johannesburg. 
Mnangagwa became president last month following a de facto coup that ended 93-year-old Mugabe's rule. In the latter half of his 37 years in power, Zimbabwe's economy collapsed, especially after the seizure of thousands of white-owned commercial farms under the banner of post-colonial land reform. [L8N1OE2E7]
Land ownership is one of Zimbabwe's most sensitive political topics. Colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980 leaving many blacks effectively landless.
Twenty years later, Mugabe authorized the violent invasion of many white-owned farms and justified it on the grounds that it was redressing imbalances from the colonial era.
White farmers complained that well connected people used state security forces to force them off their farms, sometimes in the middle of harvesting, even after the Mugabe government indicated, some four years ago, that land seizures were over.
""We are overjoyed, over the moon. We thought we would never see this day coming,"" Smart's son, Darryn, told Reuters.
""Getting back to the farm has given not just us, but the whole community hope that it's a new Zimbabwe, a new country.""
Rob Smart, whose father said he started the farm from ""virgin bush"" in 1932, expressed confidence in the new government's pledge to protect the commercial farming sector, a mainstay of the struggling economy.
""It's early days but so far what they (the new government) said they are going to do they are doing,"" he told Reuters.
""We just hope this whole incident will give hope to other farmers, who've had the same situation.""
""NO CONFUSION""
Mnangagwa, who is under pressure to revive the economy ahead of elections next year, said on Thursday that he was resolute about the changes he was introducing. 
""There is no business as usual. Things have changed, it's a new era,"" he said at a meeting with business leaders in South Africa. 
""I'm from the military. If it's 'left turn' then it's 'left turn'. If it's 'right turn' it's 'right turn'. No confusion.""
Mnangagwa's new agriculture minister, Perrance Shiri, last week ordered illegal occupiers of farms to vacate the land immediately, a move that could ultimately see some white farmers who say they were unfairly evicted return to farming.
Shiri, a military hardliner who was head of the air force before being picked for the crucial ministry this month, called for ""unquestionable sanity on the farms"".
For 83-year-old Anna Matemani, whose late husband worked on the farm, Smart's return was long overdue. 
""I'm so happy he is finally back. He always helped us and the farm provides jobs for many of our young people,"" said the grandmother of 15, who grew up and raised her children on the farm and witnessed Rob's birth, wiping away tears. 
Some of the Smarts' joy subsided as they walked into their ransacked farmhouses. 
The occupiers had looted property, including clothes, the children's toys, three guns, bottles of 100-year-old wine and Smart's late father Roy's medals from when he served with the Police Reserve Air Wing in the former Rhodesia.
""I'm sad about my grandfather's medals,"" Darryn Smart said, surveying a ransacked room.

""You can buy tables and chairs, you can't buy that family history. But thank goodness we're here.""

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - South Sudan's government and rebel groups signed a ceasefire on Thursday in the latest attempt to end a four-year civil war and allow humanitarian groups access to civilians caught in the fighting.
The ceasefire aims to revive a 2015 peace deal that collapsed last year after heavy fighting broke out in South Sudan's capital Juba. It was agreed after talks in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa convened by regional bloc IGAD.
A decision by President Salva Kiir to sack his deputy Riek Machar triggered the war in the world's youngest country. The war has been fought largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to Kiir, who is Dinka, and Machar, who is Nuer.
Tens of thousands have died and a third of the population of 12 million have fled their homes. The conflict has since mutated from a two-way fight into one involving multiple parties and this has made it harder to find peace.
Representatives of Kiir and Machar were both present at the signing.
South Sudan's Information Minister Michael Makuei Leuth told journalists: ""The cessation of hostilities will be effective 72 hours from now. As of now, we will send messages to all the commands in the field to abide by this cessation of hostilities. 
""From now onwards, there will be no more fighting,"" he added. ""Just talks.""
""I do hope in signing this agreement, you will try to put an end to this tragedy .... This is an encouraging first phase,"" said Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairperson of the African Union Commission.
Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Workneh Gebeyehu, also present, said: ""There is no longer any excuse for the violations of human rights. All parties are obliged to observe cessation of hostilities agreement.
Diplomats at the talks told Reuters the next phase of the negotiations would now center on thrashing out a revised power-sharing arrangement leading up to a new date for polls.
The United States, Britain and Norway, which form a group that supported a 2005 accord leading to the independence of South Sudan from Sudan, welcomed the agreement.
""The troika ... congratulate the parties on their willingness to compromise for the benefit of the people of South Sudan and hope that they immediately take action to make good on that agreement,"" they said in a statement issued by the U.S. State Department.

MOSCOW/GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. special envoy on Syria Staffan de Mistura said on Thursday he would take part in the latest round of Syrian peace talks in the Kazakh capital Astana on Friday, with a month to go before he hopes to break the deadlock in political talks in Geneva.
De Mistura's Geneva peace process reached deadlock this month, missing what said was a ""golden opportunity"" to close out almost seven years of war.
Blaming intransigence on both sides, he told the U.N. Security Council he would start 2018 with a proposal to involve a wider constituency in constitutional and electoral reform, since the warring sides were stuck.
He said on Thursday he planned to hold the next round in Geneva in the second half of January. 
""I am planning to go to Astana just after this meeting,"" de Mistura said in Moscow at the start of Syrian talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.
U.N. timetables routinely slip, but the presence of many of the global power elite at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos on Jan. 23-26 could also create some political momentum.
Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have made big gains on the ground since Russia joined the war in late 2015, but the fighting shows no sign of ending conclusively. 
De Mistura's humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland said that although fewer people were now under siege or out of reach of humanitarian aid, 2017 had defied expectations by being worse than 2016 in many respects, and fewer aid convoys were going in.
""In December we haven’t reached a single soul (in besieged areas),"" Egeland told reporters in Geneva.
He hoped Astana might bring a cessation of hostilities in the rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta, where Assad's forces are besieging almost 400,000 people. U.N. aid convoys are waiting for Syria's government to give them a green light. Food prices have risen eightfold since August, Egeland said. 
""495 people were on the priority lists for medical evacuations. That number is going down. Not because we are evacuating people, but because they are dying.""
Russia, Iran, China, Egypt, Algeria and Iraq could all bring their influence to bear, he said. 

""If we are going to get out of this quagmire it is because there will be political agreements, really. So I hope that out of the Astana meetings in the next couple of days we will have some kind of impulse for a change on the humanitarian side.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - North Carolina sued  Insys Therapeutics Inc  (O:INSY) on Thursday, accusing the pharmaceutical company of illegally pushing a powerful fentanyl-based cancer pain medicine called Subsys to boost profits amid the U.S. opioid epidemic.
The lawsuit announced by North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein comes amid a federal investigation that has led to charges against several former executives accused of engaging in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys.
Stein accused Insys of paying kickbacks to doctors to promote and prescribe Subsys for uses other than treating cancer pain and of deceiving insurers into covering prescriptions for the company's product.
""As we allege in our complaint, Insys carried out an extensive, coordinated scheme of kickbacks, deception and fraud in the marketing of its drug, Subsys,"" Stein said at a press conference in Raleigh, North Carolina that was streamed online.
Chandler, Arizona-based Insys did not respond to requests for comment. It has said that it has taken steps to prevent past mistakes from happening again and has stressed that Subsys made up 0.02 percent of opioid prescriptions in 2016.
Thursday's lawsuit, filed in a North Carolina state court, came as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that opioids were involved in 42,249 overdose deaths in 2016, up 28 percent from a year earlier.
Insys has found itself at the center of investigations focused on Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients that contains fentanyl, a synthetic opioid.
In October, federal prosecutors in Boston brought charges against billionaire Insys founder John Kapoor, adding him to a case filed last year against six former Insys executives and managers initially charged, including former Chief Executive Michael Babich.
Prosecutors said that beginning in 2012, Kapoor, Babich and others schemed to pay speaker fees and other bribes to medical practitioners to prescribe Subsys and to fraudulently induce insurers into approving payment for it. 
Kapoor, Babich and the others have pleaded not guilty. Several other ex-Insys employees and medical practitioners have also faced charges related to Subsys.
Insys has said it is in settlement talks with the U.S. Justice Department and has estimated the minimum amount it may have to pay is $150 million.
It previously agreed to pay $9.45 million to resolve investigations by attorneys general in Oregon, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Illinois. It also faces lawsuits by attorneys general in Arizona, New Jersey and New Mexico.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on 13 ""serious human rights abusers and corrupt actors"" including Myanmar general Maung Maung Soe, who oversaw this year's brutal crackdown against the Rohingya Muslim minority.
The U.S. government, applying penalties for the first time under a law passed last year, also targeted 39 other individuals and entities with sanctions that block their assets under U.S. jurisdiction, bar most Americans from dealing with them and largely cut them off from the global financial system.
The Treasury Department said those sanctioned included Benjamin Bol Mel, who has served as an adviser to South Sudan President Salva Kiir and is suspected of getting preferential treatment in government contracts. The list also included former Gambian leader Yahya Jammeh, accused of human rights abuses and corruption, and Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, accused of using his friendship with Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila to secure sweetheart mining deals.
Myanmar's government spokesman was not immediately available for comment on the U.S. sanctions.
Reuters has been unable to reach Jammeh for comment since he went to exile. He has previously denied ordering the torture or death of political opponents. His lawyer until exile, Edward Gomez, said earlier this year that he was unaware of any misspending of public or charity funds by Jammeh. 
Gertler has denied all allegations of impropriety and has said his investments in Congo have created thousands of jobs. A spokesman for his Amsterdam-based company the Fleurette Group was not immediately available for comment.
Myanmar's military cracked down on Muslim Rohingya from Rakhine state following Aug. 25 Rohingya militant attacks on an army base and police posts. Maung Maung Soe was in charge of the operation that drove more than 650,000 Rohingya to flee mostly Buddhist Myanmar to Bangladesh.
The United States on Nov. 22 called the Myanmar military operation against the Rohingya population ""ethnic cleansing"" and threatened targeted sanctions against those responsible.
The United States ""examined credible evidence of Maung Maung Soe's activities, including allegations against Burmese security forces of extrajudicial killings, sexual violence and arbitrary arrest as well as the widespread burning of villages,"" the Treasury Department said on Thursday.
Myanmar's army last month released a report denying all allegations of rape and killings by security forces, having days earlier replaced Maung Maung Soe. No reason was given for his transfer from the post.
'SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES'
""We must lead by example, and today's announcement of sanctions demonstrates the United States will continue to pursue tangible and significant consequences for those who commit serious human rights abuse and engage in corruption,"" U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement.
The sanctions against the 13 people described by the Treasury Department as ""serious human rights abusers and corrupt actors"" and the 39 ""affiliated individuals and entities"" were the first imposed under a U.S. law called the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.
Jammeh, who ruled Gambia for 22 years before being forced into exile after refusing to accept an election defeat, created a terror and assassination squad reporting to him called the Junglers that threatened, terrorized, interrogated and killed people he saw as a threat to his rule, the Treasury Department said.
The sanctions targeted Gertler, considered by diplomats to be a member of Kabila's innermost circle, 19 of his businesses and his Congo-based associate Pieter Deboutte.
The United States imposed sanctions this year and last against top Democratic Republic of Congo security officials over alleged human rights abuses and the failure to organize an election on time to choose Kabila's successor.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The funeral of Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned as Archbishop of Boston 15 years ago after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests, was held in the Vatican on Thursday without a mention of what led to his downfall.
About 200 people attended the funeral Mass in a chapel in the apse of St. Peter's Basilica and presided over by a senior cardinal, Angelo Sodano. The wooden coffin lay on the floor with an open book of the gospels resting on it.
Pope Francis entered the chapel for a few minutes after the Mass to bless the coffin and conduct a brief service known as the Final Commendation and Farewell - which he does for all cardinals who die in Rome.
""He dedicated his whole life to the Church,"" Sodano said in his homily in praise of Law, who died on Wednesday. 
Sodano listed the stages of Law's clerical life and said the late Pope John Paul had ""called him to Rome"" to be archpriest of a Rome basilica. But Sodano made no mention of the reason why he left Boston.
""Unfortunately, each of us can sometimes be lacking in our mission,"" Sodano said.
The pope read out a Latin prayer, part of which reads: ""May he be given a merciful judgement"".
About 15 cardinals attended, though not Law's successor in Boston, Cardinal Sean O'Malley. O'Malley said on Wednesday that Law served at a time ""when the Church failed seriously in its responsibilities ...""
Law was Archbishop of Boston for 18 years when he resigned on Dec. 13, 2002, climaxing a tumultuous year that sparked the greatest crisis in the history of the American Catholic Church.
A succession of devastating news stories by Boston Globe reporters showed how priests who sexually abused children had been moved from parish to parish for years under Law's tenure without parishioners or law authorities being informed.
Victims groups have expressed outrage that Law's funeral was being in St. Peter's and that he would be buried in a crypt in a chapel of the Rome Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, where he served as archpriest.
""Survivors of child sexual assault in Boston, who were first betrayed by Law's cover-up of sex crimes and then doubly betrayed by his subsequent promotion to Rome, were those most hurt,"" SNAP, a victim's group, said in a statement on Wednesday.
After Pope Francis left Thursday's funeral, two nuns in brown robes knelt by the coffin and arched over it to pray.
After the funeral, Cardinal Franc Rode of Slovenia praised Law as ""a good man with good intentions"".
""All these provisions about paedophilia were not as severe as they are now so one can't say that he made that many mistakes,"" Rode told Reuters Television, saying it was ""another era"". He did not elaborate.
About a half dozen ambassadors attended. The United States' official representative was Louis Bono, the current chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy to the Vatican.

U.S. Ambassador-designate Callista Gingrich and her husband Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House of Representatives, attended in a private capacity. Callista Gingrich officially becomes ambassador on Friday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's first ever rules on drones, which were tentatively agreed three weeks ago, risk being scuppered as EU governments hesitate over endorsing the deal because of their opposition to a drone registration requirement, among other issues.
European Union lawmakers and member states finally struck a tentative deal on a long-awaited reform of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on Nov. 30, which also includes rules requiring owners of drones to register their devices if ""dangerous"".
Such deals then need to be definitively endorsed by member states in the Council of the EU and lawmakers in the European Parliament before becoming law, something which is usually a formality.
Member states were supposed to endorse the EASA reform on Wednesday, but the vote was put off when several countries, including France and Germany, expressed major concerns about elements of the deal, such as the registration requirement for drones with a kinetic energy of more than 80 joules based on their mass and maximum speed.
A spokeswoman for Estonia, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said member states had until Friday to analyze the final text and say whether they could endorse it.
If the EASA reform is not endorsed it risks derailing the project for months to come as negotiations between the parliament and member states will have to start almost from scratch, over two years after the initial proposal was made.
The risk of the deal falling apart has unleashed a wave of lobbying from both the aerospace industry and pilots.
""The emerging market of civil drones, including small as well as larger certified category of drones, has many potentials for the EU aeronautical industry. It is therefore crucial that EASA has received the mandate to put in place the safety regulatory framework for the deployment of this new technology,"" the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe said in a statement ahead of Wednesday's meeting.
Members include plane manufacturer Airbus,  Safran  (PA:SAF), BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR).
Member states had opposed a registration requirement for drones throughout the negotiations, and the European Parliament had initially pushed for a registration threshold of 250 grams.
Many countries fear the 80 joules threshold is too complicated and are not happy with the compromise.
""I don't think there is one happy member state around the table,"" said one person involved in the discussions.
The German pilots union wrote to the German transport minister on Tuesday urging him to endorse the EASA deal. 
""Any delay through further negotiations - as some countries are apparently envisaging - would clearly not be in the interest of aviation safety,"" wrote Ilja Schulz, President of the Vereinigung Cockpit union.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York jury on Thursday began its second day of deliberations in the trial of a Turkish banker accused of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions.
The jury had begun deliberating on Wednesday following the three-week trial of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey's majority state-owned Halkbank.
At the center of the trial was explosive testimony from Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who pleaded guilty to charges of violating sanctions and testified for U.S. prosecutors.
Zarrab testified that Atilla helped design fraudulent transactions of gold and food that allowed Iran to spend its oil and gas revenues abroad, including through U.S. financial institutions, defying U.S. sanctions.
Zarrab also implicated Turkish officials in the scheme, including President Tayyip Erdogan.
Attempts to reach Erdogan’s spokesman for comment on the allegations at the trial have been unsuccessful. Erdogan has publicly dismissed the case as a politically motivated attack on his government.
Atilla, testifying in his own defense at the trial, denied all the charges against him.
Halkbank has denied taking part in any illegal transactions.
U.S. prosecutors charged nine people in the criminal case, though only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, were arrested by U.S. authorities.

DUBAI/KHOBAR (Reuters) - London-listed NMC Healthcare is in talks with the Riyadh government to take over the running of a struggling Saudi hospital, according to four sources familiar with the matter.
A deal for the Saad Specialist Hospital in Khobar, one of the top cancer treatment facilities in the Gulf, would be a rare instance of a foreign group operating a Saudi hospital. 
It would be a test of Riyadh's plan to bring overseas investors into the healthcare sector under a reform drive, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aimed at restructuring the kingdom's economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue.
The Saudi health ministry has asked interested parties to submit bids for the operational license by the end of this month, said the sources who declined to be named as the discussions are confidential. UAE-based NMC is involved in the process and is considered a frontrunner to win the contract, they added.
The 750-bed hospital is owned by Saad Group, a conglomerate owned by billionaire tycoon Maan al-Sanea which also operated the facility. But in recent weeks the government has stepped in after the hospital become weighed down by financial problems, said the sources. 
The hospital had effectively ceased operating - with the emergency room the last unit of the facility to close last month - due to debts which meant it was unable to pay salaries or contractors, according to the sources.
The government's intervention coincided with the detention of the al-Sanea by Saudi authorities for unpaid debts, sources have previously told Reuters.
NMC Healthcare and the Saudi health ministry were not immediately available to comment.
Saad Specialist is one of only two hospitals in the kingdom to have a cyclotron, used to help identify cancerous tumors. The ministry is keen to get it re-opened as quickly as possible.
It approached NMC and other healthcare companies a few weeks ago about taking over the running of the facility and conducted a site tour for potential bidders, which number around 10, according to the sources familiar with the matter. The sources did not name any other potential bidders. 
'VISION 2030'
Saad Specialist Hospital, which al-Sanea opened in 2001, gradually ground to a halt this year as staff began to leave, including doctors and nurses, because of non-payment of salaries, which in some cases dated back around one year, said the sources. 
In addition, contractors began to stop maintaining the high-tech medical equipment because of lack of payment, the sources said. 
At the peak of his business success in 2007, al-Sanea was ranked by Forbes as one of the world's 100 richest men, with his Saad Group owning interests in everything from banking to civil engineering.
But his empire has been embroiled in a high-profile debt dispute since 2009 spanning courts in London to the Cayman Islands, and Saudi authorities have recently begun liquidating some of his assets. 
Al-Sanea was detained in October in the kingdom's Eastern Province and he has been held in a civil detention center in Khobar, sources previously told Reuters. His detention was a few weeks before Prince Mohammed launched a corruption crackdown in which dozens of Saudi princes and businessmen are being held.
In an effort to get him released, Reemas Group, a financial consultancy hired by Saad Group, has outlined a proposed settlement covering $4 billion in debt, sources previously told Reuters. Reuters was not able to determine whether the plan includes any provision to repay hospital staff or contractors.
NMC Healthcare has $800 million available to start investing in 2018 in the Gulf and other markets, its CEO Prasanth Manghat said this week. ""We want to look at opportunities in Saudi Arabia,"" he said. ""It is a very strong market and the reforms happening there will give the healthcare sector a lot of momentum.""
The government is looking to bring in foreign investors to the healthcare sector as part of its ""Vision 2030"" plan.
But progress has been slow. 
The health ministry has put on hold its tender seeking financial advisers for the privatization of 55 primary healthcare units in Riyadh, a financial source familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month.

The rivals signed a deal brokered by Cairo on Oct. 12 after Hamas agreed to hand over administrative control of the Gaza Strip, including its border crossings with Egypt and Israel, a decade after seizing control of the enclave in a civil war.
The deal bridged a deep gulf between Abbas's Western-backed mainstream Fatah and Hamas, an Islamist movement designated a terrorist group by Western countries and Israel. But continued disputes have delayed its implementation. 
Yehya Al-Sinwar, Hamas's chief in Gaza and a key architect of the unity agreement, offered a bleak outlook on Thursday, suggesting the deal could suffer a similar fate to numerous reconciliation attempts over the past decade.
""The reconciliation project is falling apart. Only a blind man can't see that,"" Sinwar said in comments published by pro-Hamas media.
One of the latest disputes came earlier this month when Hamas, according to Fatah officials, missed a milestone to complete the handover of Gaza to Abbas's West Bank-based government.
Hamas says it has given up all administrative control in Gaza.
Rami Al-Hamdallah, the prime minister, said Hamas had not transferred moneys as agreed, while Hamas said Hamdallah's government had not paid salaries in Gaza as agreed.
Sinwar in the past has said his group would not go back to governing Gaza and that he was committed to making the deal succeed.
Fatah officials declined immediate comment.
""Reconciliation is collapsing because some people want to get from it the relinquishing of arms and the closing of tunnels,"" said Sinwar without elaborating, but in apparent reference to Fatah.
During the last Gaza war, in 2014, Hamas fighters used dozens of tunnels to blindside Israel’s superior forces and threaten civilian communities near the frontier.

Israel and the United States have called for Hamas to be disarmed as part of the pact between it and the Palestinian Authority, so that Israeli peace efforts with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which collapsed in 2014, can proceed. Hamas has rejected the demand.

Senators passed the last of three bills which critics say limit the independence of magistrates and which have triggered street protests across Romania, widely regarded as one of the EU's most corrupt states.
The three bills change the process of appointing chief prosecutors and set up a special unit to probe crimes committed by magistrates, making them the only professional category with a prosecuting unit dedicated to investigating them.
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden said in a joint statement from their embassies in Bucharest that the bills and criminal code changes under debate in parliament undermined Romania's progress on judicial reforms.
""We appeal to the parties involved in the justice reform project to avoid any action that could lead to weakening the independence of the justice system and of the fight against corruption,"" the joint statement said.
The seven states joined a chorus of criticism that included the European Commission, the U.S. State Department, thousands of Romanian magistrates and centrist President Klaus Iohannis.
Romania's ruling Social Democrats, which command an overwhelming majority in parliament together with their junior coalition partner, ALDE, have so far ignored the warnings. 
They are also working on changes to the criminal code that critics say will derail law and order.
Opposition politicians challenged the bills in the Constitutional Court on Thursday. Romania's top court also said it will challenge legal changes to the status of magistrates. 
It was unclear when the court would meet to rule on the challenges but it could be months before the bills are enforced, as the president must also sign off on them. Iohannis has repeatedly criticized the bills.
The proposed changes place Romania alongside its eastern European peers Hungary and Poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, in defying EU concerns over the rule of law.
The Commission launched an unprecedented action on Poland on Wednesday, calling on other member states to prepare to sanction Warsaw if it fails to reverse judicial reforms it says pose a threat to democracy.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia should not forfeit its ""sovereign"" right to one day enrich uranium under its planned civilian nuclear program, especially as world powers have allowed Iran to do so, a senior Saudi royal told Reuters.
Former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal's comments reinforced Riyadh's stance on what is likely to be a sensitive issue in talks between Saudi Arabia and the United States on an agreement to help the kingdom develop atomic energy.
Riyadh aims to start talks with the United States within weeks on a civilian nuclear cooperation pact, which is essential if U.S. firms are to bid in a multi-billion-dollar tender next year for building Saudi Arabia's first two nuclear reactors.
The reactors will be part of a wider program to produce electricity from atomic energy so that the kingdom can export more crude oil. 
Riyadh says it wants nuclear technology only for peaceful uses but has left unclear whether it also wants to enrich uranium to produce nuclear fuel, a process which can also be used in the production of atomic weapons.
U.S. companies can usually transfer nuclear technology to another country only if the United States has signed an agreement with that country ruling out domestic uranium enrichment and the preprocessing of spent nuclear fuel -- steps that can have military uses.
""It's a sovereign issue. If you look at the agreement between the P5+1 with Iran specifically it allows Iran to enrich,"" Prince Turki, who now holds no government office but remains influential, said in an interview on Tuesday in Riyadh.
He was referring to the six countries -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- that reached a deal with Tehran in 2015, under which economic sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for the Islamic Republic curbing its nuclear energy program. 
""The world community that supports the nuclear deal between the P5+1 and Iran told Iran you can enrich although the NPT (global non-proliferation treaty) tells us all we can enrich,"" Prince Turki, a senior royal family member and a former ambassador to Washington, said.
""So the kingdom from that point of view will have the same right as the other members of the NPT, including Iran."" 
""SELF-SUFFICIENCY"" 
The dual technology has been at the heart of Western and regional concerns over the nuclear work of Iran, Saudi Arabia’s regional rival. These worries helped lead to the 2015 deal, which allows Iran to enrich uranium to around the normal level needed for commercial power production.
Atomic reactors need uranium enriched to around five percent purity but the same technology can also be used to enrich the heavy metal to higher, weapons-grade levels.  
Saudi Arabia plans to build 17.6 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear capacity by 2032, the equivalent of around 16 reactors.
Riyadh has previously said it wants to tap its own uranium resources for ""self-sufficiency"" in producing nuclear fuel.
Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters on Wednesday that said these large resources were being explored, were promising and that Saudi Arabia would like to localize the industry in the long-term. 
Prince Turki said the only way to stop uranium enrichment would be by establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East, a longstanding idea which has been backed by the U.N.’s nuclear assembly.

""This is not going to happen overnight. You have to set a time scale for negotiations to include regional discussions between the prospective members of the zone on issues not just of nuclear, but of achieving peace in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine,"" he said.

May ordered the investigation in October after the Mail on Sunday newspaper reported Garnier, now a junior international trade minister, asked secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy two sex toys.
The statement come a day after May forced her most senior minister, Damian Green, to resign for lying about whether he knew pornography had been found on computers in his parliamentary office.
The investigation into Garnier's conduct said he had not breached the rules since becoming a minister in 2016. 
Addressing events between Garnier and his staff member, it said the incident happened before Garnier became a minister, and that whilst there was no dispute about the facts, there was ""a significant difference of interpretation between the parties.""
“It was not his intention to cause distress, and Mr Garnier has apologized unreservedly to the individual. On that basis the Prime Minister considers that a line should be drawn under the issue,” the statement from May's office said.
The Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal has triggered a debate about a culture of abuse by some powerful men at the heart of Britain's Westminster parliament.
That has played a role in the departure of two of May's senior ministers after former Defence Secretary Michael Fallon resigned in November saying his past conduct had fallen below the required standard. 
The departures have added to May's political difficulties at a time when she is trying to manage a party and electorate still split over Brexit, negotiate an exit deal with the European Union and convince voters she can drive through domestic reforms.

Nevertheless, having secured progress in Brexit negotiations and steered key EU withdrawal legislation through difficult tests in parliament, she is not facing immediate pressure to quit from her own party.

Radio France Internationale reporter Ahmed Abba was arrested in July 2015 and sentenced in April this year to 10 years on terrorism charges that rights groups denounced as a sham.
Authorities said they found evidence on Abba's computer of attacks planned by Boko Haram, whose Islamist insurgency in Nigeria, Cameroon and neighboring countries has cost the lives of at least 20,000 people since 2009. 
Abba has denied knowledge of attacks and protested his innocence.
The sentence was reduced to two years on Thursday when an appeals court dropped the terrorism charges but upheld less serious charges of ""non-denunciation"" of terrorism. 
""Technically, Mr. Ahmed can be outside today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,"" given that he has already been in jail for over two years, his lawyer Charles Tchoungang told Reuters.
Abba's forthcoming release comes amid a crackdown on dissent by President Paul Biya who is seeking to extend his 35-year rule in elections next year. The government is confronting a growing separatist insurgency in the country's Anglophone regions as well as the threat from Boko Haram. 
Patrice Nganang, a prize-winning Cameroonian author who lives in New York, was arrested during a visit to Cameroon this month for writing a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post critical of Biya. Nganang is being held in jail until court proceedings next month. 
Rights Groups and RFI welcomed Thursday's ruling. 
""This ruling is a victory for Ahmed Abba who has been detained for more than two years simply for doing his job as a journalist,"" said Amnesty International researcher Ilaria Allegrozzi.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The U.N. war crimes court that prosecuted atrocities committed during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, and put former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on trial, closed its doors on Thursday after two decades.
""Today it's common for the U.N. Security Council to call for perpetrators of the worst crimes be held responsible. .... Accountability has taken root in our collective conscience,"" said U.N. Secretary General António Guterres of the court's legacy at a ceremony in The Hague. 
When the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was set up in 1993, the Balkan wars were still raging and few thought it stood much chance of success. But it went on through international co-operation to capture and try every one of the 161 suspects it indicted who didn't die first.
It was the first serious attempt to hold war criminals responsible for their actions since the Nuremberg trials after World War Two. Now the idea that international courts or special tribunals will be set up to try war crimes after conflicts has become commonplace. 
The ICTY had begun to fade from popular consciousness outside of the Balkans until the conviction last month of Bosnian Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic of genocide for the massacre of thousands of unarmed men and boys at Srebrenica, Bosnia in 1995. 
Days later, Bosnian Croat general Slobodan Praljak committed suicide in the courtroom by drinking a cyanide potion moments after his conviction and 20-year sentence were upheld.
SUICIDE IN COURT
A low came in 2006 when Milosevic, whose trial had dragged on for years, died of a heart attack in his cell in 2006 before a verdict was reached in his case.
Victims attended the closing ceremony, notably Munira Subasic, representing the ""Mothers of Srebrenica"" group who lobbied for justice for the more than 8,000 boys and men who were massacred by Serb forces at Srebrenica in 1995.
Prominent figures included Bosnian Serb military leader Radovan Karadzic, who was convicted in 2016 and sentenced to 40 years, and Ratko Mladic, convicted last month and sentenced to life. Both are appealing their convictions.
The court's architects hoped that establishing what happened during the war and punishing its worst offenders would help reconcile Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims.
However, Prosecutor Serge Brammertz said while the court brought justice for some, it had not brought the communities together. ""Throughout the region war criminals are seen as heroes and victims are ignored"", he said.

At the bittersweet closing ceremony, Alfons Orie, the presiding judge in Mladic's case, performed part of Handel's oratio ""Solomon"", singing the part of Solomon.

WARSAW (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May gave Poland a rare dose of big power support on Thursday by saying that its constitution was its own affair, a sharply different tone to that of the European Union which has scolded Warsaw over judicial reforms.
The EU executive launched an unprecedented action against Poland on Wednesday, calling on other member states to prepare to sanction Warsaw if it fails to reverse judicial reforms that Brussels says pose a threat to democracy.
When asked about the Commission's move to deploy the ""nuclear option"" under Article 7 of the 2009 Lisbon treaty, May said: ""These constitutional issues are normally, and should be primarily a matter for the individual country concerned.""
Speaking alongside Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Warsaw, May said: ""Across Europe we have collective belief in the rule of law."" 
""I welcome the fact that Prime Minister Morawiecki has indicated that he will be speaking with the European Commission and I hope that that will lead to a satisfactory resolution.""
At one point, a translator's slip made Morawiecki's appear to call May ""Madame Brexit"", though in fact he said in Polish: ""as madam PM said, Brexit is Brexit"".
Voicing frustration after two years of fruitless requests to the right-wing government, the European Commission has given the socially conservative Law and Justice party in Warsaw three months to change tack.
But Poland fired back defiantly and was reassured that like-minded allies in Hungary would veto the ultimate sanction of suspending Poland's voting rights in the bloc.
Morawiecki said he hoped France and Germany were aiming to work out the best solution with Britain as it leaves the EU

""I have deep hopes and conviction that our French and German partners aim to work out the best solution in this new, not easy situation that we are in with respect to Brexit,"" Morawiecki said.

954,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 10:29AM ET</span>",Yazidi sisters reunited after three years in Islamic State captivity,"By Raya Jalabi
SHARYA, Iraq (Reuters) - When Rosa, now 14, asked her Islamic State captors about her younger sisters Bushra, 12, and Suhayla, seven, she was told they had been killed for misbehaving.
""At that point, I didn't care about anything anymore. Even if I died,"" she said. ""I never thought I'd see them again.""
The sisters were finally reunited on Sunday, more than three years after being taken by the militants in an assault on Sinjar, the Yazidi heartland on August 3, 2014.
Just last week, Iraq declared ""final victory"" over Islamic State, with parades through the streets of Baghdad in celebration after three years of bloody war.
But the damage done by the militants is not easily remedied: they brutalized Iraqis, exposing fault lines in the country's already fragile social fabric and ripping families apart.
For Rosa and her family, though overjoyed at reuniting, the last three years will not be easily erased.
The militants shot, beheaded, burned alive or kidnapped more than 9,000 members of the minority religion, in what the United Nations has called a genocidal campaign against them. According to community leaders, more than 3,000 Yazidis remain unaccounted for.
Among them, are Rosa's parents, thought murdered by the militants who rolled their victims into mass graves scattered across the sides of Sinjar mountain, where thousands of Yazidis still live in tents.
The girls' nine-year-old brother, Zinal, is also still missing. Captured and held with them in the nearby city of Tal Afar, he was later driven away to Mosul in a car full of young Yazidi boys. They haven't heard from him since.
SEPARATED AND SOLD
Reuters could not verify all of the details given by Rosa, Bushra and some of the five older brothers they now live with in a group of tents in the tiny village of Sharya in Iraq's Kurdistan region.
But Amin Khalat, spokesperson for Kurdish government office which helps return missing Yazidis, said Rosa and Suhayla had been taken to Syria and Turkey respectively after being held in Tal Afar and that his office had helped reunite them with their family.
He said Rosa was returned from Syria by fighters from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and Suhayla by the Iraqi government which was alerted to her existence by Turkish officials who found her at a refugee camp in Turkey. Her family then recognized her photograph.
Rosa said she and her younger siblings were sold, by the Islamic State militants who attacked Sinjar, to a fighter and his family in Tal Afar, a city of predominantly ethnic Turkmen which produced some of the group's most senior commanders.
She said she did all the household chores and cared for her siblings and other young Yazidi captives, who lived together in a tiny room.
After a year together, Zinal was taken to Mosul, while Suhayla and Bushra were sold off to separate Islamic State families, close to one another, but not allowed to meet. After Bushra's captors took her to Rosa's house for a visit, she said she memorized the route so she could return.
""I would wait till everyone fell asleep in the afternoon, I'd pretend to fall asleep and then sneak out to see Rosa,"" said Bushra. ""They once caught me and threatened to sell me off if I didn't stop seeing my sister but I didn't care.""
Bushra said she was eventually sold again, but about a year ago, she and six older Yazidi girls ran away and reached Sinjar, where Kurdish fighters helped them find their families.
Rosa was taken to Deir Ezzor, Syria and sold twice more. She said she was originally bought for $4 in Tal Afar and last sold in Syria for $60. ""Those dogs made quite a good profit out of me,"" she said with a wry smile. PKK fighters came across her in Idlib and brought her back to Iraq and her family, she said.
Suhayla was taken by her Turkmen captors to a refugee camp in Turkey, where authorities discovered her situation and repatriated her. She was reunited with her sisters and other relatives on Sunday, a day after Rosa returned.
Beaten, forced to convert and forget their native Kurdish, the girls even had their names changed. 
Rosa was known as Noor – hers was an infidel’s name, her captors told her. Suhayla, captured when she was three, barely recognizes her sisters and speaks in broken Turkman dialect and Arabic.
""She has to learn to remember us again,"" said Rosa. ""She got used to calling some strangers mum and grandpa while she was held captive.""
Her sisters say Suhayla has barely spoken since returning to her family, but wearing a pink sweater and plastic jewelry, she relaxed under a flood of kisses from her sisters.
Bushra, nine when she was captured, is only at ease with her closest relatives. Because she returned to the family first, her brothers have asked her to help her sisters, but she warned them that it would not be easy.
""It's true we are strong, we've been through so much. But our hearts are weak – they're broken.""

Trump has threatened to cut aid to countries that support a draft U.N. resolution calling for the United States to withdraw its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in Ankara U.N. member states should not let their decision in Thursday's vote at the U.N. General Assembly be dictated by money.
""Mr. Trump, you cannot buy Turkey's democratic will with your dollars,"" he said. ""The dollars will come back, but your will won't once it's sold.
""That is why your stance is important.""
Trump's announcement two weeks ago that he was recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital broke with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that the city's status must be left to Israeli-Palestinian talks.
Last week Erdogan hosted a special meeting of the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation, which condemned Trump's decision and called on the world to respond by recognizing East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.
Jerusalem, revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, has been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in an action not recognized internationally.
Trump's Jerusalem move led to harsh criticisms from Muslim countries and Israel's closest European allies, who have also rejected the move.
A draft resolution calling for withdrawal of Trump's decision was vetoed at the United Nations Security Council by the United States on Monday. Following that vote, opponents of the U.S. decision called for the vote in the General Assembly. 

""I hope and expect the United States won't get the result it expects from there and the world will give a very good lesson to the United States,"" Erdogan said.

Without naming him, Erdogan said UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahayan - who shared a tweet accusing Ottoman troops led by Fakhreddin Pasha of stealing money and manuscripts from Medina in 1916 - was ignorant.
""Some impertinent man sinks low and goes as far as accusing our ancestors of thievery ... What spoiled this man? He was spoiled by oil, by the money he has,"" Erdogan told an awards ceremony at his Ankara palace.
""When my ancestors were defending Medina, you impudent (man), where were yours? First, you have to give account for this,"" he added. 
The United Arab Emirates, a close U.S. ally, sees Erdogan's Islamist-rooted ruling party as a friend of Islamist forces the UAE opposes across the Arab world.
Relations were further strained by Ankara’s support for Qatar after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on the Gulf emirate in June.
Two months later, Sheikh Abdullah criticized what he called Turkey and Iran’s ""colonial"" actions in Syria, though Turkey and the UAE have both opposed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Medina, now part of Saudi Arabia, was under Ottoman rule until the empire's collapse at the end of World War One.
On Wednesday, Erdogan said Fakhreddin Pasha, who led the Ottoman forces, had not stolen from Medina or its people but strived to protect the city - where the Prophet Muhammad was buried - and its occupants during a time of war.

""Believe me, this man who insulted us, who disrespected us, wouldn't even know what the holy relics are. They are ignorant like this,"" Erdogan said.

""Yes, they were sent to the court,"" said police colonel Myo Thu Soe. ""The remand has already been obtained. The case is under the Burma State Secrets Act ... so, for now, they are not allowed to meet with anyone and they are being investigated.""
Reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have been in detention for nine days with no detail on where they are being held. They have not had access to visitors or lawyers.
Pan Ei Mon, Wa Lone's wife, said she was told by police on Thursday that both journalists were well and she was allowed to leave food and clothes for them.
The authorities are investigating whether they violated the country's colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.
The Ministry of Information said last week that Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, had ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"".
A spokesman for Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Wednesday that the police had almost completed their investigation, after which a court case would begin and the reporters would have access to a lawyer and be able to meet members of their families.
The spokesman said he was told by the Ministry of Home Affairs and police that the two men were being detained in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, were ""in good condition"" and had not been subject to ""illegal questioning.""A number of governments and human rights and journalist groups have criticized Myanmar's authorities for holding the pair incommunicado since their arrest, with no access to a lawyer, colleagues and family members.

959,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 09:11AM ET</span>",A hard knock life for London's rough sleepers,"LONDON (Reuters) - Outside London's Piccadilly theater where tickets cost up to 110 pounds and a banner advertising the musical ""Annie"" reads ""It's a hard knock life"", Bryan and Kevin sleep in small tents on the street. 
They are among almost 1,000 people who sleep rough in the British capital, according to official figures, while more than 4,000 are on the streets across the country every night.
Bryan, 51, who last year nearly died from pneumonia, became homeless after personal problems led him to drink and drugs.
""It's worse than it used to be right now, but I think it's down to a lot of things,"" he says. ""The way people are now - everything is going up and costing more and then the other stuff, services and care, humanity, it's going down.""
There is wide agreement that the problem has become worse in the last seven years, leading to criticism of the Conservative government's approach and accusations that its austerity policies, including changes to welfare payments for housing, are partly to blame.
In a report this week, parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) called the extent of homelessness across England ""a national crisis"".
""The latest official figures hammer home the shameful state of homelessness in England and the abject failure of the government's approach to addressing the misery suffered by many thousands of families and individuals,"" PAC chairman Meg Hillier said.
The charity Shelter estimates more than 300,000 people in Britain are homeless, a figure which has risen by 13,000 in a year. It says one in every 200 people in England are homeless and 128,000 children will be without a home this Christmas.
Official figures show that there were 4,134 rough sleepers counted on a single night in autumn 2016, an increase of 134 percent since 2010 when there were fewer than 1,800.
""All you really want is a gaff (place) of your own,"" says Jimmy, who beds down in a subway near Waterloo Station.
""People come from out of town into the city at Christmas - you make more money - so it's harder for us who are here all the time,"" said Jimmy, 51, who originally hails from Glasgow in Scotland. 
""I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE""
There is both a human and financial cost to the problem. The average age of death of someone who is rough-sleeping is 47 and people living on the street are 17 times more likely to be the victims of violence than those in settled accommodation.
""I'm getting to a point where I can't do it anymore, I'm trying to save my money but it's hard,"" said John, 19, one of a small group of men living under Waterloo Bridge. 
Andrew, who now has a place to live but returns to hang out with his homeless friends under the bridge, recalls how he was offered drugs on his first night on the streets: ""I said 'no mate, I'm not into that' and he said 'It’s a free trial, no strings.'"" 
While he has escaped the streets, Andrew is pessimistic about John's future. ""He won't get himself off the streets, it’s almost impossible without help,"" he said. 
As to the financial impact, the National Audit Office, parliament's spending watchdog, said local authorities had spent 1.15 billion pounds ($1.54 billion) on homelessness services in 2015-16.
NAO head Amyas Morse said in September the government's ""recent performance in reducing homelessness therefore cannot be considered value for money."" 
The government has set a target of halving rough sleeping by 2022 and abolishing it by 2027. Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May told lawmakers the government would spend 500 million pounds on tackling homelessness and was putting in projects to tackle rough sleeping.
""We do not want to see anybody who is homeless or anybody who is sleeping rough on our streets,"" May said. 
But critics say the Conservatives, who have been in power since 2010, have done little to find solutions and warn that the problem could get even worse.
""We heard that over the next 10 years, if the current trajectory stays as it is, the 160,000 people who are homeless in a year could increase by 25 percent and the 9,100 people sleeping rough could rise by 76 percent,"" the PAC report said.
Meanwhile for some of those who have been homeless for a number of years, getting off the streets can be difficult, especially for those battling drug additions.
One of those is Bryan outside the Piccadilly Theatre. Despite his problems, he says he refuses to take any money from children, recalling how one girl recently tried to give him her pocket money. 

""Afterwards I sat and I cried,"" he said.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 08:54AM ET</span>",Pope says foes make reforming Vatican as hard as cleaning Sphinx with toothbrush,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis issued a stinging new critique of the Vatican's top administration on Thursday, saying ""traitors"" stood in the way of his reforms and made any change as hard as cleaning Egypt's Sphinx ""with a toothbrush"".
For the fourth year running, Francis used his annual Christmas greetings to the Roman Catholic Church’s central bureaucracy, or Curia, to lecture the assembled cardinals, bishops and other department heads on the need for change.
""Reforming Rome is like cleaning the Sphinx of Egypt with a toothbrush,"" he said, quoting a 19th-century Belgian churchman. The phrase did not evoke much laughter when the pope read it in the frescoed Clementina Hall of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace.
Since his election as the first Latin American pope in 2013, Francis has been trying to reform the Italian-dominated Curia to bring the Church’s hierarchy closer to its members, to enact financial reforms and guide it out of scandals that marked the pontificate of his predecessor, former Pope Benedict.
But he has encountered resistance, particularly as some departments have been closed, merged or streamlined. 
Francis said some in the bureaucracy - the nerve center of the 1.2-billion-member Church and whose members are entrusted with carrying out the pope's decisions - were part of ""cliques and plots"". Francis called this ""unbalanced and degenerate"" and a ""cancer that leads to a self-referential attitude"".
In his address on Thursday, he spoke of those ""traitors of trust"" who had been entrusted with carrying out reforms but ""let themselves be corrupted by ambition and vainglory.""
When they are quietly let go, he said, ""they erroneously declare themselves to be martyrs of the system ... instead of reciting a 'mea culpa'"" (Latin for ""my fault"").
Francis did not cite any specific examples.
Last June the Vatican's first auditor general resigned suddenly. He later said he was forced to step down because he had discovered irregularities but the Vatican said he had been spying on his superiors.
Earlier this month, the Vatican bank's deputy director was fired under circumstances that have not been explained.
In July, in a major shake-up of the Vatican administration, Francis replaced Catholicism's top theologian, a conservative German cardinal who has been at odds with the pontiff's vision of a more inclusive Church.
Francis said the overwhelming majority of Curia members were faithful, competent and some saintly.
Later, in a separate meeting with lay Vatican employees and their families, Francis asked forgiveness for the failings of some Church officials. 

He spoke hours before the funeral of Cardinal Bernard Law, the ex-Archbishop of Boston who resigned in disgrace after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests and whose name became a byword for scandal in the Catholic Church.

961,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 08:40AM ET</span>",Critics accuse UK government of not taking Brexit preparations seriously enough,"LONDON (Reuters) - Pro-European campaigners accused ministers of failing to take preparations for Brexit seriously enough on Thursday, after a committee of lawmakers published the government's sector-by-sector analysis on the impact of leaving the European Union.
The analyses have become a focal point for critics of the government's approach to Brexit since last year's referendum vote to leave.
The government revealed in October the 58 economic sectors it had analyzed to help it prepare for leaving, but refused requests to publish them. Brexit minister David Davis said the reports contained ""excruciating detail"" and that their publication could undermine negotiations with the EU.
However, lawmakers demanded to see the papers and used an unusual parliamentary procedure to compel the government to hand them over to a parliamentary committee. The committee published them on Thursday, but with some sensitive sections redacted.
""There is little or nothing in them that couldn’t be learned from the annual reports of different trade bodies,"" said Pat McFadden, a member of the committee and spokesman for the Open Britain campaign group.
""Breezy busking won’t cut it when people’s jobs and livelihoods are on the line. Winging it should not be a matter of principle,"" the opposition Labour Party lawmaker said. 
Since his initial remarks, Davis has stressed that the work does not constitute a formal impact assessment - a detailed document setting out the economic implications of policy decisions. He said earlier this month that it was too soon for such work to have been conducted. 
The documents released on Thursday cover sectors from asset management to tourism, describing each sector, the current EU regulatory regime and a summary of how trade is conducted in these areas. A section entitled 'sector views' was redacted by the committee.
Non-profit organization The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, which has previously warned of the risks posed by leaving the EU, also criticized the documents.

""What leaps out at you is the total absence of analysis. Search, and you do not find,"" said the organization's director Richard Black.

Among the items recovered were a golden queen's crown with an inscription of the Hellenistic god, Helios, a bust dedicated to Alexander the Great's conquest of India and a statue of a goddess dating back to the Hittite era 3,000 years ago.
The 26,456 objects recovered also included Egyptian-origin statues and Phoenician-type teardrop vials.
""The retrieved artefacts are... more valuable than the artefacts in the inventory of an average size museum,"" Istanbul police said in a statement.
For three months the investigation, dubbed ""Operation Zeus"", tracked the smuggling ring, which aimed to take the artefacts abroad and sell them to museums and collectors for millions of dollars, it said. 
Six people involved in the ring were detained on Dec. 12 in Turkey's northwestern province of Duzce as they attempted to sell off some of their haul. Seven more were detained in four different provinces.

A report published online by the Irrawaddy magazine on Tuesday had cited an unnamed source ""who has close ties with military intelligence"" as saying that the two men had passed photographs obtained during their reporting on violence in the western state of Rakhine to the U.N.
Asked about the report, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Wednesday: ""We can confirm that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo do not work for the United Nations and have not contacted the United Nations regarding the situation in Rakhine State.""
Reuters also denied that Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, who have been in detention since Dec. 12, had worked with the U.N. or any other organization.
""We reject the assertion that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were working with any organization other than Reuters,"" said a spokeswoman for the news agency, when asked about the Irrawaddy report.
""They were engaged only in independent, unbiased reporting consistent with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.""
A government spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
Myanmar authorities have said the two journalists are being investigated over whether they violated the country's colonial-era Official Secrets Act. The act carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of the crisis in Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.
A number of governments and human rights and journalist groups have criticized Myanmar's authorities for holding the pair incommunicado since their arrest, with no access to a lawyer, colleagues and family members. 

A senior government spokesman said on Wednesday that the pair were in good health and had been well treated. The authorities have previously said that the arrest of the two men did not represent an attack on press freedom.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's rival factions should stick to a United Nations peace process and prepare for elections in spring 2018, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Thursday, trying to give stalled U.N. talks a new push.
The North African country has two rival governments, one in the east and a U.N.-backed administration in the capital Tripoli in the west, in a conflict stemming from the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
France was a leading player in the NATO intervention against Gaddafi, sending warplanes to bomb his forces.
The United Nations launched a new round of talks in September in Tunis between the rival factions to prepare for presidential and parliamentary elections in 2018, but they broke off after one month.
""I noted the desire from the Prime Minister (Fayez al-Seraj) to stick to the calendar. We have a total convergence of views to implement this agenda,"" Le Drian said after meeting the Tripoli-based prime minister in the Libyan capital.
Drian will later fly to the eastern city of Benghazi to meet the powerful eastern military commander Khalifa Haftar, who on Sunday called the U.N.-backed government and peace process obsolete.
The U.N. talks had stumbled over the question of what role Haftar should play. He indicated on Sunday he wants to run as presidential candidate.
Haftar remains popular among Libyans in the east who are weary of the chaos, but faces opposition in western Libya.
The eastern-based House of Representatives on Tuesday widened divisions between east and west by approving a new central bank governor. The bank's Tripoli headquarters and U.N. rejected the move.
Le Drian said a political deal would help solve crisis of thousands of illegal migrants stuck in detention centers in Libya where human rights groups said they often face abuse.
Libyan officials deny this but say they are overwhelmed with a flood of migrants.
Libya is to main departure point for illegal migrants heading for Europe by boat.

""Myanmar is still cooperating with the special rapporteur mechanism,"" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Kyaw Moe Tun.
""But Ms Yanghee Lee's undertakings don't have impartiality and objectivity,"" he said, adding that Myanmar had asked the United Nations to replace her with someone who knows Myanmar well and is both fair and impartial.
Lee had been due to visit Myanmar next month to assess human rights across the country, including alleged abuses against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State, but on Wednesday she said she had been barred from visiting for the rest of her tenure.
She called for stronger international pressure to be exerted on Myanmar's military and said in a statement that the ban suggested something ""terribly awful"" was happening in the country.
More than 650,000 Rohingya have fled into Bangladesh since Aug. 25, when attacks by Muslim insurgents on the Myanmar security forces triggered a sweeping counter-offensive by the army and Buddhist vigilantes. 
Surveys of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh by aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres have shown at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in Rakhine state in the month after violence flared up on Aug 25, the aid group said last week.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein has called the violence ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" and said he would not be surprised if a court eventually ruled that genocide had taken place. 
Myanmar has rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing, blaming most of the violence and torching of Rohingya villages on the Rohingya insurgents who attacked the security forces.
Lee had planned to use her visit to find out procedures for the return of Rohingya refugees, and to investigate increased fighting in Kachin State and Shan State in northern Myanmar, where the army is battling autonomy-seeking ethnic minority insurgents.
Kyaw Moe Tun, who is director general of the foreign ministry's International Organizations and Economic Department, said a statement released by Lee after her last visit in July ""was not objective and not impartial"".
""If she comes again and does that, it is not easy to cooperate with us and have a positive attitude,"" he said.
Lee said in July that activists and journalists continued to be followed and questioned by state surveillance agents, and that her visit was beset by official snooping and access restrictions.
The office of Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said at the time that it was ""disappointed"" with Lee's end-of-mission statement, which contained ""many sweeping allegations and a number of factual errors"".
It did not give any details and did not directly address the issues of access or surveillance.

967,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 07:30AM ET</span>",Czech far-right party says will not support new government,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD) said on Thursday it would not support a new minority government formed by the ANO party leader Andrej Babis, making it more likely the government will lose a confidence vote next month.
If Babis loses, he will stay in power as caretaker while another coalition arrangement is sought. Given ANO's strength, however, it is almost impossible to form a government without it. 
SPD leader Tomio Okamura told a news conference his party had led talks with ANO and while there were some common points on program, there were also many differences and SPD had objections to several ministers.
""We told them we will not support this government,"" Okamura told reporters.
He said ANO refused to back its plan to legislate a referendum law allowing to vote on leaving the European Union, one of SPD's campaign calls. 
Running on an anti-establishment platform and pledges to improve management of public affairs, ANO won 78 out of 200 seats in the lower house of parliament in an October election.
But it has failed to find any coalition partners or support for its minority government among the other eight factions in parliament. Only the far-left Communists, with 15 seats, have not ruled out supporting the government. 
The SPD, with 22 seats, had supported ANO in a number of votes, raising the possibility that it might also in the end vote for the cabinet. The fresh rejection to back the cabinet makes Babis's success less likely.
Under the EU and NATO member country's constitution, Babis has to call a confidence vote by mid-January.
Several parties - including SPD but also ANO's coalition partners in the previous cabinet, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats -- have indicated they may be open to discussions on supporting an ANO-led government in the second round if Babis's first attempt fails.
The main objection to Babis is a police investigation into alleged fraud Babis is suspected of in tapping a 2 million euro EU subsidy for a conference center outside Prague a decade ago. 
Babis denies any wrongdoing. Parliament is expected to vote in January whether to lift his immunity and allow police to prosecute him.
Parties also criticise Babis for conflicts of interests he has as a politician and a billionaire owner of over 25o firms in chemicals, farming, media and other sectors.

Hariri has been a political ally of Saudi Arabia but his coalition government includes Lebanon's powerful Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah group, an ally of Shi'ite Iran and sworn enemy of Sunni Muslim Riyadh. 
Last month's political crisis, sparked when Hariri announced his resignation while in Saudi Arabia, raised fear in Lebanon that Riyadh and its Gulf allies would take economic action against the tiny Mediterranean country. 
In an interview broadcast from Riyadh before he returned to Lebanon and rescinded his resignation, Hariri warned of possible Gulf sanctions on Lebanon and of a threat to the livelihood of Lebanese workers in Gulf states. 
His remarks on Thursday seemed aimed at reassuring that no such action was in the cards. ""This is not going to happen. I assure you we have the best relationship with Saudi Arabia, we have a very good relationship with the UAE, and most of the Gulf,"" he said at a business conference. 
""The Gulf has a problem with one political party in Lebanon and does not have a problem with the whole of Lebanon,"" Hariri added, alluding to Hezbollah.

973,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 07:10AM ET</span>","As he hits 40, Macron can toast a tumultuous year","By Luke Baker
PARIS (Reuters) - As he looks back on a momentous year, French President Emmanuel Macron might be tempted to have an extra glass of champagne this holiday season, and not just because he turned 40 on Thursday.
A year ago, his newly created En Marche movement was only just starting to gain traction, with the candidate inching ahead of his main center-right rival Francois Fillon in the polls. 
But he still faced a full-throated challenge from far-right leader Marine Le Pen, and the idea of a 30-something former economy minister with no party affiliation rising to become president of the republic appeared far-fetched.
A year on, and a few wobbles aside, Macron looks to be sitting pretty: he's up in the polls again, the opposition is largely in disarray, the economy is picking up, and business and consumer confidence are strong. 
With German Chancellor Angela Merkel, 63, bogged down in draining coalition negotiations, Britain's Theresa May, 61, battling to make Brexit work while holding her divided government together, and President Donald Trump, 71, taking the United States in often unpredictable directions, Macron is arguably the most stable and reliable leader in the West.
In the past few weeks alone he has hosted a global climate summit, convened Middle East and African leaders to tackle Islamist militancy in the Sahel, brokered the return of Prime Minister Saad Hariri to Lebanon from Saudi Arabia, and been at the forefront of discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the status of Jerusalem.
Next month he will visit China for four days, and in the coming months he is expected to become the first French leader to visit Tehran since 1971 -- six years before his birth.
In Europe, he is credited with standing up to the wave of nationalist populism and unabashedly backing EU integration at a time when such ideas have become a dirty word in many capitals.
""Macron's unexpected performance underscores that harsh anti-EU populism is not always a winning strategy,"" Erik Brattenberg, director of the Europe Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote this week.
CHALLENGES AHEAD 
So as Macron prepares to wind down a little bit at the end of the year, what are the risks?
One of the former investment banker's shortcomings has been a tendency to use dismissive, even denigrating, language that has at times made him appear arrogant. Opponents have dubbed him ""president of the rich"", a label that's proving hard to shake.
Referring to those who oppose his economic reforms as ""slackers"" and suggesting that protesting workers should stop ""kicking up a bloody mess"" was ready fuel for the center-left opposition and dented his popularity. [nL8N1MG11O] 
He faces a challenge to keep his ambitious agenda on track. While he has pushed through changes to the labor rules with minimal unrest, he still needs to secure an overhaul to the pensions and unemployment benefit systems. [nL8N1MM3H0]
In Europe, his grand plans for a separate budget for the euro zone have been stymied in large part by Germany's post-electoral impasse [nL8N1OC2QI], and his talk of pan-European lists to run in next year's elections to the European Parliament is unsettling parties and leaders across the continent.
He also cannot bank on the opposition being disordered forever. The center-right Republicans party has now elected Laurent Wauquiez, a 42-year-old in the Macron mould, as its leader, and the far-left La France Insoumise keeps promising to put hundreds of thousands of protesters on the streets.

What's certain is that 2018 is unlikely to be uneventful.

Coups in 1960 and 1980 and a failed 2016 putsch involved overt army use of force, but the resignation of prime minister Necmettin Erbakan followed warnings and only a brief appearance of tanks in a provincial town. It is an action that has long rankled with current Islamist-rooted President Tayyip Erdogan. 
In his final opinion on the case, the prosecutor said the army action, which did not result in any direct military rule, constituted a real coup attempt and could not be defined as ""post-modern"", broadcaster NTV reported.
Among those facing life sentences are General Ismail Hakki Karadayi, 85, who was chief of general staff between 1994 and 1998, and his deputy at the time General Cevik Bir, state-run Anadolu news agency said.
The investigation into the unseating of Erbakan, who led a coalition government, is one of a series of court cases that have targeted the formerly all powerful secularist military in recent years.
The army's influence has been curbed drastically under Erdogan, who first came to power in 2003 and who was a member of Erbakan's Welfare Party at the time of the government's ouster.
A total of 103 people, mostly retired generals, had been named in the trial's 1,300-page indictment, accused of ""overthrowing by force, and participating in the overthrow"" of a government.
While aggravated life sentences were sought for 60 defendants, the prosecutor asked for the acquittal of 39 other defendants, NTV reported. The four other defendants have died since the court case began in 2013.
Last year, rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, tanks and helicopters in a failed coup which killed 250 people and which Ankara has blamed on U.S.-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen. He has denied involvement.
Erbakan, who died in 2011, pioneered Islamist politics in Turkey, a Muslim country with a secular state system, paving the way for the later success of Erdogan’s AK Party.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the United Nations as a ""house of lies"" ahead of a vote on Thursday on a draft resolution calling on the United States to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
""The State of Israel totally rejects this vote, even before (the resolution's) approval,"" Netanyahu said in a speech at a hospital dedication in the port city of Ashdod.
The 193-member U.N. General Assembly will hold a rare
emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab
and Muslim countries to vote on the draft resolution, which the United States vetoed on Monday in the 15-member U.N. Security Council.
Generating outrage from Palestinians and the Arab and Muslim world, and concern among Washington's Western allies, President Donald Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy on Dec. 6 when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Palestinians have protested daily in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip since Trump's announcement, throwing stones at security forces and burning tires. Gaza militants have also launched sporadic rocket fire.
Eight Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire during the demonstrations and dozens wounded, Palestinian health officials said. Two militants were killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza after a rocket attack.
Trump threatened on Wednesday to cut off financial aid to countries that vote in favor of the U.N. draft resolution, and his ambassador to the world body, Nikki Haley said the United States ""will be taking names"".
Netanyahu, in his speech, thanked Trump and Haley for ""their brave and uncompromising stance"". He repeated his prediction that other countries would eventually follow Washington's lead in pledging to move their embassies from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
""The attitude towards Israel of many countries, on all continents, outside the walls of the United Nations, is changing and will ultimately permeate into the U.N. - the house of lies,"" he said.
Most countries regard the status of Jerusalem as a matter to be settled in an eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, although that process is now stalled.
Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city's eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. 
Several senior diplomats said Haley's warning was unlikely
to change many votes in the General Assembly, where such direct,
public threats are rare. Some diplomats brushed off the warning
as more likely aimed at impressing U.S. voters.

The Syria peace congress was originally scheduled for Nov. 18 but was postponed and the Kremlin said on Thursday that no new date had been set.
If the invitation is renewed, ""we will attend Sochi and every other meeting that concerns the Syrian crisis as representatives of the people's will"" Sihanouk Depo, an official of Syria's main Kurdish party, PYD, told an affiliated website on Wednesday.
""We are still invited,"" Badran Jia Kurd, a senior Kurdish official, told Reuters on Thursday. If the framework for the congress still stands, ""we will attend"", said Jia Kurd, an adviser to the administration that governs Kurdish-led autonomous regions of Syria.
It would mark the first time Syria's main Kurdish groups are brought into peace talks. Although they now run at least a quarter of Syria, they have so far been left out of international talks in line with Turkish wishes.
Before the Sochi talks were postponed, the PYD said in November it had been invited and favored attending.
Since the conflict erupted in 2011, the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and its allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north. The YPG spearheads the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias fighting Islamic State militants with Washington's backing. 
Their territorial grip has expanded since joining forces with the United States, though Washington opposes their autonomy plans. 
Turkey views the PYD and the YPG as offshoots of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey.
Last month, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman said Russia had told Ankara that the PYD would not be invited to the peace talks. 
The Kurdish groups share enmities with both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and with neighboring Turkey. This week, Assad described the U.S.-backed militias as ""traitors"".
On Wednesday, in an interview with Iran's Arabic language Al-Alam television, Syria's deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad equated the Kurdish-led forces with Islamic State. ""There is another Daesh called SDF,"" he said, using the Arabic acronym for the militant group that until recently controlled swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.
In his interview on Wednesday, Depo said: ""Any attack from the regime will be a failed venture.""

Chinese aircraft, most of them from the air force, have carried out increasing numbers of drills far from Chinese shores in the past few years, most recently focused on self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by China as its own, and near Japan. 
Xinhua said dozens of aircraft, including bombers, fighters and early warning aircraft, drilled in the Western Pacific along with warships, but it did not give an exact location.
The exercises were normal drills, part of annual plans, and accorded with international law and norms and were not aimed at any specific country or region, Xinhua said, citing the military.
The exercises had no impact on freedom of navigation or overflight in the area, the news agency added.
The participation of aircraft attached to the South China Sea fleet implies they could have flown over the disputed South China Sea, where China has been building airfields and other military facilities, some on artificial islands, unnerving the region.
China claims most of the South China Sea, a strategic waterway through which $3 trillion worth of goods passes every year. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei all have overlapping claims.

So far, it has been exclusively used to label media sponsored by the U.S. authorities as foreign agents, but the new regulation would appear to go further.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A car deliberately plowed into pedestrians at a crowded intersection in the Australian city of Melbourne on Thursday, injuring 14 people, police said, adding they had arrested the driver and a second man.
Police said the motive for the incident was not known but it had chilling echoes of several attacks by Islamist militants in various parts of the world over the past two years.
In January, four people were killed and more than 20 injured when a man deliberately drove into pedestrians at a spot just a few hundred meters away from the Thursday incident, though that incident was not terrorism-related.
A witness told the Australian Broadcasting Corp the vehicle was traveling at 80 to 100 kph (50-62 mph).
""There was no breaking or any slowing down at all,"" said Jim Stoupas, who said he was standing outside his donut shop when the car crashed into the people, one after another.
""All you could hear was just 'bang bang bang bang bang',"" he said.
Police said they had arrested two men but that they had not been charged.
""We believe based on what we've seen that it was a deliberate act,"" Victoria Police Commander Russell Barrett told reporters.
""The motivations are unknown,"" Barrett said.
The Victoria State ambulance service said it had taken 13 people to hospital, including a pre-school child with a serious head injury.
Police did not identify the two arrested men but pictures taken at the scene and posted on social media showed a bearded man in a flannel shirt sitting on the footpath and talking to police.
'HORRIBLE INCIDENT'
Major streets in Australian cities have been packed with Christmas shoppers this week. 
The incident took place on Flinders street, a major road that runs alongside the Yarra River, in the central business district of Australia's second-biggest city.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said federal and state police as well as security agencies were working together to secure the scene and investigate the ""shocking incident"".
""Our thoughts & prayers are with the victims & the emergency & health workers who are treating them,"" Turnbull said in a post on his official Twitter account.
Victoria's premier, Daniel Andrews, writing on his official Twitter account, called it a ""horrible incident"".
Melbourne has installed about 140 concrete bollards in the city center to stop vehicle attacks by militants. 
Sydney, Australia's biggest city, has installed concrete barricades in main pedestrian thoroughfares.
Authorities in cities around the world have taken similar measures following attacks in Europe and the United States.
Australia has been on a ""high"" national threat level since 2015, citing the likelihood of attacks by Australians radicalized in Iraq and Syria.
A staunch ally of the United States and its campaign against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, Australia believes more than 100 of its citizens are fighting there.

Two hostages were killed during a 17-hour siege by a ""lone wolf"" gunman, inspired by Islamic State militants, in a cafe in Sydney in December 2014.

ALMOG, West Bank (Reuters) - The aromatic plants bestowed on the infant Jesus are being cultivated by an Israeli entrepreneur who aims to transform the gifts of the Christmas story into therapeutic balms and incense.
Manger aside, the baby Jesus may have been swaddled in pleasant and pricey fragrances, thanks to the presents that the Bible says were given to him by the Wise Men of the East.
The frankincense (pungent and sweet) and myrrh (sharp and piney) recounted in the Gospel of St Matthew are being grown by Guy Erlich, a businessman who hopes to revive the rare plants' use for commercial ends. 
And what about gold, the third gift brought by the Magi according to the New Testament story? 
Some Christians believe this refers to the precious amber resin of the Balsam of Gilead, an aromatic mix resembling citrus and cinnamon that Erlich also cultivates on his farm in the Judean desert. 
""I see myself as a modern Magus,"" he told Reuters. 
""I decided to focus on plants that no one else in the world grows. Since those plants, those medical plants of the Bible were in medical use for so many years, there must be something about them and it is our duty to look for it."" 
Dried and crushed resins of all three plants smolder in a nearby censer, filling the air with heavenly smells of fruity freshness. 
Such smoke was used for religious rites and fumigation in ancient times. The plants have also been known to produce balms, poultices and perfumes. The Balsam of Gilead resin, Erlich says, was used as the oil with which biblical kings were anointed. 
Archaeologists doubt the claim that it could be identified as the Magi's gold, and attribute the origins of this theory to Christian evangelical circles. 
But Christianity scholar Yisca Harani explains it may be plausible in at least a literary way, if there was a translation inaccuracy of the word ""gold"".
""Maybe it was this very precious Balm of Gilead. Maybe it was another statement from Biblical times saying these are the perfumes that are typical of the prophecies of God, these are the gifts of the land."" 
Prof. Shimshon Ben Yehoshua, from the Volcani Agricultural Research Centre and the Hebrew University's Faculty of Agriculture, says Erlich's plants are most likely the same as those from ancient times.
""For the frankincense and myrrh which I believe are similar to the ones that were growing in the past in Israel, those are many species but I believe that the species he (Guy Erlich) grew has the desirable qualities,"" he told Reuters. 
In addition to Christians interested in sampling the scents, Erlich says he has been fielding inquiries from pious Jews who thrill at the prospect of recreating the incenses that were burnt in their Roman-era temple in Jerusalem. 

""My plants are sacred to all religions,"" he said. ""Now they can be a uniting factor. They can be a common ground. They can connect people.""

Kuala Lumpur (Reuters) - Malaysia’s growing ties to Saudi Arabia - and its puritan Salafi-Wahhabi Islamic doctrines -  are coming under new scrutiny as concerns grow over an erosion of traditional religious practices and culture in the multi-ethnic nation.
A string of recent events has fueled the concern. Hostility toward atheists, non-believers and the gay community has risen. Two annual beer festivals were canceled after Islamic leaders objected. A hardline preacher, accused of spreading hatred in India, has received official patronage.
The government has backed a parliamentary bill that would allow harsh sharia punishments, such as amputations for theft and stoning for adultery. And after religious officials supported a Muslim-only laundromat, Malaysia's mostly ceremonial royalty made a rare public intervention, calling for religious harmony.
Marina Mahathir, the daughter of Malaysia's longest serving prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, publicly lashed out at the government for allowing the ""Arabisation"" of Malaysia.
Marina, who heads the civil rights group Sisters in Islam, told Reuters Saudi influence on Islam in Malaysia ""has come at the expense of traditional Malay culture"". Her father, 93, now heads the opposition alliance.
Saudi Arabia’s fundamentalist Wahhabi beliefs have strongly influenced Malaysia – and neighboring Indonesia - for decades, but have strengthened considerably since Najib became prime minister in 2009 and began cozying up to the kingdom.
The relationship came under a harsh spotlight when nearly $700 million wound up in Najib's bank account in 2013. Najib said it was a donation from the Saudi Royal family, rebutting allegations it was money siphoned from the 1MDB state investment fund he had founded and overseen. Malaysia's attorney-general cleared him of any wrongdoing.
The trend toward a politicized brand of Islam in Malaysia, a middle-income emerging market, has alarmed Malaysia’s non-Muslims, including ethnic Chinese who comprise a quarter of the population and dominate private sector commerce. It is also a concern for foreign investors, who account for nearly half the local bond market and have invested $8.95 billion in project investments in the first nine months of this year.
The government denies actively promoting Wahhabi-style Islamic conservatism.
Najib has been largely silent about the recent religious controversies. Critics have accused the prime minister, whose governing coalition lost the popular vote in the last general election but retained a simple majority in parliament, of playing on fears that Islam and Malay political power will be eroded should the opposition win. An election is due by mid-2018.
ELECTION CALCULATIONS
Militancy has also been on the rise in Malaysia, which from 2013 to 2016 had arrested more than 250 people with alleged ties to Islamic State, many of whom were indoctrinated with hardline interpretations of Islam.
After the visit of the Saudi monarch this year, Malaysia announced plans to build the King Salman Centre for International Peace to bring together Islamic scholars and intelligence agencies in an effort to counter extremist interpretations of Islam.
The center, which is being built on a 16-hectare (40-acre) plot in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, will draw on the resources of the Saudi-financed Islamic Science University of Malaysia, and the Muslim World League, a Wahhabi Saudi religious body.
Saudi Arabia has long been funding mosques and schools in Malaysia, while providing scholarships for Malaysians to study in the kingdom. Many of them find employment in Malaysia's multitude of Islamic agencies, said Farouk Musa, chairman and director of the moderate think-tank, Islamic Renaissance Front.
One of the most worrisome doctrines they preach in multi-cultural Malaysia is 'al-w ala' wa-al-bara' or ""allegiance and disavowal"", Farouk said. ""This doctrine basically means do not befriend the non-believers (al-kuffar), even if they are among the closest relatives.
""We have never heard of Islamic scholars forbidding Muslims to wish Merry Christmas before, for example. Now, this is a common phenomenon,” he said.
The adoption of Arab culture and interpretations of Islam is a result of greater exposure to Middle Eastern people and universities, said Abdul Aziz Kaprawi, a member of the Supreme Council of Najib’s political party, the United Malay National Organisation.
""The extensive usage of social media also accelerated the external influence on the locals,"" he told Reuters. 
The government is not promoting Wahhabism but rather the doctrine of ""wasatiyyah"", or moderation and balance, to accommodate Malaysia's multi-cultural society, said Abdul Aziz, who is also a federal deputy minister.
CROWN PRINCE'S REFORMS?
Karima Bennoune, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for cultural rights, expressed concern in a report after her September visit to Malaysia about the deepening involvement of religious authorities in policy decisions. She said this was influenced by “a hegemonic version of Islam imported from the Arabian Peninsula” that was “at odds with local forms of practice.”
She also expressed concern about ""the banning of books, including some about moderate and progressive Islam, in the country when the government extols these very concepts abroad"".
Marina Mahathir said religious departments, staffed with Saudi graduates, ""are now consulted on absolutely everything, from movies to health and medicine to insurance, all sorts of things that they do not necessarily have any expertise in"".
The kingdom also exerts leverage over Muslim-majority countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia through the quotas it gives to countries for the number of pilgrims they can send on the Hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam that all capable Muslims must perform at least once in their lives.
This could all start to change if Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman succeeds in returning the Saudi kingdom to “a moderate Islam,” which he says was practiced before 1979.
He has already scaled back the role of religious police, permitted public concerts and announced women will be allowed to drive.
The kingdom has also set up an authority to scrutinize uses of the “hadith” – accounts of the sayings, actions or habits of the Prophet – to prevent them being used to justify violence or terrorism.

In those hardest hit by crises -- Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Sudan -- an average of more than a quarter of the population was undernourished, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said in its annual report on food security.
A quarter of Yemen's people are on the brink of famine, several years into a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi that has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times.
The report focused on changes to food security and nutrition across the region since 2000.
It said that undernourishment in countries not directly affected by conflict, such as most Gulf Arab states and most North African countries including Egypt, had slowly improved in the last decade. But it had worsened in conflict-hit countries.
""The costs of conflict can be seen in the measurements of food insecurity and malnutrition,"" the FAO's assistant director-general Abdessalam Ould Ahmed said.
""Decisive steps towards peace and stability (need to be) taken.""
Several countries in the region erupted into conflict following uprisings in 2011 that overthrew leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.

Syria's civil war, which also began with popular demonstrations, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and made more than 11 million homeless.

VERKHNAYA PYSHMA/YEKATERINBURG, Russia (Reuters) - One thousand French goats have found a new home in Russia's Ural mountains as a local company bets on producing European-style cheeses no longer available for import.
Russia banned the wholesale import of fresh food from the European Union, including dairy products, in response to sanctions imposed on Moscow after its 2014 annexation of Crimea. 
But as images of steamrollers flattening illegally imported European cheeses were beamed across the country, Russian businesses were gearing up to fill the gap. 
Investment in the production of sanctioned foodstuffs has grown, and in the Ural mountains the owners of mining company UMMC have added goats to their copper and coal assets.
Iskandar Makhmudov and Andrey Kozytsin, both on the Forbes list of Russia's 100 richest people, are among UMMC's main shareholders. 
Their company, UGMK-Agro, spent one million euros on trucking the Alpine goats 5,000 km from the Vendee region in France. Working out of a converted cowshed north of Yekaterinburg, it is aiming to be Russia's largest producer of white mold goat's cheese, a French delicacy.
The company has invested 200 million rubles ($3.4 million)in cheese production and expects to turn a profit in six years. 
""For us, sanctions have of course played a positive role. We saw a gap in the market - not quite a deficit, but some room for maneuver,"" Ilya Bondarev, CEO of UGMK-Agro, told Reuters. 
With most Russians accustomed to semi-hard cheeses, part of the challenge will be encouraging buyers to try something new. 
""I'm sorry but goat's cheese smells, and I don't like the taste of moldy cheeses,"" said 30-year-old Alexander, a Yekaterinburg resident.
""I prefer mozzarella and normal Russian cheeses, which remind me of my childhood,"" he said.
There is also the price. A kg of UGMK-Agro's Bûche-de-Chèvre cheese, sold under the ""Coeur du Nord"" brand, costs 2,200-2,500 rubles ($37-$43) versus 300-800 rubles per kg for standard Russian cheeses.
UGMK-Agro plans to produce 500-700 kg of cheese a day by the spring of 2018.
""We are launching in Moscow ... and are talking to distributors in St Petersburg,"" Bondarev said. ""But our main challenge is the creation of a local market.""

The team was heading to the club's stadium for a Champions League match against AS Monaco on April 11 when the explosions went off, wounding Spanish defender Marc Bartra and delaying the match by a day.
Letters left at the scene had initially suggested Islamist militants were behind the bomb attack, but prosecutors later said the 28-year old suspect, a dual German and Russian national identified as Sergei V., was motivated by greed.
The attack near the Signal Iduna Park stadium, the largest in Germany, holding more than 80,000 fans, had nonetheless revived memories at the time of the November 2015 attacks in Paris that targeted entertainment venues including the Stade de France where France were playing Germany in a soccer friendly.
The start of the trial also comes only days after the anniversary of a deadly truck attack at a Berlin Christmas market, which killed 12 people and put the issue of security at the heart of political debate in Germany.
Prosecutors have alleged that the suspect in the Borussia bus bombing had hoped the attack would force down the club's share price, reaping him a profit on an investment.
He had bought options on the day of the attack entitling him to sell shares in Borussia Dortmund at a pre-determined price. But shares in BVB actually rose after the attack and are up 18 percent so far this year.

In addition to the attempted murder charges, the Dortmund prosecutor's office also accuses the suspect of inflicting grievous bodily harm and of causing an explosion.

The MP said he, other colleagues and the ex-minister were going to court on Thursday to ""know the evidence on what he (Abdishakur) was first arrested"".

The group is fighting to expel African Union peacekeeping force AMISOM from the Horn of African nation, topple the federal government and impose rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law.
More than 500 people were killed in twin bomb blasts in Mogadishu in October while this month a suicide bomber killed at least 18 people at a Mogadishu police academy.

The case relates to alleged below-market-price sale of lucrative telecoms permits bundled with airwaves in 2008, which a federal auditor said may have cost the government as much as $28 billion in lost revenue.
A special court convened by the federal investigator was called to give its verdict on the accused, including former telecoms minister A. Raja.
""The prosecution has miserably failed to prove its charge,"" defense lawyer Vijay Aggarwal told reporters, citing the judge's ruling.
Shares of companies affected by the case rose after the verdict, with Reliance Communications Ltd gaining as much as 13.3 percent, DB Realty jumping nearly 20 percent and SUN TV Networks Ltd rising as much as 6.8 percent.
The scandal dented the fortunes of then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his government, which oversaw the sale of the licenses at below-market prices, and triggered street protests.
It was one of the several scandals that emerged during Singh's second term, hobbling policymaking and diverting the government's attention away from pushing forward crucial economic reforms.
The uncertainty hurt business sentiment in Asia's third-biggest economy, and led to questions about the government's efforts to crack down on corruption.

998,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 03:23AM ET</span>",Shots fired along demilitarized zone as North Korean soldier defects,"By Haejin Choi and Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean guards fired warning shots across the heavily militarized border with North Korea on Thursday as a soldier from the North defected, officials said, complicating efforts to ease tensions over the Pyongyang's weapons programs.
A South Korean defense ministry official said up to 20 warning shots were fired at North Korean troops who approached too closely to the ""military demarcation line"", apparently in search of the missing soldier.
Thursday's defection came about five weeks after another North Korean soldier suffered critical gunshot wounds during a defection dash across the border on Nov. 13.
Two North Korean civilians who were found in a fishing boat on Wednesday had also sought to defect, officials in the South said.
That brings the total number of North Koreans who have defected by taking dangerous routes either directly across the border or by sea to 15 so far this year, including two other soldiers. That is three times the number last year, according to South Korean officials.
Tensions on the Korean peninsula were already high after North Korea accelerated testing of its missile and nuclear programs this year in defiance of international pressure. 
The rash of defections also threatens to complicate South Korea's efforts to ensure the smooth running of the 2018 Winter Olympics, which begin in Pyeongchang in February.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday he had proposed postponing major military drills with the United States until after the games in an attempt to soothe relations, although officials in Seoul later said any proposed delay would depend on the North not engaging in any ""provocations"".
LANDMINES, BARBED WIRE
Seoul says more than 880 North Koreans have defected to the South so far in 2017, but the vast majority have taken a less dangerous route through China.
Going through China, North Korea's neighbor and sole major ally, means they avoid the heavily fortified demilitarized zone, which features landmines, barbed wire, surveillance cameras, electric fencing, and thousands of armed troops on both sides.
The number of defectors arriving successfully in the South has dropped since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un took power in late 2011, a trend defectors and experts say may be linked to a crackdown by Pyongyang.
There was no immediate comment from the secretive North about the latest incidents.
However, the North's state media released a statement sharply denying U.S. allegations this week that Pyongyang was behind a number of recent cyber attacks.
Washington has publicly blamed North Korean hackers for a cyber attack in May that crippled hospitals, banks and other companies. Researchers also say the North was likely behind attacks on virtual currency exchanges.
The military drills with the United States have also complicated relations with China. South Korea says it needs the drills to guard against the North's missile and nuclear ambitions but Pyongyang describes them as preparation for war.
The proposed delay in drills was discussed during a summit between Moon and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week after the proposal was submitted to Washington, an official at the presidential Blue House said this week.
China and Russia have proposed a ""freeze for freeze"" arrangement under which North Korea would stop its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a halt to the exercises, but there has been little interest from Washington or Pyongyang.
Beijing was angered when the South deployed a controversial U.S. anti-missile system this year. China fears the system's powerful radar can see far into its territory and the row led to China taking economic measures that included blocking tour groups from visiting South Korea.
Some blocks on group tours had resumed, industry sources said this week, and Beijing has also rebuked Seoul for firing warning shots at Chinese fishing boats.
DEFECTION IN HEAVY FOG
In Thursday's defection, a low-ranking soldier crossed the border near a South Korean guard post in the ""center-west"" region at around 8:04 a.m. (2304 GMT Wednesday), South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said. No shots were fired at the soldier.
Surveillance equipment detected him despite heavy fog that limited visibility to about 100 meters (110 yards), Roh said.
""Our military secured his safety, and a questioning will be conducted by related agencies to find out the background of his defection and motive, etc,"" he said.
South Korean guards fired about 20 warning shots at North Korean troops near the border presumably searching for the defector about half an hour later, a defense ministry official in the South told Reuters.
Gunfire from the North was detected later but the target could not be determined, the official said. 
The United Nations Command, which maintains military forces along the border in the South, said it was aware of the incident and was coordinating with the South Korean military to determine the circumstances of the defection.
South Korea's Unification Ministry also said maritime police had found two North Korean men drifting in a small boat off the coast on Wednesday. The pair ""expressed their willingness to defect"", a ministry official said, and their claim for asylum was being investigated.
The North Korean soldier who was shot several times during a daring dash across the border on Nov. 13 has since been identified as 24-year-old Oh Chong Song and is now in a military hospital south of Seoul.

His treatment for gunshot wounds and pre-existing conditions has included two major operations and intelligence officials will begin questioning him soon.

Standard Bank, one of the top four banks whose fortunes are linked to local politics and the economy, called on the ANC take quick and decisive action against corruption. 
""As a leading contributor to the economic development of our country, Standard Bank has a right and a duty to argue for policies and approaches to governance that will reverse South Africa's economic decline and that will foster the conditions for much faster and more inclusive growth, more job creation, and further transformation,"" the bank said in a statement.
Ramaphosa, an apartheid-era trade unionist and former chairman of Africa's biggest telecoms operator MTN Group, is seen by business leaders as well placed to turn around the economy. South Africa's GDP is estimated to grow by less than one percent this year, while the unemployment rate is nearly at a record 28 percent. 
Some investors are nevertheless concerned that Ramaphosa may not be able to push through policy changes because the ANC's decision making group, known as the ""Top Six"", was split down the middle, consisting of three politicians apiece drawn from Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma's camps.
Dlamini-Zuma is a veteran campaigner against the racial economic inequality that has persisted since the end of white-minority rule and her hostility to big business had rattled some investors in South Africa.
Separately, Zuma on Thursday congratulated Ramaphosa on his victory and commended the policies adopted at the conference, which include the nationalization of the central bank and land expropriation without compensation.

""The delegates have shown yet again that there is no task bigger than the ANC. But most importantly, they have demonstrated that the unity of the ANC is sacrosanct,"" Zuma said in a statement.

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 03:10AM ET</span>",Dying for a paycheck: the Russian civilians fighting in Syria,"By Maria Tsvetkova
ORENBURG, Russia (Reuters) - When Vladimir Kabunin signed up as a private military contractor, he saw a chance to make a wage much higher than any he could earn in his provincial Russian hometown.
Happy to be able to support his wife and son, the ex-police officer left Orenburg, nearly 1,500 km (940 miles) southeast of Moscow, and joined pro-Russian rebels fighting government forces in east Ukraine, a family friend and a relative told Reuters. 
When fighting subsided there, he went to Syria to serve as a field medic with troops under Russian command, they said.
Kabunin was killed in Syria this year and his body was sent home, they said. But the government does not recognize he was in Syria, so he was buried without military honors and nothing on his grave shows he was killed in action.
Kabunin, who was 38, was one of hundreds of military contractors secretly recruited by Moscow for combat operations in Syria since Russia's military operation began there in 2015, according to people familiar with the deployment.
According to a Reuters tally based on accounts from people who knew the deceased and local officials, at least 28 private contractors have been killed in Syria this year, and Russian consular documents seen by Reuters suggest the figure may be much higher. 
The government denies recruiting and sending private military contractors to fight abroad. The defense ministry did not respond when asked about Kabunin's case and the role of contractors in Syria, and has said previous Reuters reports on the contractors are an attempt to discredit Russia's mission to restore peace to Syria. 
But over two years, Reuters has spoken to dozens of family members, colleagues and friends of military contractors who have been killed in Syria.
Those familiar with the deployment say the contractors are under government command and have helped turn the tide of war in favor of Russia's ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while hiding the scale of its military involvement and losses.
The fact that Kabunin and others like him are willing to sign up for such missions shows the Kremlin can draw on a large reserve of fighters who, as long as they are well remunerated, are willing to risk dying in the shadows.
WELL-TRODDEN PATH
Kabunin followed a path taken by many contractors: service in the military or security forces, a return to civilian life, a struggle to make a living, then a chance to make decent money fighting secretly for Russia, in Ukraine and then Syria.
Family members of Russian contractors say that in Syria they were paid up to $6,500 per month, which exceeds Russia's average monthly wage more than 12 times.
""If you quit law enforcement bodies, you have only one way (choice) - to become a mercenary,"" Vasily Karkan, a classmate of Kabunin at school, told Reuters. 
Kabunin was shy as a child until he started kickboxing classes, Karkan recalled. The sport became a life-long hobby.
Kabunin obtained a degree in medicine and also studied law, but followed in the family footsteps by joining the police. 
In 2010, he found a new job in a prison, where his wife also worked in a tuberculosis hospital. Kabunin's role was to work with prisoners to obtain information and gather intelligence on planned escape attempts or potential unrest, but he left that job in 2012. 
A spokesman for Orenburg prisons service said he had left of his own volition. A family friend spoke of job cuts and said he looked for a new job for about two years.
""There is no place to work,"" the family friend said. ""You can't earn more than 10,000 rubles ($170)(a month) here.""
When fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Kabunin saw a job opportunity.
Moscow denies deploying active service troops in Ukraine or providing direct military help to the separatists. But Kabunin signed up with Dmitry Utkin, the leader of a group of Russian ex-servicemen fighting there who uses the nom de guerre ""Vagner"", and, drawing on his medical degree, served as a military medic, his relative said.
COMBAT DEATH
When Utkin and his comrades deployed to Syria in support of Russia's regular forces, Kabunin went with them, people familiar with the deployment said. As of April 2016, he was a field medic in a medical evacuation unit under Utkin's command in Syria, according to an official in a Ukrainian law enforcement agency.
The agency says it has obtained the personnel records of 1,700 Russian contractors deployed in Syria, most of whom were earlier in Ukraine. 
Kabunin left home for his last trip to Syria on Jan. 4 and was put in command of a medical company, but was wounded on Jan. 31 and died on Feb. 7 in Homs province, a relative said.
The relative knew this from former police colleagues of Kabunin, some of whom also served in Syria, and from his death certificate, which was handed to his wife Natalya. It was not clear how she was informed and who gave her the death certificate. She declined to speak to Reuters. 
Relatives of other killed contractors say the news has come via friends or acquaintances, or by phone from people who say they represent a private company.
Kabunin was buried next to other family members' graves in Orenburg, his portrait displayed on a cross showing a man with a shaved head in civilian clothes.
His wife received a compensation payment, according to the relative, who gave no further details.
According to accounts from relatives of other contractors killed in Syria, the employer typically pays out 3 million rubles ($51,227) in compensation to the next of kin when a contractor is killed.
Relatives of another dead contractor told Reuters that, in his case, the money was handed over to his widow in cash in a hotel in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don.
""MISSION ACCOMPLISHED""
On a visit to Syria on Dec. 11, President Vladimir Putin declared mission accomplished for the Syrian operation and paid tribute to Russian servicemen who have been killed there.
There was no mention of the contractors' losses. The government is under no obligation to disclose the deaths of non-regular forces fighting under its command and Russian military losses in Syria are a state secret.
Kabunin's death did not dissuade his friend Valery Dzyuba, also a former police officer and kickboxer from Orenburg, from heading to Syria to fight as a military contractor.
Dzyuba's family received a phone call from an unidentified man saying he had died on Aug. 20 but not specifying the circumstances. Dzyuba was killed in Syria, according to one of his classmates, Kabunin's relative and an official in the village where Dzyuba was buried.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Monday laid out a national security strategy based on Trump's ""America First"" vision, singling out of China and Russia as ""revisionist powers"" seeking not only to challenge U.S. power but to erode its security and prosperity.
China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday cooperation between China and the United States was the only correct choice.
The spokesman for its defense ministry, Ren Guoqiang, said in a statement posted on the ministry website late on Wednesday that the U.S. strategy had ""without regard for the facts, created sensational hype over the modernization of China's defenses"".
Ren also said the strategy had ""called into question the intentions of China's military development plan"" and that it ran counter to peace worldwide and the development of China's relations with the United States.
China's contribution to world peace was plain for all to see, he said.
""Attempts by any country or any document to distort the facts or cast aspersions will be in vain,"" Ren said.
China's armed forces, the world's largest, are in the midst of an ambitious modernization program, which includes investment in technology and new equipment such as stealth fighters and aircraft carriers, as well as cuts to troop numbers.
The tough U.S. national security strategy comes after Trump has sought to build strong relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Trump has called upon Xi to ensure China does more to help the United States rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
The U.S. administration cited China's growing military might and its efforts to build military bases on manmade islands in the contested South China Sea as evidence of Chinese attempts to alter the status quo.

China says its expansion of islets in the South China Sea is for peaceful purposes only and that, as it has irrefutable sovereignty there, no other country has the right to question its actions.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has discovered the wreck of its first submarine off the coast of Papua New Guinea, authorities said on Thursday, resolving one of the country's oldest naval mysteries after more than a century.
The submarine, AE-1, was the first Allied vessel to sink during World War One, while patrolling for German warships in 1914, in circumstances that have never been established.
The Australian Navy and several private bodies found the final resting place of the vessel's 35 crew on their 13th attempt, Defence Minister Marise Payne told media. 
The submarine's disappearance ""was a tragedy for our then fledgling nation,"" Payne said, adding that a small commemorative service was held aboard the survey ship that found the wreck and authorities were trying to contact the crew's descendants.
""It is my hope that what we have done in the last couple of days will now provide relief to the family and descendants of all of those members,"" said navy chief Vice Admiral Timmy Barrett, adding that the crew had come from Australia, Britain and New Zealand. 

The authorities did not disclose the wreck's location, except to say it was found off the Duke of York Islands. The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea said they planned to preserve the site.

The hardline Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) said this week it would conduct ""sweeping operations"" in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, and that forcing Muslims to wear Christmas attire was a violation of their human rights.
Indonesia is home to several religious minorities, including Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and people who follow traditional beliefs. 
The constitution guarantees freedom of religion in an officially secular state though tension between followers of different faiths can flare.
""There can be no sweeping operations ... members of the public should respect other religions that are carrying out celebrations,"" national police chief Tito Karnavian told police during a security exercise in the capital, Jakarta.
The FPI said it aimed to enforce a fatwa, or decree, issued by Indonesia's Islamic Clerical Council in 2016 prohibiting business owners from forcing employees to wear Christmas clothing. 
""We will raid businesses in anticipation of them being stubborn about this and we will be accompanied by police,"" said Novel Bakmukmin, head of the FPI's Jakarta chapter. 
Employers forcing staff to wear Christmas clothes were violating their rights.
""Businesses should be aware that there should be no forcing,"" he said.
The Islamic Clerical Council's decrees are not legally binding but serve as guidelines for Indonesian Muslims. 
Christmas is widely celebrated across Indonesia and holiday decorations are ubiquitous, especially at shops, restaurants and malls where many enthusiastic workers - even Muslims - don Santa hats or elf costumes.
The FPI built its reputation with raids on restaurants and bars serving alcohol during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
In recent years, it has turned its attention to Christian celebrations.
The group has also said it wants the Jakarta city government to stop sponsoring New Year celebrations, which attract many thousands of people.
About 90,000 police officers will be on duty cross the country during the end-of-year holidays, in an operation largely aimed at preventing militant attacks. 

Attacks on churches in Jakarta and elsewhere on Christmas Eve in 2000, killed nearly 20 people. Ever since, authorities have stepped up security at churches and tourist spots for the holiday.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 02:23AM ET</span>",British PM May forces her deputy to resign over pornography scandal,"By Guy Faulconbridge and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May forced her most senior minister, Damian Green, to resign after an internal investigation found he had made misleading comments about pornography on computers in his parliamentary office.
The resignation of one of May's most trusted allies, who had helped pacify her deeply divided party, is a blow as she navigates the final year of tortuous negotiations towards Britain's exit from the European Union in March 2019.
Green, who voted to stay in the EU, was appointed as first secretary of state just six months ago in a bid to shore up May's premiership following her disastrous bet on a June snap election that lost her party its majority in parliament.
But Green's future was thrust into doubt when the Sunday Times newspaper reported last month that police in 2008 had found pornography on his office computers in the Houses of Parliament. In response, Green said the story was untrue.
A review, requested by May and conducted by a senior government official, concluded that Green's statements which suggested he was not aware that indecent material had been found on the computers, were ""inaccurate and misleading.""
The inquiry, a summary of which was distributed by May's Downing Street office, found he had breached rules governing the behavior of ministers.
""I regret that I've been asked to resign from the government following breaches of the Ministerial Code, for which I apologise,"" Green said in a letter to May, who said she had accepted his resignation with deep regret.
Green, 61, said he did not download or view pornography on his parliamentary computers. He added that he should have been clearer about his statements after the story broke.
He is the most senior British politician to fall since a debate about a culture of abuse by some powerful men at the heart of Westminster was triggered by the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal. 
May's defense minister, Michael Fallon, quit last month for unspecified conduct which he said had fallen below required standards. Her aid minister resigned a week later after holding undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials.
CONDUIT FOR COMPLAINTS
During the turmoil that followed the botched election, May turned to Green - a friend and ally from their days at Oxford University - to stabilize her premiership and appease those within the Conservative Party who wanted her to quit.
One of his key roles was to act as a conduit for disgruntled party members who felt they had been ignored in May's election campaign. He sought to help her to shed the image of a distant leader who only listens to those in her inner circle.
""It's another blow for May but it is not deadly in any way at all,"" said Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King's College London. ""She has lost her soulmate in cabinet but this is not the end of Prime Minister May."" 
""May is surviving not because of Damian Green but because there are sufficient MPs in her party who don't want to have a leadership election while Brexit is going on and that fundamental calculation has not changed,"" he said.
The internal investigation found that Green's conduct as a minister was generally ""professional and proper"" but found two statements he made on Nov. 4 and 11 to be inaccurate and misleading. 
In the statements he had suggested he was not aware that indecent material was found on parliamentary computers in his office.
""These statements ... constitute breaches of the Ministerial Code. Mr Green accepts this,"" the report summary said.
WESTMINSTER SCANDAL
Sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Weinstein have prompted some women and men to share stories about improper behavior at the heart of British political power in Westminster.
""Everyone who wants to play their part in our political life should feel able to do so - without fear or harassment, and knowing they can speak out if they need to,"" May said in her letter to Green.
The internal investigation also addressed allegations, made by the daughter of a family friend, that Green had made an unwanted advance towards her during a social meeting in 2015, had suggested that this might further her career, and later had sent her an inappropriate text message.
The report said it was not possible to reach a definitive conclusion on the appropriateness of Green’s behavior in that instance, though the investigation found allegations to be plausible.

Green said in his resignation letter that he did not recognize the account of events, but apologized to the woman, academic and critic Kate Maltby, for making her feel uncomfortable.

Heather Cho had been charged with, among others, violation of aviation law in 2015 after she took issue with the way she was served nuts and forced the Korean Air Lines plane to return to its gate in a New York airport in December 2014.
The incident became a national scandal in South Korea, as Cho is the daughter of the chairman of Hanjin Group, the conglomerate of which Korean Air is an affiliate.
Cho stepped down from her role as Korean Air Lines vice president and attempted to apologize to crew members. 
The Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling that said forcing an on-the-ground plane to return to its gate cannot be seen as ""route deviation,"" but found Cho guilty of abusive language and actions against cabin crew and forcing a crew member to disembark. 
Cho was originally sentenced to one year in jail, but has been free from custody since May 2015, when the appeals court suspended her sentence.

The arrest extends a streak of corruption allegations dogging the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), with four former governors arrested on such charges this year. Entrenched corruption is expected to be a key issue in the runup to Mexico's next presidential election in 2018.
Alejandro Gutierrez, who was the adjunct secretary to the presidency of the PRI, was arrested in a joint operation by state and federal police, Chihuahua Governor Javier Corral wrote in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The Chihuahua prosecutor's office accused Gutierrez of participating in a ""sophisticated scheme"" to divert public funds of 250 million pesos ($13 million) earmarked for educational programs in 2016. Gutierrez will present himself before a judge early Thursday, the office said in a statement.
This week, Mexican newspaper Reforma published reports on an alleged Chihuahua corruption scheme to funnel the money into the PRI's campaign fund, through avenues such as fake contracts for workshops for parents and expensive software.
The reports were based on testimony to prosecutors by former state finance minister Jaime Herrera that the paper obtained. 
Gutierrez' arrest took place in Coahuila. This week, he rejected allegations against him in an interview with Mexican newspaper Vanguardia, saying he was considering suing for defamation.
""I am thinking, I will have to look into it, if I initiate some legal proceeding,"" he said. ""I do not know, I repeat to you, I did not know not even one official, nor ex-official, of finances... I see things that are absolutely false.""
Gutierrez' arrest ""contributes to the clearing up of the crimes of political corruption that have been attributed to the former governor, César Duarte Jáquez,"" said Corral, of the National Action Party. 
The government is determining whether others should be held responsible for the funneling of funds to PRI coffers in 2016, Corral added.
In March, a Mexican judge issued an arrest warrant for Duarte on suspicion of embezzlement. Corral has said he is a fugitive from justice.
A spokesman for the PRI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The PRI was routed in 2016 regional elections, losing several of its bastions, including the states of Veracruz, Tamaulipas and Quintana Roo, as voters expressed discontent over a series of graft scandals.

Department records show Ukraine has bought small amounts of those types of weapons for several years, both before and after the 2014 Russian annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.
The department notified Congress of the decision on Dec. 13, Nauert said, adding that the U.S. government was not selling the weapons directly to the Kiev government but was allowing Ukraine to buy from U.S. manufacturers. 
""Under the previous two administrations, the U.S. government has approved export licenses to Ukraine, so this is nothing new,"" Nauert said.
The license covers weapons in categories such as semi-automatic and automatic firearms up to, and including, .50 caliber weapons. It also includes combat shotguns, silencers, military scopes, and flash suppressors, as well as parts.
Nauert said the U.S. government had not directly provided lethal defensive equipment to Ukraine, nor had it ruled out doing so. U.S. exporters can apply for direct commercial sales licenses at any time and those are reviewed by the State Department on a case-by-case basis, she said.

The decree by the Constituent Assembly - created in a controversial July vote boycotted by the opposition and widely condemned abroad - infuriated Venezuela's opposition and drew criticism from the United States. 
""The Venezuelan government and its illegitimate Constituent Assembly are inventing rules as they go along. This is not democracy,"" the U.S. Embassy said on Twitter.
The Justice First, Democratic Action and Popular Will parties did not run candidates in this month's mayoral polls in protest against what they said was a biased election system designed to perpetuate leftist President Nicolas Maduro's ""dictatorship.""
Maduro had warned that could cost them participation in future votes and the Constituent Assembly echoed that position on Wednesday, saying the parties had lost their legal status and should re-apply to the National Election Board.
Given that the board is pro-Maduro and authorities are constantly throwing up obstacles to the opposition, that could well mean those parties are now effectively unable to run in the presidential election due before the end of 2018.
Maduro, 55, is expected to run for re-election despite the disastrous state of the economy in Venezuela, where millions are skipping meals and struggling to survive amid one of the world's highest inflation rates and widespread shortages of basics.
Two of his potentially biggest rivals already cannot run against him: Popular Will leader Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest, while Justice First leader Henrique Capriles is prohibited from holding political office.
""We alert the world and all democratic governments that banning opposition political parties is yet another measure by the dictatorship that deserves rejection and condemnation,"" said Capriles' party colleague Tomas Guanipa.
Maduro and his allies say the Constituent Assembly has brought peace to the OPEC nation after months of opposition protests earlier this year in which more than 125 people were killed. Demonstrators said they were fighting for freedom, but the government condemned them as violent subversives. 

""It's time for the coupsters to face the constitution. Let no one undermine the people's participation and the democratic system,"" Constituent Assembly head Delcy Rodriguez said after the passage of Wednesday's measure.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 10:31PM ET</span>",Mistrial declared for Nevada rancher who led revolt over U.S. land dispute,"By John L. Smith
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday declared a mistrial in a criminal case against four people, including Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, over a 2014 armed standoff with U.S. government agents, and rebuked prosecutors for withholding evidence from the defense.
Bundy, two of his sons and a fourth man were charged with 15 counts of conspiracy, assault and other offenses stemming from the confrontation, which galvanized right-wing militia groups challenging federal authority over vast tracts of public lands in the American West.
U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro told federal prosecutors they had willfully violated evidence rules in failing to turn over pertinent documents to the defense, adding, ""The failure is prejudicial,"" to ensuring a fair trial.
The ruling came a month after prosecutors began presenting their case to a federal court jury in Las Vegas.
Navarro had warned prosecutors last week she might declare a mistrial after listing documents previously undisclosed by prosecutors that could be used to impugn government witnesses or bolster defendants' arguments that they felt threatened by government ""snipers"" before the standoff. 
In a stern rebuke on Wednesday, Navarro said prosecutors knew or should have known of the existence of memos from Federal Bureau of Investigation agents that might have been helpful to the defense. 
Those memos and other documents, about 3,300 pages in all, were not turned over until well after an Oct. 1 deadline, and then only after repeated efforts by Bundy's defense counsel, Navarro said. 
Navarro set a retrial date for Feb. 26, 2018, but it is uncertain if there will be a new trial. Acting U.S. Attorney Steven Myhre said prosecutors had yet to decide whether to pursue the case. Defense lawyers will argue for charges to be dismissed at a hearing set for Jan. 8.
""We have a very strong case that this will never be tried again,"" Bundy's attorney, Bret Whipple, told reporters.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions weighed in through a Justice Department spokesman in Washington.
""The attorney general takes this issue very seriously and has personally directed that an expert in the department's discovery obligations ... examine the case and advise as to the next steps,"" said the spokesman, Ian Prior.
UPROAR OVER CATTLE
The April 2014 revolt at the heart of the trial was sparked by a court-ordered roundup of Bundy's cattle by agents of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) after Bundy had refused for two decades to pay fees to graze his herds on federal property.
Hundreds of supporters, many of them heavily armed, answered Bundy's public pleas for support and rallied at his ranch near Bunkerville, Nevada, about 75 miles (120 km) northeast of Las Vegas, in a show of force to demand the return of his impounded livestock.
Police and government agents, vastly outgunned, ultimately retreated rather than risk bloodshed, and no shots were fired. 
Bundy, his sons Ammon and Ryan, and co-defendant Ryan Payne, a Montana resident prosecutors linked to a militia group called Operation Mutual Aid, have cast the uprising as an act of patriotic civil disobedience against government excess. 
""I don’t believe there’s a jury in this country that would convict us,"" Ammon Bundy said after the hearing, adding, ""I believe that God has favored us.""
Prosecutors contend Bundy, 71, and his followers were defying the rule of law by threat of violence, rather than engaging in an act of legal protest. The most serious counts the defendants face carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
Ammon and Ryan Bundy were acquitted last year, along with five people, in a separate conspiracy case over a six-week armed occupation of a U.S. wildlife refuge in Oregon by activists protesting against federal land management.
A would-be fifth defendant in the Nevada case, internet blogger and radio host Peter Santilli Jr., pleaded guilty on Oct. 6 to conspiracy and faces a possible six-year prison term.
Six lesser-known participants in the Nevada showdown went on trial earlier this year. Two were found guilty; one received a prison term of 68 years, a fourth awaits sentencing. Two pleaded guilty to lesser charges in exchange for a maximum one-year jail term.

Yet another group of six defendants from the Bunkerville standoff, including two other Bundy sons, Dave and Mel Bundy, were due to stand trial after the Cliven Bundy case concluded. One of them, Micah McGuire, pleaded guilty in November to conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer, and faces up to six years in prison when sentenced.

Over the past two years countries including Kenya, Spain, Vietnam and Cambodia have deported hundreds of people from Taiwan to China for telecoms fraud, sparking accusations from Taipei that Beijing was effectively kidnapping its citizens.
China has defended the deportations, saying the crimes were committed against people in China and that as Taiwan is a part of China it was natural foreign governments should send these people to China rather than Taiwan.
In a brief statement, the Beijing court said that the 50 were given jail terms ranging from one year and nine months to 15 years and had also been given unspecified fines. 
It did not give specific details of the sentences for the 22 people from Taiwan. The cases were tried in two separate batches.
On at least two occasions last year Kenya deported groups of Taiwanese to China. In one case, a Kenyan magistrate said the Taiwanese should be repatriated to their place of origin, Taiwan, but the Kenyan government sent them to China.
Kenya, like most countries, only has diplomatic relations with China. Beijing considers democratic Taiwan a wayward province, ineligible for formal ties with other nations.
Chinese authorities have sought to contain an explosion of telecom crime it says has led to huge financial losses, with callers often impersonating officials or authority figures and preying on the elderly, students or the unemployed.
The fraud has spread overseas, with Chinese speakers recruited in neighboring Taiwan increasingly setting up operations in East Africa or Southeast Asia.

Ramaphosa, a 65-year-old union leader who became a businessman and is now one of South Africa's richest people, is likely to become the country's next president after elections in 2019, because of his party's electoral dominance.
His promise to fight rampant corruption and revitalize the economy has been hailed by foreign investors.
""This conference has resolved that corruption must be fought with the same intensity and purpose that we fight poverty, unemployment and inequality,"" Ramaphosa said in his maiden speech at the close of a five-day party meeting where he was elected.
""We must also act fearlessly against alleged corruption and abuse of office within our ranks,"" he said in the early hours of Thursday after a long delay.
Ramaphosa, who is South Africa's deputy president, was elected the new leader of the African National Congress (ANC) on Monday, succeeding President Jacob Zuma as party head after Zuma's presidency became tainted with corruption allegations.
Ramaphosa's narrow victory over former cabinet minister and African Union Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, 68, is seen as a pivotal moment for the ANC, which launched black-majority rule under Nelson Mandela's leadership 23 years ago but is now deeply divided with its image tarnished.
Ramaphosa paid tribute to Zuma in his speech, saying the ANC would be ""united"" despite a fractious campaign. Zuma had backed his ex-wife Dlamini-Zuma for ANC's top job.
However, investors are concerned that Ramaphosa may not be able to push through policy changes because the ANC's top decision-making group, known as the ""Top Six"", was split down the middle, with three politicians apiece drawn from Ramaphosa's camp and that of Dlamini-Zuma.
Analysts warned that the division of the party presidency, held by Ramaphosa, and the state presidency in Zuma's hands, could lead to policy uncertainty or paralysis.
""Mr. Zuma, for instance, still occupies South Africa’s presidency – a cohabitation that may cause a period of policy uncertainty,"" Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said in a note. 
Expectations that Ramaphosa would win the ANC race had pushed the rand to 12.5200 per dollar on Monday, its firmest since March 27, when a cabinet reshuffle by Zuma rocked markets and triggered credit ratings downgrades to ""junk.""
The rand weakened on Tuesday, but firmed on Wednesday as investors continued to digest how much clout Ramaphosa wields.
""Victory for Ramaphosa, but not a loss for Zuma,"" said Geoff Blount, managing director at BayHill Capital.
FOCUS ON ECONOMY
Zuma has faced allegations of corruption since he became head of state in 2009, but has denied any wrongdoing. The president has also faced allegations that his friends the wealthy Gupta businessmen wielded undue influence over his government.
Zuma and the Guptas have denied the accusations.
Ramaphosa alluded to these allegations in his speech, saying, ""At the state level we must confront the reality that critical institutions of our state have been targeted by individuals and families, through the exercise of influence and the manipulation of governance processes and public resources.""
He said this had weakened the state-owned enterprises in Africa's most industrialized economy. South Africa, the continent's traditional powerhouse, has had lethargic growth over the last six years and the jobless rate stands near record levels.
Ramaphosa also had a warning for corporate executives.
""We must investigate without fear or favor the so-called 'accounting irregularities' that cause turmoil in the markets and wipe billions off the investments of ordinary South Africans,"" he said.
South African furniture retailer Steinhoff, has been embroiled in a scandal over accounting irregularities, which have wiped more than $10 billion off its market value over the past two weeks.
Ramaphosa also said he would aim to expedite job creation, improve the lackluster economy and speed up the transfer of land to black people.
Two decades after the end of apartheid, the ANC is under pressure to redress racial disparities in land ownership where whites own most of the land.

""This conference has resolved that the expropriation of land without compensation should be among the mechanisms available to government to give effect to land reform and redistribution,"" Ramaphosa said. He said the land transfers would be speeded up under the radical economic transformation program, a vague ANC plan to tackle racial inequality.

Jaime Rodriguez, known as ""El Bronco,"" wrote in a post on Twitter that he had asked the state's congress for permission to take a six-month leave of absence. 
""I want to change Mexico so that the citizens together make history,"" he wrote in Spanish. ""While this is being decided, I will continue working as every day.""
Diana Adame, a spokeswoman for the state of Nuevo Leon, said the governor expects to hear back from Congress in the next few days.
Rodriguez still needs more signatures across 12 states to become an independent candidate, having reached the goal in five, according to the electoral regulator INE. 

A poll by Parametria published by Reuters on Tuesday showed just 2 percent of people said they would vote for Rodriguez, though other polls have put it at around 4 percent.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 06:20PM ET</span>",Catalonia votes in election pivotal for independence campaign,"By Angus Berwick and Sonya Dowsett
BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia on Thursday holds a regional election which the Spanish government hopes will strip pro-independence parties of their control of the Catalan parliament and end their campaign to force a split with Spain.
But, though final polls showed separatist and unionist parties running neck-and-neck, an effective pro-independence majority remains a likely outcome that would jolt financial markets and cast a long shadow over national politics.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the Dec. 21 vote in October in the hopes of returning Catalonia to ""normality"" under a unionist government. He sacked its previous government for holding a banned referendum and declaring independence.
A new separatist majority would further dampen investors' confidence in Catalonia, which by itself has an economy larger than that of Portugal and is the main driver of Spain's economic growth. However, pro-independence leaders recently have backed away from demands for unilateral secession.
Voting stations in the affluent region of northeastern Spain will open on Thursday at 0800 GMT and close at 1900 GMT. The election is expected to draw a record turnout.
The independence campaign pitched Spain into its worst political turmoil since the collapse of fascist rule and return of democracy in the 1970s. It has polarized public opinion, dented Spain's economic rebound and prompted a business exodus from Catalonia to other parts of the country.
Thursday's vote became a de facto referendum on how support for the independence movement has fared in recent months.
None of the six parties in the Catalan parliament - ranging across the ideological spectrum from separatist Marxists to the Catalan wing of Rajoy's conservative People's Party (PP) - are expected on their own to come close to the 68-seat majority.
So, analysts expect the next Catalan government to result from weeks of haggling between parties over viable coalitions.
An analysis of polling data by the Madrid daily El Pais published on Tuesday found that the most likely scenario is separatists securing a majority with the backing or abstention of the Catalan offshoot of anti-austerity party Podemos.
Podemos backs the unity of Spain but says Catalans should be able to have a referendum authorized by Madrid to decide their future. At the same time, Podemos favors a left-wing alliance of Catalan parties that both back and reject independence. 
In this, analysts say, Podemos is caught between two options it does not particularly like, but would prefer to back the separatists rather than a coalition involving Rajoy's PP.
Separatist parties campaigned against the backdrop of Spanish courts investigating their leaders on allegations of rebellion for their roles in the Oct. 1 referendum, which was ruled unconstitutional.
Deposed Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has campaigned from self-imposed exile in Brussels and his former deputy and now rival candidate, Oriol Junqueras, has done so from behind bars at a prison outside Madrid.

In a written interview with Reuters published on Monday, Junqueras struck a conciliatory tone and opened the door to building bridges with the Spanish state.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 06:20PM ET</span>","France to raise minimum food prices, limit bargain sales","PARIS (Reuters) - France will on Thursday announce a plan to raise regulated minimum food prices and limit bargain sales in supermarkets as part of a wider field-to-fork plan aimed at increasing farmers' income, a government official said.
The measures are part of a wider review promised by President Emmanuel Macron to appease farmers, an important constituency in French politics, who have long complained of being hit by squeezed margins and retail price wars.
In October Macron said the government would raise minimum prices retailers can charge on food products only if each sector proposed detailed organization plans by the end of the year. Most of these plans arrived late last week, the official said.
The government will propose that threshold below which retailers cannot sell food products will rise by some 10 percent while prices on promotional offers could not be discounted by more than 34 percent and no more than 25 percent of a product's volume could be sold in a promotional offer, the official said, in line with a proposal reported by daily Le Figaro.
The new rules, aimed at limiting sales at losses that pressure suppliers down the chain, would be applied for a trial period of two years.
Macron had delayed until year-end the proposal by retailers to raise regulated minimum prices as he sought guarantees it would meet his promise to boost farm income while minimizing retail inflation.
The measures will be included in a new law, set to be approved in the first half of next year, which will also tackle price renegotiation in case of a wide swing in commodity prices and create a reversed contract starting from farmers' production costs to food processors and to retailers.

Company and industry representatives, unions, non-governmental organizations and officials, have gathered at the so-called Food Convention since the summer to discuss topics ranging from food quality to farm income and export strategy.

1018,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 05:20PM ET</span>",Trump threatens to cut aid to U.N. members over Jerusalem vote,"By Roberta Rampton and Michelle Nichols
WASHINGTON/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that vote in favor of a draft United Nations resolution calling for the United States to withdraw its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
""They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us. Well, we're watching those votes. Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.
The 193-member U.N. General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday - at the request of Arab and Muslim countries - to vote on a draft resolution, which the United States vetoed on Monday in the 15-member U.N. Security Council.
The remaining 14 Security Council members voted in favor of the Egyptian-drafted resolution, which did not specifically mention the United States or Trump but which expressed ""deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem.""
U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, in a letter to dozens of U.N. states on Tuesday seen by Reuters, warned that Trump had asked her to ""report back on those countries who voted against us.""
She bluntly echoed that call in a Twitter post: ""The U.S. will be taking names."" 
Several senior diplomats said Haley's warning was unlikely to change many votes in the General Assembly, where such direct, public threats are rare. Some diplomats brushed off the warning as more likely aimed at impressing U.S. voters. 
According to figures from the U.S. government's aid agency USAID, in 2016 the United States provided some $13 billion in economic and military assistance to countries in sub-Saharan Africa and $1.6 billion to states in East Asia and Oceania.
It provided some $13 billion to countries in the Middle East and North Africa, $6.7 billion to countries in South and Central Asia, $1.5 billion to states in Europe and Eurasia and $2.2 billion to Western Hemisphere countries, according to USAID. 
Miroslav Lajcak, president of the General Assembly, declined to comment on Trump's remarks, but added: ""It's the right and responsibility of member states to express their views.""
A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also declined to comment on Trump's remarks on Wednesday. 
""I like the message that Nikki sent yesterday at the United Nations, for all those nations that take our money and then they vote against us at the Security Council, or they vote against us potentially at the assembly,"" Trump said.
'BULLYING' 
Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, generating outrage from Palestinians and the Arab world and concern among Washington's Western allies.
He also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. The draft U.N. resolution calls on all countries to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. 
A senior diplomat from a Muslim country, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of Haley's letter: ""States resort to such blatant bullying only when they know they do not have a moral or legal argument to convince others."" 
Responding directly to that comment on Twitter, Haley said: ""Actually it is when a country is tired of being taken for granted.""
A senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, described Haley's letter as ""poor tactics"" at the United Nations ""but pretty good for Haley 2020 or Haley 2024,"" referring to speculation that Haley might run for higher office. 
""She's not going to win any votes in the General Assembly or the Security Council, but she is going to win some votes in the U.S. population,"" the Western diplomat said. 
A senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed Haley was unlikely to sway many U.N. states. 
""We are missing some leadership here from the U.S. and this type of letter is definitely not helping to establish U.S. leadership in the Middle East peace process,"" the diplomat said.
Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city's eastern sector, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.

""The first name that she should write down is Bolivia,"" Bolivia's U.N. Ambassador Sacha Sergio Llorentty Solíz said of Haley's message. ""We regret the arrogance and disrespect to the sovereign decision of member states and to multilateralism.""

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Congo and Uganda are planning a joint military operation against a Congo-based Ugandan rebel group blamed for an attack that killed 15 United Nations peacekeepers, army officials from the two countries said on Wednesday.
Fighters from the Allied Democratic Forces are suspected of being behind the Dec. 8 assault on a base manned by Tanzanian U.N. troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo's troubled eastern borderlands. 
The attack, which also killed five Congolese soldiers and wounded another 53 peacekeepers, and came amid a rising wave of violence in the mineral-rich area.
""The commanders of the ADF are Ugandan citizens. A mechanism will be outlined so the two armies can share intelligence and carry out a coordinated operation,"" said General Marcel Mbangu Mashita, a senior Congolese army commander in the east.
Representatives from the two armies met in the Congolese border town of Kasindi last week.
Under the plan, Ugandan troops will not cross over into Congolese territory but instead be concentrated along the border.
""(The Ugandan army) is reinforcing security on the common border with Congo in order to dissuade any attempt by the ADF to cross over and attack targets of interest in Uganda,"" Ugandan army spokesman Brigadier Richard Karemire said.
Congo's U.N. peacekeeping mission, MONUSCO, has pledged to track down those responsible for the attack on its base. But it was not involved in the bilateral talks between the Congolese and Ugandan officials.
Rival militia groups control parts of eastern Congo, long after the official end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died, mostly from hunger and disease. 
Congo and Uganda were enemies during that conflict and, in the years since, relations between the two countries have at times been strained.
Increased militia violence this year in the center and east comes as Congo faces a political crisis linked to President Joseph Kabila's refusal to step down when his mandate expired last December.
The ADF is an Islamist group that has long been active along the border and has been blamed for a wave of massacres there over the past two years.
Since its leader Jamil Mukulu was arrested in 2015, it has been headed by Musa Baluku. 
General Mashita said previous Congolese operations had succeeded in eliminating around a third of the ADF's top commanders, but added that its ranks had been bolstered by escaped prisoners after a major prison break in June.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 04:17PM ET</span>",Ugandan parliament passes law allowing Museveni to seek re-election,"By Elias Biryabarema
KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan legislators voted late on Wednesday to amend the country's constitution to allow 73-year-old leader Yoweri Museveni to extend his rule, potentially guaranteeing him a life-time presidency. 
A provision in the current constitution limits the age of a presidential candidate at 75 years, which would have made Museveni ineligible to stand at the next polls in 2021.
At the end of Wednesday's day-long House debate, which capped a protracted and violence-marred process to remove that age limit, MPs voted 315-62 in favor of the amendment. 
""The bill passes,"" said speaker Rebecca Kadaga after announcing tally results, prompting raucous celebrations from the mostly ruling party MPs who favored the bill. 
Earlier in the day, two lawmakers were dragged away and detained when they tried to enter parliament, as the divisive debate proceeded in the chamber.
Police had blocked some legislators from entering the building, and live television footage showed two of them being driven away in security vehicles. Both opposed the bill.
The legislators blocked by police were attempting to enter parliament to serve court documents on House speaker Rebecca Kadaga, who was presiding over the debate.
The document called on her to appear in court at 2:00 PM in respect of ""the irregular suspension of our members of parliament,"" independent lawmaker Wilfred Niwagaba told a local television station minutes before he was detained. 
Six MPs - all opposed to removal of the age cap - were suspended from parliamentary proceedings on Monday for alleged disorderly conduct and refusing to heed the speaker's instructions.
The bill to amend the constitution was introduced in parliament on October 4 by a Museveni loyalist, after two consecutive days of brawling in the debating chamber between those opposed and those in favor, supported by security personnel. 
On the second day, security personnel who some MPs said were soldiers from an elite military unit entered the chamber and violently ejected at least 25 MPs that the speaker had suspended from proceedings for alleged misconduct. 
Wednesday's vote was the second time Ugandan parliament has changed the constitution to allow Museveni extend his rule. In 2005, they voted to remove a limit of two five-year terms, which blocked him from standing again.
The bill also extended the length of a term for MPs to seven years from the current five. The limit of two terms was also re-imposed for the president, although that only means Museveni would be limited to two more terms, starting with the 2021 election.
""Are you not seeing what happened in Zimbabwe, do we want his excellency to end like Gaddafi of Libya,"" opposition legislator, Gilbert Olanya, who opposed to the amendment, said in Wednesday's debate as he attempted to persuade colleagues to reject it.
Several African leaders have amended laws designed to limit their tenure. Such moves have fueled violence in countries including Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan.
Initially hailed for restoring political order and fostering economic growth, Museveni has lately come under mounting pressure fueled by runaway corruption, and accusations he uses security forces to maintain his grip on power. 

A combination of both military and police personnel were heavily deployed around parliament this week, which opposition MPs say was meant to intimidate members.

By Sharon Bernstein
(Reuters) - Virginia Democrat Shelly Simonds won a seat in the House of Delegates by one vote, changing the power balance in the state legislature and extending a tide of Democratic victories beginning with November's capture of the governorship and several legislative seats.
Simonds beat incumbent David Yancey in a recount held Tuesday, both parties said in statements released after the unofficial vote recount was completed by officials in Newport News.
""Never, ever forget how very much your vote counts,"" House of Delegates member David Toscano said on Twitter, one of many Democrats rejoicing that a single vote handed them the seat.
""I want to thank the voters who came out on Nov. 7,"" Simonds said in a news release. ""It wouldn't have happened without their participation.""
Republican leaders in the House of Delegates welcomed Simonds and thanked Yancey for his service, but the chairman of the state party vowed to fight on.
""Today, our opponents carried the day,"" Republican Party of Virginia Chairman John Whitbeck said in a statement emailed to Reuters. ""Tomorrow, we begin again.""
Simonds' election, which still must be affirmed by a panel of three judges, means that the 100-member House of Delegates will have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. That could lead to more moderate policies by forcing the parties to share power.
Before the Nov. 7 general election, Republicans held 66 seats to Democrats' 34, along with a majority in the state senate, according to the election information website Ballotpedia. The GOP still holds a slim margin in the senate.
Also on Nov. 7, the state elected Democrat Ralph Northam in a bitter race for governor, dealing a setback to President Donald Trump with a decisive victory over a Republican who had adopted some of the president’s combative tactics and issues.
Democrats also picked up a hotly contested Senate seat in Alabama this month, after Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated Republican Roy Moore in a special election to replace former Senator Jeff Sessions, now President Trump's Attorney General. Democratic Party activists hope their candidates can ride to victories in the 2018 Congressional elections on a wave of voter disenchantment with Trump and his Republicans. 
Four legislative races, including the Simonds-Yancey battle in the 94th District, were slated for recounts.
Going into the 94th District recount, Yancey was ahead by just 10 votes. On Tuesday, that changed, and Simonds clinched with a margin of one.

The authorities did not give details on what happened to the men, but drug gangs often hang the bodies of their murdered victims in public to intimidate rivals. Drug gang violence is set to make 2017 Mexico's deadliest year in modern history.
Two bodies were found on a bridge in Las Veredas, near Los Cabos International Airport, and two on a different bridge on the highway between Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo, local prosecutors said in a statement. 
In a separate statement, the prosecutors said two further bodies were found on a third bridge near the airport.
An official from the prosecutor's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the bodies of the men had been hung from the bridges.
Violent crime has spiked in Baja California, particularly around the once peaceful resort of Los Cabos visited by million of foreign tourists every year. Los Cabos police chief Juan Manuel Mayorga was shot dead last week. 
Mexico is on track for its most violent year since records began, with the rise of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, now one of the country's most powerful, and disputes between other criminal groups fueling murder rates.
On Tuesday, authorities in the northern state of Chihuahua said 12 people were killed in clashes between armed groups.
The governor of the state of Baja California Sur, Carlos Mendoza Davis, said that authorities were investigating the incidents near Los Cabos.
""I condemn these acts and any expression of violence. Today more than ever in #BCS we should be united,"" he said via Twitter, using the hashtag for the state's initials.
Homicides have more than doubled in Baja California Sur this year, with 409 people killed through October, from 192 in all of 2016. In June authorities said they had found a mass grave with the bodies of 11 men and three women near Los Cabos.
More than 4.4 million passengers, mostly international, have passed through Los Cabos Airport so far this year, according to operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico.

ABUJA/DAKAR (Reuters) - Cameroonian troops this month crossed into Nigeria in pursuit of rebels without seeking authorization from Nigeria, causing a falling-out between the governments behind the scenes, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
At least one incursion was confirmed by a Nigerian government official, two Nigerian military officers and two foreign diplomats, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity.
Nigerian security forces were deployed to the border to stop any further crossings, said a military source.
The Cameroonian and Nigerian governments said in separate statements there were no incursions. Relations between the two countries are good, Cameroon said.
Cameroonian military officials and pro-government media accuse Nigeria of sheltering Anglophone insurgents. For the past year they have been based in the dense equatorial forests that straddle the border between the two countries, fighting for an independent state they call Ambazonia.
At least 7,000 people have fled as refugees from Anglophone Cameroon to Nigeria following a crackdown ordered this year by President Paul Biya to quell the insurgency, which represents the gravest challenge yet to his 35-year rule.
French is the official language for most of Cameroon but two regions speak English and these border Nigeria, which is also Anglophone.
""Cameroonian troops were in Nigeria,"" said a foreign diplomat. ""Zero warning, zero authorization.""
The troops crossed into Nigeria at least twice this month, the diplomat and a Nigerian military official told Reuters.
The incidents have caused anger on both sides and could sour diplomatic relations further as Cameroon increases pressure on its Anglophone regions, according to the diplomat and a Nigerian government official.
""Tensions are high and could escalate,"" the government official said.
Cameroon government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary denied that troops had crossed the border illegally.
""Relations between the two countries are cohesive when it comes to fighting against terrorism. Cameroon and Nigeria are on the same wavelength."" 
Nigeria's foreign minister, speaking to Reuters after a cabinet meeting in Abuja, also denied the incursions.
""The (Nigerian) government had investigated and discovered that it's not true,"" said Geoffrey Onyeama, Nigeria's foreign minister.
But the Nigerian government official and a diplomat said Cameroon had threatened to suspend senior Nigerian embassy officials in Yaounde after they lodged complaints. Tchiroma and Onyeama denied this.
Governments in Africa often play down diplomatic disputes and present a show of harmony even during bitter rows.
On Monday, rebels killed four gendarmes, Cameroon's government said, the latest raid on police and military positions in the country's southwest region.
""TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY""
Nigeria has for decades been West Africa's powerhouse but the militaries of the two countries have cooperated extensively to confront a threat posed by Islamist militant group Boko Haram. The group has staged attacks in Nigeria for years but more recently it has also conducted deadly assaults in Cameroon.
Cameroon has repeatedly pressed Nigeria to allow it the right of hot pursuit for Boko Haram militants and the issue has left the countries at loggerheads.
After Cameroon's military crossed the border this month in pursuit of separatist insurgents, Nigeria sent security forces to deter any future attempts, said one of the military sources.
""We were not for war but keeping the peace and protecting our territorial integrity. They were asked to leave and they did and everything has been brought under control,"" the source said.
""Many refugees have crossed into Nigeria and many more are still crossing and the Cameroon authorities appear to be concerned that the situation may escalate if they keep coming into Nigeria.""
Two Cameroonian military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters separatists had set up bases and launched attacks from Nigeria.
One attack was on Dec. 14 and involved two groups of at least 100 separatists, one of the officials said.
""How do you explain that these guys come to attack us and then leave without being troubled across the border? When we drive them back, these separatists withdraw toward Nigeria,"" the official said.
Julius Ayuk Tabe, the Nigeria-based chairman of the Ambazonian Governing Council, the political wing of the armed resistance, said he was not aware of any separatist military bases in Nigeria.
Cameroon's linguistic divide harks back to the end of World War One, when the German colony of Kamerun was carved up between allied French and British victors.
The English-speaking regions joined the French-speaking Republic of Cameroon the year after its independence in 1960. French speakers have dominated the country's politics since.

The arrest, a year after Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, hijacked a truck and drove it into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people, comes as security services have warned of growing numbers of radical Islamists in Germany.
""He was considering an attack on the ice rink on the Schlossplatz in Karlsruhe,"" police in the south-western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said, adding that the suspect was a German citizen whose name they gave only as Dasbar W.
""To that end he was assessing areas around Karlsruhe Castle and, from September 2017, had begun seeking employment as a delivery driver - without success,"" the police statement said.
In 2015, the suspect traveled to Iraq to fight for Islamic State, receiving weapons training and working as a scout seeking potential attack targets in the city of Erbil, police said. He returned to Germany the following year.
Before leaving for Iraq, Dasbar worked for Islamic State from Germany, producing propaganda videos and proselytizing to converts in online chat rooms, police said.
Earlier this month, Germany's security service warned that the number of Salafists - followers of a radical Islamist ideology - had risen to an all-time high of 10,800, though the number prepared to mount attacks was in the order of hundreds.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 01:30PM ET</span>",Philippine police chief defends deadly drug war of the 'Davao Boys',"MANILA (Reuters) - The police chief of the Philippines on Wednesday stood by the head of a secretive unit behind dozens of killings in the country's war on drugs, saying officers fired only in self-defence and the death toll reflected the danger and the scale of the narcotics problem.
National police chief Ronald dela Rosa was responding to a Reuters Special Report that spent four months examining killings by one group of policemen from or near Davao City, the hometown of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
Dela Rosa said police district 6 in Quezon City had Metro Manila's most serious drug problem and he personally sent squad commander Lito Patay there because he was a ""very professional"" and ""very dedicated"" officer capable of dealing with it.
Patay handpicked and headed a unit of 10 men who called themselves the ""Davao Boys"", which racked up the highest number of kills in Quezon City, a violent frontline in Duterte's ferocious anti-narcotics campaign. 
Police station 6 officers killed 108 people in anti-drug operations from July 2016 through June 2017, the campaign's first year, accounting for 39 percent of Quezon City's body count, according to official crime reports analyzed by Reuters.
A majority of the killings were carried out by the squad run by Patay, who was reassigned to Quezon City just a few weeks after Duterte unleashed his crackdown.
""He (Patay) was chosen because I have big trust in him, he has the balls to face the problems. He will fight,"" dela Rosa told reporters.
""He is not an officer who is after money, who will be assigned in an area only to collect money, he is not that kind of officer. He has focus. I assigned him there because I know he can deliver.""
'FREE HAND'
Asked about the high rate of killings in areas under Patay, he said deaths were inevitable where the drugs trade was rampant.
""So what's the problem? The worst drug problem is there in station 6, so if you hit the problem head on, you face the problem head on then, there would always result in casualties,"" he said. 
Nearly 4,000 mostly urban poor Filipinos have been killed in anti-drug operations since July 2016. Police reject activists' allegations they have executed drug users and peddlers and say they kill only when their lives are in danger.
Dela Rosa said Patay has since been reassigned to another province to make him eligible for promotion, reflecting his success in convincing drug suspects in Quezon City to surrender to the authorities. 
He said Patay had been ""given a free hand"" at station 6 and had command responsibility over his operations. 
""It is his own call whatever he does there, he has to solve the drug problem,"" dela Rosa said.
The story of the Davao Boys also highlights a larger dynamic: Many of the drug war's key police officers - dela Rosa included - hail from or served in Duterte's hometown, where the campaign's brutal methods originated during his time as mayor.
Duterte has repeatedly denied he ordered the killings of criminals and drug dealers during his 22 years as Davao mayor, or his 17 months as president.
Dela Rosa appeared frustrated when asked by a reporter if he personally had ordered the deaths of drug suspects in Quezon City. He said Patay's men had no alternative but to kill armed criminals who refused to go quietly.

""He was placed there to address the drug problem, and not to kill those who deserved to be killed,"" he said of Patay. ""If they resist, why would you risk your life? You have to fight back.""

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 01:29PM ET</span>",Canada's Trudeau contravened ethics rules with visit to Aga Khan island,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau contravened some conflict of interest rules when he accepted a vacation last year on a private island belonging to the Aga Khan, the country's ethics watchdog said on Wednesday.
Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson said Trudeau contravened a rule on gifts when he accepted the use of the island in March and December 2016, while there were ongoing official dealings with the Aga Khan and the Aga Khan Foundation Canada was registered to lobby Trudeau's office.
""The vacations accepted by Mr. Trudeau or his family could reasonably be seen to have been given to influence Mr. Trudeau in his capacity as Prime Minister,"" Dawson said.
She found the exception for gifts from friends did not apply in this case.
Trudeau and his family vacationed on the island during the holidays in late December 2016 into January this year, while members of his family and their guests traveled there in March 2016.
Trudeau has come under fire from the opposition, who have said the luxury Bahamas vacation was inappropriate and showed the Liberal government is out of touch with average Canadians.
Trudeau told reporters he accepted the findings of the report and that he took ""full responsibility"" for the mistake.
Trudeau has said he has known the Aga Khan, Prince Shah Karim Al Husseini, since childhood. The Aga Khan, the title held by the leader of the Ismaili branch of Shi'ite Islam, was a pallbearer at the funeral of Justin's father, former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
Trudeau also contravened the rules when he and his family traveled in the Aga Khan's private helicopter last December and when his family traveled on a non-commercial aircraft chartered by the Aga Khan in March 2016, Dawson said.
Trudeau also went against the rules by not recusing himself from discussions that ""provided an opportunity to further private interests associated with institutions of the Aga Khan,"" the investigation found.

However, Trudeau did not discuss any parliamentary business with the Aga Khan or his representatives, the report said.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 12:31PM ET</span>","Myanmar says probe of two Reuters journalists almost finished, court case to follow","YANGON (Reuters) - A spokesman for Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Wednesday he had been informed that the police had almost completed their investigation of two Reuters journalists arrested over a week ago, after which a court case against them would begin.
Zaw Htay said the two reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, would then have access to a lawyer and be able to meet members of their families.
""It will not be long. The investigation is almost done,"" he said by telephone.
The spokesman said the Ministry of Home Affairs and police told him on Tuesday that the two men were being detained in Yangon, were ""in good condition"" and had not been subjected to ""illegal questioning."" 
A number of governments and human rights and journalist groups have criticized Myanmar's authorities for holding the pair incommunicado since their arrest, with no access to a lawyer, colleagues and family members.
Asked if the police were respecting their human rights, Zaw Htay replied, ""Yes, yes, I have told them not to do those things.""
""I told them to act according to the law. They guaranteed that they will act only according to the law,"" said Zaw Htay, who was not more specific.
Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, have been in detention since Dec. 12. There have been no details on where they were being held as authorities proceeded with an investigation into whether they had violated the country's colonial-era Official Secrets Act.
The act carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants. 
The United States and the United Nations have described the campaign as ethnic cleansing of the stateless Rohingya people.
The Myanmar military has said its own internal investigation had exonerated security forces of all accusations of atrocities in Rakhine. 
The two journalists were arrested on Dec. 12 after they were invited to dine with police officers on the outskirts of Myanmar's largest city, Yangon. 
The Ministry of Information said last week that they had ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"".
U.N. RIGHTS INVESTIGATOR BLOCKED
A number of major governments and political leaders, including the United States, Canada and Britain, and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, have called for the journalists' release.
Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday that the detentions appeared to be ""aimed at stopping independent reporting of the ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya.""
""Their secret, incommunicado detention lays bare government efforts to silence media reporting on critical issues,"" Brad Adams, the group's Asia director, said in a statement.
Separately, the U.N. independent investigator into human rights in Myanmar said on Wednesday she had been told by the government that it would not cooperate with her or grant her access to the country for the rest of her tenure.
Yanghee Lee, U.N. special rapporteur, said she had been due to visit in January to assess human rights, including allegations of abuses against Rohingya in Rakhine state.
""This declaration of non-cooperation with my mandate can only be viewed as a strong indication that there must be something terribly awful happening in Rakhine, as well as in the rest of the country,"" she said in a statement.
Myanmar government and foreign ministry spokesmen were not immediately available for comment on the criticism from Human Rights Watch and on Lee's status.
In Washington, the leading Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee called for the immediate release of the Reuters journalists.
""This is outrageous,"" said Senator Ben Cardin, who has introduced with 14 other lawmakers legislation that seeks through targeted sanctions and visa restrictions to hold senior Myanmar military officials accountable for human rights abuses.
""It just brings back the memory of the horrible practices with the repressive military rule.""
""PRESSURE ON MEDIA FREEDOM""
The Myanmar Press Council, some of whose members are government-appointed, told a news conference in Yangon that it would like to mediate in the case of the Reuters journalists.
Thiha Saw, the council's secretary, told Reuters that the arrests were not aimed at muzzling the media.
""I don't agree that this is to silence the voices of the journalists attempting to cover the Rakhine issue independently ... We don't want to generalize things,"" he said.
Critics have characterized the arrests as an attack on press freedom in the former Burma and, although this is not a view widely held in Myanmar, about one-third of the roughly 100 journalists at the news conference were dressed in black as a protest against the detention of the Reuters reporters. 
Myanmar has seen rapid growth in independent media since censorship imposed under the former junta was lifted in 2012.
Rights groups were hopeful there would be further gains in press freedoms after Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi came to power last year amid a transition from full military rule that had propelled her from political prisoner to elected leader.
However, advocacy groups say that freedom of speech has eroded since she took office, with many arrests of journalists, restrictions on reporting in Rakhine state and heavy use of state-run media to control the narrative.
""If the government continues to ratchet up the pressure on the independent press, media freedom in Aung San Suu Kyi's Burma will look a lot more like the media repression during the military junta,"" Human Rights Watch's Adams said.

Myo Nyunt, deputy director for Myanmar's Ministry of Information, told Reuters on Saturday that the case against Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had nothing to do with press freedom, and said journalists have ""freedom to write and speak.""

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Wednesday his new coalition would focus on fighting anti-Semitism, after Israel made it clear it would not work directly with any ministers from the far-right party now back in government.
Kurz, a 31-year-old conservative, was sworn in with the rest of his government on Monday after reaching a coalition deal that handed control of much of Austria's security apparatus to the anti-Islam Freedom Party (FPO). The FPO came third in October's parliamentary election with 26 percent of the vote.
Israel reacted to the inauguration by saying it would do business only with the ""operational echelons"" of government departments headed by an FPO minister. The FPO now controls the foreign, interior and defence ministries, though Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl is not officially a member of the party.
""Anti-Semitism has no place in Austria or Europe. We will fight all forms of anti-Semitism with full determination, both those that still exist and those that have been newly imported,"" said in a speech outlining the government's goals to parliament. ""That will be one of our government's significant tasks.""
The FPO, which was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, says it has left its anti-Semitic past behind it, though it has still had to expel members each year for anti-Semitic or neo-Nazi comments. 
It now openly courts Jewish voters, with limited success. Its leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, has also visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem.
""Israel wishes to underline its total commitment to fighting anti-Semitism and commemorating the Holocaust,"" the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a short statement on Monday in response to the Austrian government's swearing in.
""SHAMEFUL AND SAD""
The European Jewish Congress has called on the new government to take concrete steps against anti-Semitism while taking a generally more inclusive approach. 
""The Freedom Party cannot use the Jewish community as a fig leaf and must show tolerance and acceptance towards all communities and minorities,"" it said on Monday.
Austria, where Adolf Hitler was born, was annexed by Nazi Germany in March 1938. Next year will mark the 80th anniversary of that takeover as well as the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, which led to the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Kurz said the events of 1938 were ""shameful and sad"".
His People's Party (OVP) and the FPO published a 180-page coalition manifesto over the weekend, which includes plans to cut public spending, taxes and benefits for refugees.
The OVP won October's election with a hard line on immigration that often overlapped with the FPO's. The issue dominated the campaign after Austria took in large numbers of asylum seekers during Europe's migration crisis, many of them from Muslim countries.
Austria's Jewish community of just over 10,000 is tiny relative to the more than half a million Muslims who live in the nation of almost 9 million, many of whom are Turkish or of Turkish origin.
Both Kurz and Strache have warned of Muslim ""parallel societies"" they say are emerging in Austria, despite there being few obvious signs of sectarian tension.
Kurz flew to Brussels on Tuesday to dispel concerns that his alliance with the far right will undermine the European Union. In their speeches to parliament, both he and Strache said they opposed Turkey joining the European Union -- a position that polls show a majority of Austrians support.
""Turkey is moving in the wrong direction, which means Turkey will certainly have no future in the European Union,"" said Kurz, who has criticised Ankara's clampdown on dissent since a failed coup last year.
On Tuesday night during his first foreign visit as chancellor, to Brussels, Kurz told broadcaster ORF he would ""soon"" meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

""I hope we will succeed in dispelling the concerns that exist regarding the FPO government members,"" Kurz said. ""It would be in the interest of both our countries.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday imposed new sanctions on five Russians and Chechens, including the head of the Russian republic of Chechnya, for alleged human rights abuses. 
The new sanctions blacklisted Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader and a close ally of Vladimir Putin, the Treasury Department said in a statement. 
U.S. authorities accused Kadyrov of overseeing ""an administration involved in disappearances and extrajudicial killings.""
The U.S. Treasury Department imposed the sanctions, which freeze the banks accounts of those targeted, under a 2012 law known as the Magnitsky Act. 
The Magnitsky Act imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian auditor and whistleblower. The act also seeks to hold responsible those U.S. authorities allege orchestrated or benefited from the death of Magnitsky. 
Magnitsky was arrested and died in a Moscow jail in 2009 after discovering a $230 million tax fraud scheme, according to U.S. authorities. Supporters of Magnitsky say the Russian state murdered him by denying him adequate medical care after he was imprisoned on tax evasion charges. The Kremlin denies the allegation.

In addition to Kadyrov and one other Chechen official, the Treasury's action on Wednesday targeted three Russians that U.S. authorities say were involved in the complex tax fraud scheme that Magnitsky exposed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for an executive at Turkey's majority state-owned Halkbank who is accused of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions on Wednesday asked a U.S. federal judge to declare a mistrial as jurors were expected to begin deliberating.
In a motion filed in Manhattan federal court, the lawyers for Mehmet Hakan Atilla said prosecutors had prejudiced the jury by asking their client during cross-examination on Tuesday whether he remembered that a report by a Turkish expert concluded he violated sanctions.
Atilla's lawyers immediately objected before Atilla could answer, and U.S. District Judge Richard Berman ordered the question stricken from the record. However, Atilla's lawyers said Wednesday that the damage had been done.
They said jurors should not have been allowed to hear about the Turkish report because its author was not in court, depriving Atilla of his right to confront his accuser. They also said the question ""grossly mischaracterized"" the report's conclusion.
""Asking this question in open court had the effect of introducing otherwise inadmissible hearsay and an expert opinion on the ultimate issue for the jury,"" they said.
Berman ordered prosecutors to respond to the motion by 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) Wednesday.
Jurors had been expected to begin deliberating Wednesday morning after a three-week trial that has strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey.
At the center of the trial was explosive testimony from Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who pleaded guilty to charges of violating sanctions and testified for U.S. prosecutors.
Zarrab testified that Atilla helped design fraudulent transactions of gold and food that allowed Iran to spend its oil and gas revenues abroad, including through U.S. financial institutions, defying U.S. sanctions.
Zarrab also implicated Turkish officials in the scheme, including President Tayyip Erdogan.
Attempts to reach Erdogan’s spokesman for comment on the allegations at the trial have been unsuccessful. Erdogan has publicly dismissed the case as a politically motivated attack on his government.
Atilla, testifying in his own defense at the trial, denied all the charges against him.
Halkbank has denied taking part in any illegal transactions.
Atilla's lawyers already asked for a mistrial last week after jurors heard testimony from Huseyin Korkmaz, a former Turkish police officer who said he led an investigation that included Atilla and was forced to flee Turkey to escape retaliation. Berman denied that motion.
U.S. prosecutors charged nine people in the criminal case, though only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, were arrested by U.S. authorities.

(Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to exploratory talks on forming a new government starting on Jan. 7, both parties said on Wednesday after informal discussions.
The decision, 87 days after a national election that returned a fragmented parliament and complicated coalition arithmetic, brightens prospects for a renewal of the ""grand coalition"" that governed Germany over the past four years.
A repeat coalition is Merkel's best chance of securing a fourth term as chancellor after talks on forming a three-way alliance with two smaller parties broke down, leaving Europe's largest economy in an unprecedented state of uncertainty.
""It was a good discussion in a trusting atmosphere,"" the parties said in a joint statement after leaders met on Wednesday. They agreed to hold four days of talks from Jan. 7, with the aim of deciding by Jan. 12 whether to open formal coalition negotiations.
Even in the most optimistic case, Germany will have smashed 2013's post-World War Two record of needing 86 days to form a new government after an election. The hiatus highlights that Germany, long Europe's bastion of stability, is not immune to the political fragmentation that has swept the continent.
The conservatives and Social Democrats have identified 15 policy areas for exploration, including education, the welfare state and employment law, where the SPD is keen to carve out a distinctive left-wing identity for itself after a disastrous election showing blamed in part on Merkel's dominant stature.
The SPD's membership, which tends to be more radical than the party leadership, will have to ratify any decision to repeat a coalition with Merkel, who has been in power for 12 years.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government urged voters on Wednesday to reject a campaign for a nationwide ban on face veils, saying any decision on facial coverings was a matter for Switzerland's cantons individually.
But, in a counter move to a referendum to be held by 2020, the government said it would propose to voters a ban on face veils being worn by individuals while doing business with federal authorities, including in immigration offices or employment agencies.
""Regulation of public spaces in Switzerland is traditionally a cantonal matter,"" the government said in a statement. ""So cantons should continue to decide for themselves whether to enact a ban on facial coverings.""
In particular, it said it was down to individual cantons to decide how they handled tourists from the Arab world who wore the veil.
In September, activists submitted a petition for a nationwide ban after collecting more than the 100,000 signatures required to put the proposal to a binding referendum.
Several cantons have already taken a stand on the issue.
Zurich, Solothurn, Schwyz, Basel City and Glarus have rejected a ban on veils, while Italian-speaking Ticino has imposed a ban.
At least two demonstrators who wore veils in Ticino in defiance of the ban were fined 250 Swiss francs ($260), according to media reports.
The parliament in St. Gallen canton this year backed a ban on facial coverings which were deemed likely to endanger public security or upset the peace.
With an eye to the referendum, the federal government said it would also present a proposal to stop individuals being forced to cover their face.
""We can not allow husbands and fathers to demand their wives and daughters wear a face veil,"" Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga told a news conference.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark will no longer take in refugees under a U.N. resettlement program after passing a law on Wednesday that enables the government to determine how many may enter the country instead of accepting a set quota.
Since 1989, Denmark has agreed to take 500 refugees a year selected by the United Nations under a program to ease the burden on countries that neighbor war zones. 
But after the European migration crisis in 2015 brought almost 20,000 claims for asylum, Denmark has refused to take any U.N. quota refugees and the center-right government's new law aims to cut total refugee numbers to no more than 500 a year.
Last year, more than 6,000 people claimed asylum in Denmark. Between January and November this year a little over 3,000 people did. 
The opposition Social-Liberal Party said opting out of the U.N. program would increase pressure on countries already accommodating large numbers of refugees, and the move could encourage others countries to follow suit.
Under the new law, the immigration minister will decide how many refugees will be allowed, but the number can never surpass 500 each year unless there is an ""exceptional situation"". 
""It's hard to predict how many refugees and migrants will show up at the border to seek asylum, and we know it may be hard to integrate those who arrive here,"" Immigration and Integration Minister Inger Stojberg said last month when her ministry proposed the law.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Wednesday promised zero tolerance in his government's push to punish corruption that stifled political freedom and economic growth under Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule.
Mnangagwa, giving his first state of the nation address since he assumed power last month following a de facto coup that ousted his 93-year-old predecessor, has sought to draw a line under years of endemic corruption and impunity. 
Under pressure to deliver results, especially on an economy crippled by severe currency shortages, Mnangagwa said reforms of a bloated state sector would be launched in early 2018. 
With opposition parties calling for widespread political reforms before an election next year, he repeated a promise that his government would do everything in its power to ensure a credible, free and fair ballot.
""Corruption remains the major source of some of the problems we face as a country and its retarding impact on national development cannot be overemphasized,"" Mnangagwa told a joint sitting of the country's two houses of parliament.
""On individual cases of corruption, every case must be investigated and punished in accordance with the dictates of our laws. There should be no sacred cows. My government will have zero tolerance towards corruption and this has already begun.""
The latter was an apparent reference to comments last week he would name and shame those who failed to return stolen public funds after a three-month amnesty ends in February. 
His government is also pursuing corruption charges dating back over two decades against former finance minister Ignatius Chombo, a close ally of Mugabe and his wife, Grace. Chombo, whose lawyer has said he will deny the charges, faces trial early next year.
""ALBATROSS""
In the latter half of Mugabe's rule the economy fell apart amid the violent and chaotic seizure of thousands of white-owned commercial farms.
Billions of dollars of domestic debt issued to pay for a bloated civil service triggered a collapse in the value of Zimbabwe's de facto currency and hyperinflation. 
Mnangagwa said the government would in the first quarter of next year announce a program to reform, commercialize or shut down some state-owned firms he said had been ""for a long time an albatross around the government's neck"".
Zimbabwe's efforts to re-engage international lenders and lure investors will rest on the credibility of next year's election, and the president again pledged a commitment to a free and fair vote.
To level a playing field they say is skewed in favor of Mnangagwa's ZANU-PF party, opposition parties have however challenged his army-backed government to first enact a long list of electoral reforms.
They include a new voters' roll, opposition access to public media, allowing an estimated three million Zimbabweans living abroad to vote and international observers including the United Nations.
""We would like to see genuine, credible electoral reforms that will lead to free and fair elections and they must be underwritten and guaranteed by the international community,"" Tendai Biti, leader of the opposition MDC Alliance, told reporters ahead of Mnangagwa's address.
Biti and other members of the alliance also criticized what they called the ""militarization"" of the government following the appointment of two former senior military officials to the new cabinet. 
Mnangagwa gave his clearest signal yet on Tuesday that he would appoint as vice president Constantino Chiwenga, the military leader who led the coup that ousted Mugabe.

Chris Mutsvangwa, adviser to the president and the influential leader of the war veterans' association, has rejected the criticism of the appointments, saying they were not unique to Zimbabwe.

The Balkan, formerly communist country is the poorest as well as one of the most corrupt countries in the EU, which it joined in 2007, and has made scant progress towards stamping out graft and organized crime.
The European Commission, the EU's executive, has repeatedly rebuked Bulgaria for failing to prosecute and sentence allegedly corrupt officials and for not overhauling a creaking judiciary.
""This law corresponds to the wishes of Bulgarian citizens and the European Commission,"" said Tsvetan Tsvetanov, chairman of the ruling GERB party's parliamentary group.
Analysts voiced concern, though, that the bill would not allow efficient investigations of corruption networks.
The management of a special anti-graft unit envisaged by the legislation would be appointed by parliament, something analysts said could limit its objectivity. 
Radev said the new five-person unit, meant to investigate persons occupying high state posts as well as assets and conflict of interest, may not be truly independent and could be used by those in power to persecute opponents.
""The instruments envisaged in this law are ineffective,"" Radev said last week. ""It does not deal a blow on those who feed corruption, and it can be used as a weapon against inconvenient people."" He said he would veto the measure.
The president, prime minister and lawmakers could be targets of investigation, as well as municipal councillors, directors of hospitals and border customs bosses.
The new law also focuses on improving control and accountability of law-enforcement agencies, just before Bulgaria assumes the six-month, rotating EU presidency in January.
Corruption has deterred foreign investment since communism collapsed in Bulgaria in 1989, and the EU has kept Sofia as well as neighboring Romania - for the same rule-of-law failings - outside its Schengen zone of passport-free travel.

JUBA (Reuters) - Six aid workers kidnapped by rebels in South Sudan earlier this week have been released, according to the United Nations and a spokesman for the rebels. 
The aid workers are from the French organization Solidarites International and had been kidnapped on Sunday while traveling on a road near the city of Raja, in the west of the country. 
""All of them were released and they have landed safely in Wau,"" another city in the west of the country, a United Nations official in Juba who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters. He said one of those who had been held by the rebels was a foreigner. 
Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel told Reuters that the six humanitarian aid workers had been freed: ""All their belongings were given back to them including their vehicles."" It was not clear why the rebels had taken the aid workers and their vehicles into custody.
Solidarites said in a statement on Monday that it had lost contact with three members of its team on Saturday. [L8N1OI50M]
It gave no indication of their fate and it was not immediately clear why it gave a different number of those involved. 
The spokesman for Solidarites in Paris did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement of the release of its staff. The army spokesman in Juba also did not respond to request for comment.
South Sudan is one of the world's most dangerous countries for aid workers. Some 28 aid workers have been killed this year, with nine shot dead in November alone, according to the United Nations.
The world's youngest nation is embroiled in a civil war that has killed tens of thousands of people and forced a third of the 12 million strong population to flee their homes.

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian officials, security monitors and Kiev's foreign backers warned on Wednesday that Moscow's decision to withdraw from a Ukrainian-Russian ceasefire control group could worsen the fighting in eastern Ukraine.
On Monday, the Russian foreign ministry said it was recalling officers serving at the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination (JCCC) in Ukraine, accusing the Ukrainian side of obstructing their work and limiting access to the front line.
Ukrainian Defence Minister Stepan Poltorak and security chief Olekshandr Turchynov said the decision, coupled with a recent surge in fighting in the eastern Donbass region, suggested Russia had switched to a more offensive strategy.
""We cannot rule out that they withdrew their officers in order to start stepping up not only military provocations but also military operations,"" Turchynov said. ""We will strengthen our positions at the front.""
""The Ukrainian armed forces are currently prepared for a change in the situation,"" Poltorak told journalists.
A Russia-backed separatist insurgency erupted in 2014 and the bloodshed has continued despite a ceasefire that was meant to end the conflict. More than 10,000 people have been killed, with casualties reported on a near-daily basis.
A spokesman for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which works with the JCCC to monitor the much-violated Minsk peace agreement, said: 
""We are concerned about any step that might lead to a further deterioration of the security situation in the region, affecting both the SMM (OSCE special monitoring mission) and the civilian population."" 
Fighting between Ukrainian troops and separatists has climbed to the worst level in months, the OSCE said this week, after the shelling of a frontline village wounded civilians and destroyed or damaged dozens of homes.
Russia denies accusations from Ukraine and NATO it supports the rebels with troops and weapons, but the U.S. envoy to peace talks, Kurt Volker, said Moscow was answerable for the violence. 
""Russia withdrew its officers from JCCC - a ceasefire implementation tool - right before a massive escalation in ceasefire violations. Ukraine just suffered some of the worst fighting since February, 2017. Decision for peace lies with Russia,"" Volker tweeted on Tuesday.
Germany and France, which have spearheaded international efforts to resolve the conflict, expressed concern. A Germany foreign ministry spokesman said ""it could have severe consequences for civilians in the conflict zones.""
""We call on the Russian authorities to reconsider this decision and hope that the Ukrainian authorities will guarantee access to Ukrainian territory to Russian representatives of the joint center (JCCC),"" said Alexandre Giorgini, deputy spokesman for the French foreign ministry.

Created in 2014, the JCCC is made up of Ukrainian and Russian officers, who are meant to work together to ensure the safety of OSCE monitors and help implement the Minsk ceasefire.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 10:00AM ET</span>",Somali lawmakers seek to impeach president amid political crisis,"By Abdi Sheikh and Katharine Houreld
MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Some Somali lawmakers said on Wednesday they plan to impeach the president in a mounting political crisis that could put the fledgling government on a violent collision course with one of the country's most powerful clans. 
The political turmoil endangers fragile gains against the Islamist al Shabaab insurgency and could derail the government of President Mohamed Abdullahi. Universally known by his nickname ""Farmajo"", the dual U.S.-Somali citizen took power earlier this year in a U.N.-backed process. 
The Horn of Africa state's parliament adjourned last week until the end of February, but some legislators want it to reconvene on an emergency basis, lawmaker Mahad Salad told Reuters.
""Ninety-six lawmakers have asked the speaker to reopen the session so that the impeachment against the president kicks off. The president is accused of violation of the constitution, treason, destruction of the federal states and so on,"" he said. 
The letter had not yet been delivered to the speaker. There are 275 lawmakers and two-thirds would have to vote against the president to impeach him. 
The motion follows a deadly raid on Sunday on the home of an opposition leader, Abdirahman Abdishakur Warsame, who ran for the presidency against Farmajo. Somali security agents arrived at his house around midnight and engaged his guards in a firefight, killing five people.
The minister of security said Warsame resisted arrest and he would be charged with treason. He appeared in court on Tuesday but no warrant was shown for his arrest, a witness said. A Wednesday court hearing was postponed until Thursday. 
The information minister did not return calls seeking comment. A statement from the security minister and attorney general said they were ""investigating the crimes of Somalis who were involved in treason, terror and the destruction of government systems"".
POWERFUL CLAN 
Warsame comes from Somalia's formidable Habar Gidir clan, which is spread across south-central Somalia. Although both his supporters and the government stress that his detention is political, rather than a clan issue, it will further sour relations between the two sides.
If that sparks fighting it could split Somalia's security forces, which are composed mostly of clan-based militias. In September, a battle between the police, intelligence, and military killed nine people in Mogadishu's Habar Gidir district. 
""It's a lose-lose situation for the government. If they pursue this, they face a showdown with the Habar Gidir, who are powerful, wealthy and well-armed and provide many units in the SNA,"" said a Somalia security analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity, referring to the Somali National Army. 
""If they back down, they look weak. It's very hard to see how the administration could survive this crisis."" 
In August, a joint U.S.-Somali raid in the town of Bariire killed 10 Habar Gidir members. The U.S. military said they were Islamist militants but clan elders said they were civilians.
In May, a soldier accidentally killed the minister of public works in a case of mistaken identity. A Habar Gidir clan member, the soldier was sentenced to death, angering clan members who felt that blood money should have been accepted.
POLITICAL PROBLEMS
Somalia's new government has won plaudits from diplomats for trying to assess the extent of mismanagement and corruption in the armed forces and the International Monetary Fund has praised it for fiscal reforms.
But at home, the government has many problems.
It has hired and fired a string of top security officials. Al Shabaab militants, skilled at exploiting clan divisions, stepped up a campaign of deadly bombings in Mogadishu. One October bomb killed more than 500 people. 
A split between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, both of which have supported Somali factions, has fuelled a spat between the president and leaders of Somalia's regional administrations, damaging security cooperation. 
This month, the U.S. government announced it was suspending aid to most of the military over accountability concerns.
Now many parliamentarians are angry that a government that promotes itself as reformist is arresting critics like Warsame, said Abdirizak Mohamed, a lawmaker and former security minister. 

""MPs are concerned about freedom of expression and association. This was an unnecessary crisis when they already had a lot on their plate.""

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 10:00AM ET</span>",Senior Saudi prince says Trump's Jerusalem move threatens stability,"By Rania El Gamal and Katie Paul
RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital will stoke violence in the region, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said, dismissing reports of prior consultations made with Riyadh over the move. 
""It is a very bad decision. The consequences will be more bloodshed, more conflict rather than peaceful resolution,"" Prince Turki, a senior royal family member and a former ambassador to Washington, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday in Riyadh.
Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy and veered from international consensus this month by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Most countries say the city's status must be left to negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
Saudi Arabia condemned the decision. Saudi King Salman told President Trump that any decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem before a permanent peace settlement is reached will inflame the feelings of Muslims, official media reported.
But Saudi Arabia stopped short of calling for any Arab action against the decision. Palestinian officials say Riyadh has been working for weeks behind the scenes to press them to support a nascent U.S. peace plan.
""The reaction here was total surprise,"" said Prince Turki, who now holds no government office but remains influential. 
""... If there has been prior consultation or anything like that, why would the King go through the process of telling him (Trump) this is a bad idea and make that known publicly?"" 
""I don't think there ever was any discussion of this"" before the decision was taken, he added.
ARAB PEACE INITIATIVE
As regards possible Saudi and Arab action in response to Trump's decision, Prince Turki said: ""I am sure lots of people would prefer to have something just for the sake of appearance but I don't think that's how the Saudi government operates. If it is going to take action, it is going to be a serious action.""
Four Palestinian officials, who spoke on condition they not be named, said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have discussed in detail a grand bargain that Trump and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser, are expected to unveil in the first half of 2018. Arab officials say the plan is still in its early phases of development. 
Prince Turki said he was unaware of details of any such plan.
Prince Turki is a son of King Faisal, who was assassinated in 1975. His brother, Saud al-Faisal, served as foreign minister for 40 years until 2015, and their branch of the family is seen as influential over Saudi foreign policy, even as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has solidified his authority.
Prince Saud championed a 2002 Arab peace initiative which called for normalizing relations between Arab countries and Israel in return for Israel’s withdrawal from lands occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.
In a letter to Trump published in a Saudi newspaper on Dec. 11, Prince Turki said that Trump's ""opportunistic"" Jerusalem move would threaten security in the region.
KINGDOM QUELLS PROMOTERS OF MILITANCY 
""The now much diminished terrorist international gets a rejuvenation boost from you and re-energizes its recruitment of volunteers to broaden their murderous attacks on innocent civilians, worldwide,"" he wrote in his letter.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said he would encourage a more moderate and tolerant version of Islam in the ultra-conservative kingdom.
The ambitious young prince has already taken some steps to loosen Saudi Arabia's ultra-strict social restrictions, scaling back the role of religious morality police, permitting public concerts and announcing plans to allow women to drive next year.
Prince Turki said that Saudis share in the blame for the spread of extremist ideology through funding of mosques abroad that may have fallen into the wrong hands, but that such funding stopped since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. 
""The kingdom has been the victim of such people and such activity... Since Sept. 11 the kingdom has had a sustained and continuous program opposing extremist ideology, not just in the kingdom but abroad,"" he told Reuters. 

""For a period of time, yes it is true there were some Saudis who promoted issues of extremism and so on. Now we are getting rid of all of those. I would say we have gotten rid of most of them, if not all of them.""

A violent crackdown by the security forces in response to attacks by militants in the western state has caused around 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in recent months.
The discover of the grave, at the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe, was announced by the military two days ago.
In a statement posted on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of the military's commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the army said a five-member investigation team had left the capital Naypyitaw on Wednesday.
The team, led by Lieutenant General Aye Win, would ""investigate whether the security forces took part or not, in relation to the unidentified dead bodies found in Inn Din village graveyard"".
It gave no further details and military officials were not immediately available for comment.
General Aye Win is the same officer who led a wider probe into the conduct of troops in a conflict that began in late August, which concluded in a report last month that no atrocities took place.
Myanmar's armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern Rakhine, where many of the stateless Muslim minority lived, after Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25.
Rights monitors have accused troops of abuses, including killings, mass rape and arson during those operations. The United States has said it amounted to ""ethnic cleansing"".
Myanmar's civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya.
The civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. It has promised to investigate allegations of abuses in Rakhine if it is given evidence.

1051,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 09:52AM ET</span>",South Korea says delay in military drills aimed only at ensuring peaceful Olympics,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean officials said on Wednesday a proposed delay in military drills with the United States was aimed at ensuring a peaceful 2018 Winter Olympics, not ending the North Korean missile crisis, as relations with China suffered new setbacks.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in is seeking to soothe relations with North Korea, which is pursuing nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of U.N. sanctions, and with China, the North's lone major ally, before the Games begin in South Korea in February.
China, which hosted years of on-again-off-again six-party talks to try to end the North Korea standoff, resumed some blocks on group tours to South Korea, industry sources said, and rebuked Seoul for firing warning shots at Chinese fishing boats 
On Tuesday, Moon, who visited China last week, said he had proposed postponing major military drills with the United States until after the Games, a move his office said was designed to reassure athletes and spectators.
""This is confined to our efforts to host a peaceful Olympics,"" an official from the presidential Blue House said. ""We are only talking about the exercises which are supposed to take place during the Olympics and Paralympics.""
North Korea sees the regular joint exercises as preparation for war, while China is still angry about the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system, commonly known as THAAD, by South Korea, whose powerful radar it fears could see deep inside its territory.
The South argues it needs THAAD to guard against the threat posed by North Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, Japan and the United States.

The proposed delay in drills was discussed during a summit last week between Moon and Chinese President Xi Jinping, after the proposal had already been submitted to the Americans, the Blue House official said.
China and Russia have proposed a ""freeze for freeze"" arrangement under which North Korea would stop its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a halt to the exercises. However, the official denied the proposed delay had anything to do with the freeze idea.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in Ottawa on Tuesday he was unaware of any plans to ""alter longstanding and scheduled and regular military exercises"".
North Korea has stepped up its missile and nuclear tests at an unprecedented rate this year, and any new provocation from the North would ""inevitably have an impact"" on the exercises, the Blue House official said.
""It is a display of the president's strong message that North Korea must not conduct any provocation (during the Olympics),"" the official told reporters.
(For a graphic on North Korea's missile and nuclear tests, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2vXbj0S)
""BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS""
Japan's Asahi newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing an unidentified person connected to South Korean intelligence, that North Korea was conducting biological experiments to test the possibility of loading anthrax-laden warheads on its intercontinental ballistic missiles.
The Asahi report said the U.S. government was aware of the tests, which were meant to ascertain whether the anthrax bacteria could survive the high temperatures that occur during warheads' re-entry from space.
Reuters was unable to verify the report independently.
In a statement released by state media, North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called reports it was developing biological weapons ""nonsense"" designed to provoke nuclear war.
The United States has given China a draft resolution for tougher U.N. sanctions on North Korea and is hoping for a quick vote on it by the U.N. Security Council, a Western diplomat said on Tuesday, however Beijing has yet to sign on.
When asked about the U.S. resolution at a press briefing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying would only say that China always takes a responsible and constructive attitude towards Security Council talks on North Korea.
The United States has also called on the Security Council to blacklist 10 ships for circumventing sanctions on North Korea. Hua said China had received the proposal from the United States. 
WARNING SHOTS
China has resumed at least some restrictions on group tours into the South, South Korea's inbound travel agency said. The restrictions were first in place last year as part of China's retaliation over THAAD deployment.
""I was told from my boss this morning that our Chinese partners (based in Beijing and Shandong) said they won't send group tourists to South Korea as of January,"" the official from Naeil Tour Agency told Reuters by phone. 
One source in China said the reason for reinstating the ban was to rein in overly aggressive tour operators who had been rolling out package deals to South Korea too quickly in the eyes of authorities.
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua told reporters she had not heard of a tourism ban, but she reiterated that Moon's visit to Beijing was successful and that China has an open attitude towards exchanges and cooperation in all areas. 
Beijing has never officially confirmed restrictions on tourism.
Three representatives at Beijing travel agencies told Reuters that they were not currently organising group tours to South Korea. One confirmed that the tourism administration had issued the notice, while a third said: ""At the moment we have no group trips to South Korea.""
A travel agency in the northern province of Shandong also said it could not organise group trips. Three others said they could, but with restrictions such as on the number of people.
South Korea's coast guard said on Wednesday it had fired around 250 warning shots on Tuesday to chase away a fleet of 44 Chinese boats fortified with iron bars and steel mesh that were fishing illegally in South Korean waters.
""The Chinese fishing boats sought to swarm around and collide with our patrol ship, ignoring the broadcast warnings,"" the coast guard said in a statement. 
China, which has in the past lodged diplomatic protests to South Korea over the use of force by its coast guard, expressed ""serious concern"" about the latest clash.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 09:40AM ET</span>",Opposition groups quit Iraqi Kurdish government,"SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - Leading Kurdish opposition movement Gorran has withdrawn its ministers from Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and its member Yousif Mohamed has resigned as parliament speaker, party sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
The Kurdistan Islamic Group (Komal), another opposition party with a smaller presence in parliament, also withdrew from the government. 
The departures follow two days of violent unrest in the region, as Kurdish demonstrators joined protests against years of austerity and unpaid public sector salaries, amid tensions between their region and Baghdad. 
Some protesters have demanded the regional government's ousting.
Tension has been high in the region since the central government in Baghdad imposed tough measures when the KRG unilaterally held an independence referendum on Sept. 25 and Kurds voted overwhelmingly to secede.
The move, in defiance of Baghdad, also alarmed neighboring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities.
At least three people were killed and more than 80 wounded on Tuesday. They were killed in clashes with Kurdish security forces, local officials said, and some were injured when the crowd was shot at with rubber bullets and sprayed with tear gas. 
Protesters also attacked several offices of the main political parties in Sulaimaniya province on Monday and Tuesday.
CURFEWS IMPOSED
There were no major protests in the city on Wednesday.
Security forces from the region's capital Erbil have been deployed to help quell the unrest in the city, security sources told Reuters. 
After Tuesday's unrest, curfews were imposed in several towns across the province, some have lasted through Wednesday.
Local media reported smaller protests in towns across the province, including Ranya and Kifri. 
In a statement on Tuesday, Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani, who is on an official visit to Germany, told protesters that although he understood their frustrations, the burning of political party offices is ""not helpful"". 
The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) said on Wednesday it was ""deeply concerned"" about violence and clashes during the protests, and called for restraint on all sides.
""The people have the right to partake in peaceful demonstrations, and the authorities have the responsibility of protecting their citizens, including peaceful protesters,"" UNAMI said in a statement.
UNAMI also called on the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to respect media freedoms after Kurdish Asayish security forces on Tuesday raided the offices of Kurdish private broadcast NRT in Sulaimaniya, and took the channel off the air.

NRT's founder and opposition figure Shaswar Abdulwahid was also arrested at the Sulaimaniya airport on Tuesday. His family have asked for his release, amid reports that another NRT journalist was arrested in Sulaimaniya on Wednesday.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Two Kosovo men pleaded guilty on Wednesday to planning attacks at a World Cup soccer match in Albania against the visiting Israel team last year.
Kosovo police arrested 19 people in November 2016 on suspicion that they had links with the Islamic State militant group and were planning attacks in Kosovo and neighboring Albania. Nine of them were charged.
The state prosecutor said some of them were in contact with Lavdrim Muhaxheri, Islamic State's self-declared ""commander of Albanians in Syria and Iraq"", who ordered them to attack. Police said Muhaxheri was killed in June this year.
""... I accept guilty plea,"" defendant Kenan Plakaj said in court. He is accused of making explosives, after police found half a kilo of explosives at his house, the indictment said. The other defendant, Besart Peci, also pleaded guilty.
Sentences were not announced.
Another defendant facing trial had kept in his basement 283 grams of self-made explosives. The same triacetone triperoxide explosive was used in attacks in Paris and Brussels and has been found in various foiled bombings in Europe since 2007.
No militant attacks have been staged in Kosovo, whose population is largely ethnic Albanian Muslim. But at least 200 people have been detained or investigated over offences related to Islamic State, and a total of 300 Kosovars have gone to Syria to fight for Islamic State. More than 70 have been killed.
International and local security agencies in Kosovo are worried that many of those returning from combat zones will pose a security threat.
In 2015, Kosovo adopted a law introducing jail sentences of up to 15 years for anyone found guilty of fighting in wars abroad.

Security sources meanwhile said an army officer and five militants had been killed in clashes as security forces carried out arrest raids near the Arish air base on Wednesday.
The Amaq statement said Islamic State fighters used a Kornet anti-tank missile in the Tuesday attack that targeted the interior and defense ministers who were visiting the area.
Neither minister was harmed, a security source said.
Islamic State's Sinai branch has for years waged attacks against security forces, and in the past year expanded targets to include Christians and other civilians.
An attack on a mosque last month which killed more than 300 people, the deadliest in Egypt's modern history, was widely attributed to Islamic State, but the group did not claim it.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered security forces to use heavy force to stamp out the Sinai insurgency within three months after that attack.

1055,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 09:20AM ET</span>",Turkish PM calls Rohingya killings in Myanmar 'genocide',"COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Turkey's prime minister on Wednesday dubbed the killing of minority Muslim Rohingyas in Myanmar by its security forces ""genocide"" and urged the international community to ensure their safety back home.
Binali Yildirim met several Rohingyas in two refugee camps in Cox's Bazar in neighboring Bangladesh.
Almost 870,000 Rohingya fled there, about 660,000 of whom arrived after Aug. 25, when Rohingya militants attacked security posts and the Myanmar army launched a counter-offensive.
""The Myanmar military has been trying to uproot Rohingya Muslim community from their homeland and for that they persecuted them, set fire to their homes, villages, raped and abused women and killed them,"" Yildirim told reporters from Cox's Bazar, before flying back to Turkey.
""It's one kind of a genocide,"" he said.
""The international community should also work together to ensure their safe and dignified return to their homeland,"" Yildirim, who was accompanied by Bangladesh's Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali, said.
Surveys of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh by aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres have shown at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in Rakhine state in the month after violence flared up on Aug. 25, MSF said last week.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein has called the violence ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" and said he would not be surprised if a court eventually ruled that genocide had taken place.
Yildirim inaugurated a medical camp at Balukhali, sponsored by Turkey, and handed over two ambulances to Cox's Bazar district administration. He also distributed food to Rohingya refugees at Kutupalong makeshift camp.
He urged the international community to enhance support for Rohingyas in Bangladesh and help find a political solution to this humanitarian crisis.
U.N. investigators have heard Rohingya testimony of a ""consistent, methodical pattern of killings, torture, rape and arson"".
The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare under international law, but has been used in contexts including Bosnia, Sudan and an Islamic State campaign against the Yazidi communities in Iraq and Syria.
Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's less than two-year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under Myanmar's transition after decades of military rule.

Yildirim's trip follows Turkish first lady Emine Erdogan's visit in September to the Rohingya camp, when she said the crack down in Myanmar's Rakhine state was ""tantamount to genocide"" and a solution to the Rohingya crisis lies in Myanmar alone.

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 09:19AM ET</span>",Full Brexit in Jan. 2021 as EU sets transition deadline,"By Alastair Macdonald and Robert-Jan Bartunek
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union wants a transition period after Brexit to end no later than the last day of 2020, according to the European Commission's negotiating directives agreed on Wednesday.
That date, coinciding with the end of the EU's seven-year budget period and 21 months after Britain departs the EU, had long been expected as the target end point of the transition.
But this was the first official confirmation that it is the goal of the Union's negotiators.
British Prime Minister Theresa May had sought a transition lasting around two years. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, speaking at a news conference after the EU executive had agreed the terms, said the 2020 deadline was logical and would avoid complications in the next 2021-2027 EU budget period. 
The four pages of new directives for Barnier were in line with guidelines issued by EU leaders at a summit on Friday and will form the basis of talks on the transition that he hopes to start next month. He has said in the past he hopes a free trade pact could be ready to take effect in January 2021.
The directives spell out that Britain will effectively remain in EU institutions, bound by all their rules including new ones, while not having a say in their making. 
The EU will also offer Britain a non-voting place at some meetings where decisions may affect specific issues and will set up special arrangements for a UK role in setting annual EU fishing quotas.
The directives also spell out more clearly that EU treaties with other countries and international organizations will no longer apply to Britain during the transition period. 
However, the document adds: ""Where it is in the interest of the Union, the Union may consider whether and how arrangements can be agreed that would maintain the effects of the agreements as regards the United Kingdom during the transition period."" 
This has been important to Britain since it could mean that it no longer benefits automatically from free trade agreements which the EU has with, say, Canada or South Korea, while it would still have to apply EU trade policy -- for example collecting EU customs duty at UK ports.
Barnier said he understood that Britain was working with other countries to try to retain the advantages of some of the nearly 750 international agreements to which London is currently party as an EU member.
FINANCIAL SERVICES
Among elements spelled out more in the directives than in the leaders' guidelines last week was a repetition of a previously agreed EU position that everything applying to Brexit for Britain would also apply to other British territories.
Brussels has said the Spanish government must agree any future arrangements with Britain that affect the British territory of Gibraltar on Spain's southern coast.
Asked about his previously expressed view that a future trade deal may offer little automatic access for the City of London's financial services firms to the EU market, Barnier repeated that free access would be unprecedented as far as he was aware.
""I remind you that I'm not aware of any free-trade deal in the past between the European Union and third countries that would have allowed privileged access for financial services,"" he told a news conference. 
British negotiators have said Britain's size and proximity give it the leverage to negotiate a more ambitious relationship with the EU than any other state.
During the transition, Britain will maintain access to the European single market, Barnier added. ""Britain will keep all the benefits, but also all the obligations of the single market, the customs union and the common policies,"" he said, ruling out ""a la carte"" terms.
Barnier welcomed agreements made earlier this month on issues such as the Irish border, citizens' rights and the divorce settlement.

""We are not at the end of the road,"" he said. ""But it is an important stage of this road towards an orderly withdrawal rather than a disorderly one.""

Turkey has called for the arrest of Huseyin Korkmaz after he testified at the trial of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a former executive of state-lender Halkbank who is accused of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions.
The Istanbul prosecutor's office was not immediately available for comment.
U.S. prosecutors have accused Atilla of working with Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab and others to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions through fraudulent gold and food transactions. The case has strained relations between Turkey and the United States, which are NATO allies.
Atilla has pleaded not guilty and Halkbank has denied involvement with any illegal transactions. But Zarrab has pleaded guilty and testified for U.S. prosecutors.
Korkmaz said he fled Turkey in 2016 fearing retaliation from the government after leading an investigation in 2013 into Zarrab which implicated high-ranking officials.
Hurriyet said the Istanbul prosecutor's order to arrest Korkmaz's parents came after his testimony in the U.S. case in which he said he gave documents related to the 2013 investigation to his mother to keep.
Last week, Turkish police summoned a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) official over statements made by Korkmaz in the U.S. court, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 08:10AM ET</span>",Ex-Interpol chief says ready to testify for Argentina's Fernandez,"By Nicolás Misculin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's previous government never asked Interpol to drop arrest warrants against a group of Iranians accused of bombing a Jewish center, the ex-head of the police agency said on Wednesday, as the government proceeded with treason charges against the former president.
Former Interpol chief Ronald Noble said in an email on Wednesday that he wants to testify that the government of former President Cristina Fernandez did not ask to have the arrest warrants lifted as part of a ""memorandum"" she had with Iran.
If a judge allows Noble to testify, the treason case filed this month against Fernandez and 11 other top officials could crumble. She denies wrongdoing and calls the charge politically motivated.
The arrest warrants ""were not affected in their validity by the approval of the memorandum,"" Noble said in an email to a federal appeals court that was seen by Reuters. The Fernandez administration ""always expressed its belief that the warrants should remain in effect,"" the email said.
The accusation that the Fernandez government worked behind the scenes to clear the accused bombers of the AMIA Jewish community center in order to improve trade between Argentina and Iran is at the heart of a charge of treason brought against Fernandez. 
She served as president for eight years before being succeeded by Mauricio Macri in 2015.
Others agreed that the treason charge against Fernandez appeared questionable.
""The indictment by Judge Claudio Bonadio of former President Fernandez, her Foreign Minister Hector Timerman, and 10 others, for 'treason' and 'concealment' points to no evidence that would seem to substantiate those charges,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Tuesday. 
The allegations against Fernandez drew international attention in January 2015, when the prosecutor who initially made them, Alberto Nisman, was found shot dead in the bathroom of his Buenos Aires apartment. An Argentine appeals court ordered the re-opening of the investigation a year ago.
Nisman's death was classified a suicide, though an official investigating the case has said the shooting appeared to be a homicide. Nisman's body was discovered hours before he was to brief Congress on the 1994 bombing of the AMIA center. 

Nisman said Fernandez worked behind the scenes to clear Iran of any wrongdoing and normalize relations to clinch a grains-for-oil deal with Tehran that was signed in 2013. The ""memorandum"" agreement created a joint commission to investigate the AMIA bombing that critics said was really a means to absolve Iran.

Erdogan appeared to be responding to a tweet shared on Saturday by UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahayan, which said Ottoman troops led by Fakhreddin Pasha stole money and manuscripts from Medina in 1916.
The tweet also said Turkish forces abducted residents of Medina and took them to Istanbul. ""These are Erdogan's ancestors, and their history with Arab Muslims,"" read the tweet, originally posted by someone identifying themselves as an Iraqi dentist from Germany.
Medina, now part of Saudi Arabia, was part of the Ottoman territory for centuries until the empire's collapse at the end of World War One.
In a speech to local administrators, Erdogan said Fahreddin Pasha had not stolen from Medina or its people, but strived to protect the city and its occupants during a time of war.
""Those miserable people who are delirious enough to shamelessly and tirelessly say Erdogan’s ancestors stole sacred items from there and brought them to Istanbul - it was to protect them from the people that came to invade,"" he said.
The United Arab Emirates, a close U.S. ally, sees Erdogan's Islamist-rooted ruling party as a friend of Islamist forces which the UAE opposes across the Arab world.
Relations were further strained by Ankara's support for Qatar after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on the Gulf emirate in June.
Two months later, Sheikh Abdullah criticised what he called Turkey and Iran's ""colonial"" actions in Syria, even though Turkey and the UAE have both opposed Syria President Bashar al-Assad.
Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin has also responded to Sheikh Abdullah's comments, saying it was a shame that he ""retweets this propaganda lie that seeks to turn Turks & Arabs against one another, again.""

""Is attacking President Erdoğan at all costs the new fashion now?"" Kalin tweeted on Tuesday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU executive launched an unprecedented process on Wednesday to suspend Poland's voting rights in the European Union after two years of dispute over judicial reforms that Brussels says undermine Polish courts' independence.
The European Commission, the guardian of EU law, will now ask the other EU governments to declare that Poland's changes to the judiciary constitute ""a clear risk of a serious breach"" of EU values -- especially the rule of law.
However, it gave Warsaw, where a new prime minister took office only this month, three months to remedy the situation and said it could rescind its decision if it did so.
""The Commission has today concluded that there is a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law in Poland,"" the Commission said in a statement.
""Judicial reforms in Poland mean that the country's judiciary is now under the political control of the ruling majority. In the absence of judicial independence, serious questions are raised about the effective application of EU law.""
The Commission's deputy head, First Vice President Frans Timmermans, who has conducted talks with the Polish government dominated by Law and Justice Party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski for the past two years, said he was acting ""with a heavy heart"" but was obliged to take action to protect the Union as a whole.
""We are open for dialogue 24/7,"" Timmermans said.

But he insisted: ""As guardians of the treaty, the Commission is under a strict responsibility to act ... If the application of the rule of law is left completely to the individual member states, then the whole of the EU will suffer.""

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 07:32AM ET</span>","In Georgia, battle of the 'Staceys' tests Democrats' future","By Letitia Stein
ATLANTA (Reuters) - The two Democratic candidates running for governor in Georgia are both lawyers and former state legislators. Both are women, and on many policy issues it's hard to tell them apart. Both even share the same first name - Stacey.
But they sharply disagree on the path to victory.   
Stacey Abrams, 44, wants to become the first African American female governor in the United States by mobilizing solidly Democratic black voters, who vote sporadically in elections, to form a winning coalition with white liberals.
Stacey Evans, 39, thinks the math does not add up without also appealing to white moderates, many of them outside urban areas, who voted for President Donald Trump last November. She is highlighting her crossover appeal as a white suburban mother with country roots.
Their divergent strategies mirror a wider debate within the Democratic Party that has grown louder after strong turnout by minority voters helped to power recent Democratic victories in Alabama and Virginia.
As the party prepares for the 2018 congressional elections, there is disagreement over which voters to spend more time and money on - minority voters who are a fast-growing share of the electorate but do not reliably cast ballots, or blue-collar and suburban whites who swing between parties. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2yYkcHV)
Reuters interviews with liberal activist groups, some donors and an examination of campaign finance records show that many on the left are betting on Abrams' strategy as the best shot at turning a Republican state. 
Underscoring the stakes in Georgia is the unusual attention from national groups seeking to push the party farther left. Their level of early support for Abrams is largely unparalleled among other 2018 gubernatorial and many congressional races.
A dozen liberal groups have already thrown support behind Abrams, according to a Reuters tally, even though the Democratic primary, or nominating contest, is still months away. The breadth of that support has been little reported.
Abrams, who rouses audiences to near religious fervor describing her struggles growing up poor and black in the South, argues that Democrats have wasted resources on swing voters. 
""We have left too many voters untouched,"" she said in an interview, noting that she refuses to tone down her support for abortion, gay rights and labor unions to appeal to Republican-leaning voters. 
Her opponent does not discount the importance of black voters and also embraces liberal views. But ""you are going to have to persuade some moderate Republicans to vote for you, if you are going to win in Georgia,"" said Evans, who tears up before crowds when she recounts a childhood spent moving from one rural trailer home to another.
    
DEMOCRATS REGROUP
After losing the White House last year, the Democratic Party found itself powerless in Washington. Some in the party faulted their presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, for her lack of outreach to minority voters in key states. Others blamed her inability to connect with working class white voters who were once Democratic.
Minorities supported the Democratic ticket by wide margins in 2016, but turnout was flat among Hispanics and sharply lower among African Americans, according to the Pew Research Center.
Only half of Georgia's black voters cast ballots in 2016, compared to more than two-thirds of whites, a Reuters review of state records showed.
The Democratic National Committee said the recent wins in Alabama and Virginia “show that Democrats are a force to be reckoned with when we invest early in the communities that represent who we are as a Party."" 
Jennifer Duffy, a political analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said boosting Democratic turnout could work as a strategy. But she urged caution - focusing too narrowly on specific demographic groups risks alienating moderate Democrats. And swing voters, especially in suburban areas, also played a role in the recent Democratic victories, she noted.
University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock agreed the numbers are there if Democrats do not lose more white voters.
HOW WE WIN  
    At the Abrams campaign headquarters, a poster titled ""How We Win"" points out that Democrats in Georgia have lost recent elections by some 200,000 votes. More than 1 million black voters did not cast ballots during the last governor's race in 2014, state data shows. 
    ""They don't vote because we don't ask, and this is a campaign that is going to keep asking,"" Abrams said, speaking on a recent evening to an audience of three dozen volunteers.
    Abrams, a tax attorney and romance novelist who led Democrats in the state legislature, said her campaign has already reached out to more than 300,000 voters with door knocks, phone calls and text messages. 
    She hosted summer events with music and barbecue in a dozen smaller cities - places like Macon, a predominately African American community, and tiny Dalton in the rural northern state. 
      
SOROS PLACES A BET
    National liberal activists are lining up endorsements, money and manpower behind Abrams, who is seen as starting with an advantage in a Democratic primary dominated by black voters.
Democracy for America, MoveOn Political Action and the Working Families Party call her campaign a model of how to engage the nation's increasingly diverse electorate. 
    ""Politics is changing in America, and Abrams' path to victory reflects the changing demographics and enthusiasm,"" said Dan Cantor, national chairman of the Working Families Party. 
    MoveOn, whose recent endorsement of Abrams marked its first in a 2018 governor's race, said it would mobilize its 125,000 Georgia members as volunteers for her campaign. 
    Democracy for America is similarly engaging nearly 35,000 members in the state. Officials said the group has already raised nearly $25,000 for Abrams, an unusually high sum for an election still a year away. 
A group called PowerPac is organizing a $10 million get-out-the-vote effort with plans to hire people to contact minority voters and use targeted radio, phone and digital campaigns. 
    Individual donors from outside Georgia have contributed more than half of the $470,000 in larger donations that Abrams has reported, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance records. Billionaire George Soros, one of the Democratic Party's biggest financial backers, and two sons donated $21,000 each.
'AN UTTERLY FALSE CHOICE'
    By contrast, Evans is not receiving many donations from outside of Georgia, nor national endorsements. Her campaign is focused on restoring cuts to a state college scholarship called HOPE. Most of her money has come from in-state donors, who have fueled almost all of her reported $390,000 in major donations.
    She has support from Georgia's last Democratic governor, as well as a big-name Democratic strategist, Paul Begala, who worked for the governor who created the scholarship. 
    The Georgia contest reflects divisions between those who want to broaden the Democratic electorate by bringing back voters who have shifted away, and those who want to drill deeper into the party's base to increase turnout, said Begala, calling it ""an utterly false choice.""
""It is like a football team saying, 'Do you play offense, or defense?'"" Begala said. ""You have to do both."" 
    At a recent barbecue luncheon in Athens, Evans pointed out that she outperformed Clinton last year in her district by 12 percentage points, picking up moderate voters.
    ""You can win in areas where you might not think you are going to have support, if you show up and talk to people,"" she told lawyers lunching on pulled pork served on paper placemats.
    Evans is not knocking on voters' doors just yet. But she is traveling the state talking to local Democratic organizations and African-American churches.    
    Lukis Newborn, an undecided rural voter, recently heard Abrams speak in a suburban Atlanta sports bar. He found her exciting. But he also connects with Evans, having been raised in a household where dinner was rice and beans or peanut butter and jelly.

""Both are a part of me,"" said Newborn, 26, from Paulding County. ""It's an internal struggle of a Georgia Democrat like no other.""

1067,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 06:11AM ET</span>","Too late, Theresa: Brexit offer to EU citizens leaves many cold","By Estelle Shirbon
LONDON (Reuters) - Back from Brussels with a hard-fought Brexit deal, Prime Minister Theresa May wrote an open letter to the three million citizens of other European Union states living in Britain.
""I know our country would be poorer if you left and I want you to stay,"" she wrote after striking the initial agreement, which promises to secure their British residency rights after Brexit and allows the negotiations to move onto trade relations.
But for some EU nationals - who have endured uncertainty over their rights since the Brexit vote in June 2016, not to mention an unpleasant feeling that many Britons do not want them around - May's Dec. 8 deal is too little, too late.
It's too late to keep German nurse Daniela Jones in the chronically short-staffed National Health Service (NHS), where she worked for 35 years.
It's too late for French psychotherapist Baya Salmon-Hawk, who after 40 years in Britain has moved to Ireland to remain in the EU.
It's too late for French accountant Nathalie Duran, who is planning early retirement in France because after 31 years as a taxpayer in Britain she objects to being told she has to pay a fee and fill in forms to be granted a new ""settled status"".
""I will have to regretfully decline your generous offer for settled status and oblige your lovely countrymen's wishes and go home,"" she wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in a response to May laden with irony.
Duran told Reuters that the prime minister's ""late outpouring of love"" for EU citizens, after years of tough talk on the need to cut immigration, could not mask negative attitudes towards immigrants unleashed by the Brexit vote.
""I think it's turning ugly,"" said 56-year-old Duran. ""It's now OK to say 'go home foreigners'.""
EU citizens, particularly those from the poorer eastern member states such as Poland and Romania, have complained of increasing hostility from some Britons.
They find themselves accused of stealing jobs from Britons and driving down wages, even though unemployment is at a four-decade low, or of overburdening health services as patients, even though many help to provide them by working for the NHS.
Official figures show hate crimes in Britain surged by the highest amount on record last year, with the Brexit vote a significant factor.
The impact of Brexit on EU citizens in Britain is a serious concern for sectors of the economy that rely heavily on European workers, such as hospitality, construction, agriculture, care for the elderly and the cherished NHS.
Britain won't leave the bloc until March 2019, but many EU nationals are already voting with their feet. In the 12 months following the referendum, 123,000 of them left Britain, a 29 percent year-on-year increase.
They were still outnumbered by the 230,000 EU citizens who arrived to live in Britain in the same period, although that figure was down 19 percent on the previous year. 
""A BRITISH JOB FOR A BRITISH WORKER""
Not everyone is making plans to go: 28,500 EU citizens applied for British citizenship in the 12 months after the referendum, an 80 percent year-on-year jump. With personal and professional roots often running deep, many more have applied for permanent residence documents.
UK citizenship would be an option for nurse Jones, 61, who moved to England from Munich just before her 18th birthday. That was in 1974, the year after Britain joined what is now the EU.
Today she has a grown-up British son and a British husband. But as a point of principle she cannot see why she should apply for something she never needed in the past. 
""Despite my enormous love for Britain, I do not feel that I am British,"" was how she put it in a letter to Ruth Deech, a pro-Brexit member of parliament's House of Lords, sent in February to lobby her on the EU citizens' rights issue.
In a one-line response to the long, impassioned letter, which made clear Jones had worked for 35 years in the state NHS, Deech said she should have applied for UK citizenship.
Jones replied it had never been necessary and explained that she was already a dual German and U.S. national through her German mother and her American father, a serviceman in the U.S. army who was posted to Germany in the 1950s.
Deech sent another one-liner: ""You sought U.S. citizenship - presumably you could have shown the same commitment to this country.""
Jones was dismayed by that response, which in her eyes lacked understanding and respect. She began to think she needed to look after her own interests better.
A few months later, she quit her NHS job at a doctors' office in Yateley, a small town southwest of London. She is now re-training as a foot and ear care specialist and plans to work privately.
""I still like looking after people but I want to do it on my own terms,"" she told Reuters. ""It's time to get out. Work for myself, start a little business.""
Jones wrote to Deech again, saying: ""I have now freed up a British job for a British worker."" This time she got no response.
Deech declined an interview request from Reuters, but said in an emailed response to questions that obtaining a British passport ""might be a good idea for any EU citizen who is (probably needlessly) concerned"".
""A NEW ADVENTURE""
French national Baya Salmon-Hawk, 61, initially reacted to the Brexit vote by trying to make sure her residency rights were not under threat. Having lived in England for 40 years, had her son there, owned a home, worked in a variety of jobs and paid taxes, she thought that should be straightforward.
But when she made inquiries about a permanent residence permit she had obtained in 1977, she was told this was no longer valid and she would have to re-apply by filling an 85-page form and providing lots of documents, including details of every time she had left the country and returned, stretching back years.
Besides, Salmon-Hawk was struggling to adjust to the new reality. Having believed previously that she was integrated into British society, she felt unwelcome for the first time.
""I just don't understand what's happened to the UK,"" she said. ""I became quite easily upset by all this and I didn't want to live like that anymore.""
She and her 74-year-old wife Audrey Evelyn, who is British, decided to leave. They sold their house in a village north of London, and in July this year they moved to County Kilkenny in Ireland, where Evelyn has family ties.
At times, Salmon-Hawk has wondered if they made the right decision. ""I may have made a foolish mistake. I have woken up in the middle of the night in a state of panic,"" she said.
But she is starting a new venture as a professional story-teller at Hook Lighthouse on the southeast coast of Ireland, telling visitors tales from Irish history.

""I thought I was done, I was settled, and I'm not. I'm having a new adventure.""

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 06:11AM ET</span>",EU seeks to end Brexit transition no later than end: 2020,"By Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union wants a transition period after Brexit to end no later than Dec. 31, 2020, according to the European Commission's negotiating directives agreed on Wednesday.
""The transitional arrangements should apply as from the date of entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement and should not last beyond 31 December 2020,"" the published text showed. 
Coinciding with the end of the EU's current seven-year budget period, the end of 2020, 21 months after Brexit at the end of March 2019, had long been expected as the target end date of the transition but this was the first official confirmation that this is the official goal of the Union negotiators.
British Prime Minister Theresa May had formally asked for a transition to last around two years.
The four pages of new directives for EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier were in line with guidelines issued by EU leaders at a summit on Friday and will form the basis of talks on the transition which Barnier hopes to start next month.
They spell out that Britain will be effectively still a member of EU institutions, bound by all their rules including new ones, while not having a say in their making. The EU will also offer Britain a non-voting place at some meetings where decisions may affect specific issues and will set up special arrangements for a UK role in setting annual EU fishing quotas.
The directives also spell out more clearly that EU treaties with other countries and international organizations will no longer apply to Britain during the transition period. However, the document adds: ""Where it is in the interest of the Union, the Union may consider whether and how arrangements can be agreed that would maintain the effects of the agreements as regards the United Kingdom during the transition period.""
This has been important to Britain since it could mean that it no longer benefits automatically from free trade agreements which the EU has with, say, Canada or South Korea, while, as the directives underline, it would still have to apply EU trade policy -- for example collecting EU customs duty at UK ports.
Among elements spelled out more in the transition directives than in the leaders' guidelines last week was a repetition of a previously agreed EU position that everything applying to Brexit for Britain would also apply to other British territories.

Brussels has previously said the Spanish government must agree any future arrangements with Britain that affect the British territory of Gibraltar on Spain's southern coast.

1069,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 05:50AM ET</span>",Afghanistan political turmoil deepens as regional leader ousted,"KABUL (Reuters) - One of the main parties behind Afghanistan's Western-backed government warned President Ashraf Ghani that it could withdraw its support unless he reversed the dismissal of one of its most powerful regional governors this week.
The warning from the Jamiat-e Islami party came after Ghani removed Atta Mohammad Noor as governor of Balkh, a strategic northern province bordering Afghanistan's Central Asian neighbors Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
Describing the dismissal as a ""unilateral decision"" by Ghani, Jamiat's leadership called into question the legitimacy of the unity government formed after a disputed presidential election of 2014.
""If the presidential palace does not reconsider its one-sided action which is misusing the presence of the international community, Jamiat-e Islami will nullify the national unity government agreement and will employ all options to defend the legitimate rights of the people,"" the party leadership said in a statement.
The man named as Atta Noor's replacement, Mohammad Daoud, also from Jamiat, said he would not take up the position until the situation had been resolved. ""I want to stay out of it for now,"" he told Reuters.
The standoff adds to an already clouded political climate in Afghanistan, where the United States has announced a stepped-up military effort to break a stalemate with the Taliban and force a settlement to 16 years of conflict.
Long-delayed parliamentary elections, officially scheduled for next year, are now in doubt and an array of political leaders both inside and outside the government are positioning themselves ahead of a presidential election in 2019.
Ghani's government retains strong international backing but has faced increasing pressure from opposition groups and debilitating tension within its ranks between allies of Ghani and government Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, a senior Jamiat leader.
However, Jamiat is itself divided and it remains unclear what approach will be taken by Abdullah, who was Ghani's rival in 2014 before taking the specially created post of chief executive in a U.S.-brokered power-sharing deal.
Abdullah, who has regularly clashed with Atta Noor, has made no public comment on his dismissal.
The move to oust Atta Noor, one of a group of powerful regional strongmen, followed calls from politicians including former President Hamid Karzai for a loya jirga, or grand assembly of elders and political leaders to discuss the future of the government.
This month, Atta Noor was prevented from attending a meeting in the southern city of Khandahar to discuss the loya jirga proposal.
As the political uncertainty has deepened, tension between Pashtuns and ethnic Tajiks, Afghanistan's two largest ethnic groups, as well as others including ethnic Uzbeks and the mainly Shi'ite Hazara minority, have worsened.

Many in Jamiat, a mainly northern, ethnic Tajik party, see Ghani as a Pashtun nationalist bent on concentrating power in his own office while Jamiat's own opponents see the party as a base for old-style warlords who undermine national unity.

But in the past three months there has been a spike in Venezuelans migrating to the border area and spending their days going door-to-door trying to sell low-cost goods in Colombia. 
Hundreds of vendors are sleeping in the streets of the Venezuelan border town of San Antonio, while the surge in hawkers on the Colombian side is stoking anger among local shopkeepers. 
Albert Rodriguez, 22, spends his nights on a plastic sheet in the streets of San Antonio since moving from Venezuela's inland agricultural state of Lara a month ago. He sells coffee in Colombia, but still has not been able to send money home to help his newborn daughter. 
""It's tough because there are so many Venezuelans. I feel like crying because I am so impotent,"" said Rodriguez, who said he hopes to eventually migrate to central Colombia where he thinks job prospects will be better. 
The flood of vendors is evidence of how a fourth year of recession - which has fomented malnutrition, disease and violent crime - is tearing Venezuela's social fabric apart. 
It also highlights that Colombia, already home to the most Venezuelan migrants in South America, remains particularly vulnerable to the crisis. 
The Colombian government did not respond to a request for comment. 
TENSIONS IN COLOMBIA 
Come daybreak, Venezuelan hawkers jostle for hours to get a spot on a bus traveling to the Colombian border. They then cross the teeming frontier on foot, many silently praying that the National Guard will not demand payment to let them through with their goods. 
Once safely in Cucuta, the vendors disperse on different buses that take them across the Colombian border city. In the low-income hillside neighborhood of La Libertad, around a hundred Venezuelans rang doorbells offering mayonnaise, insecticide, cereal boxes and more. 
Sales are often brisk. Prices are roughly half those in Colombian stores due to Venezuela's depreciated bolivar currency. 
Some worried Colombian shopkeepers are demanding the border be closed to protect their businesses. Colombians also at times fret that the influx of Venezuelan vendors could lead to crime. 
Marlon Carrillo, a 21-year-old Venezuelan who abandoned university studies to start selling fruit in Colombia three months ago, said some locals slammed doors in his face out of fear. 
""It's hard to pay for the sins of others,"" said Carrillo, who crisscrosses Cucuta for eight hours a day selling the lemons, strawberries, bananas and pineapples he crams into his backpack. 
""I want to progress and study but I have to work. I'm not going to let my family die of hunger,"" said Carrillo, who is supporting his three nephews after his sister died of bone marrow failure.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law a new package of sanctions in August drafted by U.S. lawmakers. One of the provisions asked the U.S. Treasury Secretary to submit a report on the impact of expanding sanctions to cover Russian sovereign debt, with an outcome expected as early as February.
U.S. and EU sanctions imposed over Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, and its support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, remain in place. But U.S. allegations that Moscow interfered in last year's U.S. presidential election, something Russia denies, have spurred calls for more sanctions. 
On Wednesday, the Kremlin was asked to comment on media reports that Russian state development bank VEB planned to transfer its Globex bank to the state and about speculation that the bank would then be used to service the military industrial complex to try to protect Russia from new sanctions.
""We are working on and taking measures aimed at defending our interests against a backdrop of possible new restrictive actions and sanctions by various countries, which we continue to deem unlawful,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.
He did not mention Globex bank.
""It would probably not be right now to make public or disclose all these measures aimed at hedging our risks,"" Peskov said.

Trump's planned visit to Britain has proved controversial since Prime Minister Theresa May invited him for a state visit, which typically involves lavish pageantry and events hosted by the queen.
However nearly 2 million people have signed a petition saying Trump should not be invited because it ""would cause embarrassment"" to the queen, and protests could be expected to greet the U.S. leader.
The Daily Mail cited a source in Westminster as saying Trump had told May during a call on Tuesday that he planned a working visit to Britain to open the new embassy, a billion-dollar building which overlooks the River Thames, in late February. 
A spokesman for May's Downing Street office declined to comment on the report. He said the position on the state visit had not changed. An offer had been extended but no dates have been arranged. 
May originally invited Trump to visit by the end of 2017. 
Britain regards its close ties with Washington as a ""special relationship"" and a pillar of its foreign policy as it prepares to leave the European Union.

However the ties have been strained in recent months, most recently when Trump sparked outrage by rebuking May on Twitter after she criticized him for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 04:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's border city with North Korea eases tourism curbs - sources,"By Sue-Lin Wong
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese tourists are still visiting Pyongyang from China's border city of Dandong, tourism sources say, even after authorities unofficially halted the tours just ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to China last month. 
A group of 40 Chinese tourists left on Friday from the border city of Dandong to Pyongyang, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a sign local authorities have not been strongly enforcing curbs on tourist flows. 
""This is the largest group to go in from Dandong since the curb,"" a tour operator said, adding the tourists traveled by train into North Korea for a four-day tour.
The Dandong Tourism Bureau declined to be interviewed for this story. When asked for comment, China's foreign ministry said they did ""not understand the situation.""
Local businesses in China are known to find ways around policies introduced by local authorities or Beijing, whether in good times or bad. 
""There's always a way around government policies,"" said one Dandong-based tourism source. ""You know how Chinese people are."" 
""I think the central government will be very annoyed at Dandong for lifting the travel restriction,"" the tour operator said.
MONEY-MAKER FOR NORTH
Tourism to North Korea is not banned by the United Nations and is one of the few remaining ways that North Korea earns hard currency. The Korea Maritime Institute, a South Korean think-tank, estimates that tourism generates about $44 million in annual revenue for North Korea. 
The U.N. has ramped up sanctions over North Korea's accelerating missile program over the past year, curbing key export industries including coal, seafood and textiles.
Simon Cockerell, head of Beijing-based Koryo Tours which organizes travel to North Korea, said he saw 3 to 4 busloads of Chinese tourists in Pyongyang in mid-November. ""But I'm not sure where they entered from or what visas they were on,"" he said. 
""If you have a visa to North Korea, it doesn't say where you can and can't go. So once you enter into Sinuiju or Rason, you could travel onwards to Pyongyang. The North Koreans wouldn't care,"" Cockerell said. 
Sinuiju and Rason are popular entry points for Chinese tourists traveling overland into North Korea.
TRUMP'S VISIT
China never publicly announced a ban on Chinese tourists visiting Pyongyang and strongly opposes unilateral sanctions, which it says undermines U.N. unity.
But the day before U.S President Donald Trump's first official visit to China in early November, Reuters exclusively reported that the Dandong Tourism Bureau had told Chinese tour operators based in Dandong to halt trips to North Korea's capital of Pyongyang.
Trump has frequently praised Chinese President Xi Jinping Trump with whom he has been working to exert pressure on North Korea through strict enforcement of sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Dandong, a city of 800,000 people in northeastern Liaoning province, is the main trading hub on the Chinese side of the border and most tour companies that take Chinese tourists to North Korea are based there. The U.N. sanctions have particularly hit Dandong's economy this year.
Almost all tours to North Korea have stopped and many Dandong-based companies who traditionally conducted business with North Korea are struggling, sources told Reuters. 
""A lot of the more successful Chinese businessmen have gone on holidays because there's nothing for them to do around here at the moment,"" said one Chinese businessman in Dandong. 
China's trade with North Korea has already fallen to its lowest in months. Beijing has repeatedly said it is rigorously enforcing U.N. resolutions aimed at reining in Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.

North Korea has accelerated the pace of its missile tests this year. Pyongyang said its latest test on Nov. 28 was an intercontinental ballistic missile that it said could deliver heavy nuclear warheads anywhere in the continental United States.

The Observatory, a Britain-based war monitoring group, said Syrian government or Russian aircraft struck the village. There was no immediate comment from the Syrian military or Russia, which have both repeatedly said they only target militants. 
The strikes pounded the town of Maar Shureen in the northwestern province of Idlib and the dead included seven children, the Observatory said. 
Idlib's civil defense, a rescue service known as the White Helmets which operates in rebel territory, said fierce bombing after midnight killed 19 people.
The Observatory said 25 others had been injured.
Government forces and their allies stepped up air strikes against opposition towns in the Hama countryside, near the southern part of Idlib, rebels said last week. 
The Damascus government lost Idlib after insurgents took over the provincial capital in 2015. It has since become the only province fully under opposition control, and the most populated insurgent-held part of Syria. 
Hayat Tahrir al Sham, an Islamist alliance spearheaded by the former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, is the dominant rebel force in Idlib. This has raised fears among civilians and Free Syrian Army rebels that the province could come under attack and turn into a major battlefield.
Thousands of civilians and fighters have poured into Idlib in the past year, bussed out of towns and cities which Syrian troops seized with the help of Russia and Iran-backed militias.
The province, bordering Turkey, is part of Russian-brokered de-escalation agreements that seek to shore up ceasefires in parts of western Syria.
Turkey, which had long backed some Syrian rebel factions, set up observation posts in Idlib in October under a deal with Russia and Iran to reduce fighting there. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the Idlib military operation in Idlib was largely completed. The deployment was also seen partly aimed at containing Kurdish influence nearby in northern Syria.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. independent investigator into human rights in Myanmar has been barred from visiting the country for the rest of her tenure, she said on Wednesday. 
Yanghee Lee, U.N. special rapporteur, said she had been due to visit in January to assess human rights across Myanmar, including alleged abuses against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State, but Myanmar had now told her it would not cooperate with her any more.
""This declaration of non-cooperation with my mandate can only be viewed as a strong indication that there must be something terribly awful happening in Rakhine, as well as in the rest of the country,"" she said in a statement. 
""It is a shame that Myanmar has decided to take this route,"" she said. 
""The government has repeatedly denied violations of human rights are occurring throughout Myanmar, particularly in Rakhine State. They have said that they have nothing to hide, but their lack of cooperation with my mandate and the fact-finding mission suggests otherwise.""
She hoped Myanmar's government would change its mind, adding that she was ""puzzled and disappointed"", since its Ambassador in Geneva Htin Lynn had told the U.N. Human Rights Council only two weeks ago that it would continue to cooperate.
""Now I am being told that this decision to no longer cooperate with me is based on the statement I made after I visited the country in July,"" she said.
Neither Lynn, nor Zaw Htay, spokesman for Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, nor Kyaw Moe Tun, a spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs that Suu Kyi heads, were immediately available for comment.
Lee's mandate requires two visits to Myanmar each year and she has visited six times since taking up the mandate in June 2014, although the government has consistently refused access to some areas, citing security concerns, the statement said.
More than 650,000 Rohingya fled into Bangladesh after attacks by Muslim insurgents on the Myanmar security forces triggered a response by the army and Buddhist vigilantes. 
Surveys of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh by aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres have shown at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in Rakhine state in the month after violence flared up on Aug 25, MSF said last week.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein has called the violence ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" and said he would not be surprised if a court eventually ruled that genocide had taken place.

1076,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 04:30AM ET</span>",South Korea 'fired 249 warning shots' to fend off Chinese fishing boats,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's coast guard said it fired 249 warning shots over a group of Chinese fishing boats ""swarming around"" one of its patrol ships in South Korean waters, prompting a call for restraint from Beijing. 
South Korean coast guard vessels regularly chase Chinese boats suspected of fishing illegally in South Korean waters, at times sparking violent confrontations, complicating a relationship which is key to efforts to try to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
A fleet of 44 Chinese fishing boats fortified with iron bars and steel mesh on Tuesday began to rush the patrol boat which broadcast warnings to steer clear, the coast guard said. 
The coast guard vessel fired 249 shots over the boats until they retreated. 
""The Chinese fishing boats sought to swarm around and collide with our patrol ship, ignoring the broadcast warnings,"" the coast guard said in a statement. 
China, which has in the past lodged diplomatic protests with South Korea over the use of force by its coast guard, expressed ""serious concern"" about the reports. 
""We hope that South Korea appropriately handles the relevant issue and in the course of law enforcement takes no extreme actions that endanger people's safety,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing. 
Seoul's foreign ministry said the coast guard followed domestic law in its use of weapons in a ""legitimate step"" against the boats which made a ""mass violation of the country's waters for illegal fishing"".
In September last year, three Chinese fishermen were killed in a fire on their boat when a South Korean coast guard crew trying to apprehend them for illegal fishing threw flash grenades into a room where they were hiding, according to the South Korean coast guard. 
A month later, two Chinese fishing boats illegally fishing in South Korean waters crashed into and sank a coast guard vessel, the coast guard officials said.

The criticism followed similar rebukes this month of President Emmanuel Macron's 40th birthday celebrations in the grounds of a royal palace, which Macron's office sought to play down, saying the event had been paid for by Macron and his wife.
Philippe and the French delegation took a private plane to fly from Tokyo to Paris on their way back from an official trip to New Caledonia earlier this month at a cost of 350,000 euros ($414,225).
""I totally understand the surprise and the questions of the French people,"" Philippe told RTL radio.
""We knew there was no commercial flight (from Tokyo) at the time we needed to return, and we knew we had to return because the President was leaving on the Wednesday morning of our return for Algeria,"" he said.
""The rule is that, whenever possible, the Prime Minister or the President must be on the national territory... I take full responsibility for this decision,"" added Philippe.
President Emmanuel Macron put financial and ethical probity in public life at the heart of his presidential campaign and his new government passed a law earlier this year to tighten up on ethical standards in French politics.

However, some of Macron's political opponents have branded the former investment banker as a ""president of the rich"" due to policies such as the scrapping of a wealth tax and cutting housing benefit - moves which the president has framed as reforms to boost investment and social mobility.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 03:05AM ET</span>","Cardinal Bernard Law, symbol of Church's sexual abuse crisis, dies","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Cardinal Bernard Law, the former archbishop of Boston who became a symbol of the Roman Catholic Church's worldwide sexual abuse scandals, died on Wednesday, the Vatican said. He was 86.
Law, whose resignation from his Boston post in 2002 shocked the Church and brought abuse into the open, had been living in Rome and was in declining health in recent years.
The Vatican did not give a cause of death but sources close to Law, who died in a hospital in Rome, said he had been suffering from the complications of diabetes, liver failure and a build up of fluids around the heart, known as pericardial effusion. 
Law was archbishop of Boston for 18 years when Pope John Paul - who in 1984 had appointed Law to run one of the most prestigious and wealthy American archdioceses - reluctantly accepted his resignation on Dec. 13, 2002, after a tumultuous year in Church history.
A succession of devastating stories by the Boston Globe's Spotlight team showed how priests who sexually abused children had been moved from parish to parish for years under Law's tenure without informing parishioners or law authorities.
The resignation sent shock waves through the American Church and began a trickle down effect around the world, as the cover-up techniques used in Boston were discovered to have been used in country after country. 
""It is my fervent prayer that this action may help the archdiocese of Boston to experience the healing, reconciliation and unity which are so desperately needed,"" Law said at the time.
""To all those who have suffered from my shortcomings and mistakes, I both apologize and from them beg forgiveness.""
Law had offered to step down several times before the pope accepted his resignation.
The story of how the Globe team doggedly brought the scandal to light in a city were few wanted to cross the politically powerful Church was immortalized in the 2015 film Spotlight, which won the Oscar for Best Picture.
The situation in Boston turned out to be the tip of an iceberg of abuse and its cover-up, where churchmen preferred protecting the reputation of the institution rather than the innocence of children.
Thousands of cases came to light around the world as investigations encouraged long-silent victims to go public, shattering the Church’s reputation in places such as Ireland, and forcing it to pay some $2 billion in compensation.
Six months after his resignation the Massachusetts attorney general's office announced that Law and others would not face criminal charges.
GOLDEN PARACHUTE
After a period in a monastery in the United States, Law moved to Rome.
In 2004 Pope John Paul appointed Law to be archpriest of the Rome Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the four major basilica's of Christendom, whose gold leaf ceiling is said to be made from the first batch of the precious metal Columbus brought back from America. He is likely to be buried there.
In relative terms it was an immense fall from grace. Such posts are symbolic and ceremonial. 
But victims of sexual abuse were outraged because it gave Law a second career and a golden parachute that allowed him to stay close to the center of power in Rome and serve as a member or adviser in several influential Vatican departments.
He also maintained the rank of cardinal and participated in the conclave that elected Pope Benedict in 2005.
Before he became ill, Law was a regular on the diplomatic circuit, attending receptions, including many in the gardens of the U.S. embassy to the Vatican.
While Law was the elephant in the room at U.S. receptions for a few years after his resignation, at Italian events he was treated with the same effusive obsequiousness bestowed on all cardinals - something Law appeared to enjoy.
He always declined to talk about events in Boston. ""I'm retired from that,"" he told a reporter at a reception.
FOOT DRAGGING
Law was succeed as Boston archbishop by Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who also heads a Vatican commission advising Pope Francis on how to root out sexual abuse in the Church.
But the credibility of the commission, which was formed in 2014, has been hurt by the resignation of two high-level lay members who have accused the Vatican of dragging its feet.
Last September, Pope Francis, addressing the commission, said the Catholic Church had moved too slowly to confront abuse.
""When consciousness arrives late, the means to resolve the problems also arrive late. I am aware of this difficulty but it is reality and I say it plainly: We arrived late. The old practice of moving people around and not confronting the problem made consciences fall asleep,"" the pope said.
Like those of all cardinals who die in Rome, Law's funeral is likely to be held in St. Peter's Basilica. Funeral Masses for cardinals are said by another cardinal and the pope gives the final blessing.
Bernard Francis Law was born on Nov. 4, 1931, in Torreon, Mexico, the son of a U.S. Army official and a musician. He graduated from Harvard University and was ordained a priest in 1961.

His first assignment was in Mississippi, where he received death threats for championing civil rights. As bishop of Springfield–Cape Girardeau in Missouri, he opened a home for battered women and a center to help Vietnamese boat people.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 02:31AM ET</span>","Too late, Theresa - Brexit offer to EU citizens leaves many cold","By Estelle Shirbon
LONDON (Reuters) - Back from Brussels with a hard-fought Brexit deal, Prime Minister Theresa May wrote an open letter to the three million citizens of other European Union states living in Britain.
""I know our country would be poorer if you left and I want you to stay,"" she wrote after striking the initial agreement, which promises to secure their British residency rights after Brexit and allows the negotiations to move onto trade relations.
But for some EU nationals - who have endured uncertainty over their rights since the Brexit vote in June 2016, not to mention an unpleasant feeling that many Britons do not want them around - May's Dec. 8 deal is too little, too late.
It's too late to keep German nurse Daniela Jones in the chronically short-staffed National Health Service (NHS), where she worked for 35 years.
It's too late for French psychotherapist Baya Salmon-Hawk, who after 40 years in Britain has moved to Ireland to remain in the EU.
It's too late for French accountant Nathalie Duran, who is planning early retirement in France because after 31 years as a taxpayer in Britain she objects to being told she has to pay a fee and fill in forms to be granted a new ""settled status"".
""I will have to regretfully decline your generous offer for settled status and oblige your lovely countrymen's wishes and go home,"" she wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in a response to May laden with irony.
Duran told Reuters that the prime minister's ""late outpouring of love"" for EU citizens, after years of tough talk on the need to cut immigration, could not mask negative attitudes towards immigrants unleashed by the Brexit vote.
""I think it's turning ugly,"" said 56-year-old Duran. ""It's now OK to say 'go home foreigners'.""
EU citizens, particularly those from the poorer eastern member states such as Poland and Romania, have complained of increasing hostility from some Britons.
They find themselves accused of stealing jobs from Britons and driving down wages, even though unemployment is at a four-decade low, or of overburdening health services as patients, even though many help to provide them by working for the NHS.
Official figures show hate crimes in Britain surged by the highest amount on record last year, with the Brexit vote a significant factor.
The impact of Brexit on EU citizens in Britain is a serious concern for sectors of the economy that rely heavily on European workers, such as hospitality, construction, agriculture, care for the elderly and the cherished NHS.
Britain won't leave the bloc until March 2019, but many EU nationals are already voting with their feet. In the 12 months following the referendum, 123,000 of them left Britain, a 29 percent year-on-year increase.
They were still outnumbered by the 230,000 EU citizens who arrived to live in Britain in the same period, although that figure was down 19 percent on the previous year. 
""A BRITISH JOB FOR A BRITISH WORKER""
Not everyone is making plans to go: 28,500 EU citizens applied for British citizenship in the 12 months after the referendum, an 80 percent year-on-year jump. With personal and professional roots often running deep, many more have applied for permanent residence documents.
UK citizenship would be an option for nurse Jones, 61, who moved to England from Munich just before her 18th birthday. That was in 1974, the year after Britain joined what is now the EU.
Today she has a grown-up British son and a British husband. But as a point of principle she cannot see why she should apply for something she never needed in the past. 
""Despite my enormous love for Britain, I do not feel that I am British,"" was how she put it in a letter to Ruth Deech, a pro-Brexit member of parliament's House of Lords, sent in February to lobby her on the EU citizens' rights issue.
In a one-line response to the long, impassioned letter, which made clear Jones had worked for 35 years in the state NHS, Deech said she should have applied for UK citizenship.
Jones replied it had never been necessary and explained that she was already a dual German and U.S. national through her German mother and her American father, a serviceman in the U.S. army who was posted to Germany in the 1950s.
Deech sent another one-liner: ""You sought U.S. citizenship - presumably you could have shown the same commitment to this country.""
Jones was dismayed by that response, which in her eyes lacked understanding and respect. She began to think she needed to look after her own interests better.
A few months later, she quit her NHS job at a doctors' office in Yateley, a small town southwest of London. She is now re-training as a foot and ear care specialist and plans to work privately.
""I still like looking after people but I want to do it on my own terms,"" she told Reuters. ""It's time to get out. Work for myself, start a little business.""
Jones wrote to Deech again, saying: ""I have now freed up a British job for a British worker."" This time she got no response.
Deech declined an interview request from Reuters, but said in an emailed response to questions that obtaining a British passport ""might be a good idea for any EU citizen who is (probably needlessly) concerned"".
""A NEW ADVENTURE""
French national Baya Salmon-Hawk, 61, initially reacted to the Brexit vote by trying to make sure her residency rights were not under threat. Having lived in England for 40 years, had her son there, owned a home, worked in a variety of jobs and paid taxes, she thought that should be straightforward.
But when she made inquiries about a permanent residence permit she had obtained in 1977, she was told this was no longer valid and she would have to re-apply by filling an 85-page form and providing lots of documents, including details of every time she had left the country and returned, stretching back years.
Besides, Salmon-Hawk was struggling to adjust to the new reality. Having believed previously that she was integrated into British society, she felt unwelcome for the first time.
""I just don't understand what's happened to the UK,"" she said. ""I became quite easily upset by all this and I didn't want to live like that anymore.""
She and her 74-year-old wife Audrey Evelyn, who is British, decided to leave. They sold their house in a village north of London, and in July this year they moved to County Kilkenny in Ireland, where Evelyn has family ties.
At times, Salmon-Hawk has wondered if they made the right decision. ""I may have made a foolish mistake. I have woken up in the middle of the night in a state of panic,"" she said.
But she is starting a new venture as a professional story-teller at Hook Lighthouse on the southeast coast of Ireland, telling visitors tales from Irish history.

""I thought I was done, I was settled, and I'm not. I'm having a new adventure.""

Now, he and dozens of other migrants are braving near-freezing temperatures in shrubs and fields near Sid, a northwestern Serbian town just outside European Union's member Croatia, hoping to make another border run. 
They spend nights in tents and makeshift shelters in a shrub they call - the jungle. 
""I have tried 30 times, I am in Serbia for 16 months, ... I am tired of sleeping in the 'jungle',"" said Mudassir, dressed in a black hooded jacket.
Meanwhile, other migrants, all young males, huddled outside an abandoned printing factory in the outskirts of Sid, waiting for a meal delivered by an international volunteer group, the No Name Kitchen. 
The so-called Balkan route for migrants was shut last year when Turkey agreed to stop the flow in return for EU aid and a promise of visa-free travel for its own citizens.
But people mainly from the Middle East, Africa and Asia continued to arrive in Serbia, mainly from Turkey, via neighboring Bulgaria, attempting to enter Croatia and the EU.
According to official data there are as many as 4,500 migrants in government-operated camps in Serbia. Rights activists say that hundreds are scattered in the capital Belgrade and towns along the Croatian border. 
Muhammad, 22 from the Moroccan town of Oujda, said he has tried to reach the EU 26 times. Three times he made it to Slovenia, but was caught and deported back to Serbia.
""I will try again ... my family is in France and my girlfriend is in Italy,"" Muhammad said.
Bruno Alvares of the No Name Kitchen said migrants are given two meals a day, water, clothes, footwear and tents. 
""Even if it is cold, it doesn't matter, they will keep on trying because there's ... no evolution in their lives in camps,"" Alvares said. 
Migrants who cannot afford to pay smugglers, often hide in passing trucks and freight trains or ride on the top of them. Recently an Afghan girl was killed by a train as she and her family attempted to cross into Croatia.

VIC/CERDANYOLA DEL VALLES, Spain (Reuters) - Catalonia votes on Thursday for a new administration in an election many hope will resolve Spain's worst crisis in decades after the region declared independence leading Madrid to sack local leaders.
Polls suggest neither the pro-independence nor the pro-unity camp will win a majority. The likely outcome is a hung parliament and many weeks of wrangling to form a new regional government.
In the separatist heartland of rural Catalonia, fireman Josep Sales says he hopes the results will endorse the result of an Oct. 1 illegal referendum on independence from Spain and lead to the creation of a republic.
""If we get a majority, something will have to be done. And if the politicians don't do it, the people will unite,"" he said, speaking from the town fire station where many of the red fire engines bear the slogan 'Hello Democracy'.
""If we have to bring the country to a standstill, so be it,"" said the 45-year-old, who plans to vote for Carles Puigdemont, the sacked Catalan head who is campaigning for election from self-imposed exile in Belgium. 
The uncertainty generated by the independence drive has hurt hotel occupancy rates in the region, dented consumer sales and caused more than 3,000 businesses to move their registered headquarters from Catalonia.
It has also bitterly divided Catalan society between those who support independence and those who favor unity with Spain.
""Everyone is eager for the election and to see how it turns out, because nothing is clear at the moment,"" said 34-year-old flamenco teacher Maria Gonzalez, who lives in Cerdanyola del Valles, an industrial suburb of Barcelona.

""The feeling on the streets is not comfortable,"" says Gonzalez, the daughter of migrants from other parts of Spain who moved to Catalonia decades ago and who plans to vote for pro-unity party Ciudadanos (""Citizens""). ""There's a hidden tension.""

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 01:20AM ET</span>","Germany takes political vacuum in its stride, for now","By Madeline Chambers
BERLIN (Reuters) - Largely unperturbed by Angela Merkel's failure to form a government after a September election, many Germans are taking the prospect of several more months of coalition talks in their stride.
The country is used to lengthy transitions but this is the longest since reunification in 1990. It is 87 days since the election and few experts see a government in place before March.
EU leaders fear delays to euro zone integration plans, some of which are to strengthen the banking system, and many economists warn Europe’s biggest economy must reform and invest in broadband and infrastructure to stay competitive.
But as caretaker chancellor, Merkel is voting at EU summits, parliament is passing laws required by international mandates, local authorities are wading through asylum applications and a bright outlook in Europe's biggest economy is buoying the mood.
""I haven’t noticed much difference from before,” said Nadja Helling, 36, cradling a steaming mug of gluehwein at a Berlin Christmas market. ""It's not ideal but nobody is panicking.""
Domestic and foreign demand are driving solid growth and the effects of low borrowing costs and European Central Bank stimulus are supporting record-high employment levels and rising real wages.
""We have jobs and are enjoying the Christmas markets,"" said Helling's friend, Silvia. ""What's the problem?”
The Munich-based Ifo institute raised its forecasts last week and expects the German economy to expand by 2.6 percent next year, the highest rate since 2011, adding, however, that this might be the peak.
The IfW institute in Kiel said the delayed formation of a government ""does not pose an economic risk"", but also sounded a warning for the longer term. 
""A boom may feel good but it carries the seeds of a crisis. The view that a boom is harmless, as long as consumer prices are under control, falls short,"" said the IfW's Stefan Kooths.
LITTLE SENSE OF CRISIS
The reality experienced by many Germans belies dire warnings from commentators last month about looming instability and even new elections after Merkel, weakened by losing votes to the far-right, was humiliated by the collapse of 3-way coalition talks.
She is now wooing the Social Democrats (SPD), reluctant partners after voters punished them for sharing power with Merkel's conservatives over the last four years.
Germany's transition pales into comparison with some other EU partners, such as Belgium and the Netherlands where a coalition took 225 days to clinch a deal this year.
""I suspect the process will take some time yet but people who talk about instability are mistaken. We have a stable caretaker government, an effective parliament and a democracy that is functioning very well,"" said Nils Diederich, politics professor at Berlin's Free University.
Confounding some predictions, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), dogged by infighting, has so far failed to capitalize on the lack of a proper government despite being the third-biggest party. Opinion polls have barely changed since the Sept. 24 election, indicating there is little sense of crisis.
The Ifo institute said on Tuesday uncertainty about the shape of the government was growing but that a surprise drop in its business moral survey in December after a record high the previous month was nothing too unusual.
Indeed, seasonally adjusted unemployment is at the lowest level since 1990 and Christmas sales forecasts are bright, with the HDE retail industry association expecting sales over the festive season to rise by 3 percent to a record high.
UNRUFFLED
Merkel, unruffled as ever, has sought to reassure voters and investors that it is business as usual in Germany, with most incumbent ministers staying on in an interim government. 
If anything, there is a striking lack of urgency about the talks, partly to keep skeptical SPD rank and file on board. After party leaders meet on Wednesday to draw up a rough timetable, no further talks are expected before January. 
Meanwhile, the Bundestag lower house has agreed to roll over military missions in Afghanistan and Mali and debated topics from Brexit to planned job cuts by Siemens.   
Germany's federal structure means much business that affects ordinary people, including dealing with asylum applications, housing and school issues, goes ahead regardless of Berlin.
Deutsche Bahn has launched a much delayed fast train link between Berlin and Munich, complete with the usual teething problems, and Christmas markets have opened, albeit with tight security after last year's attack.
The impasse has had little effect on Brexit talks because there is consensus among Germany's main parties about the German, and EU, position towards Britain.
Plans for euro zone reform, however, are more contentious, although Merkel said on Monday, she hoped to make progress on the issue by March.
""The main possible negative effect is that the momentum in Europe (for reform), that was desired after the Brexit vote might be lost,"" said Thomas Jaeger, politics professor at Cologne University.
The SPD, determined to stamp its identity on any coalition deal with Merkel, backs deeper integration than Merkel's conservatives, but is split over whether it should agree to a 'grand coalition' with Merkel.
Its leader Martin Schulz has championed French President Emmanuel Macron's proposals for a euro zone budget and finance minister and wants a ""United States of Europe"" by 2025.
""The only political crisis in Germany is the struggle for direction by the main parties, in particular the SPD,” said Diederich. ""The SPD needs time to overcome this.""

Thailand's Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) was downgraded to Category 2 from 1 because it fell short of the FAA's standards.
""We aim to be restored back to Category 1 by March,"" Transport Minister Arkom Termpittayapaisith told reporters. 
Arkom's comment came three months after the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) removed a red flag against Thailand over safety concerns in October. 
He said Thailand will speed up its inspection of pilot qualifications and aim to have more aviation personnel and qualified pilots to be considered for the safety ratings upgrade. 

Bangkok is a regional airline hub and Thailand targeted a record 33 million to 34 million tourist arrivals this year.

Phung Dinh Thuc, a former chairman of PetroVietnam, will be prosecuted for alleged ""violation of state regulations on economic management, causing serious consequences"" while he was in charge of a PetroVietnam solar power plant project, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement posted online. 
Thuc is one of two officials that Vietnamese state media had earlier this month reported would be prosecuted. Vietnam's state-run news agency later apologized for issuing what it said was a false report on the prosecution of the two.
Thuc was not available for comment. PetroVietnam did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
PetroVietnam is at the center of a high-level corruption crackdown. Former PetroVietnam chairman and also a former member of the communist state's politburo, Dinh La Thang, 56, was the most senior executive arrested in the scandal. 
Police have said they are investigating alleged violations of state rules at PetroVietnam that resulted in an 800 billion dong ($35 million) loss for local lender Ocean Bank.
On Tuesday, the security ministry said Phan Dinh Duc, a member of PetroVietnam's board of directors, would face prosecution over financial losses. 
The corruption crackdown made global headlines in August when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping Trinh Xuan Thanh, a former chairman of PetroVietnam's construction unit, after he applied for asylum in Berlin.

Vietnam has denied kidnapping Thanh and has said he turned himself in. The Communist Party has said Thanh will go on trial in January.

The coalition, which controls Yemen's airspace and access to its ports, last month blocked all entry points to Yemen after a similar missile attack on Riyadh's international airport.
Saudi authorities had said that both missiles were intercepted without causing any casualties.
""Keen to maintain humanitarian aid to the brotherly Yemeni people and as a result of intensified inspection measures, the coalition command announces that Hodeidah port will remain open for humanitarian and relief supplies,"" the coalition said in a statement carried by Saudi state new agency SPA.
The coalition said that ships bringing in fuel and food supplies will also be allowed to enter for another 30 days while proposals made by the United Nations envoy to Yemen are implemented, it added.
The agency did not elaborate on the proposals, but the coalition had been demanding that a U.N. inspection regime agreed in 2015 be further tightened to prevent weapons from reaching the Houthis.
The Red Sea port is the country's main entry point for food and humanitarian supplies.
The coalition had accused Iran of sending the missile that was fired towards Riyadh in November, and the United States last week displayed what it said was evidence that it was provided by Iran. Tehran has denied the report.
The closure of Yemen's ports and airports last month caused food and fuel shortages in a country already reeling from three years of war that has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than two million and caused a cholera epidemic that had infected some one million.

The coalition had said came under heavy international criticism, leading to the blockade being eased.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico recognized Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez on Tuesday as the winner of last month's election, just days after the Organization of American States called for a fresh vote to dispel widespread allegations of fraud.
The statement by Mexico, an important player in Central America, strengthened the position of Hernandez, who declared himself president-elect on Tuesday. It could pave the way for more countries, including the United States, to weigh in the incumbent's favor.
""Mexico respectfully calls for the democratic institutions, the political forces and the people of Honduras, in a mark of respect and agreement, to definitively conclude this electoral process,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. 
Mexico's announcement was brokered in coordination with the United States, two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said. The presidents of Guatemala and Colombia had recognized Hernandez, a staunch U.S. ally. 
The Mexican foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The statement was requested by Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, one of the sources said. Honduras' ambassador in Mexico was alerted of the move on Monday. The embassy did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
It is likely to enrage the center-left opposition, led by TV star Salvador Nasralla, who has accused Hernandez of stealing the election, sparking violent nationwide protests.

The General Secretariat of the OAS on Sunday said the election was plagued with irregularities and should be redone to meet democratic standards.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 11:39PM ET</span>",Crews battling California wildfire make headway in third day of fair weather,"By Steve Gorman
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Crews battling a devastating California wildfire that now ranks as the state's second-largest on record capitalized on a third straight day of favorable weather conditions on Tuesday as they made greater progress corralling the flames.
With the so-called Thomas fire blazing into its third week in the coastal mountains, foothills and canyons of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties northwest of Los Angeles, officials scaled back evacuation orders, sent home some visiting firefighters and reported improved air quality.
""I would definitely say things are looking better today than they have in the last two weeks,"" Rudy Evenson, a spokesman for the incident command center, told Reuters by telephone.
Higher humidity, combined with diminished winds and temperatures to ease firefighters' jobs since Sunday, but the region remains ""critically dry,"" a group of agencies said in a statement.
More than 1,000 homes and other buildings have gone up in flames and about 18,000 structures remained listed as threatened from a late-season firestorm that kept crews on the defensive for the better part of two weeks.
One firefighter died last Thursday near the town of Fillmore in Ventura County.
Still, fire managers are ""cautiously optimistic"" of having gained sufficient ground this week to protect populated areas against the return of high winds forecast for Wednesday night and early Thursday.
""We feel pretty confident about that for now,"" Evenson added. 
By Tuesday night, firefighters had carved containment lines around 55 percent of the blaze's perimeter - up from 50 percent earlier in the day. But the fire has still spread by several hundred acres a day since the weekend. 
In total the fire has scorched 272,000 acres (110,074 hectares) of drought-parched chaparral and brush since igniting on Dec. 4, covering an area equivalent to nearly a third of Rhode Island.
The latest tally makes the Thomas blaze one of the two largest single wildfires documented in California, second only to the 2003 Cedar fire in San Diego County, which consumed a record 273,246 acres (110,600 hectares) and killed 15 people.
The Thomas fire was initially stoked by hot, dry Santa Ana winds blowing with rare hurricane force from the eastern desert, spreading flames across miles of rugged coastal terrain faster than firefighters could keep up.
Winds have briefly abated a few times since, but the latest three-day break in the weather marked the most welcome relief offered firefighters yet by Mother Nature.
As a measure of their progress, officials have begun demobilizing crews, cutting the firefighting force to just over 6,800 personnel from about 8,500.
The cost of fighting the blaze runs into more than $150 million, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention estimates. The cause is still being investigated.

The Thomas fire erupted two months after a spate of wind-driven blazes in Northern California's wine country destroyed several thousand homes and killed more than 40 people. That ranked as the deadliest rash of wildfires, and one of the most destructive, in state history.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte had ordered the army and police to suspend offensive operations from Dec. 24 to Jan. 2 ""to lessen the apprehension of the public this Christmas season"".
He said he expected the Maoists and their political leaders to ""do a similar gesture of goodwill.""
There was no immediate comment from the communist rebel movement, whose top leaders and negotiators have been living in exile in The Netherlands since the late 1980s.
Duterte restarted a stalled peace process and freed several communist leaders as a gesture of good faith when he came to office last year but he recently abandoned talks due to escalating rebel attacks. 
He has vented his fury on a near-daily basis at what he considers duplicity by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA). He has collectively declared them a ""terrorist organization"" and has ended the three-decades peace process.
The rebel forces, estimated to number around 3,000, have been waging a protracted guerrilla warfare in the countryside for nearly 50 years in a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people and stifled growth in resource-rich areas of the Philippines.
The guerrillas have been targeting mines, plantations, construction and telecommunication companies, demanding ""revolutionary taxation"" to finance arms purchases and recruitment activities.
Duterte on Tuesday night said he only wanted Filipinos to celebrate a ""stress-free"" Christmas.

""I do not want to add more strain to what people are now suffering,"" he told reporters.

1089,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 11:20PM ET</span>",Who killed U.N. experts in Congo? Confidential prosecutor's file offers clues,"By Aaron Ross
DAKAR (Reuters) - U.N. investigators Zaida Catalan and Michael Sharp were on familiar ground when they sat down with local leaders in central Congo in March to discuss a widening seven-month-old conflict in the area.
The pair – experienced members of a panel monitoring the sanctions regime in Democratic Republic of Congo for the U.N. Security Council – were meeting members of the Kamuina Nsapu, a local clan, on the sidelines of peace talks with the government in the city of Kananga. 
Among other things, they discussed plans to visit the village of Bunkonde, the site of violent clashes, the next day.
The two U.N. workers left Kananga on the morning of March 12. On March 27, their bodies were found in a shallow grave. Catalan had been decapitated.
Congolese government officials maintained for months to reporters that no state agents were involved in the killings and that they did not know that the two experts were in the region, let alone heading to Bunkonde.
But at least one person who helped organize the trip, Jose Tshibuabua, worked for Congo's intelligence service, the Agence Nationale de Renseignements (ANR), Reuters and Radio France Internationale (RFI) have learned.
The trial of a dozen suspected Kamuina Nsapu militia members started in June but was suspended in October pending the arrival in Congo of four U.N. experts last month to assist with additional investigations. 
Phone logs in a confidential prosecutor's case file compiled for the trial and seen by Reuters and RFI, who jointly reported this story, show that Tshibuabua had frequent contact with a local ANR boss, Luc Albert Tanga Sakrine, before and after the two experts were killed. 
Two security sources said that case file was given to a U.N. board of inquiry that concluded militiamen were likely responsible for the killings of Sharp, 34, an American, and Catalan, 36, a Swede.
Tshibuabua and his ties to the ANR were not mentioned in the board's confidential report to the U.N. Security Council or in the trial, however. 
The board said it was unable to establish a motive for state actors to have been involved. But the two experts were conducting investigations in an area where the United Nations has accused Congo's military of using excessive force against militia and civilians and of digging mass graves.
The top ANR official in Congo, Kalev Mutond, told Reuters and RFI that Tshibuabua was working as a ""volunteer informant"" for the agency at the time of the meeting, but did not inform ANR officials about his contacts with the two experts.
Since the trial of the militiamen was suspended, Tshibuabua was arrested and charged last week with the murder of Catalan and Sharp and participation in an insurrection, his lawyer, Tresor Kabangu, told Reuters. Kabangu said his client denies the charges and has not worked for the ANR in more than a year.
Government spokesman Lambert Mende now says that authorities have not excluded the possibility that state agents were involved. 
""If there is a state agent who was involved, he will be pursued and judged,"" Mende said on Dec. 1 after Reuters and RFI laid out the contents of the case file and phone logs.
The U.N. board's chairman, Greg Starr, declined to say if he had seen the prosecutor's file or was aware of its contents. 
In an emailed answer to questions, Starr said only that the board's report had a tight deadline and did not include some sensitive information, which was turned over to authorities in the United States and Sweden, because of concerns about leaks.
""A thorough criminal investigation into a heinous act like this, under these circumstances, could not be accomplished in only three months,"" he said.
Congo's top military prosecutor, Joseph Ponde, declined to respond to questions about why Tshibuabua's involvement was not raised in the trial, except to say the proceedings are public. 
Tanga Sakrine declined to comment. President Joseph Kabila's deputy chief of staff, Jean-Pierre Kambila, also declined to comment, citing the ongoing trial. 
A TENSE RELATIONSHIP
Ties between the United Nations and Congo can be tense, with authorities often accusing the world body of meddling in their sovereign affairs. The U.N. peacekeeping mission, deployed in 1999 to monitor a cease-fire in a long-running war in the east, is the world's largest with about 18,000 uniformed personnel. 
Catalan and Sharp were investigating a new conflict in the central Kasai region. In August 2016, Kamuina Nsapu militiamen in the area rose up to demand government forces withdraw after the local chief, Jean-Pierre Mpandi, was killed.
Up to 5,000 people died in the violence. 
On the weekend of March 11, a delegation of about 40 Kamuina Nsapu representatives was in Kananga to talk peace. Members of this delegation met Sharp and Catalan at the Woodland Hotel.
In audio recovered from Catalan's computer by the United Nations, Tshibuabua describes himself as a Mpandi family member and helps translate from the local Tshiluba language into French for the group's leader, Francois Muamba. He does not say he works for the ANR.
According to a Reuters translation, Tshibuabua and another person assured Sharp and Catalan in French that their safety would be guaranteed in Bunkonde, even as Muamba warned not to make promises they couldn't keep.
""We don't know the situation over there,"" Muamba said at one point. He said he did not have control of the local militia in Bunkonde. ""Let's talk about (the situation) near us.""
Tshibuabua continued to assure the U.N. investigators that the militiamen ""will not do anything"", adding later: ""Here in Kasai, we really guarantee your passage.""
Reuters was unable to reach Muamba for comment.
The prosecutor's case file includes logs from about 20 phone numbers over various periods from early March to mid-June.
One is from the phone of Tshibuabua and another is from the phone of his cousin Betu Tshintela, who accompanied Catalan and Sharp to Bunkonde as an interpreter. Tshintela claimed in a 2012 job application to the government of Kasai-Occidental province - seen by Reuters and RFI - to have also worked for the ANR.
The government says Tshintela is dead but the United Nations cannot confirm that. Mutond, the top ANR official, could not confirm if Tshintela had worked for the ANR but said he was looking into it.   
The phone logs show Tshibuabua was repeatedly in contact with Tanga Sakrine, the provincial ANR chief, around this time. Between March 10 and 12, the two exchanged at least 17 text messages, including five in the afternoon of March 11, shortly after the meeting at the Woodland Hotel, and five around 9 p.m. on March 12, hours after Sharp and Catalan were killed. 
Mutond said he asked Tshibuabua three times in an interrogation in the capital Kinshasa whether he informed ANR officials about his contacts with the investigators, and Tshibuabua said no each time. 
Reuters and RFI could not independently confirm this.
""I looked Jose Tshibuabua in the eyes and asked him because I myself wanted to have a clean conscience,"" Mutond said.
FINAL CALL 
Sharp spent three years working in eastern Congo for a Mennonite peace-building organization, trying to persuade rebels to lay down their weapons, before joining the sanctions panel in 2015 as its armed groups expert.
Catalan, the panel's humanitarian expert, worked for the European Union's police mission in Congo in 2011-12 and also held posts with the EU in Palestine and Afghanistan.   
The phone logs show the last call from Catalan's phone was to her sister, Elizabeth Morseby, in Sweden at 4:49 p.m.
Morseby told Reuters and RFI she could hear only some male voices in the background and Catalan breathing deeply before the call disconnected. No-one answered when she called back.  
Some relatives and rights activists told Reuters and RFI they raised concerns early about possible government involvement because state forces were heavily implicated in rights abuses in Kasai that attracted international attention in the past. 
The families and Washington want the United Nations to launch an independent investigation. 
A former colleague on the U.N. panel also cast doubt on a video that the government said showed the two being executed by Kamuina Nsapu members. He said the video raised more questions than it answered, for example, why at least one of the alleged assassins gave orders in Lingala, the language of western Congo and the army, rather than the local Tshiluba.
Mende, the government spokesman, countered that many Congolese speak at least some Lingala.
The U.N. board noted theories of ""alternate causes of the incident"" but cited a lack of motive for government to be involved. It also said Sharp and Catalan failed to heed warnings from U.N. security officials that travel outside Kananga was dangerous. 
The FBI has opened an investigation, according to Sharp's parents, who have met with bureau investigators. The FBI declined to comment.
The Swedish prosecutor's office is investigating Catalan's killing but complained in a statement last month that Congolese officials are not cooperating.

Mende said it was up to Swedish authorities to provide information to the Congolese court hearing the case, not the other way around.

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 11:10PM ET</span>",France's Macron firms up bounce in opinion polls,"PARIS (Reuters) - French president Emmanuel Macron's popularity jumped back above 50 percent thanks in part to better ratings among the young and the working class, an opinion poll showed on Wednesday, confirming a rebound that started at the beginning of December.
Macron's popularity dropped quickly after he swept to an electoral victory in May on a centrist platform, shattering a long-standing two-party system in France. 
But while the former investment banker has struggled to shake off a ""president of the rich"" tag pinned on him by rivals for policies such as cuts in housing benefits, Macron's efforts to defend French interests abroad have helped lift his ratings. 
His popularity rose above 50 percent for the first time since his election in early December, and a new poll on Wednesday, taken on Monday and Tuesday, showed the president scoring a 52 percent approval rating.
That was a six-percentage-point jump from November, according to the BVA poll, carried out for Orange and La Tribune and released on the eve of Macron's 40th birthday. 
As well as praising Macron's international efforts, those surveyed also highlighted that he was delivering on campaign promises, BVA said, even though some policies like a labor reform that gives employers greater freedom to hire and fire staff were deeply unpopular with many of his detractors. 
The president is most popular with older voters and higher earners, but made the biggest progress in the latest poll with the young, BVA added. 
Other surveys this week also confirmed Macron was making headway, although a ViaVoice poll for Liberation published on Tuesday put his popularity rating lower, at 46 percent. That was also a six-percentage-point improvement on the previous month. 
An Odoxa survey gave Macron a 54 percent approval rating. 
Macron's turnaround in polls comes as political rivals are scrambling to regroup and form a stronger opposition, at a time when both the left and right are deeply fragmented.

The president's office recently played down attacks from some opponents over Macron's planned birthday celebrations with his family in the grounds of a former royal palace, which drew jibes about him being out of touch.

Gumaro Perez, 35, who regularly wrote about security and drug trafficking, was shot at four times and killed in the Acayucan municipality, becoming the third journalist killed in the state, and Mexico's twelfth, this year. 
Perez worked for Golfo Sur and Voz del Sur, among other media organizations.
""We're in shock, waiting for them to hand over the body and see what we're going to do together with his family,"" said journalists' group Asociacion de Periodistas Independientes de Acayucan, to which Perez belonged. 
A lone gunman entered Perez's 6-year-old son's classroom, where the Christmas celebration was being held, and fired at Perez, the group said, citing witnesses. 
Roberta Jacobson, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, condemned Perez's death in a post on Twitter, writing that she was ""outraged by the death of another brave journalist in Mexico."" 
""You don't kill the truth by killing journalists,"" she added.

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 10:51PM ET</span>","After U.S. veto, U.N. General Assembly to meet on Jerusalem status","By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The 193-member United Nations General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states on U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, sparking a warning from Washington that it will ""take names.""
Palestinian U.N. envoy Riyad Mansour said the General Assembly would vote on a draft resolution calling for Trump's declaration to be withdrawn, which was vetoed by the United States in the 15-member U.N. Security Council on Monday.
The remaining 14 Security Council members voted in favor of the Egyptian-drafted resolution, which did not specifically mention the United States or Trump but which expressed ""deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem.""
Mansour said on Monday he hoped there would be ""overwhelming support"" in the General Assembly for the resolution. Such a vote is non-binding, but carries political weight.
U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, in a letter to dozens of U.N. states on Tuesday seen by Reuters, warned that the United States would remember those who voted for the resolution criticizing the U.S. decision.
""The president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those countries who voted against us. We will take note of each and every vote on this issue,"" Haley wrote. 
She echoed that call in a Twitter post: The U.S. will be taking names.""
Under a 1950 resolution, an emergency special session can be called for the General Assembly to consider a matter ""with a view to making appropriate recommendations to members for collective measures"" if the Security Council fails to act.
Only 10 such sessions have been convened, and the last time the General Assembly met in such a session was in 2009 on occupied East Jerusalem and Palestinian territories. Thursday's meeting will be a resumption of that session. 
Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, generating outrage from Palestinians and the Arab world and concern among Washington's Western allies.
Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. The draft U.N. resolution calls on all countries to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. 
Haley said on Monday that the resolution was vetoed in the Security Council in defense of U.S. sovereignty and the U.S. role in the Middle East peace process. She criticized it as an insult to Washington and an embarrassment to council members.

Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city's eastern sector, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.

The New Party has denounced the raids as politically motivated, although Taiwanese prosecutors and the government have not given details of what they are suspected of.
Party chairman Yok Mu-ming, cited in Taiwanese media, wondered how such a small party with no legislators could be considered to have any secrets, and said that they had nothing to fear from the investigation. 
In a short statement released late on Tuesday, China's Taiwan Affairs Office praised the New Party for its stance in opposing Taiwan independence and upholding the ""one China"" principle, which states that Taiwan is part of China. 
""Recently, the Taiwan authorities have shielded and connived with Taiwan independent splittists, and taken various moves to wantonly crack down on and persecute forces and people who uphold peaceful reunification,"" it said.
""We strongly condemn this and are paying close attention to developments,"" the office said.
The New Party broke off from the Nationalists, who once ruled all of China, in 1993. Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists.
Relations between China and Taiwan have soured since Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party won presidential elections last year. China suspects she wants to push for Taiwan's formal independence.
Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan's security.
The Chinese military has stepped up air force patrols around Taiwan in recent weeks. China has never renounced the use of force to bring what it considers a wayward province under Chinese control.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan leftist President Nicolas Maduro said on Tuesday that ""terrorists"" had broken into a National Guard unit over the weekend and stolen weapons, the latest sign of volatility in the oil-rich country convulsed by a profound economic crisis.
Oscar Perez, a rogue Venezuelan police pilot wanted for lobbing grenades and shooting at government buildings in June, claimed responsibility for the attack, which he called ""Operation Genesis."" 
A video posted on Perez's YouTube account shows armed, masked men taking control of military barracks under cover of night. They smash photos of Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, handcuff around a dozen soldiers and berate them for supporting ""dictatorship"" in Venezuela.
""You yourselves are dying of hunger. Why have you not done anything, given you have weapons? Why do you keep protecting these drug-trafficking dictators?"" the assailants shout at gagged soldiers crouching on the floor of what appears to be a bathroom.
""Soon we'll win the war ... so that Venezuela can be free,"" says Perez, under the cover of a black balaclava.
His Twitter account later posted a purported summary by authorities of the attack. The summary says some 49 armed men stole around 26 Kalashnikov AK-103's and over 3,000 munitions for the rifles, as well as pistols, in Miranda state near Caracas during the early hours of Monday.
Reuters was not able to independently confirm details of the attack. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
An action film star who portrays himself as a James Bond cum-Rambo figure on social media, Perez has added surreal twists to Venezuela's long-running political drama.
He rose to fame in June after hijacking a police helicopter flying over Caracas’ center. He fired shots at and lobbed grenades on the Interior Ministry and the Supreme Court to fight what he said was a tyrannical government. He went into hiding after the attack, only to pop up two weeks later at an opposition vigil for anti-government protesters killed during demonstrations that rocked the country earlier this year.
Perez's latest offensive highlights instability in Venezuela, an OPEC member state heaving under malnutrition, disease and the world's steepest inflation rate. The opposition has long appealed to the military, historically a powerbroker in Venezuela, for help.
Maduro on Tuesday denounced the attackers, whom he did not name, as ""terrorists"" sent by his ideological enemy the United States.
""Wherever they appear, I've told the armed forces: Fire at the terrorist groups!"" he said during a speech on state television, as he blamed opposition groups in Miami for orchestrating the raid.
""Do these people think they can attack a unit of the armed forces to steal some guns and threaten democracy and that that's going to be tolerated? Zero tolerance!"" Maduro said.
The military has played a key role in government since Chavez - himself a former military officer - took office in 1999 promising to bring greater equality to Venezuela, home to the world’s largest oil reserves.
The top brass continues to publicly profess loyalty to Maduro’s government. Critics say juicy government contracts, corruption and contraband mean that many military officials want Maduro to stay in office and fear persecution should the opposition take power.

Discontent is higher among lower-tier officials, who are often sent to control rowdy protests and are paid the equivalent of just a handful of U.S. dollars a month.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi air defenses shot down a ballistic missile fired by Yemen's Houthi group towards Riyadh on Tuesday, the Saudi-led coalition said, in an attack that could escalate a proxy war between the kingdom and Iran.
There were no reports of casualties or damage. In contrast, a U.N. human rights spokesman said coalition air strikes had killed at least 136 non-combatants in war-torn Yemen since Dec. 6.
The Iran-aligned Houthi movement said it had aimed the missile at the Saudi royal court at al-Yamama palace, where a meeting of Saudi leaders was under way. It described the attack as a new chapter in the conflict. 
The Saudi-led coalition said the missile, the latest of several fired towards Riyadh, had been directed at residential areas and there had been no damage. 
Quoting a statement from the coalition, Saudi state news agency SPA said Iranian-made missiles were a threat to regional and international security. It accused the Houthis of using humanitarian entry points into Yemen to smuggle in missiles from Saudi Arabia's regional arch-foe Iran.
""Coalition forces confirm intercepting an Iranian-Houthi missile targeting (the) south of Riyadh. There are no reported casualties at this time,"" the government-run Center for International Communication wrote on its Twitter account.
Saudi palaces, military and oil facilities are within range of such missiles, the Houthis said in a statement carried by the group's Al-Masirah television.
The U.S. State Department condemned the missile attack and called on Iran to stop arming the Houthis.
At the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the Houthi missile strike ""bears all the hallmarks of previous attacks using Iranian-provided weapons.""
Haley said she was exploring, with some U.N. Security Council colleagues, several options for pressuring Iran to ""adjust their behavior."" Haley is likely to struggle, however, to convince some members, like veto powers Russia and China, that U.N. action is needed.
THOUSANDS OF AIR STRIKES IN YEMEN
Saudi Arabia and Iran are locked in struggle for influence in the Middle East. The conflict in Saudi Arabia's backyard Yemen has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced over 2 million. 
The Houthis for their part have fired several missiles at the kingdom, but have not caused any serious damage.
The attack came as the Houthis marked 1,000 days since the Saudi-led coalition began military operations in Yemen in March 2015 after the Iran-aligned group drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile.
""The enemies had their own mirage calculations ... but over 1,000 days, there has been this great steadfastness,"" said Abdel-Malek al-Houthi, a Houthi leader, in a speech on the group's Al-Masirah TV.
The United Arab Emirates, a close ally of Saudi Arabia and part of its coalition, said the latest Houthi attack underscored the need to keep the military campaign in Yemen going.
""With every Iranian missile fired by the Houthi militia against civilian targets, the necessity of (Operation) Decisive Storm becomes clear,"" United Arab Emirates Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on his Twitter account.
Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri condemned the attack, saying such actions exacerbated divisions in the region.
Saudi Arabia and Iran are also competing for influence in Iraq and Syria.
Reuters witnesses described hearing a blast and said they saw smoke in the northeast of Riyadh.
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has described what Riyadh says is Iran's supply of rockets to the Houthis as ""direct military aggression"" that could be an act of war.
Iran has denied supplying such weaponry to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and other parts of the country during its civil war.
Saudi Arabia said on Nov. 4 it had intercepted a ballistic missile over Riyadh's King Khaled Airport, an attack that led the coalition to close Yemeni ports. 
On Nov. 30, Saudi Arabia shot down another missile near its southwestern city of Khamis Mushait.
Last week, the United States presented for the first time pieces of what it said were Iranian weapons supplied to the Houthis, describing them as conclusive evidence that Tehran was violating U.N. resolutions.

The arms included charred remnants of what the Pentagon said was an Iranian-made short-range ballistic missile fired from Yemen in the Nov. 4 attack, as well as a drone and an anti-tank weapon recovered in Yemen by the Saudis.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico is poised to recognize Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez as the winner of last month's election, according to a draft foreign ministry statement seen by Reuters, just days after the Organization of American States called for a fresh vote to dispel widespread allegations of fraud.
Mexico's announcement was brokered in coordination with the United States, two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said. The presidents of Guatemala and Colombia had recognized Hernandez, a staunch U.S. ally. 
A statement by Mexico, an important player in Central America, would strengthen the position of Hernandez, who declared himself president-elect on Tuesday. It could pave the way for more countries, including the United States, to weigh in the incumbent's favor.
""The government of Mexico congratulates Juan Orlando Hernandez for his victory in the general elections,"" Mexico's foreign ministry wrote in a draft of the statement seen by Reuters. 
The Mexican foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The statement was requested by Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and awaits final approval, one of the sources said. Honduras' ambassador in Mexico was alerted of the move on Monday. The embassy did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
It is likely to enrage the center-left opposition, led by TV star Salvador Nasralla, who has accused Hernandez of stealing the election, sparking violent nationwide protests.

The General Secretariat of the OAS on Sunday said the election was plagued with irregularities and should be redone to meet democratic standards.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 08:56PM ET</span>",U.S. investigators seek answers from train crew in Washington derailment,"By Tom James
DUPONT, Wash. (Reuters) - U.S. safety inspectors probing the deadly wreck of a passenger train that careened off a bridge onto a highway in Washington state are eager to question the engineer and a conductor-in-training who were in the cab of the locomotive, officials said on Tuesday.
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) officials hoped interviews with all crew members would shed light on why Train 501 on Amtrak's Cascades line was going more than twice the speed limit around a curved stretch of track when it derailed on Monday.
The accident occurred during the train's inaugural run on a new, slightly quicker route between Olympia and Tacoma, with 86 people aboard, 80 of them passengers, Amtrak said. 
NTSB officials said they planned to interview all the crew members in the next two days, once they sufficiently recover from injuries suffered in the wreck, including the conductor-in-training who was with the engineer at the time.
Safety board member T. Bella Dinh-Zarr told reporters that NTSB investigators would seek to determine, among other factors routinely examined, whether the engineer was distracted while driving the ill-fated train.
""Distraction is one of our most-wanted-list priorities at the NTSB,"" she said.
She also said investigators had determined that the train's emergency brakes were automatically activated while the derailment was occurring, rather than engaged manually by the engineer.
In addition, she confirmed that a safety system known as positive train control (PTC), which automatically slows trains if they go too fast, was not installed on the rail line. She said Congress had extended a mandatory deadline for having the PTC system installed on all passenger railways to 2018. 
None of the crew has been identified. All were hospitalized, Dinh-Zarr said.
Three people aboard the train were killed when all 12 carriages and one of the train's two locomotives tumbled off the rails onto Interstate 5 near the town of DuPont (NYSE:DWDP), about 50 miles south of Seattle, officials said. Another 100 people were taken to hospitals, 10 with serious injuries.
Some motorists were among the injured, though nobody on the highway died.
Recorded data recovered from the rear locomotive showed the train was going 80 miles (129 km) per hour on a bend in the track where the speed limit was 30 mph (48 kph), NTSB officials said on Monday night. The board said it was investigating whether other circumstances besides speed were involved, such as track conditions, signals, mechanical issues and human factors.
Speaking at an afternoon news conference on Tuesday, Dinh-Zarr said that a conductor ""who was getting experience and familiarizing himself with the territory"" was present in the locomotive cab with the engineer. NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson described that second Amtrak employee as a ""conductor-in-training.""
Dinh-Zarr said it was not unusual for conductors who are learning a new train route to ride in the cab with the engineer. She said another conductor was posted in the passenger section of the train at the time.
The derailment placed Amtrak, the country's main passenger rail service, under renewed scrutiny following a series of fatal incidents.
SEEKING TO REOPEN HIGHWAY
Meanwhile, workers lifted mangled train cars onto flatbed trucks from the wreckage site, using two towering cranes in wet, windy weather as they sought to reopen the southbound lanes of Interstate 5, a major West Coast highway stretching from the Canadian border to Mexico. 
They expected to remove five of the cars and the locomotive by Tuesday afternoon and take them to a nearby U.S. military base for further examination, officials said.
The locomotive alone weighs more than 270,000 pounds (120 tonnes) and will require an extra-large truck to move, Dan Hall, the regional commander for the Washington State Patrol, said at a news conference.
The southbound stretch of Interstate 5 will remain closed for several days, the Washington State Department of Transportation said.
At least two of the three people who died in the derailment were transit enthusiasts who wanted to see the maiden run of a new route for the train line, said Abe Zumwalt, director of policy research for the Rail Passengers Association.
Jim Hamre and Zack Willhoite were members of the association, the Washington, D.C.-based organization said in a statement identifying the two men as victims of the wreck. Willhoite worked for a local transportation agency, Pierce Transit, as a customer service support specialist.

""They were best friends and they took all kinds of trips together, and given that yesterday was an inaugural run on a service that both had advocated for tirelessly, it made sense that they were on board,"" Zumwalt said in a phone interview.

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 08:40PM ET</span>",Fighting in eastern Ukraine worst since February: OSCE,"By Alessandra Prentice and Oleksandr Klymenko
KIEV/NOVOLUHANSKE, Ukraine (Reuters) - Fighting in eastern Ukraine has escalated to the worst level in months, officials monitoring the conflict said on Tuesday, after the shelling of a frontline village wounded eight civilians and destroyed or damaged dozens of homes.
A Russia-backed insurgency erupted in 2014 and the bloodshed has continued despite a ceasefire deal that was meant to end a conflict in which more than 10,000 people have been killed, with casualties reported on a near-daily basis.
The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitors the implementation of the peace agreement, said it had recorded 16,000 ceasefire violations between Dec. 11 and Dec. 17, a 35 percent increase on the week before. 
""We note with concern a sharp deterioration in the security situation with ceasefire violations reaching levels not recorded since February this year,"" chief monitor Ertugrul Apakan said in a statement.
In February, a surge of violence around the government-held industrial town of Avdiivka cut off power and water to thousands of civilians on the front line.
Apakan said the latest escalation reflected an established trend ""in which a recommitment to the ceasefire by the sides was followed by a steady increase in the level of violence, culminating in fierce fighting"". 
Apakan's comments followed warnings from aid agencies over the humanitarian situation in the eastern Donbass region, particularly given Monday's attack on the government-controlled village of Novoluhanske.
The United Nations' OCHA humanitarian arm said on Twitter heavy shelling near Novoluhanske was affecting 2,000 residents.
People are fleeing the area in blizzard conditions, it said.
Eight civilians were wounded and more than 50 buildings were damaged in the shelling, which also temporarily cut power supplies, the regional Kiev-controlled Donetsk administration said.
A Reuters witness saw residents picking their way through the rubble of destroyed homes and surveying fire-blackened buildings.
The U.S. State Department said the humanitarian situation was ""dire"" because of the shelling, which it blamed on Russian-led forces firing Grad multiple-launch rockets.
The Ukrainian military on Tuesday accused pro-Russian separatists of deliberately firing more than 40 times from multiple-launch rocket systems at Novoluhanske. 
Meanwhile, the rebel command said attacks from the Ukrainian side had almost doubled in the past 24 hours, according to separatist news website DAN.
Rebels deny attacking Novoluhanske and say the Ukrainian military fired at the village to justify their attacks on separatist-held civilian areas, according to DAN.
The U.S. State Department also voiced concern about fighting around the Donetsk water filtration station, which has a system of pipes that carry chlorine gas.
""If those were to go off in this area, which is close to where people live, it could be potentially devastating,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing.
She said civilian water workers were trapped in the station's bomb shelter and could not get out because of fighting.
In an effort to end the deadlock, the international community, including the United States, has in recent months been advocating for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in the Donbass.
Both Kiev and Moscow backed the idea but disagree on whether the troops should be positioned on the rebel-controlled part of the Ukraine-Russia border, so no decision was made.

Russia denies accusations from Ukraine and NATO that it supports the rebels with troops and weapons.

""I was told from my boss this morning that our Chinese partners (based in Beijing and Shandong) said they won't send group tourists to South Korea as of January,"" the official from Naeil Tour Agency told Reuters by phone.

UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has given China a draft resolution for tougher U.N. sanctions on North Korea and is hoping for a quick vote on it by the U.N. Security Council, a Western diplomat said on Tuesday.
A senior official of the Trump administration confirmed efforts were under way to negotiate a new U.N. resolution, but added that there had been no agreement.
""We're trying to get another one,"" said the official, who did not want to be identified. ""They're not there yet.""
Details of the draft given to China last week were not immediately available, but the United States is keen to step up global sanctions to pressure North Korea to give up a weapons program aimed developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.
Among the steps it wants is a tightening of restrictions on North Korea's supply of refined petroleum, which is capped by previous U.N. sanctions at 2 million barrels a year.
China, which supplies most of North Korea's oil, has backed successive rounds of U.N. sanctions but has resisted past U.S. calls to cut off supplies to its neighbor. Its embassy in Washington and Foreign Ministry in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The United States has also called on the U.N. Security Council to blacklist 10 ships for circumventing sanctions on North Korea, documents seen by Reuters on Tuesday showed.
The documents said vessels had been conducting ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels or transporting North Korean coal in violation of existing U.N. sanctions.
Earlier on Tuesday, China responded to the announcement of a new U.S. national security strategy this week that branded Beijing a competitor seeking to challenge U.S. power by saying that cooperation between it and Washington would lead to a win-win outcome for both sides, but confrontation would bring mutual losses.

The bus was carrying 31 passengers, including citizens of the United States, Brazil and Sweden, authorities said. A child was among the dead. Quintana Roo is one of three states on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, which has popular tourist sites.
Twenty-seven of the passengers had been traveling on Royal Caribbean cruise ships, spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said. 
""Our hearts go out to all those involved in the bus accident,"" Martinez said in a statement. ""We are doing all we can to care for our guests, including assisting with medical care and transportation.""
The tourists were headed to the archaeological zone of Chacchoben, an ancient Mayan ruin south of the resort town of Tulum, when the vehicle veered off the highway early on Tuesday.
After the accident, passengers were taken to hospitals, bus company Costa Maya said in a statement. Five have been discharged and the injured were in stable condition, it said.
The government of Quintana Roo said in a statement that it was investigating the cause of the accident.
The U.S. embassy in Mexico said it was working with authorities to learn whether U.S. citizens were aboard the bus.
Last year, 11 tourists were killed in a crash in Quintana Roo when their bus flipped en route to Cancun, the Associated Press reported.

1102,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 07:29PM ET</span>","After one week, Myanmar silent on whereabouts of detained Reuters journalists","YANGON (Reuters) - Two Reuters journalists completed a week in detention in Myanmar on Tuesday, with no word on where they were being held as authorities proceeded with an investigation into whether they violated the country's colonial-era Official Secrets Act.
Journalists Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were arrested last Tuesday evening after they were invited to dine with police officers on the outskirts of Myanmar's largest city, Yangon.
""We and their families continue to be denied access to them or to the most basic information about their well-being and whereabouts,"" Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement calling for their immediate release.
""Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are journalists who perform a crucial role in shedding light on news of global interest, and they are innocent of any wrongdoing.""
The news group Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) on Tuesday cited government spokesman Zaw Htay as saying that the journalists were ""being treated well and in good health"".
It gave no further details in its online report.
Reuters was unable to reach Zaw Htay for comment.
Myanmar's civilian president, Htin Kyaw, a close ally of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi, has authorized the police to proceed with a case against the reporters, Zaw Htay said on Sunday.
Approval from the president's office is needed before court proceedings can begin in cases brought under the Official Secrets Act, which has a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis that has seen an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims flee from a fierce military crackdown on militants in the western state of Rakhine.
CRITICISM FROM FAR AND WIDE
A number of governments, including the United States, Canada and Britain, and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, as well as a host of journalists' and human rights' groups, have criticized the arrests as an attack on press freedom and called on Myanmar to release the two men.
The U.S. State Department on Tuesday called for their immediate release.
""We've been ... following the cases of the two reporters, the Reuters reporters, very closely. We're deeply concerned about their detention. We do not know their whereabouts. That is of concern also,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a news briefing. ""Today I want to make it clear that we're calling for their immediate release.""
On Monday, the spokeswoman for the European Union's foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini, described the arrests as ""a cause of real concern"".
""Freedom of the press and media is the foundation and a cornerstone of any democracy,"" the spokeswoman said.
Myanmar has seen rapid growth in independent media since censorship imposed under the former junta was lifted in 2012.
Rights groups were hopeful there would be further gains in press freedoms after Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi came to power last year amid a transition from full military rule that had propelled her from political prisoner to elected leader.
However, advocacy groups say freedom of speech has been eroded since she took office, with many arrests of journalists, restrictions on reporting in Rakhine state and heavy use of state-run media to control the narrative.
BLACK SHIRTS PROTEST
About 20 local reporters belonging to the Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists (PCMJ) posted pictures on Tuesday of themselves wearing black shirts as a sign of protest. They said their act was meant ""to signify the dark age of media freedom"".
""By wearing black shirts, all journalists should show unity,"" said Tha Lun Zaung Htet, a producer and presenter at DVB Debate TV and a leading member of the PCMJ. ""We must fight for press freedom with unity.""
But most journalists in Yangon did not take part in the campaign. Mya Hnin Aye, senior executive editor at the Voice Weekly, said few participated because the arrested journalists work for foreign media, much of whose ""reporting on the Rakhine issue is biased"".
Myo Nyunt, deputy director for Myanmar's Ministry of Information, told Reuters the case against Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had nothing to do with press freedom, and said journalists have ""freedom to write and speak"".
The Ministry of Information said last week that the two journalists had ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"", and released a photo of them in handcuffs.
The authorities have not allowed the journalists any contact with their families, a lawyer or Reuters since their arrest.
The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) called on the authorities to immediately disclose the whereabouts of the pair.
""All detainees must be allowed prompt access to a lawyer and to family members,"" Frederick Rawski, the ICJ's Asia-Pacific Regional Director, said in a statement on Monday.
""Authorities are bound to respect these rights in line with Myanmar law and the State's international law obligations.""

On Sunday, spokesman Zaw Htay said the journalists' legal rights were being respected. ""Your reporters are protected by the rule of the law.""

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 07:20PM ET</span>",EU Commission may launch moves to punish Poland over legal reforms,"By Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's executive may trigger a process on Wednesday to begin to strip Poland of its voting rights in the bloc, officials say, as months of tensions between Brussels and Warsaw come to a head.
In what would be an unprecedented move, the European Commission could invoke Article 7 of the European Union's founding Lisbon Treaty to punish Warsaw for breaking its rules on human rights and democratic values.
""Unless the Polish government postpones these court reforms, we will have no choice but to trigger Article 7,"" said a senior EU official before a Commission meeting on Wednesday, where Poland's reforms are on the agenda. 
Poland's new prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in Brussels last week that ""the decision has already been made"". The Commission's deputy head Frans Timmermans warned in July that Poland was ""perilously close"" to facing sanctions.
Such a punishment could still be blocked. Hungary, Poland's closest ally in the EU, is likely to argue strongly against it.
But the mere threat of it underlines the sharp deterioration in ties between Warsaw and Brussels since the socially conservative Law and Justice (PiS) won power in late 2015. 
The Commission says Poland's judicial reforms limit judges' independence. Polish President Andrzej Duda has until Jan. 5 to sign them into law. 
If all EU governments agree, Poland could have its voting rights in the EU suspended, and may also see cuts in billions of euros of EU aid. 
The PiS government rejects accusations of undemocratic behavior and says its reforms are needed because courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist era-mentality.
Following a non-binding European Parliament vote last month calling for Article 7 to be invoked, the Commission appears to have little leeway to grant Warsaw more time to amend its legislation.
The reforms would give the PiS-controlled parliament de facto control over the selection of judges and end the terms of some Supreme Court judges early.
The Council of Europe, the continent's human rights watchdog, has compared such measures to those of the Soviet system. 

The Commission fears letting Poland off the hook could weaken its hand, especially in the ex-communist east, and risk damaging the EU's single market and cross-border legal cooperation.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 07:20PM ET</span>",Britain's Brexit rebels offer compromise on latest EU exit laws row,"LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers who inflicted defeat on Prime Minister Theresa May last week in parliament over Brexit have signaled a possible compromise to avoid another row on Wednesday when legislation taking Britain out of the EU is debated.
The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which will repeal the 1972 legislation binding Britain to the EU and copy existing EU law into domestic law, has tested May's authority to deliver on her Brexit plan during several days of line-by-line debate.
Last week, 11 lawmakers from her Conservative Party rebelled against their leader, joining forces with the opposition to force through changes giving parliament greater guarantees of a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal.
However, another row - this time over the government's desire to fix the planned date of Britain's departure into law - could be averted on Wednesday after rebels said they were prepared to agree to it if another proviso were inserted in the bill allowing that date to be changed if necessary.
Pro-EU Conservative Nicky Morgan, who voted against the government last week, said on Twitter she would back the plan when it comes to a vote. Some of the other rebels also publicly indicated their support.
DIVIDED PARLIAMENT
Last week's defeat underscored just one of the serious difficulties May faces in taking the country out of the EU. 
As well as navigating a divided parliament without an overall majority, she has to please ministers who are deeply split over the country's long term relationship with Brussels and negotiate a deal from an EU which is keen to send a discouraging message to other potentially wayward states. 
The initial move to define March 29 2019 in law as ""exit day"" was designed to ease pressure on the government from Brexiteers who fear slow negotiations and opposition to the divorce could cause delays.
The government has not confirmed it will accept the compromise plan - which represents a watering-down of its original intention - but has said it will consider its response and remains open to changes that will improve the legislation.
However, ministers have limited room to maneuver with over 40 Conservative lawmakers signed up to the proposal - more than enough to defeat May if opposition parties also back it.
""It would be foolhardy to make assumptions either about the votes of colleagues or about the decisions of government. But I am cautiously optimistic that the government will accept my amendments and that they will carry,"" said Oliver Letwin, the former minister responsible for brokering the compromise. 

Wednesday's debate is the last in the current stage of the legislating process but the bill will receive further scrutiny in both chambers of parliament over the coming months before it is finally approved.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday urged a New York jury to find Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey's majority state-owned Halkbank, guilty of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions, while Atilla's lawyers said he was a ""blameless pawn.""
The closing arguments in Manhattan federal court capped off a three-week trial that has strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey.
""This is a case about lies,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Lockard told the jury, saying Atilla lied to U.S. authorities that Halkbank was complying with sanctions.
Halkbank has denied involvement in illegal activities.
Lockard pointed to the testimony of Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who was charged in the case but pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecutors.
Zarrab testified that Atilla helped design fraudulent gold and food transactions that allowed Iran to spend its oil and gas revenues abroad, including through U.S. financial institutions, defying U.S. sanctions.
Atilla denied conspiring with Zarrab while testifying in his own defense during the trial.
Lockard said Zarrab's testimony was supported by other evidence, including an April 2013 message in which Halkbank's then-general manager, Suleyman Aslan, asked Zarrab if he had any problem with ""the method proposed by Hakan Atilla.""
Attempts by Reuters to reach Aslan for comment have been unsuccessful.
Lockard also said that Zarrab's scheme continued even as Aslan and others at the bank were replaced.
""The only person who's been involved at every step is Mr. Atilla,"" he said.
Atilla's lawyer, Victor Rocco, said Zarrab was not credible. He noted that Zarrab had hired prominent American lawyers to try to negotiate his release through diplomacy, and said he decided to turn on Atilla after that failed.
""Hakan Atilla is a blameless pawn, collateral damage in a story that belongs in The Twilight Zone, not in American court,"" Rocco said.
Rocco argued that evidence pointed to Atilla's innocence. He cited a call in which Zarrab told one of his employees that Atilla ""threw a wrench in the gears,"" but that Zarrab resolved the problem by going to Aslan.
Rocco also pointed to an April 2013 call in which Zarrab said he lied to Atilla, even though Zarrab had said Atilla was already in on the scheme by October 2012.
""If in October of 2012 Hakan Atilla was part of a conspiracy with Zarrab, why is Zarrab lying to him six months later?"" Rocco asked.
U.S. prosecutors charged nine people in the criminal case, though only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, have been arrested by U.S. authorities.
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman is expected to instruct the jury Wednesday morning, after which jurors will begin deliberating on the case.

1107,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 05:00PM ET</span>",Chile election ends era of female presidents in Latin America,"By Caroline Stauffer and Mitra Taj
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - When Chile's President Michelle Bachelet leaves office in March, it will mark the end of a generation of women leaders in Latin America, leaving the region without a female head of state as it shifts to the right politically.
At the start of this decade, women held the top jobs in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica and Chile, collectively representing about 40 percent of the population in a region better known for its machismo.
But conservative Sebastian Pinera's victory in the second round of Chile's presidential election on Sunday drew that period to a close.
Bachelet was the first of her female counterparts to rise to power in a leftist tide that swept South America during a commodities-fueled economic boom. She served as president from 2006 to 2010 before winning re-election in 2013.
Together with Brazil's Dilma Rousseff and Argentina's Cristina Fernandez, Bachelet embodied the major strides made by women across a region that has passed laws deterring rampant violence against women and set quotas for political participation that have given Latin American women a bigger share of parliamentary seats than in Europe.
But now some worry that progress on women's rights could stall.
""We're seeing a shift to conservative politics that is questioning the advances of the last 15 to 20 years,"" said Eugenia Piza-Lopez, who works on gender in Latin America for the United Nations Development Program.
Conservative groups are targeting gender equality across the region, said Piza-Lopez. Protests over curriculums aimed at empowering girls to rise above traditional female duties have helped topple education ministers in Peru and Colombia.
During campaigning in Chile, Pinera voiced concerns about the country's declining birth rate as he took aim at changes to abortion laws under Bachelet, who loosened a strict ban to make exemptions for rape, unviable fetuses and the risk of death during labor.
While there is no definitive study showing female leaders do more to advance women's wellbeing than men, Farida Jalalzai, a political scientist at Oklahoma State University, said her research on Latin America suggested that was the case.
""Dilma (Rousseff), for example, would take a policy that was already in existence and reframe it in ways that made it clear it was a women's issue, whether it was poverty or home ownership,"" Jalalzai said.
Piza-Lopez said Fernandez, who ruled Argentina from 2007 to 2015, helped narrow the gender poverty gap with her generous spending on social programs aimed at women. 
Stella Zervoudaki, head of the European Union delegation in Chile, pointed to Bachelet's creation of a ministry of women, her programs to finance companies led by women and work for marriage equality.
""I'm not sure this would have been as forceful without a woman leader,"" Zervoudaki said. She said Bachelet had pressed for a chapter on gender in an update to an EU trade agreement that called for progress on equal pay, fair maternity leave and better access to technology for women.
CORRUPTION SCANDALS
In a region where corruption scandals often hurt presidencies, South America's women leaders were no honorable exception.
Rousseff was removed from office in 2016 on accusations she manipulated budget laws and was later charged with graft. A judge in Argentina has charged Fernandez, now a senator who is also under investigation for graft, with treason for allegedly covering up Iran's possible role in a 1994 bombing.
Both women deny wrongdoing. Rousseff recently visited Fernandez in her apartment in Buenos Aires to commiserate, and has said sexism played a role in her own impeachment.
Brazil's conservative President Michel Temer appointed an all-male cabinet after Rousseff's exit. She was voted out after lawmakers held up signs saying ""bye, dear!""
In contrast, Pinera said on Monday he would announce the ""women and men"" who would form his team, a sign he would create a balanced cabinet, perhaps taking his lead from Bachelet, whose first cabinet was exactly half men and half women.
Bachelet's own approval ratings were hit hard after her daughter-in-law was accused of using political ties to get access to a bank loan.
SIX ELECTIONS
Although Latin America is poised to hold six elections next year - in Costa Rica, Paraguay, Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico and Brazil - the chances for another female president are slim.
In Mexico, leftist frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has repeatedly referred to his rival Margarita Zavala as ""the wife of Felipe Calderon"" - her husband and a former president - angering her supporters, who charge it is sexist. She is polling around 10 percent of votes.
In Brazil, Marina Silva, who has lost the presidency twice, recently joined the race and lies third in most polls.
A number of female candidates are expected to compete in Colombia's presidential race, though none is expected to win. Maria Eugenia Vidal, the governor of Argentina's largest province of Buenos Aires, is the country's most popular politician, according to several polls, but is not expected to run for president in 2019.
Still-rampant sexism and sexual harassment in politics remain deterrents to women who want to rise to the top, said Mercedes Araoz, Peru's Prime Minister and a former presidential candidate. 

""I've been a victim (of sexual harassment),"" Araoz recently told journalists. ""It's important to realize how discouraging it can be.""

The mansion - in Socialist hands since 1980, just before Francois Mitterrand became the party's first leader to rise to the presidency - will be sold to French property developer Apsys. 
The center-left party won just 29 parliamentary seats in a legislative election this year, down from 280 previously in the 577-strong chamber, causing it to lose state subsidies. 
The Socialists also suffered an electoral drubbing in the presidential race in May, as centrist newcomer Emmanuel Macron took power, blowing apart France's traditional two-party system in the process. 
The center-left party's candidate limped into fifth place, after Francois Hollande, whose election five years earlier was hailed as a new dawn for French Socialists, did not seek re-election following an unpopular presidency.
Center-left parties across Europe have struggled to win back voters in the wake of recessions and a global banking crisis that have spawned newer political parties and increased support in some cases for more radical forces on the left.
Macron's upstart Republic on the Move party has now the largest number of seats in the lower house of parliament. 
Funds from the sale of the Socialist headquarters will partly be used for future campaigns. The party said it would not have to move out until next September. 
The Socialists are currently being managed by a committee and the party is due to hold a leadership contest next April.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany should learn from security shortcomings exposed by a deadly truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market a year ago and increase aid to survivors and families of victims, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday.
Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, hijacked a truck on Dec. 19, 2016, killed the driver and then plowed it into a crowded market place, killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others.
Merkel spoke on the anniversary of the attack at the unveiling of a memorial on the Breitscheidplatz square where it took place. The ceremony came amid criticism from families of the victims and from survivors about the government's handling of the incident.
""Today is a day for mourning but also a day for the determination of making things better that did not work (in the past),"" Merkel said.
Merkel, who met victims and relatives of those killed at the chancellery on Monday, said she would meet the group again in a few months to provide updates on lessons learned from Germany's worst Islamist militant attack.
Hundreds of people gathered with candles at the site after a church service at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church that was also attended by Berlin mayor Michael Mueller and former German President Joachim Gauck. 
The church bells tolled for 12 minutes, one minute for each of those killed, at 8:02 p.m., the precise time when the attack occurred.
The normally crowded Christmas market at the plaza remained closed all day on Tuesday.
The memorial shows the names of the victims carved on the steps of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church near the scene of the attack. A long crack filled with metal and gold alloy runs through the steps and the Christmas market. 
President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said support for the victims of the attack came late and had not been sufficient.
""It's bitter that the state could not protect your relatives,"" Steinmeier said addressing the families.
German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said the government had not been well enough prepared to avert such an attack.
""We can only apologize for the victims and the surviving relatives,"" Maas wrote in an article published in Tagesspiegel paper on Tuesday. 
The German government has agreed to increase compensation payments to victims' families and survivors after complaints that the 10,000 euros ($11,820) compensation the German government had offered was insufficient, Kurt Beck, an advocate for victims and survivors said on Tuesday.
Dozens of protesters rallied near the Breitscheidplatz, carrying signs expressing solidarity with the victims but warning against turning the tragic event into a rallying cry against Islam, as some far-right groups have sought to do.

""I'm angry about the right wing's efforts to instrumentalize this,"" said Martin Pfaff, who organized the event. ""That's why we're making clear that racism cannot be an answer to terrorism.""

A German court on Nov. 29 ruled that Oskar Groening, known as the ""bookkeeper of Auschwitz"", was fit to go to prison and rejected his plea for the sentence to be suspended.
Groening, who is physically frail, was sentenced to four years in prison in 2015, in one of the last cases against a surviving Nazi, but he has not been incarcerated since then because of the legal argument about his health.
Broadcaster ntv quoted Groening's lawyer, Hans Holtermann, as saying that the latest legal challenge asked Germany's constitutional court to determine if imprisonment would violate Groening's right to life, given his medical condition.
He told the broadcaster that an expert had concluded that Groening was not fit enough to be imprisoned.
Holtermann could not be immediately reached for comment.
The Nov. 29 court ruling had said that enforcing Groening's sentence would not breach his fundamental rights and added that special needs related to his age could be addressed in prison.
Groening, a former Nazi SS officer, did not kill anyone himself while working at the camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. But a court convicted him in 2015 of aiding and abetting mass murder there through various actions, including by sorting banknotes seized from arriving Jews.
He admitted during his trial that he was morally guilty and said he had been an enthusiastic Nazi when he was sent to work at Auschwitz in 1942 at the age of 21.

Some six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust carried out under Adolf Hitler.

MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - Kenyan police raided an Islamic school on Tuesday, arresting two teachers and taking around 100 children into protective custody in what police described as a counter-terrorism operation involving foreign law-enforcement agencies. 
Police described the school in Likoni, south of the port city of Mombasa, as a center for indoctrinating young men and children with militant ideology. 
""The place has been monitored for a long time,"" said a police source who asked not to be named. The police spokesman was unavailable for comment. 
Kenya is mostly Christian but has a large Islamic population. It is relatively free from religious tension, although it has suffered repeated deadly attacks from Somali Islamist extremists. 
A local Muslim leader confirmed the operation but said there was no evidence of any illegal activity.
""A group of local and foreign police officers raided the madrasa (Islamic school) where the pupils were sleeping and took them with their teachers,"" Sheikh Hassan Omar, a senior official in the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya (CIPK), an umbrella body for Kenya's religious leaders, told journalists in Mombasa.
""There are nearly 100 pupils and four madrasa teachers who have been arrested and detained at police headquarters and nobody is telling us what crime they have committed."" 
It was not immediately clear why the police and CIPK gave different totals for the number of teachers arrested.
Omar said the officers asked for identification documents, including birth certificates from the children, and their teachers before they took them.
Another police source told Reuters the operation was sparked by intelligence information that both foreign and local children were being indoctrinated in the school.
""We have been assisted by some friends from outside with information and monitoring of this madrasa. That is normal with such cross-border criminal issues,"" said another senior police officer, who also asked not to be named. He did say which foreign country was involved in the raid.
""They (the children) will be released one by one after we interrogate and clear them,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has an 11-percentage point lead ahead of next year's presidential election, according to an opinion poll taken in the last week, giving him a sizeable advantage even after new rivals formally entered the race.
The former Mexico City mayor Lopez Obrador has vowed to combat inequality and corruption, but some international investors are concerned about suggestions that he might reverse parts of the government's 2013-14 energy legislation.
The poll, carried out and financed by Mexican public opinion firm Parametria, was provided exclusively to Reuters ahead of wider publication later on Tuesday. It was taken between Dec.14 and Dec.17.
It found that 31 percent of those asked who they would vote for if the election were today would choose Lopez Obrador, followed by former Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade, seeking nomination for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), on 20 percent.
Ricardo Anaya, former leader of the center-right National Action Party (PAN) was third on 19 percent, the poll said. Anaya resigned this month to pursue the presidency in an alliance with the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD).
The Parametria poll also included potential independent candidates, former first lady Margarita Zavala and Nuevo Leon Governor Jaime Rodriguez, giving them 10 percent and 2 percent respectively.
Of the 800 people surveyed, 18 percent answered none of the listed candidates, did not know or did not reply.
The Parametria poll is the first conducted since Lopez Obrador joined up with the conservative Social Encounter Party (PES), sparking worries among his progressive backers. 
But the controversial alliance appears to have had little immediate effect on his advantage.
The poll shows Lopez Obrador slightly further ahead than a survey by Mexican newspaper El Universal published in early December that gave him an eight-point lead.
A survey by pollster Mitofsky, also from early December, showed a much closer race, with Lopez Obrador on 23 percent of the vote, followed by Anaya with 20 percent support and Meade with 19 percent.
    Lopez Obrador unveiled his planned cabinet last week, including tapping a moderate U.S.-trained economist for finance minister and splitting the posts evenly between women and men.
    The Parametria poll was conducted face-to-face and has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

    Mexican political parties have until March to formally register candidates.

Caruana Galizia died in the powerful blast as she was driving near her home in the village of Bidnija on Oct. 16 -- a killing that appalled Europe and raised questions about the rule of law on the tiny Mediterranean island.
Brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio, and Vince Muscat were arrested earlier this month in connection with the murder. The three men, who were known to police, have denied any wrongdoing.
Police started laying out their evidence against the trio to a Malta court which will decide whether to order a trial.
One of the chief investigators, Keith Arnaud, described how a team from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, brought in by the Malta government to help solve the crime, had focused on a phone number which received a text message at the time of the explosion in Bidnija.
Police say the number was not attached to a mobile phone but to a circuit board used in remote-control devices. The appliance was switched on at 2 a.m. local time in Bidnija on the day of the explosion and went off the grid at the time of the blast. 
Part of the circuit board was later found in the wreckage of the car.
Cell phone data suggested the device was triggered by a call from off the coast. CCTV video showed a boat owned by the Degiorgio brothers putting to sea at around 8 a.m. on the day of the killing. It was later seen still at sea at 2.50 p.m. and was idling at the time of the explosion before returning to harbor. 
The three suspects had never been the target of any of Caruana Galizia's often fierce blogs, leading to questions over their possible motive. The blogger's family say the people who ordered the killing remain at large.
Arnaud revealed that police had already been tapping the phone of George Degiorgio at the time of the murder and had heard him asking two separate people to top up the credit of a mobile phone number on the morning of the blast.
He did not go into further details, but local media have reported that the same number might have triggered the bomb.
Arnaud was the first person called to testify in the pre-trial hearing, which has been delayed twice over the past week after the initial two magistrates assigned to the case recused themselves.
A third magistrate, Claire Stafrace Zammit, rejected calls by the defense for her also to abstain from the case because Caruana Galizia had once praised her husband. She dismissed the request as frivolous.

The hearing will resume on Wednesday.

UNITED NATIONS/GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations will propose to Syria's warring parties a timeline for elections and guidance on constitutional reform in a bid to revive stalled peace talks, mediator Staffan de Mistura told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.
The Council launched the peace process two years ago with instructions to negotiate new governance for Syria, U.N.-supervised elections and constitutional reform. But the eighth round ended last week with no dialogue between the two sides.
The U.N. could make recommendations on a timeline to broker elections for all Syrians including refugees and internally displaced people because only such a process would be seen as legitimate by ordinary Syrians, de Mistura said. 
It could also help to guide constitutional reform and help establish a constitutional commission and a national dialogue body, with the Syrian people solely responsible for writing and approving a new constitution. 
""The time has come for the U.N. to provide some specific elaborations ... and therefore stimulate a wider conversation,"" he said. ""The U.N. has provided electoral assistance to a majority of U.N. member states ... so we do have experience.""
""These propositions are advanced in good faith by the U.N. in order to promote fresh thinking in all quarters,"" he said. 
He said the reform process would need the backing of parties in the Geneva talks and suggested they had already signed up to the overarching principles and he planned to set out his ideas early in 2018, when a ninth round of talks is penciled in. 
""I cannot hide my disappointment,"" de Mistura said over the failed eighth round.
He said representatives of President Bashar al-Assad had also introduced a new condition by insisting that there could be no political movement until all sovereignty was restored and terrorism defeated in all Syrian territory.
That suggested any reforms would be ""put aside for a long period"", which was very worrying, said de Mistura, a 47-year U.N. veteran known for his optimism and reliance on creative ideas to resolve crises that may appear intractable.

With fresh thinking, the U.N. mandate could be implemented, ""even in the context of the realpolitik of 2018"", he said.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - A Canadian jury on Tuesday found a man guilty of possessing an explosive substance and acquitted his partner of all charges in a case in which the government alleged they were trying to build a bomb with ingredients that included Christmas lights.
The Montreal couple, El Mahdi Jamali and Sabrine Djermane, were charged with trying to leave Canada to join a terrorist group, possessing an explosive substance, facilitating a terrorist activity and committing an offense for a terrorist group. 
They have been detained since they were arrested in 2015, when they were teenagers. 
Jamali, now 20, was found guilty of explosives possession and acquitted on other charges. He faces up to five years in prison.
Djermane, 21, was acquitted of all charges.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police found a handwritten bomb-making recipe copied from a propaganda magazine published by al Qaeda militants when the police searched a condo rented by the couple in 2015, according to prosecutors.
The two were arrested at a time when international security forces reported that college students from Montreal were among waves of young people heading to Syria to join Islamic State militants.
RCMP began investigating the couple after receiving a tip, and arrested them days later.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican prosecutors are failing to systematically punish money launderers and tax authorities are too lax with potential drug money fronts such as real estate and luxury goods firms, according to a draft report on Mexico's efforts to fight illicit finance.
The report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international organization that sets global standards for fighting illicit finance, highlights the tiny dents made by Mexican prosecutors in the financial networks of drug gangs and corrupt officials.
Mexico has been slipping in convictions, data in the report shows. The country already lagged regional peers such as Colombia and Brazil, both of which have made strides in setting up independent prosecutors.
""Money laundering is not investigated and prosecuted in a proactive and systematic fashion,"" said the draft of the report, sections of which were seen by Reuters. Its publication is set for early January.
The finance ministry and attorney general's office did not respond to a request for comment for this story. 
Mexico is the top source of illegal drugs to the United States and both countries' authorities have been criticized by civil society groups for leaving drug gang finances largely intact. 
The more than 200-page report commends efforts to clean up the Mexican banking sector after U.S. investigations in the mid-2000s showed global banks processed billions of dollars in drug gang cash. Officials say tighter regulations flushed much illicit money from the banking system.
However, the report says Mexican tax authorities did not do enough to monitor businesses outside the financial sector used for money laundering, such as real estate.
Since 2014, Mexico's tax authority has had powers to audit more than 64,000 businesses considered high risk.
But it has only allocated 16 people to probe those companies and since 2014 they have audited just 118, or less than 0.2 percent, the draft noted.
The lack of a national registry of shareholders has made it difficult for authorities to follow the complex money trails used by drug gangs and corrupt officials to hide ill-gotten funds, the report said. 
The draft seen by Reuters was hammered out at closed-door meetings in Buenos Aires last month. 
An earlier draft prepared by a team of officials led by the International Monetary Fund was harsher, according to two sources familiar with the issue. The IMF did not respond to a request for comment.
The earlier draft noted poor co-ordination between financial officials, prosecutors and security forces within Mexico, and flagged weak co-operation with the United States, the sources said. However, Mexican officials convinced the assessors to tone down the report, they said.
During the Argentina meetings, Mexico's government said in a statement that the FATF report identified areas for improvement on its efforts to combat money laundering but ""affirms that there is good co-ordination between authorities and extensive international co-operation.""
LOW SEIZURES, FEW CONVICTIONS 
Mexico is making little headway in seizing illicit cash, according to the government's own estimates.
Data in the report provided by Mexico shows the country seized just $32.5 million in 2016. That represents less than 0.1 percent of the $58.5 billion of illicit revenues the government estimates is generated by organized crime annually.
Also, fewer investigations than in previous years were based on information from the financial intelligence unit (FIU), a part of the finance ministry, the report notes. 
Setting up sophisticated FIUs that target major operations is key to effectively fighting money laundering, compared to cases that stem from routine police and customs busts.
Yet only 8 percent of investigations in Mexico last year were based on FIU reports, according to data in the FATF report. That is down from around an average of 15 percent in recent years. 
Mexico is at the bottom of major countries in terms of its efforts to fight money laundering, said Edgardo Buscaglia, an expert on organized crime at Columbia University.
While convictions based on FIU data have grown more than fourfold in Brazil and nearly sixfold in Colombia since 2000, Mexico has seen the number drop, according to data compiled by Buscaglia that runs through 2015. 

""The financial intelligence unit is not engaging the criminal networks,"" Buscaglia said. ""They are not passing the right kind of data.""

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa gave his clearest signal yet on Tuesday that he would appoint as vice president the military leader who led the de facto coup that ousted former leader Robert Mugabe last month.
At a ceremony marking Constantino Chiwenga's retirement and handover of the military reins to Phillip Sibanda at an army barracks near Harare's international airport, Mnangagwa lauded Chiwenga for his consistency and steadfastness.
""I therefore urge you to maintain the same loyalty, robustness and dedication to duty as you move to your next assignment which is quite prominent,"" he said without elaborating.
Mnangagwa said on Friday he would fill the two vice presidential posts in the following few days. Chiwenga is the top contender in what is seen as a reward for helping to end Mugabe's 37-year rule. 
Mnangagwa has appointed several senior military officers to his cabinet and the ruling party's executive politburo since he was sworn in as president on Nov. 24 in what some political analysts say reflects the army's consolidation of power since it turned against the 93-year-old Mugabe.
Chris Mutsvangwa, special adviser to the president and the influential leader of the war veterans' association, rejected criticism of the military appointments, saying they were not unique to Zimbabwe. He pointed to the former generals in U.S. President Donald Trump's cabinet.
He also denied a report by the privately owned NewsDay newspaper that he had said the army would play a role in elections due next year.
""It's a lie ... I said there was a team which helped to undo the dynastic tendencies of geriatric Mugabe and his mid-wife (sic),"" he told reporters at his offices in Harare. 
""I promised to the new president that we are going to deliver an electoral victory but that team specifically excludes the army because the army had played a role earlier and because the army is a professional army and does not get involved in election campaigns.""
The elections are due by July 2018 but Mnangagwa has said they may be held sooner than expected.
Mnangagwa told members of his ruling ZANU-PF party on Friday they would have to start fixing the economy if they wanted a chance of winning next year's vote.

The southern African nation's economy collapsed in the latter half of Mugabe's rule, especially after the violent seizures of thousands of white-owned commercial farms.

The former chief executive officer of Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL], Latin America's largest construction firm, was arrested in 2015 during an investigation dubbed Car Wash that exposed billions of dollars in kickbacks to politicians and executives at state-run companies in exchange for inflated contracts.
Odebrecht was set to travel to Sao Paulo to begin his house arrest under electronic surveillance on Tuesday, according to the federal court in Parana.
A representative for the former executive said he remained committed to collaborating with authorities under a leniency deal. 
Odebrecht was first sentenced to 19 years in prison in one of the many cases related to Car Wash. That was reduced to 10 years after he signed a leniency deal last December in exchange for paying a nearly $2 billion fine, admitting guilt and providing evidence to authorities.
He has already served two-and-a-half years in prison. Under the deal, he must serve another two-and-a-half years under house arrest. He will then be permitted to leave his home for work for another two-and-a-half years. He will then be required to do community service for the rest of his 10-year sentence.

Separately Tuesday, Brazil's antitrust watchdog Cade said it was investigating two alleged cartels involved in bidding for Sao Paulo infrastructure projects after receiving information provided by Odebrecht executives.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's right-wing government secured backing from a junior partner for the 2018 budget on Tuesday, defusing a crisis that had threatened to bring down the minority coalition.
The Liberal Alliance (LA), part of the three-way coalition led by Prime Minister Lokke Rasmussen's Liberals, said it would support the budget in parliament and agreed to postpone the negotiations on tax and immigration reforms it wants until January.
The anti-immigrant Danish People's Party (DF), whose support the government needs to pass laws, gave its backing on Dec. 8 for the 2018 budget, but the LA had said it still wanted an agreement on tax cuts.
""I am willing to make another attempt to secure an ambitious tax reform and a new modern immigration policy,"" foreign minister and Liberal Alliance leader Anders Samuelsen said at a press conference. 
The budget will be passed at a parliament vote on Friday, he said.
Failure to secure backing from LA could have forced Rasmussen either to hand power to the Social Democrat-led opposition or call a snap election.
Tax cuts have been on the right-leaning government's wish list for a long time, but pro-welfare DF has been less eager to back that part of the government's policies.
The 2018 budget deal includes among other things increased spending on health and elderly care and on infrastructure.

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 01:20PM ET</span>","U.N. decries Israel's killing of Gaza amputee, Israel denies he was targeted","GENEVA (Reuters) - A senior U.N. official said on Tuesday that Israel's killing of a disabled Palestinian man protesting against U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital was ""incomprehensible"", but Israel said he had not been targeted.
A statement issued by Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said wheelchair-bound Ibrahim Abu Thurayeh was shot in the head by Israeli security forces close to the border fence with Israel on Friday.
But the Israeli military said its own investigation had found that it was not possible to say what had killed Abu Thurayeh and that no live fire had been directed at him during the dispersal of the violent demonstration.
""No live fire was aimed at Abu Thurayeh. It is impossible to determine whether Abu Thurayeh was injured as a result of riot dispersal means, or what caused his death,"" part of the military statement said.
It added that protesters hurled explosive devices and rocks and rolled burning tyres ""with the aim of harming soldiers and destroying security infrastructure"" and that non-lethal riot dispersal means were mainly used, although a few live rounds fired under supervision were aimed ""towards main instigators.""
Zeid said there was nothing to suggest Abu Thurayeh was posing an imminent threat when he was killed and ""the facts gathered so far by my staff in Gaza strongly suggest that the force used against (him) was excessive."" 
""Given his severe disability, which must have been clearly visible to those who shot him, his killing is incomprehensible – a truly shocking and wanton act,"" Zeid's statement said.
The Israeli military statement said ""numerous requests"" for information on Abu Thurayeh's wounds had not been answered and that ""if additional details are received, they will be examined and studied.""
Gaza medical officials said on Friday that Israeli troops had shot dead four people, including Abu Thurayeh, and that 150 others were wounded by live fire during the protests.
Most of the casualties were on the Gaza Strip border. In the West Bank, the Israeli military said about 2,500 Palestinians took part in riots against soldiers and border police officers.
Abu Thurayeh, 29, was a regular at such demonstrations. In media interviews, he had said he had lost both his legs in a 2008 Israeli missile strike in Gaza.
Zeid's statement said the Israeli response had resulted in five people being killed, including three deaths in Gaza, as well as more than 220 injured by live ammunition. 
International law strictly regulates the use of force in the context of protests and demonstrations, and the lethal use of firearms should only be employed as the last resort when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life, Zeid said.
Trump's announcement on Jerusalem infuriated the Arab world and upset Western allies. The status of the city has been one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians for generations.
Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital. Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as the capital of a future independent state of their own.
""These events ... can sadly be traced directly back to the unilateral U.S. announcement on the status of Jerusalem, which breaks international consensus and was dangerously provocative,"" Zeid said, calling for an independent investigation into the casualties.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 01:20PM ET</span>",Three people killed as protests turn violent again in Iraqi Kurdistan,"SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - Three people were killed and more than 80 wounded on Tuesday when Kurdish demonstrators joined a second day of protests against years of austerity and unpaid public sector salaries amid tensions between their region and Baghdad. 
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said later he would take action if any citizen were assaulted in Iraq's northern semi-autonomous Kurdistan region.
About 1,250 protesters, mostly teachers, students, and civil servants, protested in the city of Sulaimaniya.The Sulaimaniya provincial council told Reuters three people were killed during clashes with Kurdish security forces in the town of Ranya. Regional health officials said six people were injured when the crowd was shot at with rubber bullets and sprayed with tear gas by security forces.
Protesters also attacked several offices of the main political parties in Sulaimaniya province on Tuesday. 
Acknowledging that protesters had a ""legitimate right"" to demonstrate, Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) nonetheless said the targeting of government offices and party headquarters in Sulaimaniya province was unacceptable.
""We are concerned with the uncivil actions and the violence used today in a number of cities and towns across Kurdistan,"" a KRG statement said.
It warned that relevant authorities could intervene to prevent further damage after several people were left injured and property was damaged.
Later on Tuesday, Kurdish Asayish security forces raided the offices of Kurdish private broadcast NRT in Sulaimaniya, and took the channel off the air, its head told Reuters. The channel was no longer accessible. 
NRT's chief also said the broadcaster's founder, Shaswar Abdulwahid, was arrested as he landed at Sulaimaniya airport on Tuesday evening. 
Last month, Abdulwahid said he sold the broadcaster after launching a new political opposition movement, the New Generation. He had agitated against September's referendum on Kurdish independence, leading NRT's offices to be attacked by a mob in August. 
At a weekly news conference, Abadi called on the KRG to respect peaceful protests.
""We will not just stand by and watch if citizens are oppressed. The Iraqi citizen is an Iraqi citizen everywhere and if there is an attack or violation against citizens in a way that contradicts the constitution we will punish those responsible,"" Abadi said.
""We want there to be freedom for expression and assembly for citizens in the Kurdistan region.""
Local officials imposed a curfew starting at 7pm (1600 GMT) in several towns including Kifri, Takya and Chamchammal in Sulaimaniya province. In Chamchammal, the curfew will last throughout the day on Wednesday.
ROADS CLOSED
Tension has been high in the region since the central government in Baghdad imposed tough measures when the KRG unilaterally held an independence referendum on Sept. 25 and Kurds voted overwhelmingly to secede.
The move, in defiance of Baghdad, also alarmed neighboring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities.
For the second day, protesters demanded that the KRG quit. 
They set fire to the offices of Kurdish political parties in the towns of Koya, Kifri and Ranya. Officials have closed roads around Sulaimaniya, a Reuters witness said.
Security sources said the road between Darbandikhan and Sulaimaniya, which connects the city to southern towns where there are major protests, has been closed.
On Monday, Kurdish political offices were also set ablaze in Sulaimaniya province, including a building belonging to the ruling Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and one belonging to its coalition partner in government, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).
At least 3,000 Kurdish demonstrators had gathered in Sulaimaniya for the protests on Monday against the KRG.
Stringent economic measures taken after the Baghdad central government slashed funds to the KRG in 2014 when it built its own oil pipeline to Turkey in pursuit of economic independence have led to sporadic protests over unpaid civil servant salaries in the last three years.
After the September referendum, the Iraqi government responded by seizing Kurdish-held Kirkuk and other territory disputed between the Kurds and the central government. It also banned direct flights to Kurdistan and demanded control over border crossings.

SINGAPORE/SEOUL (Reuters) - A series of recent cyber attacks has netted North Korean hackers millions of dollars in virtual currencies like bitcoin, with more attacks expected as international sanctions drive the country to seek new sources of cash, researchers say.
North Korea's government-backed hackers have been blamed for a rising number of cyber attacks, including the so-called WannaCry cyber attack that crippled hospitals, banks and other companies across the globe this year.
Analysts say the explosive growth in the value of bitcoin makes it and other ""cryptocurrencies"" an attractive target for North Korea, which has become increasingly isolated under international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons and missile programs. 
Bitcoin was trading at over $19,104 per bitcoin at one point on Tuesday, up from less than $1,000 at the beginning of 2017, according to Coinmarketcap.com. 
Researchers in South Korea, which hosts some of the world’s busiest virtual currency exchanges and accounts for 15 to 25 percent of world bitcoin trading on any given day, say attacks this year on exchanges like Bithumb, Coinis, and Youbit have the digital fingerprints of hackers from North Korea.
The researchers' findings have not been independently verified.
North Korea has rejected accusations that it has been involved in hacking.
A spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry, which handles North Korean affairs, said on Monday the government was considering ""countermeasures"", including more sanctions, over the cyber attacks.
Representatives of Bithumb and Coinis declined to comment.
On Monday, a Youbit spokeswoman told Reuters the company had not been targeted by North Korean hackers, and on Tuesday the company announced it had suffered another cyber attack that cost it 17 percent of its assets, forcing the exchange to halt operations and file for bankruptcy.
The hackers behind the second attack were not identified, but one cyber security researcher, who said he was not authorized to speak about the matter as it was being investigated, said there were similarities between the Youbit hack reported on Tuesday and the earlier attack on the company, which has been linked to North Korea.
Another researcher, who worked with Youbit after the first hack in April, said the company has since experienced a consistent string of attacks that used malicious code previously used by North Korea.
INFECTED EMAIL
South Korea's intelligence service reported that some 7.6 billion won ($7 million) worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen in those previous attacks on multiple exchanges, according to South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper.
But that amount could now be worth about 90 billion Korean won ($82 million), Moonbeom Park, a researcher at the Korea Internet and Security Agency, told Reuters.
Malicious code used in attacks over the summer was ""virtually identical"" to previous attacks connected to North Korea, he said.
The attacks this year began by targeting the companies themselves, stealing customers' personal information, including names and email addresses, Park said.
Some of those customers were then targeted with so-called spearphishing emails - infected emails designed to look as if they were from South Korea's taxation agency, the Korean National Tax Service, he said.
Other researchers said the attackers had impersonated other official bodies.
The emails told the recipient that the agency was about to conduct a tax investigation of the user. 
An attached document, however, was a Korean-language file infected with a ""Trojan Horse"" program that would exploit a vulnerability in the Hanword Korean-language word processing software to allow the hackers to remotely control the user's computer, Park said.
From there, the attackers would access the user's bitcoin wallet either on the computer, or on the bitcoin exchange's server, he said. Other researchers said the exchanges were also attacked using fake email accounts.
Cristiana Brafman Kittner, principal analyst at the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said she could not confirm whether North Korea had actually stolen any virtual currencies, but said hackers linked to it had targeted ""multiple exchanges"" over the past six to nine months.
""We believe that some of the criminal activity we are observing originating from North Korea is a result of the regime looking for alternative sources of revenue,"" she said.

""North Korean cyber threat actors present an immediate risk to the financial services sector worldwide.""

Charles Duchaine, head of the new AFA anti-graft body, told Reuters last week that the current law, brought in just a year ago, had to be re-drawn as it gave him almost no powers to pursue foreign companies.
He repeated the point at a conference on Tuesday. But Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet responded at the same event that she wanted to see how the ""Sapin 2"" legislation worked on the ground before making any alterations.
""We're not going to rewrite the law every morning,"" she said.
Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin told the conference: ""It is important that the agency first gets on with its work.""
Under the law, the AFA agency can only target public bodies and companies with more than 500 employees and turnover of above 100 million euros ($118.19 million), or subsidiaries of foreign companies that are headquartered in France and meet those two criteria.
AFA's work has got off to a slow start. It was created by the Sapin 2 act a year ago but only launched its first investigations in October. The ministers said there was funding to increase the number of AFA agents to 70 from 50.

About 650,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from Rakhine state and sought refuge in neighboring Bangladesh in recent months after a violent crackdown there by Myanmar security forces in response to attacks by militants. 
    Rights monitors have accused troops of atrocities, including killings, mass rape and arson during the crackdown. The United States has said it amounted to ""ethnic cleansing"".
The Myanmar military has said its own internal investigation had exonerated security forces of all accusations of atrocities.
A team including police, a local administrator, judge and doctor had examined the grave site, at the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe, on Tuesday and discovered 10 unidentified bodies, Myawady said.
""This group is continuing the process of investigation to uncover the truth,"" the report said. Military officials were not immediately available for further comment.
The discovery of a mass grave near a cemetery in the village was announced in a statement on the army commander-in-chief's official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Monday.
The village is in Maungdaw township, one of the areas worst affected by the violence that has prompted the United Nations' top human rights official to allege that Myanmar's security forces may have committed genocide against the Rohingya.
    Myanmar's armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern Rakhine, where many of the stateless Muslim minority lived, after Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25.
    Myanmar's civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya.
    The civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. It has promised to investigate allegations of abuses in Rakhine if it is given evidence.

The unprecedented appointment of a Communist lawmaker - Zdenek Ondracek - as chairman of parliament's General Inspection of Security Forces commission appeared to be part of complex maneuvering by billionaire businessman Andrej Babis and his ANO party to get backing for a minority government.
The ANO has 78 seats in the new 200-seat lower house. New Prime Minister Babis is seeking support or at least acquiescence from among lawmakers of the other eight parties in parliament. 
The far-left Communists with 15 seats, and far-right, anti-European Union SPD party with 22, have lent support in initial parliamentary votes in return for committee posts, but no deal has been announced on their backing for an ANO cabinet. 
The secret ballot vote on Tuesday to appoint Ondracek was the first time the Communist party has gained such a post in the nearly three decades since the fall of communism.
In 1989 his police unit used water cannon, clubs and dogs to disperse anti-regime protests. The demonstrations eventually led to the peaceful overthrow of Communist dictatorship in what became known as the Velvet Revolution.
A video from 1989, posted on YouTube, shows Ondracek defending police actions in an interview with state television.
His appointment drew criticism from some political leaders on Tuesday.
""It is sad that it happened only one day after we remembered the anniversary of (late president and leading anti-Communist dissident) Vaclav Havel's passing. The times have changed,"" said Vit Rakusan, deputy chairman of the Mayors and Independents party.
Communist party deputy chairman Jiri Dolejs, however, defended the appointment.
""Police work should be scrutinized by those who understand it,"" he told reporters.
The Communist party, which suffered the worst election result in its nearly 100-year history in October, is the only faction so far to say it could back the ANO government. 
Direct or indirect support might also come from the SPD party of Czech-Japanese businessman Tomio Okamura.
Other parties have shunned Babis, mainly due to pending police charges against him over allegations he concealed his company's ownership of a farm and conference center a decade ago to illegally obtain a 2 million-euro European Union subsidy.
Babis denies wrongdoing. 
Babis, who was appointed prime minister this month and whose cabinet took power last week, has until mid-January to win a confidence vote. President Milos Zeman has said Babis will get a second try if his first attempt to form a government fails.

The 65,000-tonne ship is hailed as Britain's most advanced military vessel and was only commissioned by the queen two weeks ago but it has a problem with a shaft seal that was identified during sea trials, the MoD said.
""Sea trials are precisely for finding manageable teething problems like this and rectifying them,"" a Royal Navy spokesman said. 
""Repairs under contract are already underway alongside in Portsmouth and the sea trials will take place as planned in the New Year, when we will continue to rigorously test the ship before she enters service.""
The Sun newspaper reported that the 280-metre (920-foot) warship, the nation's future flagship vessel, was letting in 200 liters of water every hour and the fix would cost millions of pounds.
A defense source said the navy was aware that the ship, which took eight years to build, had an issue when it was handed over by manufacturers and the Sun said the builders would have to foot the repair bill.
The Aircraft Carrier Alliance - a consortium including British engineering companies BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Babcock (L:BAB), and the UK division of France's  Thales  (PA:TCFP) - built the Queen Elizabeth and its sister aircraft carrier, the HMS Prince of Wales, as apart of a 6.2 billion pound project.
""It's normal practice for a volume of work and defect resolution to continue following vessel acceptance,"" BAE Systems said in a statement. ""This will be completed prior to the nation’s flagship re-commencing her program at sea in 2018.""
BAE said the issue would take just a couple of days to fix with no need for the ship to be taken into a dry dock.
Chris Parry, a former senior Royal Navy officer, said all ships took on water. 
""That's why you have pumps,"" he told Sky News. ""When you get a brand new car not everything's perfect, you have to send it back to the garage to get a few things tweaked. This is exactly in that bracket.""
Also on Tuesday, parliament's defense committee raised questions about the procurement of the F-35 fighter jets from a consortium led by  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) which will eventually operate from the Queen Elizabeth.
The committee said there had been an ""unacceptable lack of transparency"" about the program and the MoD had failed to provide details of the full cost of each aircraft which one newspaper had estimated could be as much as 155 million pounds.
""We strongly refute any suggestion of a lack of transparency in the F-35 program,"" an MOD spokesman said. 
""The program remains on track, on time, within costs and not only offers our military the world’s most advanced fighter jet but will support over 24,000 British jobs and is very much clear for take-off.""

When the aircraft carrier was commissioned, British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""Our new aircraft carrier is the epitome of British design and dexterity, at the core of our efforts to build an Armed Forces fit for the future.""

MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Germany's defense minister said on Tuesday she wanted to boost the German presence in Afghanistan, in the first public indication that Berlin could accept a U.S. call for more soldiers to help reverse territorial gains by Taliban insurgents.
Germany currently has 980 soldiers stationed in the Hindu Kush mountains as part of a NATO mission to train Afghan security forces, the second biggest national contingent after the United States. 
""The soldiers, and especially the trainers, are telling me: We have enough trainers but we could do significantly more if we had better protective components, more security personnel,"" Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said during a visit to the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
Von der Leyen added that the German parliament would have to approve any additional deployments.
The minister is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and has said she hopes to retain her job in a new coalition government currently being negotiated.
Merkel hopes to forge another 'grand coalition' with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) like the one that has led Germany for the past four years. The SPD is generally more cautious about defense spending and sending German troops abroad. 
U.S. President Donald Trump in August authorized an increase in U.S. troops to train Afghan security forces and carry out counter-terrorism operations, hoping to reverse gains by Taliban insurgents and compel them to agree to peace talks.
On Monday von der Leyen criticized the rapid reduction in forces since the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) wound up in Afghanistan in 2014, and she called for a longer-term commitment in the Hindu Kush mountains.
At the peak of the ISAF mission around 150,000 foreign soldiers were deployed in the Hindu Kush. There are now around 17,000, of whom 10,000 are Americans.
Germany increased the upper limit to its Afghanistan mandate to 980 soldiers from 850 in 2016, at a time when the United States and most other countries were reducing their forces.
Von der Leyen called for negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, saying the Afghan security forces could ""apply pressure"" to those Taliban who were ready to negotiate.
""Only that will lead to success in the long-term,"" she added.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 11:01AM ET</span>","In Bolivia's bellwether city, anger at Morales grows","By Caroline Stauffer and Daniel Ramos
EL ALTO, Bolivia (Reuters) - In El Alto, a former shantytown high in the Andes that has mushroomed into Bolivia's second-largest city, students and professors are growing disenchanted with Evo Morales, the leftist president their protests helped put in power a decade ago.
A sprawling settlement of nearly 1 million people on Bolivia's dusty Altiplano plateau, El Alto is a larger and more politically radical extension of the capital La Paz, which sits hundreds of meters below in a canyon.
An uprising here in 2003 over the use of revenues from the poor South American nation's natural gas reserves helped force the resignation of U.S.-backed President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. Some 60 residents were killed in the upheaval.
The protests were led in part from the campus of El Alto's public university UPEA and opened the way for Morales to take power as Bolivia's first indigenous president three years later.
Now, students and teachers feel forgotten. Demonstrations, some violent, have broken out in recent weeks over what teachers and students call insufficient funding for the school, a potential obstacle in Morales' plan to win a fourth term in 2019.
""The government has a pending debt,"" said Ramiro Limachi Apaza, director of UPEA'S communications department and an El Alto resident who protested alongside Morales in 2003 in the so-called ""gas wars.""
Morales fulfilled protesters' demands to nationalize the gas industry after taking office in 2006, promising to spread natural resource wealth in the country of more than 10 million, long one of Latin America's poorest. Bolivia's economy grew and thousands of Aymara peasants moved to El Alto.
While El Alto generally remains poor, some immigrants became wealthy merchants, building glamorous, colorful homes known as ""cholets"" and hosting lavish parties. Lines of cable cars, inaugurated by Morales, whisk Bolivians between El Alto and La Paz, above the dizzying mountain traffic. 
Yet Limachi said the public university, which charges students next to nothing, has been unable to pay its teachers for three months.
Morales' administration, one of Latin America's few remaining hard-line leftist governments after the region turned to the right in recent years, says it increased spending on education by 25 percent since 2006. It questions UPEA's use of its funding and the number of students enrolled.
Due to its history, the recent protests at UPEA have drawn national attention, especially as they coincided with a widely criticized court decision in late November allowing Morales to run for a fourth turn.
Bolivia's constitutional court, padded with members of Morales MAS party, argued term limits violate human rights - defying the result of a referendum last year in which 51 percent of Bolivians said they opposed Morales running again.
CREEPING DISSENT
The ruling was criticized by the United States and raised eyebrows in urban areas across Bolivia where support for Morales is weakening. Mining communities, coca farmers and rural villages generally still support him.
Across the sprawling city of El Alto, where new homes are being built every day, discontent had been creeping up for some time. Since 2015, the city has had an opposition mayor.
""It's quite disturbing that our demands are not being listened to,"" said Celia Quecana, a UPEA sociology student dressed in a traditional Aymara pollera, a flowing skirt worn in the Andes. She said that Bolivia's constitution guarantees funding for public universities.
""There's a lot of discontent that democracy, in the form of the Feb. 21 (2016) referendum, has not been respected,"" she said at the university, where trash had not been collected nor bathrooms cleaned for days.
In judicial elections on Dec. 3, nearly 54 percent of Bolivians spoiled their ballots rather than voting, as a means of protesting against Morales. ""Vote null"" graffiti remains scrawled across walls in El Alto and La Paz. 
As El Alto has grown, so has the number of students studying at UPEA, the basis for the university's dispute with the government. UPEA says it now has 47,000 students, double the 2011 enrollment when the amount of funding it receives was determined. 
For Diego von Vacano, a Bolivian political scientist at Yale University, the UPEA protests have legitimate roots and touch on a major problem for Morales.
""The government did not invest in education,"" Vacano said. ""El Alto is one of the most radical areas of Bolivia. A government can quickly fall if it does not get the support of El Alto."" 
The United Nations says Bolivia spent about 7 percent of its gross domestic product on education in 2014, its most recent data, a percentage that is high for Latin America, although one that had not changed much over the past decade. 
El Alto's explosive growth coincided with the end of a commodities boom felt in Bolivia through lower gas prices, which have halved since 2006. Bolivia's gas production peaked at an average 59.6 million cubic meters per day in 2014 and has fallen for the past two years, according to the government. 

""The gas issue is incredibly important, it affects everything. We had received an impressive amount of money, but it's gone down for everyone,"" said Nelson Vila, a UPEA professor who was hospitalized after clashes with police in November.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 10:50AM ET</span>",Ramaphosa's 'poisoned chalice': new ANC leader may struggle to reform South Africa,"By Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - When Cyril Ramaphosa won the tight vote to become the new leader of the African National Congress on Monday after years of near-misses, his loyal supporters jumped to their feet, pumping their fists and cheering.
But as the results for other top positions emerged, the cheers quickly evaporated, as it became clear that ANC officials close to President Jacob Zuma would still control important levers of the ruling party.
Ramaphosa, who has served as South Africa's deputy president under Zuma since 2014, narrowly defeated former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Zuma's ex-wife and preferred successor, in the race for the ANC's top job. 
Ramaphosa is now within touching distance of becoming president, fulfilling a lifelong ambition for the man Nelson Mandela wanted to be his heir after the end of apartheid in 1994.
Markets rallied on Ramaphosa's victory, as investors piled into rand assets on hopes Ramaphosa would follow through on campaign promises to uproot corruption and rekindle economic growth.
But the mood in the conference hall in Johannesburg where the ANC's new ""top six"" most powerful officials were announced told a different story.
The Ramaphosa camp fumed that Zuma loyalists David Mabuza and Ace Magashule were named ANC deputy president and secretary general, while Dlamini-Zuma backer Jessie Duarte kept her position as deputy secretary general. 
""We started on a high note, but as we went down the top six we started having problems. The thing is that Cyril has to work with this collective,"" said Sinenhlanhla Xaba, an ANC member from the Soweto township.
On Tuesday supporters of Senzo Mchunu, Ramaphosa's pick for secretary general, disputed the vote count that saw him lose out to Magashule, a sign that Ramaphosa's team was trying to gain greater control of the upper echelons of the ANC.
Analysts say the slim margin of Ramaphosa's victory will help keep the ANC together but will make it difficult for Ramaphosa to pursue a pro-growth policy agenda, as the ANC faction that backed Dlamini-Zuma and puts greater emphasis on wealth redistribution will wield considerable influence.
Any attempt to remove the 75-year-old Zuma as South African president before his second term ends in 2019 - something which ANC officials close to Ramaphosa have called for - will also be complicated by Zuma allies retaining senior posts.
Zuma's scandal-plagued time in office has badly tarnished the ANC's image both at home and abroad and has seen economic growth slow to a near-standstill. 
Zuma has survived several votes of no confidence because he controls large sections of the ANC through his use of political patronage.
Lukhona Mnguni, a political analyst at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said the ANC leadership outcome was a ""poisoned chalice"" for Ramaphosa because officials aligned with Zuma would constrain his room for maneuver.
""Ramaphosa's team know this was no victory. He didn't get the people he wanted and hopes for recalling (removing) Zuma have been dampened,"" Mnguni said. ""If Zuma is to be recalled, it would only be because Mabuza and Magashule gang up on him, which I don't think is likely.""
Ramaphosa, 65, told reporters on Tuesday that the ANC's new top six was a ""unity leadership"" which reflected the views of different sections of the party.
POLICY PARALYSIS?
Investors had hoped Ramaphosa, a former trade union leader and millionaire businessman, would secure a decisive win in the ANC race, putting him in a strong position to enact reforms which could help South Africa avoid further credit rating downgrades.
Dlamini-Zuma, who President Zuma publicly backed for ANC leader, was seen as more focused on tackling racial inequality and struggled to distance herself from the corruption scandals that have dogged her ex-husband.
But in the new ANC top six announced on Monday, three officials were from the ""slate"" of Ramaphosa's preferred candidates and three were from Dlamini-Zuma's ticket.
""With no clear win for either the Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma or Cyril Ramaphosa slates, I expect the policy paralysis that we have seen will continue until one side 'defeats' the other,"" said Geoff Blount, managing director at BayHill Capital.
Gwen Ngwenya at the Institute of Race Relations said expectations for sweeping policy change under Ramaphosa were overblown.
""The Ramaphosa of fantasy, the figure of a decisive man of action, has never manifest himself in reality,"" she said, noting that promises Ramaphosa made before becoming deputy president never materialized.
One important consequence of the compromise leadership outcome seen on Monday is that it lessens the likelihood of the ANC splitting before the 2019 election - which had been raised by analysts as a possibility in the event of a clear victory for the Dlamini-Zuma faction.
Attention now shifts to the makeup of the ANC's new National Executive Committee (NEC), a group of around 80 officials which steers the party and will be elected in the coming days. 

Should the new NEC be just as split as the ANC's top six, that would make the prospects for major reform even more remote.

The Permanent Court of Arbitration in June ruled that most of the Piran Bay area shared between the two neighbors was Slovenia's territorial waters, and that Slovenia should have a sea corridor through Croatian waters to international waters.
The Hague-based court's six-month deadline for the states to implement the ruling expires on Dec. 29. Croatia rejects the ruling, saying it withdrew from the process in 2015 because of Slovenia's violation of the arbitration procedure.
""We intend to implement the ruling and expect Croatia to do the same,"" Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said at a news conference following talks in Zagreb on Tuesday with his Croatian counterpart Andrej Plenkovic.
""Slovenia will start the implementation where it can do it alone, and it will seek dialogue and cooperation from Croatia where it cannot act alone.""
Plenkovic said the ruling was not obligatory for Croatia, which had withdrawn from the arbitration process after a leaked tape showed that a Slovenian judge on the arbitration panel had improperly exchanged confidential information with the Ljubljana government.
The court acknowledged the arbitration violation but concluded that it was not serious enough to halt the case. 
""The issue of borders is an open issue for Croatia,"" Plenkovic said, adding that Croatia had proposed to Slovenia a legal framework for new talks on the borders. Cerar dismissed the idea, saying the arbitration ruling was final for Slovenia.
Plenkovic warned against ""unilateral acts that could cause incidents on the borders"". 
The two countries have been arguing over their sea and land borders since both declared independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991 as it disintegrated and slid into war.
The dispute held up Croatian accession to the EU for many years. Only after both parties agreed to arbitration was Zagreb granted entry to the bloc in 2013.
The court ruled that Slovenia should have most of the Piran Bay area recognized as its territorial waters. 
In addition, the tribunal established a 2.5 nautical mile-wide and some 10 nautical mile-long corridor through Croatian waters to give Slovenia much-coveted direct access to international waters.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanian lawmakers voted on Tuesday to enact judicial changes that critics say will undermine graft investigations by weakening the president's oversight.
The move brings the country, ranked as one of the bloc's most corrupt, in line with eastern European Union peers Hungary and Poland in defying EU concerns over the independence of judiciaries and the rule of law.
Ruling Social Democrat senators approved the bill by 80-0 with all opposition groupings boycotting the vote. It now goes to the president, who has expresses scepticism about it.
He can sign it or send it back for more discussion. The opposition, however, has already said it plans to contest the bill at the constitutional court, which could prolong its adoption by early 2018.
Contested elements of the bill include weakening the president's right to vet prosecutor candidates, as well as amending the definition of prosecutors' activity to exclude the word ""independent.""
""The president can refuse to appoint (prosecutors) only once...,"" reads the bill.
""Prosecutors carry out their work according to the principles of legality, impartiality, hierarchical control, under the authority of justice minister. Prosecutors are independent in proposing solutions,"" the bill stipulates. Critics say this amounts to political control.
The bill also refers to the finance ministry's obligation to recoup losses triggered by a judicial error from the judge who issued the sentence, instead of from state funds. Experts have said this would could distort court judgments.
The bill is are part of a wider judiciary overhaul that has triggered street protests across the country in recent weeks.
Romanian prosecutors have investigated thousands of public officials in an unprecedented crackdown on graft in recent years. The lower house and senate speakers, both leaders of the ruling coalition, are on trial in separate cases.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 09:20AM ET</span>",Arrested Myanmar reporters: Two book lovers dedicated to their craft,"By Antoni Slodkowski, Shoon Naing and Thu Thu Aung
YANGON/BANGKOK (Reuters) - In many ways Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, two Reuters journalists arrested in Myanmar, symbolize their country's emergence after decades of isolation - both from modest, provincial backgrounds, they worked hard to pursue careers that would have been impossible in the junta era into which they were born. 
Following are profiles of the two journalists, who were arrested on Dec. 12 and have been held since then without contact with their families or a lawyer, accused of breaching the country's Official Secrets Act:
WA LONE
Wa Lone, 31, grew up in Kin Pyit, a village of some 100 households in the Shwe Bo district north of Mandalay, on Myanmar's dry central plain between the mighty Irrawaddy and Chindwin rivers.
One of five children, his parents were rice farmers and there was little money. His mother died from cancer when he was young.
But he was a good student, according to friends and family, and took a keen interest in news from an early age. One of his brothers, Thura Aung, remembers Wa Lone, aged around 10, watching bulletins on a shared TV in their village.
""Sometimes he would play at being an anchor,"" said Thura Aung, 26. ""He always said he wanted to be a reporter in the future.""
After finishing school at 16 he enrolled as a student at a government technical university, but left after a couple of semesters because his family could not afford the tuition.
Around 2004 he went to Mawlamyine, Myanmar's fourth biggest city, living in a Buddhist monastery where his uncle was a monk. In exchange for a place to stay, he would get up at 5 a.m. to clean and prepare food for the monks before going to work at a photo services business. Wa Lone showed a talent for design and photography, and soon set up a small photo services shop of his own, which he ran with Thura Aung.
In December 2010, having saved a little money, the brothers moved back to Yangon, where Wa Lone could pursue his boyhood dream. Living in North Okklapa township, near the city's airport, they re-established their photo services business, while Wa Lone also enrolled in a media training school and later began taking English classes.
Mindy Walker, an American teacher who met him in 2012, recalls a ""skinny kid from the village who had little interaction with foreigners"". 
He was so nervous he fled her English class the first time he was called on to answer a question.
""We still joke about that moment and he tells every new student in our class that story so that they feel more confident,"" said Walker in an email. ""His heart is huge and he is always encouraging others to succeed.""
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION
Within five or six months Wa Lone had landed his first job in journalism on the weekly People's Age in Yangon, where his editor was Pe Myint - now Myanmar's Minister of Information.
In 2014, he joined the English-language daily, Myanmar Times, covering the historic 2015 general election that swept Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to power.
""As soon as I met Wa Lone, I knew we had to hire him,"" said the paper's former editor, Thomas Kean. ""He was thoughtful, articulate and clearly cared deeply about journalism.""
As well as providing a platform for him to excel as a journalist, the two years he spent at the Myanmar Times was a significant period in Wa Lone's life - it was there that he met his wife Pan Ei Mon who works in the paper's sales and marketing department. The couple married in April last year.
Despite the long hours chasing stories and studying, Wa Lone has still found time to write a children's book, The Gardener, a story in Burmese and English with an environmental message that draws on his own rural roots.
He co-founded the Third Story Project, a charitable foundation that produces and distributes stories that aim to promote tolerance between Myanmar's different ethnic groups, and is involved in projects working with orphans.
Many of his weekends off have been spent visiting poor rural villages - much like the one where he grew up.
""He brings story books from Third Story and gives them to children,"" said Pan Ei Mon. ""He reads to them and does painting competitions and sings with the children.""
Wa Lone joined Reuters in July 2016 and quickly made his mark with in-depth stories on sensitive subjects including land grabs by the powerful military and the murder of prominent politician Ko Ni, as well as uncovering evidence of killings by soldiers in the northeast.
His reporting on the crisis that erupted in northwestern Rakhine state in October 2016 won him a joint honorable mention from the Society of Publishers in Asia in its annual awards.
He returned to Rakhine this year, after attacks by Rohingya Muslim militants on security forces in August triggered a crackdown by the army.
Covering such subjects is not easy in a country where the transition from decades of junta rule is proving painful.
""His bravery over the past year, and particularly since Aug. 25, has been incredible. It's hard to describe the tide of ill-feeling towards journalists who question the military-government narrative on Rakhine,"" said Kean, his former editor.
""As soon as one of my colleagues said, 'Have you heard about Wa Lone?', I knew he'd been arrested. His reporting has undoubtedly made him a target. It's heartbreaking, infuriating and completely unsurprising."" 
KYAW SOE OO
Family and friends of Kyaw Soe Oo say he has always had a love of writing, and composed poetry before becoming a journalist.
Min Min, the founder of the Root Investigative Agency, where Kyaw Soe Oo worked after starting his reporting career with the online Rakhine Development News, described the 27-year-old as ""a joyful person"" who had many friends.
""When I first met him in 2013, he was a poet not a journalist and not interested in journalism yet,"" said Min Min. 
An ethnic Rakhine Buddhist, Kyaw Soe Oe grew up in the state capital Sittwe, and was one of five siblings.
""He is a good elder brother,"" said his sister, Nyo Nyo Aye, adding that her brother always stood out from the crowd.
""He was always with books. He went to the book store or second-hand booksellers. He spent all his money buying books. .""
Childhood friend Zaw Myo Thu said he avoided becoming caught up in the communal tensions between Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims that have seethed in the city since the upheavals in 2012.
""He wrote poems. He loved to read,"" he said. ""He never fought with anyone.""
But it was that conflict which drew him into journalism, covering Rakhine issues. He had been with Reuters since September, reporting on the army's crackdown in the aftermath of militant attacks on security forces on Aug. 25.
""As a journalist, he will cover news, but I think he will do it fairly because he does not discriminate between races,"" said his sister Nyo Nyo Aye. ""He just realises all are human.""
For Reuters, Kyaw Soe Oo worked on an investigative story about Myanmar's plan to harvest the crops of Rohingya farmers who fled to Bangladesh, and reported on how some Buddhists were enforcing local-level segregation in central Rakhine.

""He didn't tell me about the work and I never asked,"" said his wife, Chit Thu Win, with whom he has a three-year-old daughter. ""I believed in him that he is doing the right thing and he's just following his passion. He wanted to be a writer.""

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 09:16AM ET</span>",U.S. blames North Korea for 'WannaCry' cyber attack,"(In 13th paragraph of Dec. 18 item, corrects to indicate that a separate attack was launched in June that affected FedEx (NYSE:FDX) computers)
By Dustin Volz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has publicly blamed North Korea for unleashing the so-called WannaCry cyber attack that crippled hospitals, banks and other companies across the globe earlier this year.
""The attack was widespread and cost billions, and North Korea is directly responsible,"" Tom Bossert, homeland security adviser to President Donald Trump, wrote in a piece published on Monday night in the Wall Street Journal.
""North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade, and its malicious behavior is growing more egregious,"" Bossert wrote. ""WannaCry was indiscriminately reckless.""
The White House was expected to follow up on Tuesday with a more formal statement blaming Pyongyang, according to a senior administration official.
The U.S. government has assessed with a ""very high level of confidence"" that a hacking entity known as Lazarus Group, which works on behalf of the North Korean government, carried out the WannaCry attack, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the government's investigation.
Lazarus Group is widely believed by security researchers and U.S. officials to have been responsible for the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment that destroyed files, leaked corporate communications online and led to the departure of several top studio executives.
North Korean government representatives could not be immediately reached for comment. The country has repeatedly denied responsibility for WannaCry and called other allegations about cyber attacks a smear campaign. 
Washington's public condemnation does not include any indictments or name specific individuals, the administration official said, adding the shaming was designed to hold Pyongyang accountable for its actions and ""erode and undercut their ability to launch attacks.""
The accusation comes as worries mount about North Korea's hacking capabilities and its nuclear weapons program.
'PATTERN OF MISBEHAVING'
Many security researchers, including the cyber firm Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) , as well as the British government, have already concluded that North Korea was likely behind the WannaCry attack, which quickly unfurled across the globe in May to infect more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries.
Considered unprecedented in scale at the time, WannaCry knocked British hospitals offline, forcing thousands of patients to reschedule appointments and disrupted infrastructure and businesses around the world. 
The attack originally looked like a ransomware campaign, where hackers encrypt a targeted computer and demand payment to recover files. Some experts later concluded the ransom threat may have been a distraction intended to disguise a more destructive intent.
A separate but similar attack in June, known as NotPetya, hit Ukraine and other nations and caused an estimated $300 million in damages to international shipper FedEx.
Some researchers have said they believed WannaCry was deployed accidentally by North Korea as hackers were developing the code. The senior administration official declined to comment about whether U.S. intelligence was able to discern if the attack was deliberate. 
""What we see is a continued pattern of North Korea misbehaving, whether destructive cyber attacks, hacking for financial gain, or targeting infrastructure around the globe,"" the official said.
WannaCry was made possible by a flaw in Microsoft’s Windows software, which was discovered by the U.S. National Security Agency and then used by the NSA to build a hacking tool for its own use. 
In a devastating NSA security breach, that hacking tool and others were published online by the Shadow Brokers, a mysterious group that regularly posts cryptic taunts toward the U.S. government.
The fact that WannaCry was made possible by the NSA led to sharp criticism from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) President Brad Smith and others who believe the NSA should disclose vulnerabilities it finds so that they can be fixed, rather then hoarding that knowledge to carry out attacks. 
Smith said WannaCry provided ""yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem.""
U.S. officials have pushed back on those assertions, saying the administration discloses most computer flaws that government agencies detect.

Last month, the White House published its rules for deciding whether to disclose cyber security flaws or keep them secret as part of an effort to be more transparent about the inter-agency process involved in weighing disclosure.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis and Jordan's King Abdullah on Tuesday discussed U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move that both say is dangerous to Middle East peace.
Abdullah and the pope spoke privately for about 20 minutes at the start of the king's visit to the Vatican and France.
A Vatican statement said they discussed ""the promotion of peace and stability in the Mideast, with particular reference to the question of Jerusalem and the role of the Hashemite Sovereign as Custodian of the Holy Places"".
King Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city.
When Trump announced his decision on Dec. 6, the pope responded by calling for the city's ""status quo"" to be respected, saying new tension in the Middle East would further inflame world conflicts. 
Among an outpouring of international criticism, Jordan also rejected the U.S. decision, calling it legally ""null"" because it consolidated Israel's occupation of the eastern sector of the city.
The United States was further isolated over the issue on Monday when it blocked a U.N. Security Council call for the declaration to be withdrawn.
Both the Vatican and Jordan back a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, with them agreeing on the status of Jerusalem as part of the peace process.
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent state, whereas Israel has declared the whole city to be its ""united and eternal"" capital.

The statement said both sides wanted to encourage negotiations.

Libya is the main departure point for migrants fleeing poverty or war to reach Europe by boat as smugglers exploit turmoil gripping the country since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.
Illegal migrant arrivals in Italy have fallen by two-thirds since July from the same period last year since the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, Italy's partner, cut back human smuggling at one major hub. Italy also helps in the Libyan coast guard's operations.
But activists say the push has led to worsening of conditions in detention centers, where Human Rights Watch and other groups say migrants face overcrowding, abuse, lack of medical facilities and a shortage of food.
The U.N. is repatriating migrants to African countries willing to take them back but it was also in talks with European countries and Canada to take in some refugees, Roberto Mignone, chief mission of the U.N. refugee agency, said.
""This week we are going to send out of Libya 350 refugees, until the end of January we will send out at least 1000,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
""In 2018 we are planning to send out of Libya between 5,000 to 10,000 refugees. We give priority to women, children, elderly, disabled, persons who suffered very seriously.""
A total of 44,306 had been registered as refugees and asylum seekers in Libya, he said.
Libyan officials deny abuses and say they are simply overwhelmed by a surge in arrivals amid little funds to accommodate them as public finances have been hit by a loss of oil revenues.
The issue of repatriations has got higher attention abroad since CNN published a video showing what it said was an auction of men offered to Libyan buyers as farmhands and sold for $400.

In November, Libya's U.N.-backed government said it was investigating the report and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice. But it has struggled to make an impact as the country is effect controlled by armed factions.

The dual citizenship plan for the northern Italian region of Alto Adige was included in a coalition agreement announced over the weekend between Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservative People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party (FPO).
Italian politicians have already roundly condemned it, calling it a gesture to nationalism and saying it will threaten the delicate ethnic balance in the autonomous area of Alto Adige, also known as the South Tyrol.
Kurz has said the scheme, which the FPO has long pushed for, is only meant to encourage cooperation between European states.
""That is something that of course we only plan to do in close cooperation with Italy and with the government in Rome,"" Kurz told a joint news conference with FPO chief and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache after their government's first cabinet meeting.
Alto Adige was ceded to Italy by Austria after World War One. Despite moves by Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini to settle thousands of ethnic Italians there in the 1920s, German-speakers still outnumber Italians by around two to one.
Italian- and German-speakers have their own schools and largely frequent different bars and restaurants. But the region enjoys enormous autonomy and generous handouts from Rome, which have helped dampen secessionist sentiments in the province.
""In our government program we have complied with a wish of South Tyroleans that was expressed by all parties in South Tyrol and that above all was also expressed by the South Tyrolean provincial government,"" Kurz said.
Italy's foreign minister was quoted by Italian news agency ANSA on Monday as saying that discussing the issue would be ""a conversation that requires enormous delicacy"".
Strache said Italy already has a similar arrangement in place for Italian minorities in Slovenia and Croatia. The Italian Foreign Ministry website lays out conditions under which people who lost their citizenship when some territories became part of Yugoslavia can apply for an Italian passport.
The office of the governor of Alto Adige, Arno Kompatscher, declined to comment on Vienna's plan. His conservative party has, however, cheered it.
""We welcome that this was included in the Austrian coalition program after the South Tyrolean People's Party has pursued this wish for years,"" it said in a statement on Monday.

Bell, who was vice president under President Andres Pastrana from 1998 to 2002 and is currently ambassador to Cuba, replaces Juan Camilo Restrepo, who guided talks with the National Liberation Army (ELN) since they began in February. 
Santos said in a televised address the government hopes to extend a ceasefire that began in October and ends on Jan. 9.
""With the ELN, we have for the first time achieved a stoppage of hostilities that, while not perfect, has been positive. We will work toward improving it and extending it in January,"" Santos said.
The ELN on Sunday said it is willing to continue the ceasefire if there is sufficient progress in peace talks. It said it would assess the government's willingness to overcome hurdles. [nL1N1OH0IW]
The ELN and the government have been in negotiations in Quito for 10 months, after a long and secret exploratory phase, in a bid to end more than 53 years of war.
Santos, who leaves office next year, signed a peace accord in late 2016 with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which has now become a political party and hopes to fight the government at the ballot box.
The ELN's first-ever ceasefire is being supervised by the Roman Catholic Church and the United Nations.
The 2,000-strong ELN, which has regularly bombed oil infrastructure and taken hostages, has continued kidnapping despite the ceasefire. An indigenous leader in Choco province died in October after being taken by the group.

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenia, birth country of U.S. First Lady Melania Trump, expects revenues from foreign tourists to jump by about 9 percent this year and by at least 5 percent in 2018, Economy Minister Zdravko Pocivalsek said on Tuesday.
2017 will be the fourth record year in a row for Slovenian tourism after revenues from foreign tourists reached some 2.3 billion euros ($2.71 billion) last year, Pocivalsek told a news conference.
Tourism in Slovenia rose strongly because of a general increase of tourism in Europe and a successful promotion of Slovenia as a safe country.
Officials say it also got something of a boost from Melania Trump having been born in the city of Sevnica in southeastern Slovenia before becoming a fashion model and moving to the United States. 
""We received a lot of attention from (international) journalists because of the U.S. First Lady and we managed to present Slovenia as an attractive, green country,"" Maja Pak, head of the Slovenian Tourist Organisation, told the same news conference.
About 60 percent of Slovenia is covered by forests while the country has some resorts on the Adriatic sea as well as a number of Alpine and spa tourist resorts. 
Pocivalsek also said Slovenia plans to gradually privative all tourist accommodation infrastructure which should further improve tourism business. At present about 40 percent of hotels in Slovenia are in state hands.
""I want a well-considered privatization ... which will be in favor of the state and the companies that are being sold,"" Pocivalsek said.
In the first 10 months of 2017 the number of foreign tourists jumped by almost 17 percent year-on-year, the statistics office said last month. 
In the first nine months of the year, the latest data available, the number of tourists from the United States rose by 23.4 percent, it added. 
According to the government's tourism strategy the revenues from foreign tourists should rise to at least 3.7 billion euros per year by the end of 2021.

Having secured an agreement to move EU exit negotiations to the next stage last week, Tuesday's cabinet discussion marks the start of May's next battle over Brexit: what kind of long-term relationship will Britain have with the bloc?
In making that decision, May has to manage deep divisions at home, including among senior ministers, over whether to align the country's economic future with the EU, or diverge from the bloc and seek a more global role. 
""The PM said it was clear what the cabinet's objective is: a deal which secures the best possible trading terms with the EU, enables the UK to set rules that are right for our situation and facilitates ambitious third-country trade deals,"" the spokesman said.
The discussion lasted 1-3/4 hours and saw 25 ministers speak on a subject at the heart of the country's political debate over leaving the EU. It was the first time cabinet has discussed the so-called ""end state"" of the negotiations since the referendum vote to leave in June last year.
Asked whether there was agreement on May's key aims, the spokesman said: ""Yes, it's clear what we want to achieve. It was set out in a good, clear, detailed discussion in which there were contributions from a large majority of the cabinet.""
The spokesman said May ruled out a final economic partnership with the EU modeled on the European Economic area, and that her aim was to get a more ambitious deal than the one signed between Canada and the EU last year.

""The Brexit Secretary (David Davis) and the prime minister were clear that Britain would be seeking a bespoke deal,"" he added.

Military spokesman Colonel Edgard Arevalo confirmed to reporters that Vice Admiral Ronald Joseph Mercado was no longer in charge of the 23,000-strong naval forces, but declined to say why.
""The reason for this change of command will be explained in due time,"" Arevalo told reporters.
Military sources quoted in media reports said Mercado's removal was connected to controversy that had surfaced over the procurement of two frigates from South Korea, which are due to be delivered by 2020. 
A defence official privy to the decision to remove Mercado said it concerned equipment to be purchased for those frigates.
The official told Reuters the former navy chief had lost the ""trust and confidence"" of Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.
Lorenzana did not respond to a request for comment on Mercado's removal and calls to Mercado's mobile phone went unanswered. 
""There were some policy differences between the defense department and the navy over the 18 billion pesos ($358 million) acquisition of two brand-new frigates from South Korea,"" the military official said, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Rear Admiral Robert Empedrad was promoted to navy commander at a low-key ceremony at the armed forces headquarters in Manila.
Congressman Gary Alejano, a former marine officer, said he would request a formal congressional inquiry take place over the navy's frigate acquisition project, having found Mercado's sudden removal ""unusual"".

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's vice president said on Tuesday that calls for a boycott of U.S. goods over President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel were misguided - not least because of the country's reliance on U.S. technology. 
There have been a series of protests in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country since Trump's controversial move this month to reverse decades of U.S. policy.
At a rally of about 80,000 people on Sunday, the Indonesian Ulema Council, a body of Muslim clerics, called for a boycott of U.S. and Israeli products if Trump did not revoke his action.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla told reporters that Indonesia was trying to put pressure on Washington through the United Nations and it was not even practical to stop using American products. 
""Do not be emotional... do we dare to boycott iPhones, stop using Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Can (you) live without them?"" he asked.
""(You) cannot live without them now. If you go out of the house now, you put (an iPhone) in your pocket,"" he said. 
Kalla said that even if people stopped watching U.S. movies, other American goods such as specialized petroleum equipment were vital in oil-producing Indonesia, Southeast Asia's biggest economy. 
There have been a series of protests in Indonesia over the issue of Jerusalem, including some where hardliners burned U.S. and Israeli flags.
The status of Jerusalem, a city holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, is one of the biggest barriers to a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace.
Asked about how to proceed after Washington vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for the U.S. declaration on Jerusalem to be withdrawn, Kalla said that dialogue was the only solution. 
""There had been three wars, and Palestine's territory has become smaller, so there must be a dialogue, peace,"" he said.
Indonesia enjoys a trade surplus with the United States and is one of 16 countries that the Trump administration has said could be investigated for possible trade abuses.
Tutum Rahanta, deputy chairman of the Indonesian Retailers Association, said it was up to consumers whether to buy American products.

""If it is advice or a call to boycott, it depends on the consumers whether to use the products or not.""

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 06:40AM ET</span>",Ramaphosa's ANC election win lifts South African banks,"By Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo and Tiisetso Motsoeneng
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African banking stocks rallied on Tuesday, buoyed by optimism that the newly elected leader of the ruling African National Congress will push through policies aimed at putting the economy on a stronger footing.
South Africa's Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa - a darling of markets - narrowly beat former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in Monday's vote, marking a pivotal moment for the party that launched black-majority rule under Nelson Mandela's leadership 23 years ago.
As ANC leader, Ramaphosa, a 65-year-old union leader turned businessman, is likely to become the next president after elections in 2019 because of his party's electoral dominance.
Ratings agency Moody's said Ramaphosa's victory opened up tentative prospects of a policy shift and rise in business confidence that ""could reverse the gradual deterioration in South Africa's credit fundamentals."" 
Ramaphosa, a former chairman of Africa's biggest telecoms operator MTN Group, is seen by business leaders as well placed to turn around an economy. South Africa's GDP is estimated to grow by less than a percent this year, while the unemployment rate is at near records just shy of 28 percent.
In an open letter, Mike Brown, the chief executive of South Africa's No.4 bank, Nedbank, urged Ramaphosa to immediately address governance failures in state-owned companies and ensure that the country retains the last sovereign investment grade from Moody's.
""It is important that we have stable and rational policies, creating an environment that encourages growth for businesses and individuals,"" Brown said.
Ramaphosa's election victory over Dlamini-Zuma, who was backed by ex-husband President Jacob Zuma, put shares in banks, considered the barometer of both economic and political sentiment, back in demand.
In afternoon trade, the blue-chip stock index, the JSE Top-40, added one percent to 51,601 with banks on top of the gainers' list. The banking index rose nearly six percent with FirstRand, the largest lender by market value, surging more than seven percent.
Government bonds firmed, with the yield on the benchmark instrument due in 2026 falling 16 basis points to 8.695 percent.
A local business lobby group, Business Leadership South Africa welcomed the election of Ramaphosa, saying it gave him a chance to address inequality, unemployment and poverty.
""For this to happen, we require regulatory certainty and policy stability that will accelerate and deepen transformation,"" said BLSA, which is composed of some of the biggest and most influential names in corporate South Africa. 
Another key issue facing the ANC's new leader is policy uncertainty in South Africa's mining industry, where companies are challenging a requirement to increase black ownership of firms in the sector to 30 percent from 26 percent.
The sector is a major employer and contributed 7.7 percent to gross domestic product in 2016. The sector also accounts for 25 percent of exports in Africa’s most industrialized economy.
Analysts at U.S. bank JP Morgan raised their economic growth forecast for next year to 1.4 percent from one percent, prompted by Ramaphosa's election. 
""The forecast change largely rests on a lesser purchasing power drag on consumers, as outlined below, and perhaps a modest resumption in the capex cycle,"" the analysts said in a note. 
FLAG-BEARER
The rand currency retreated on Tuesday from a nine-month high notched up in the previous session. At 1107 GMT, the rand was 0.2 percent weaker against the dollar at 12.7950 rand.
Expectations that Ramaphosa would win the ANC race had pushed the rand to 12.5200 per dollar on Monday, its firmest since March 27 before a cabinet reshuffle by Zuma rocked markets and triggered credit ratings downgrades to ""junk"".
Ramaphosa will be the ANC's flag-bearer in the 2019 national election, but will have to contend with allies of his defeated rival, Dlamini-Zuma, in his leadership team.
Some investors were worried that Ramaphosa may not be able to push through policy changes because the ANC's top decision making group, known as the ""top-six"", was split down the middle, consisting of three politicians apiece drawn from Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma's camps. 
Ramaphosa's sole rival was Dlamini-Zuma, a veteran campaigner against racial economic inequality and big business interests.

""There is some concern that the split of the ANC top six (officials) might hinder Cyril Ramaphosa's ability to invoke the much needed reforms he has been campaigning on,"" said Shaun Murison, currency strategist at IG Markets.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 06:20AM ET</span>","Argentina Congress passes pension reform after protests, clashes","BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's Congress passed a reform to the pension system early on Tuesday, after days of demonstrations by the bill's opponents and violent clashes between protesters and police gripped the South American country.
The reform, which is crucial to President Mauricio Macri's efforts to slash the fiscal deficit and attract investment, changes the formula used to calculate benefits by linking them to consumer prices at a time of lower inflation expectations. 
It passed the lower chamber of deputies after an all-night debate session by a vote of 128-116, with two abstentions. The Senate had approved the proposal last month.
The measure has generated fierce criticism from opposition lawmakers and labor unions, who say it will hurt retirees. It was initially slated for debate last Thursday, but the session was suspended after police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators outside the capitol.
Macri then promised to decree a one-time bonus payment to the neediest retirees, and the government said pensions would rise by 5 percentage points above inflation in 2018. 
But that did not win over demonstrators who took to the streets of the capital Buenos Aires and around the country late on Monday, banging pots and pans and blaring car horns. 
Earlier on Monday, protesters outside the capitol threw stones at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons, while the country's main union called a 24-hour general strike. [L1N1OI120]
Macri's market-friendly Cambiemos, or ""Let's Change"", coalition does not have a majority in either house of Congress, even after a strong performance in legislative midterm elections in October. But he managed to cobble together enough votes for the pension reform to pass.
Until now, pension payments had increased in line with tax income and wage hikes, which economists said harmed efforts to slash the fiscal deficit.

(Reuters) - South Carolina's capital on Tuesday could become the first U.S. city to ban the use of bump stocks, a gun accessory that has drawn national scrutiny after being found among the Las Vegas mass shooter's arsenal of weapons in October.
Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin said the city council was expected in a vote on Tuesday night to approve an ordinance barring the devices, which allow semiautomatic rifles to fire hundreds of rounds a minute like fully automatic machine guns.
""One of the common refrains that you hear whether it was in Texas or Vegas or Sandy Hook is that a good guy with a gun could have stopped the carnage,"" Benjamin, a Democrat, said in a phone interview on Monday. ""It's time for the good guys with guns to begin to pass some really good policy.""
Authorities said Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock had 12 rifles outfitted with bump stocks in the hotel room where he launched his attack on an outdoor concert, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.
Since the shooting, several states and cities have proposedmeasures outlawing or restricting the attachments, and the U.S. Justice Department said earlier this month it was considering a ban on certain bump stocks.
California and New York already ban them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Five other states prohibit devices that allow automatic fire, and seven states and the District of Columbia have assault weapons bans that could include bump stocks, the organization said.
""We are not aware of any cities that have passed ordinancesbanning bump stocks,"" said Tom Martin, a spokesman for the National League of Cities in Washington.
In Columbia, four of the council's six members approved the city's proposed ordinance on a first reading earlier this month.
The measure also would ban the use of other gun attachments that allow rifles to fire faster. Owners would be required to keep them stored separately from any weapon.
Trigger-enhancing devices are not gun parts, gun components, weapons or ammunition, which state law prohibits cities from regulating, Benjamin said. 
The mayor, who has a background in law enforcement and said he owns guns, said the measure had drawn support from local police and council members who support the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protecting gun ownership rights.

""In spite of long wait times, the U.S. Mission to Turkey continues to process non-immigrant visas. Appointments are available for January 2019, and applicants can as always choose to apply outside of Turkey,"" it said.
The United States in November resumed ""limited visa services"" in Turkey after getting what it said were assurances about the safety of its local staff. Washington halted issuing visas at its missions in Turkey in October, citing the detention of two local employees.
Turkey soon matched the move, relaxing a visa ban of its own that was instituted in retaliation against Washington. However, Turkey said it had not offered assurances.
In May, a translator at the U.S. consulate in the southern province of Adana was arrested and, more recently, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) worker was detained in Istanbul. Both are accused of links to last year's coup attempt. The U.S. embassy has said the accusations are baseless.
Turkey has been angered by what it sees as U.S. reluctance to hand over the cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999 and whom Ankara blames for orchestrating the coup. U.S. officials have said courts require sufficient evidence to order his extradition.

PetroVietnam is at the heart of a sweeping high-level corruption crackdown in the communist state. 
The ministry said in a statement that Phan Dinh Duc, a member of PetroVietnam's board of directors, would face prosecution on suspicion of ""violation of state regulations on economic management, causing serious consequences"".
PetroVietnam told Reuters in an emailed statement it would cooperate with the authorities in the investigation. 
Former PetroVietnam chairman Dinh La Thang, 56, was arrested on Dec 8. Thang, also a former member of Vietnam's politburo, was the most senior executive arrested in the scandal. 
Police have said they are investigating alleged violations of state rules at PetroVietnam, which resulted in a loss of an 800 billion dong ($35.2 million) investment in local lender Ocean Bank.
The corruption crackdown made global headlines in August when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping Trinh Xuan Thanh, a former chairman of PetroVietnam's construction unit, in Berlin after he applied for asylum there.
Vietnamese police denied he had been kidnapped saying he had turned himself in and returned to Vietnam, where he is in detention. The Communist Party has said Thanh will go on trial next month.

Finnish media quoted a female MP from another party as saying that Teuvo Hakkarainen, a deputy chairman of the nationalist Finns Party, last week grabbed her neck and kissed her in parliament café despite her objections.
""I am very sorry for what happened, alcohol does not suit me ... I have hurt (her),"" Hakkarainen said in his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
""I will step down from the position of the party's second deputy chairman.""
Finns Party's lawmakers issued a warning to Hakkarainen over the incident, saying any harassment was unacceptable. Hakkarainen will remain a member of the Finns Party parliamentary group.
Hakkarainen was part of a new hard-line leadership nominated by the party in June, a development that led to it being kicked out of the government by Prime Minister Juha Sipila. 
More than half of its lawmakers subsequently left the party and formed a new group to keep their government seats.
The Finns Party, formerly called ""True Finns"", rose from obscurity during the euro zone debt crisis with an anti-EU platform, complicating the bloc's bailout talks with troubled states.
Hakkarainen was fined earlier this year for a Facebook post calling for a Muslim-free Finland which a district court said amounted to agitation against an ethnic group.
The party currently has polling support of about eight percent, down from 18 percent in 2015 general election.

A day earlier, Trump's administration had unveiled a security paper - based on the president's 'America First' push - that accused Russia of interfering in other countries' internal affairs. 
""A quick read of the parts of the strategy that mention our country one way or another... (shows) an imperialist character,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 
The paper, he added also showed ""an unwillingness to give up the idea of a unipolar world, moreover, an insistent unwillingness, disregard for a multipolar world.""
Trump's strategy paper did not include specific accusations from U.S. security agencies that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. But it reflected a broader view long held by U.S. diplomats that Russia actively undermines American interests at home and abroad.
""We can not agree with an attitude that sees our country as a threat to the United States,"" Peskov said. ""At the same time, there are some modestly positive aspects, in particular, the readiness to cooperate in areas that correspond to American interests."" 
Trump has frequently spoken of wanting to improve relations with President Vladimir Putin, even though Russia has frustrated U.S. policy in Syria and Ukraine and done little to help Washington in its standoff with North Korea.
In a speech laying out his strategy on Monday, Trump said he had received a call from Putin a day earlier to thank him for providing U.S. intelligence that helped thwart a bomb attack in the Russian city of St. Petersburg.

1163,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 05:20AM ET</span>",Amtrak safety record under scrutiny even before deadly derailment,"By David Shepardson and Daniel Trotta
(Reuters) - The fatal derailment of an Amtrak train south of Seattle on Monday is likely to intensify scrutiny of the national passenger railroad company's safety record, which was already under the microscope following a series of fatal incidents.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said late on Monday that a data recorder retrieved from the rear locomotive showed the train was traveling at 80 miles (130 km) an hour in a 30-mile-per hour zone when it jumped the tracks.
The NTSB said it was too soon to say if that contributed to the crash, which killed at least three people, and it could take months for the board's investigators to reach a conclusion.
Amtrak's co-chief executive, Richard Anderson, told reporters earlier on Monday he would not speculate on the cause of the crash, and that safety was the firm's top priority. 
But he acknowledged that positive train control (PTC), a system that automatically slows trains if they are going too fast, had not been installed on that stretch of track.
Just last month, the NTSB chairman issued a scathing critique of Amtrak's culture, saying a future breakdown was likely, and the board made nine safety recommendations.
""Amtrak's safety culture is failing and is primed to fail again, until and unless Amtrak changes the way it practices safety management,"" Robert Sumwalt said on Nov. 14.
Sumwalt's statement was made in conjunction with the NTSB's findings into a fatal Amtrak accident in April 2016 in Pennsylvania, which it said was caused by ""deficient safety management across many levels of Amtrak and the resultant lack of a clear, consistent and accepted vision for safety.""
In that crash an Amtrak train struck a backhoe tractor on railroad tracks in Chester, Pennsylvania, killing two maintenance workers and injuring 41. It occurred a few miles south of the site of a May 2015 derailment in which eight people were killed and more than 200 injured.
Sumwalt told a hearing the board's investigation ""revealed more than two dozen unsafe conditions and not all of these were rule-breaking by frontline employees.""
Amtrak named former Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Chief Executive Officer Anderson as co-CEO last summer. 
Anderson also told reporters on Monday that Amtrak took NTSB recommendations from investigations ""very seriously"" and was continuing to make investments that the board recommended.
Amtrak said in a memo to employees in November seen by Reuters that it had been ""transforming our safety culture"" since the Pennsylvania incident and had made numerous reforms, including to communication, training, safety efforts and creating a team that conducts safety audits. It also expanded drug and alcohol testing.
SLOW ROLLOUT OF SAFETY SYSTEM
On Monday, a U.S. congressman from Washington state called attention to the slow rollout of PTC. 
""We don't know that it could have saved lives ... but it is a disappointment to me that we're not further along in the implementation of installing PTC,"" Representative Denny Heck, a Democrat, told CNN.
Congress had mandated the implementation of PTC nationwide by the end of 2015, then extended that deadline until the end of 2018 when its installation became more complex than anticipated.
""There is a money issue because while Congress mandated the implementation of PTC on the railroads they didn't give any money for it, so it is self-funded,"" said Allan Zarembski, director of the Railroad Engineering and Safety Program at the University of Delaware.
Zarembski cautioned against assigning blame for Monday's accident, noting that Amtrak does not own the track where the accident occurred. 
It is owned by the Seattle-area Sound Transit agency.
""The railways generally are very safe,"" he said. ""I'm very reluctant to point the finger and say the railroads are a major problem here.""
A spokesman for Sound Transit, Geoff Patrick, said the track had recently been upgraded to handle passenger trains from its prior use for slow-moving freight trains. 

He said Sound Transit was part of the incident response and was working with the NTSB in its investigation.

DUPONT, Wash. (Reuters) - An Amtrak train derailed on Monday as it took a corner on a new stretch of track in Washington state at more than twice the speed limit, sending passenger cars tumbling from a bridge and killing at least three people.
The train was on its inaugural run on a faster route from Seattle to Portland, Oregon, when 13 of its 14 cars jumped the tracks and tumbled onto a major highway near the town of DuPont (NYSE:DWDP).
In addition to the three fatalities, about 100 people were taken to nearby hospitals, of whom 10 had serious injuries, Washington State Patrol spokeswoman Brooke Bova told a news conference. 
Seven motor vehicles were also involved in the accident, and fragments of the bridge were left scattered on the highway. Some motorists were injured but none died, authorities said.
Amtrak said there were people 86 aboard the train, 80 of them passengers.
Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said late on Monday that a data recorder recovered from a rear locomotive showed the train was traveling 80 miles (130 km) per hour in a 30 mile-per-hour zone when it jumped the track at a curve leading up to the bridge.
NTSB spokeswoman Bella Dinh-Zarr told reporters it was too early to tell if the train's speed contributed to the derailment.
But the accident seems likely to intensify concerns about railroad company's safety record, which was already under scrutiny following a series of fatal incidents.

'PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING'
Some of those on board escaped by kicking out windows, passenger Chris Karnes told news outlet KIRO 7.
""All of a sudden, we felt this rocking and creaking noise, and it felt like we were heading down a hill,"" Karnes said. ""The next thing we know, we're being slammed into the front of our seats, windows are breaking, we stop, and there's water gushing out of the train. People were screaming.""
Geoff Patrick, a spokesman for Sound Transit, which owns the track, said it had recently been upgraded to handle passenger trains from its prior use for slow-moving freight trains.
The derailment happened on the first day Amtrak trains began using the new inland route between the Washington cities of Tacoma and Olympia, part of a $181-million project to cut travel time.
The state transportation department said the track had undergone ""weeks of inspection and testing"".
The rerouting takes trains along Interstate 5, enabling them to reach speeds of 79 miles per hour.
Hours after the 7:34 a.m. (1534 GMT) crash, train cars remained dangling from the overpass, with others strewn across I-5, a major West Coast route stretching from the Canadian to Mexican borders. 
Cranes were brought in to remove the carriages.
""It was just a scene of chaos and piles of twisted metal,"" said Ted Danek, administrator for the city of Dupont who visited the site.
The derailment was Amtrak's second in Washington state this year. On July 2, a southbound train with more than 250 people aboard derailed in the town of Steilacoom, just a few miles north of Monday's accident. No serious injuries were reported.
NO SPEED CONTROLS
Amtrak's co-chief executive, Richard Anderson, earlier said that positive train control (PTC), a system that automatically slows trains if they are going too fast, was not installed on the new stretch of track.
By law, PTC must be installed on all passenger rail systems by 2018, a deadline that has repeatedly been delayed after rail agencies said implementation was more complicated than anticipated. Sound Transit commuter line, which owns the track, reported in September that it did not yet have PTC in operation.
President Donald Trump said the crash illustrated the need for infrastructure improvements.
In May 2015, an Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia, killing eight people and injuring more than 200. The NTSB concluded the driver became distracted by radio transmissions and lost track of where he was.
In April 2016 a train traveling from New York hit a backhoe tractor on railroad tracks in Chester, Pennsylvania, killing two maintenance workers and injuring 41.

That crash prompted criticism from the NTSB about Amtrak's safety record. Amtrak said last month it had made numerous reforms.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Korean woman who was forced to work at a Japanese wartime military brothel and later lost a Supreme Court case seeking compensation from the Japanese government has died in Japan at the age of 95, a civic group said on Tuesday.
The death of Song Shin-do leaves 32 women registered with the South Korean government as surviving ""comfort women"", as those forced to work in wartime brothels are euphemistically known in Japan.
Japan’s 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean peninsula and the legacy of World War Two remain highly sensitive in South Korea. The issue of “comfort women”, is especially contentious.
Song was born in Korea and said she was forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military for seven years in China, according to the Korean Council for Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, a Seoul-based civic group that supports the women, which confirmed her death.
After the war, Song moved to Japan with a Japanese soldier who later left her. After that, she lived with an ethnic Korean man in Japan, the group said.
In 1993, Song filed a lawsuit with the Tokyo District Court seeking an official apology and compensation from the Japanese government. 
The case eventually went to Japan's Supreme Court, which dismissed her appeal in 2003 on the grounds that Japan had no legal obligation to pay for her suffering because a 20-year stature of limitations had expired, according to a summary by the Columbia Law School's Center for Korean Legal Studies.
The South Korean civic group said Song had ""suffered for seven years as a sex slave for the Japanese military"".
Some Japanese ultra-conservatives deny that the women were forced to work in the brothels.
Japan says the matter of compensation for the women was settled under a 1965 treaty with South Korea. 
In addition, Japan's then-chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, apologized in a 1993 statement acknowledging authorities’ involvement in coercing the women.
Two years later, Japan created a fund to make payments to the women from donations, budgeted money for their welfare support and sent letters of apology from successive premiers.
Under a pact endorsed by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in's predecessor, in 2015, Japan apologized again to the women and promised 1 billion yen ($9 million) for a fund to help them.
The two governments agreed the issue would be ""irreversibly resolved"" if both fulfilled their obligations.
But Moon has said the South Korean people did not accept the deal.

Reminders of Japan's brutal rule are inflammatory for both sides. Japan wants South Korea to remove a statue near the Japanese consulate in Busan city commemorating Korean comfort women, as well as another near the Japanese embassy in Seoul.

France on Friday said the Syrian government was doing nothing to reach a peace agreement after almost seven years of war and said it was committing mass crimes in the Eastern Ghouta region where 400,000 people are besieged by government forces.
On Monday Assad hit back. 
""France spearheaded support for terrorism and their hands are soaked in Syrian blood from the first days and we do not see they have changed their stance fundamentally,"" Assad was quoted in state media as telling reporters after meeting a Russian delegation that France had
""Those who support terrorism have no right to talk about peace,” he added.
Despite being a leading backer of the Syrian opposition, France has sought a more pragmatic approach to the Syrian conflict since the arrival of President Emmanuel Macron, saying that Assad's departure was not a pre-condition for talks.
Macron said on Monday he would push for peace talks involving all parties in the six-year-old Syrian conflict, including Assad, promising “initiatives” early next year. 
He did not say how any French proposals would relate to existing negotiations being brokered by the United Nations and insisted that the Syrian leader would have to face justice for his crimes.
Speaking in Washington after meeting senior U.S. officials, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said France was not going to take lessons from a man who had released thousands of Islamist militants from prison to fan the flames of the civil war and who relied on Russia and Iran to stay in power.

""When you have spent your days massacring your people, you should be generally a little more discrete,"" Le Drian said.

China hopes the United States can abandon its mentality of zero-sum games and seek common ground while respecting differences, China's U.S. embassy said on its website.
""On the basis of mutual respect, China is willing to exist peacefully with other countries including the United States,"" it said. ""But the U.S. ought to adapt to, and accept, China's development.""
China has always been a contributor to global development and a protector of the international order, Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said later in Beijing. 
""Cooperation is the only correct choice for China and the United States,"" she said, adding that it was not surprising for the two to have disagreements but that they should find constructive ways to handle them.
China's economic and diplomatic activities around the world are broadly welcomed and no country or report will succeed in distorting the facts or deploying malicious slander, she told a daily news briefing.
As the world's two largest economies, China and the United States have a responsibility to protect global peace and stability and promote global prosperity, Hua added.
""We urge the U.S. side to stop intentionally distorting China's strategic intentions.""
In a new national security strategy based on U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" vision on Monday, the United States lumped China and Russia together as competitors seeking to erode U.S. security and prosperity. 
The singling out of China and Russia as ""revisionist powers"" comes despite Trump's own attempts to build strong relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping as the two sides seek to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
The new U.S. strategy reflects an unwillingness to accept the reality of China's rise, the state-run Global Times said in an editorial. 
""But because of the enormous size and strength China has already achieved, they won't be able to suppress China,"" the widely-read newspaper said.
However, Trump was basically reiterating his standard line on China rather than threatening any specific action, said Shi Yinhong, head of the Centre for American Studies at Beijing's Renmin University.
""Since he took office the Chinese government's line on Trump has always been: Don't really look at what he says, but look at what he does,"" said Shi, who has advised the government on diplomacy.
""So the strong words against China in the report the Chinese government won't really care about."" 
A senior U.S. administration official said China was attempting to revise the global status quo through its aggression in the South China Sea. 
China says its expansion of islets in the South China Sea is for peaceful purposes only and it can, in any case, do what it wants, as it has irrefutable sovereignty there.

The U.S. administration also warned that intellectual property theft by China was a national security problem.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Tuesday he would use a special order that gives the military sweeping powers to lift a ban on political activity that has been in place since a 2014 coup, paving the way for a 2018 general election.
Major political parties had urged the government for months to lift the ban to allow parties to prepare for the vote and the announcement won some applause from government critics.
Prayuth, who is also head of the junta, has said that Thailand will hold an election in November 2018 - news that was largely welcomed by investors in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy.
""The government will have to use Article 44 to solve this problem (political activity deadlock),"" Prayuth told reporters, referring to a constitutional clause that grants the military absolute powers.
Prayuth did not say when the order would take effect.
According to the usual procedure, executive orders must be published in the Royal Gazette before they can become law.
Thanawut Wichaidit, spokesman for the red-shirt United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship which opposes military rule and has made statements critical of the junta, said the announcement was ""the first step for elections and democracy"".
""It's definitely a good thing,"" he said, adding that the junta should also lift a ban on public gatherings.
The military has been running Thailand since the May 2014 coup when it ousted the civilian government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, ending years of political turmoil, including pro- and anti-government street protests. 
A coup in 2006 ousted Yingluck's brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose supporters have dominated the polls since 2001.
The 2014 coup saw some Western countries downgrade ties with Bangkok. Earlier this month, the European Union said it would resume political contact ""at all levels"" with Thailand after putting relations on hold.

That announcement came after Prayuth said in October that a general election would he held next November.

Such grants require counterpart funding from the Philippines for MCC-financed projects, but presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the government wanted to channel resources into rebuilding Marawi, a southern city devastated in fighting between the military and Islamist insurgents this year.
""It was deemed that for the time being, we will withdraw our application for the second cycle and we will focus instead on the rebuilding of Marawi,"" Roque said.
""We have to re-allocate our resources and priority to the rebuilding of Marawi.""
The issue of aid has been contentious in the Philippines of late, with President Rodrigo Duterte objecting to donors attaching conditions to their help, and especially to any expressions of concern about human rights.
Nearly 4,000 people have been killed by police since June last year. Police reject allegations they are executing drug users and dealers and say killings were all in self-defense.
Several thousand other people have been killed in mysterious circumstances, with the police usually attributing those deaths to gang violence.
In August, the MCC upheld the eligibility of the Philippines to secure a fresh grant, after initially deferring a vote on its re-selection for help amid concern about the staggering death toll in Duterte's ferocious war on drugs.
The Southeast Asian country' graft-fighting efforts are also on the spotlight after it fell short of the ""control of corruption"" target on the MCC's scorecard.
But Roque was quick to point out that the decision to withdraw the application for another MCC grant had nothing to do with such issues.
He said the government would ""probably"" apply for another MCC grant in future.
This year, his government rejected about 250 million euros ($295 million) in European Union grants.

Officials of the MCC, which describes itself on its website as an independent U.S. foreign aid agency created by the U.S. Congress in 2004, were not available for comment.

1177,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 01:48AM ET</span>",Japan to expand ballistic missile defense with ground-based Aegis batteries,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan formally decided on Tuesday it would expand its ballistic missile defense system with U.S.-made ground-based Aegis radar stations and interceptors in response to a growing threat from North Korean rockets.
A proposal to build two Aegis Ashore batteries was approved by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Cabinet.
The sites without the missiles will likely cost at least $2 billion and are not likely to be operational until 2023 at the earliest, sources familiar with the plan told Reuters earlier.
""North Korea's nuclear missile development poses a new level of threat to Japan and as we have done in the past we will ensure that we are able to defend ourselves with a drastic improvement in ballistic missile defense,"" Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera told reporters after the Cabinet meeting. 
The decision to acquire the ground version of the Aegis missile-defense system, which is already deployed on Japanese warships, was widely expected.
North Korea on Nov. 29 tested a new, more powerful ballistic missile that it says can hit major U.S. cities including Washington, and fly over Japan's current defense shield.
That rocket reached an altitude of more than 4,000 km (2,485 miles), well above the range of interceptor missiles on Japanese ships operating in the Sea of Japan.
North Korea says its weapons programs are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. 
The new Aegis stations may not, however, come with a powerful radar, dubbed Spy-6, which is being developed by the United States. 
Without it, Japan will not be able to fully utilize the extended range of a new interceptor missile, the SM-3 Block IIA, which cost about $30 million each. 
A later upgrade, once the U.S. military has deployed Spy-6 on its ships around 2022, could prove a costly proposition for Japan as outlays on new equipment squeeze its military budget.
Initial funding will be ring-fenced in the next defense budget beginning in April, but no decision has been made on the radar, or the overall cost, or schedule, of the deployment, a Ministry of Defence official said at a press briefing.
Japan's military planners also evaluated the U.S.-built THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system before deciding on Aegis Ashore. 
Separately, Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera said this month Japan would acquire medium-range cruise missiles it can launch from its F-15 and F-35 fighters at sites in North Korea, in a bid to deter any attack. 

The purchase of what will become the longest-range munitions in Japan's military arsenal is controversial because it renounced the right to wage war against other nations in its post-World War Two constitution.

YOKOSUKA (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy's top officer on Tuesday said that vessels from eastern Pacific could be brought forward to reinforce U.S. naval power in Asia as Washington contends with increased threats in the region and accidents that have weakened its maritime force.
""We will continue to assure that we meet all of our missions here in the Asia Pacific area. It could be something coming forward from Third Fleet or something like that to meet those requirements,"" Chief of U.S. Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said at a briefing aboard the USS Ronald Reagan carrier in Japan. He declined to say when or how many ships could be transferred.
The growing threat posed by North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear weapon advances coupled with operations to counter China's increasing military might in the South China Sea and other parts of Asia is putting an increased burden on the U.S. Seventh Fleet. 
That added pressure on crews has been blamed for contributing to a series of accidents involving naval vessels this year including collisions by two destroyers with merchant ships that killed 17 U.S. sailors.
In August the USS John S.McCain guided missile destroyer was struck by a merchant ship near Singapore, while its sister ship, the Fitzgerald, almost sank off the coast of Japan in June after colliding with a Philippine container ship. 
Richardson spoke after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a new national security strategy based on his ""America First"" vision that singled out China and Russia as ""revisionist powers."" For its part, China is attempting to revise the global status quo by its aggression in the South China Sea, a U.S. official said.
Beijing is building military bases there on manmade islands in waters claimed by other nations. 
""One can only draw certain conclusion about what are the intentions of the Chinese with respect to those islands. We will respond as we have always done, which is that we are going to continue to be present down there,"" Richardson said. 
For now, he said, North Korea was the ""most urgent"" task for the U.S. Navy in Asia as it became ""more and more capable"" with every new missile test. The latest ballistic missile tested on Nov. 29 reached an altitude of more than 4,000 kilometers (2485.48 miles), giving it enough-range, Pyongyang claims, to hit major U.S. cities including Washington D.C. 
Richardson said his task in 2018 is to build a navy ""more lethal"" and ""dangerous"" to potential U.S. foes. 
""There is a near unanimous consensus that we need more naval power than we have now,"" he said.

Two fishermen picked up the Australians, who waved for help while clinging to a life buoy, about 50 miles (80 km) off a popular surfing town in Surigao province on Sunday.
Police in the provincial capital of Tandag said the men had been in the water for several days after the holed yacht capsized near the southern island of Mindanao while sailing to Subic Bay.

DENPASAR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian police have arrested an Australian, an American and a Malaysian on the holiday island of Bali for drugs offences, the latest foreigners to run afoul of some of the world's strictest laws against narcotics.
The three men, who were arrested in separate cases, appeared before the media at a briefing, dressed in orange prison garb, their faces concealed by balaclava, with armed police officers standing guard.
It was not immediately clear if any of the three, who were identified only by their initials, would face the death penalty if convicted.
Authorities found methamphetamine and the party drug ecstasy hidden in a plastic bottle and another container in the luggage of the Australian after he arrived on a flight from Bangkok on Monday, the customs office said.
""Based on the results of the inspection, our officers found five packages containing clear crystals weighing 19.97 grams and 14 tablets weighing a total of 6.22 grams,"" Bali Airport customs office chief Himawan Indrajono said in the statement.
Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was ""providing consular assistance to an Australian man detained in Bali"" in response to emailed questions on the arrest. It declined to comment further. 
The U.S. citizen was arrested at a Bali post office on Nov. 30 in connection with a package sent from the United States containing 336.6 grams of e-cigarette liquid containing THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient in cannabis.
The Malaysian was arrested on Nov. 8 after being found with 3.03 grams of leaves thought to be marijuana and 0.65 grams of a white powder suspected to be narcotics, Idrajono said.
Possession of small amounts of drugs can incur lengthy jail sentences in Indonesia and larger amounts can result in a death sentence.
The execution by firing squad of two Australians in 2015, along with six other drug convicts from several other countries, strained relations between Jakarta and Canberra.
Indonesia says it is facing a drug crisis with an estimated 6.4 million drug users in the country of 250 million people, and needs to impose tough punishments to contained the problem.
President Joko Widodo has called for a ""merciless"" crackdown on narcotics, and told law enforcers to shoot drug traffickers if they resisted arrest.
That echoes a tough stand taken by Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte who has ordered a war against drugs in which several thousand people have been killed since mid-2016.

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 01:00AM ET</span>",Australia's Turnbull goes rural in a cabinet reshuffle aimed at widening appeal,"By Byron Kaye and Elouise Fowler
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Tuesday named a new attorney general and promoted two junior lawmakers from rural Queensland state to his cabinet in a reshuffle he hopes will bolster his flagging popularity.
Australian leaders often revamp cabinets before the start of a new year but for center-right Turnbull the move is an attempt to salvage his leadership, ravaged by dismal opinion polls.
Last month, Turnbull's ruling Liberal-National coalition made its worst showing in a Queensland election in more than a decade, when it won 34 percent of the vote as Pauline Hanson's populist One Nation clawed into its conservative base. 
A large number of marginal seats in the country's third most populous state of Queensland often give its voters a crucial say in deciding federal elections.
The reshuffle was sparked by the resignation of Attorney General George Brandis from the Senate. Turnbull said he would ask Brandis to be the country's next High Commissioner, or ambassador, to the United Kingdom.
Turnbull gave cabinet positions to Queenslanders John McVeigh and David Littleproud, who both took office 18 months ago.
He dropped infrastructure minister Darren Chester, from the urban state of Victoria, giving the portfolio to deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, the leader of the Nationals, which features prominently in Queensland.
""It's a ministry that showcases the depth of the Liberal and National team, with well-earned promotions for talented individuals, a number of young and upcoming MPs bringing new skills and energy to the frontbench,"" Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.
Asked why he removed Chester, whose duties included running the Australian part of the fruitless search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, Turnbull said his cabinet had ""to take into account matters of geography"", but did not elaborate.
The pitch to voters in the northeastern state of Queensland was obvious, said Stewart Jackson, a specialist in Australian politics at the University of Sydney. 
""Everybody's been spooked by One Nation,"" Jackson said. ""The emphasis will shift back towards Queensland where the National Party was traditionally strong.""
The overhaul also brings youth into a government that has narrowly retained its razor-thin majority in parliament after a constitutional crisis triggered a series of by-elections.
The two promoted Queenslanders, Littleproud and McVeigh, are 41 and 52 respectively. The new attorney general, social services minister Christian Porter, from the iron ore-rich state of Western Australia, is 47.
Employment minister Michaelia Cash, who takes the expanded title of minister for jobs and innovation, and Nationals member Bridget McKenzie, who joins cabinet as minister for sport, rural health and regional communications, are also 47.
Turnbull gave no reason for the departure of Brandis after 17 years, but called him a ""stalwart"" who had backed tougher national security laws and the legalization of same-sex marriage, a measure parliament passed this month.
In 2015, when Turnbull unseated then prime minister Tony Abbott, he said the move was necessary because Abbott's government had lost 30 opinion polls in a row. Under Turnbull, the government has lost 25 opinion polls in a row.

Many commentators say that if the figure reaches 30, which could happen as soon as March, Turnbull's party may consider removing him.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 08:50PM ET</span>",Peru opposition wants vice president to govern if president ousted: lawmaker,"LIMA (Reuters) - A leading Peruvian opposition lawmaker on Monday called for the country's Vice President Martin Vizcarra to govern the country if Congress ousts President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski over graft allegations he denies.
Enough political parties have committed to backing a motion to oust Kuczynski in a scheduled vote in the opposition-run Congress on Thursday.
Kuczynski has repeatedly said there was nothing improper about recently disclosed business ties that he once denied having with Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], a Brazilian builder at the center of Latin America's biggest corruption scandal. 
If Kuczynski does depart, Vizcarra would be authorized to carry out the rest of Kuczynski's scheduled 2016-2021 term.
Congresswoman Luz Salgado denied her party, Popular Force, which has a majority in Peru's single-chamber Congress, would seek to topple Vizcarra as charged by opponents.
""If he (Vizcarra) does his job well and assumes the role that history if offering to him, he'll have our corresponding support,"" said Salgado, a key leader in the party. ""We're thinking about what's best for the country. We're not trying to find fault in anyone.""
Kuczynski and Vizcarra's offices declined requests for comment.
No major policy changes are expected if Kuczynski were replaced by Vizcarra, a former governor of a copper-rich Andean region and Peru's current ambassador to Canada. 
But the political crisis has spooked investors in one of Latin America's most stable economies. ""It's going to have an important impact on the economy. Investments are going to be delayed,"" said Carlos Galvez, the chief financial officer of Peruvian miner Buenaventura.
A 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, Kuczynski was part of a rightward shift in South American politics when he was elected last year. His fight for survival underscores the risks facing political leaders with long business resumes as graft scandals roil the region.
Kuczynski has described Popular Force's efforts to unseat him as an authoritarian attack on institutions, and criticized the party for not giving him more time to defend himself.
""We look like a banana republic. Without a proper procedure, Congress is just usurping the presidency,"" Housing Minister Carlos Bruce told journalists on Monday.
Popular Force said it only hopes to uproot corruption and was acting within the bounds of the constitution.
The party emerged from the right-wing movement started by the country's former authoritarian president Alberto Fujimori, who is now in prison for graft and human rights crimes. It is now led by Kuczynski's defeated electoral rival Keiko Fujimori.
New elections, which would be the worst-case scenario for investors, would only be called if both Vizcarra and Second Vice President Mercedes Araoz leave office before 2021, a scenario Araoz ruled out in an interview with Reuters on Sunday.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - The elder son of former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin has been charged with assault and burglary in a violent confrontation with his father in which the two men struggled over a handgun at his parents' Alaska home, court records showed on Monday.
According to the criminal complaint and supporting documents, Track Palin, 28, broke through a window of the house in Wasilla, Alaska, and scuffled with his father, Todd Palin, on Saturday night in a clash that stemmed from a family dispute over a truck.
The altercation left Todd Palin bloodied and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin visibly shaken, police said in an affidavit filed with the charging documents in state court.
The incident marked the latest in a string of run-ins with the law by the politician's elder son, a U.S. Army Reserve veteran who served a 2008 tour of duty in Iraq.
Track Palin, who is now barred by court order from further contact with his parents and two younger siblings who live with them, remained jailed on Monday in lieu of $5,000 bail.
He was charged with a felony count of burglary with attempted injury and a misdemeanor assault count, according to court records.
The family's attorney, John Tiemessen, was not available for comment on Monday, but he issued a statement on Sunday asking that the Palins' privacy be respected. Court records do not list a defense attorney of record in the case.
It was Sarah Palin who called police to report that her elder son was assaulting his father and ""freaking out and was on some type of medication,"" the police affidavit stated.
Todd Palin later recounted the conflict started when his son called to say he was coming to the house to get a truck, and the father objected, prompting the son to threaten that he was en route ""anyway to beat his ass,"" the affidavit said.
The father armed himself with a pistol as he waited for his son to arrive, but ultimately, the affidavit said, ""Todd decided he was not going to shoot his son"" and was disarmed by the younger Palin as the two struggled.
Track Palin told police after his arrest, according to the affidavit, that his father had pointed the gun at him, and that the son goaded his father to shoot him. It said he admitted to drinking a few beers earlier that night.
Sarah Palin, who was Republican Senator John McCain's vice presidential running mate in his failed 2008 White House bid, has cited her son's past legal woes in publicly questioning the adequacy of support for military veterans who may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
In 2016, her son faced several charges related to domestic violence, including using a weapon while intoxicated, court records show. The case was resolved in a special veterans' court with a conviction on a misconduct charge.

His involvement in a booze-fueled brawl at a family gathering in 2014 also drew wide attention. Authorities did not file criminal charges in the incident.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - An activist investor in  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) said on Monday it filed a shareholder resolution that would require the oil producer to report on the feasibility of ending operations in Myanmar, where a crackdown on minority Rohingya Muslims has been decried by the United States as ""ethnic cleansing.""
The resolution, filed last week by Islamic finance firm Azzad Asset Management, pushes Chevron's board of directors to consider how it could avoid risks ""posed by doing business with governments complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity.""
Azzad filed a similar resolution at the last Chevron shareholder meeting, garnering support from 6 percent of votes cast.
More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to southern Bangladesh since the end of August following a campaign by Myanmar security forces in response to attacks by militants in Rakhine State. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and United Nations officials have decried the crackdown as a form of genocide. 
Myanmar denies committing atrocities against the Rohingya. 
Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, does business in Myanmar through a subsidiary, Unocal Myanmar Offshore Co Ltd. It has projects that include a minority interest in natural gas production and a pipeline, according to the company's website.
In a statement to Reuters on Monday, Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie said the company ""values the ongoing dialogue with the stockholders on this critical issue of violence in Rakhine State, Myanmar.
""We will continue to work with other U.S. companies and the government to promote the value of U.S. investment in Myanmar and the need to foster a business environment that respects human rights.""
Chevron has the option of accepting the proposal or asking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow it to block it. If Chevron moves to block, Azzad would have the chance to appeal to the SEC. Chevron's annual meeting is slated for next spring. 
The filing comes as two Reuters journalists were arrested by Myanmar officials last week. Government officials accuse the pair of violating the country's colonial-era Officials Secrets Act. The arrests have been criticized by several governments as well as journalists' and human rights groups.

Chevron declined to directly comment on the arrests.

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 06:10PM ET</span>",Austrian leader to defend EU credentials in Brussels,"By Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Austria's new chancellor travels to Brussels on Tuesday on his first foreign trip since being sworn in, determined to dispel concerns that his coalition with the far-right spells trouble for the European Union.
Responding to a letter on Monday from European Council President Donald Tusk that underlined EU concerns, 31-year-old conservative leader Sebastian Kurz tweeted back that his new government would be ""clear pro-European and committed to making a positive contribution to the future development of the EU"".
A day after he took office at the head of a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party, Kurz will deliver that message in person on Tuesday evening to Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, whose EU executive has responded to October's election with little of the outrage that greeted the FPO's first taste of government 17 years ago. 
The FPO has distanced itself from its Nazi-apologist, anti-Semitic past, while surges in irregular immigration and militant attacks have pushed the European political mainstream rightward, leading to a much more muted reaction than in 2000.
Juncker's spokesman would not be drawn on Monday on what the Commission, which back then floated a boycott of Austria, would be saying or doing. He did, however, make clear that Kurz making Brussels his first foreign trip in office was a welcome gesture.
Austria's member of the Commission, a center-right ally of Kurz, called it a ""good start for proactive EU policy"".
But his French colleague was wary: ""Things are doubtless different from the previous time, in 2000,"" tweeted Socialist former finance minister Pierre Moscovici. ""But the presence of the far-right in government is never without consequences.""
CONCERNS
Confirmation of the FPO's return to a share of power raises concern that small, wealthy Austria will be an intractable voice on EU asylum reform and efforts to increase the EU budget.
The bluntest criticism so far has been south of the Alps, where a plan to offer Austrian citizenship to people living in Italy's German-speaking border region has rekindled worries over old territorial arguments. A junior foreign minister in Rome said the offer may be couched in a ""velvet glove of Europeanism"" but bore ""a whiff of the ethno-nationalist iron fist"".
For a Union battered by mounting nationalism that goes well beyond Brexit, there is concern too that criticism of Brussels in Vienna can help fuel the euroskepticism of Austria's formerly communist neighbors in Central Europe, including Poland, where the Commission is seriously considering imposing sanctions that were designed in response to the FPO's rise early this century.
In a letter of congratulation to Kurz, Tusk made clear his concerns about the new coalition in Austria:

""I trust that the Austrian government will continue to play a constructive and pro-European role in the European Union,"" Tusk wrote, noting that Austria will from July enjoy six months of influence in Brussels as chair of EU ministerial councils.
Germany and France, the EU's lead powers, also indicated a vigilance about Austria in their comments on Monday which highlighted Kurz's pledges to foster European cooperation. 
Kurz's visit to Brussels comes on the eve of an important Commission meeting on Wednesday where Juncker's team will consider recommending sanctions on Poland for its continued to defiance of warnings that new laws on the judiciary are contrary to EU democratic standards.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia poses an increasing threat and is willing to use propaganda, subversion and cyber-attacks to undermine Britain and the rest of Europe, Britain's national security adviser said on Monday.
Mark Sedwill, who is overseeing a review of Britain's security services, told a parliamentary committee that Russia is attempting to ""sow dissension"" and undermine democracy in Britain and other western nations. 
He said the threats from Russia included from unconventional warfare such as disinformation campaigns to the dangers posed from an increase in its military capability in the North Atlantic and in Eastern Europe. 
""We know that the Russian threat is definitely intensifying and diversifying,"" Sedwill said. ""The Russian attitude has worsened more generally towards the West and that seems set to continue.""
Britain has been more vocal in recent weeks about the threat posed by Russia at a time when there is growing concern among some members of the ruling Conservative party about the impact of cuts to defense spending.
Prime Minister Theresa May last month in her most outspoken attack on Russia accused the country of meddling in elections and planting fake stories in the media. 
The head of Britain's armed forces said last week trade and the internet are at risk of damage from any Russian attack on underwater communications cables that could disrupt trillions of dollars in financial transactions. 
Sedwill accused Russia of planting fake stories in the media about the conduct of soldiers in Eastern Europe, where NATO troops are based to undermine the legitimacy of them being there. 
He also accused Russia of meddling in the recent French elections even though he said this had no chance of changing the outcome of the vote.
""It clearly was designed to undermine the citizen's trust in their systems and we see quite a lot elsewhere,"" he said.

Several separatists were killed by security forces in ensuing clashes, the government spokesman said.
Repression by President Paul Biya's government against what began as peaceful protests a year ago by Anglophone activists over perceived social and economic marginalization has bolstered support for armed militants demanding a full break with Yaounde.
The separatists have launched a series of deadly raids on government police and soldiers in recent weeks, leading authorities to escalate a crackdown that has killed dozens of civilians.
Issa Tchiroma Bakary, Cameroon's government spokesman, said the separatists had killed four gendarmes earlier on Monday in the town of Kembong in Southwest region's Manyu Division.
""The assailants, ensnared by the measures put in place by our defense and security forces, are now reduced to sporadic attacks carried out by hidden faces and using perfidy,"" Tchiroma said.
A representative for the separatists could not be immediately reached for comment.
Manyu, with its dense equatorial forests along the Nigerian border, has become the center of the insurgency from which the separatists have launched a series of attacks on security forces in villages.
The violence there has fueled a mounting refugee crisis. At least 7,500 people have crossed into Nigeria since Oct. 1, when the secessionists declared an independent state called Ambazonia, and the U.N. refugee agency says it is bracing itself for as many as 40,000. 
Cameroon's linguistic divide harks back to the end of World War One, when the German colony of Kamerun was carved up between allied French and British victors.
The English-speaking regions joined the French-speaking Republic of Cameroon the year after its independence in 1960. French speakers have dominated the country's politics since.
Tensions have long simmered but the recent violence is the most serious to date and has emerged as a serious challenge to Biya's 35-year rule. The 84-year-old is expected to seek a new term in an election next year.

In a wide-ranging speech, Trump said his security strategy for the first time addresses economic security and would include a complete rebuilding of U.S. infrastructure as well as a wall along the southern U.S. border.
Trump said the United States wanted Pakistan to take decisive action to help fight extremism, and that Washington had ""no choice"" but to deal with the challenge posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
Trump said the security strategy would also end mandatory defense spending limits, frequently called ""sequester,"" but did not mention if he had consulted with members of Congress about a possible bill to end the caps established in 2013 budget legislation.
""We recognize that weakness is the surest path to conflict and unrivaled power is the most certain means of defense. For this reason, our security strategy breaks from damaging defense sequester,"" Trump said. ""We're going to get rid of that.""

The idea was included in a 180-page coalition program signed on Saturday after weeks of negotiations by Austria's anti-immigration Freedom Party and the conservative People's Party.
The accord risked tearing at fragile ethnic fault lines which run through the autonomous area of Alto Adige, also known as the South Tyrol.
""Get your hands off Italy,"" said Giorgia Meloni, the head of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party, which is part of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's center-right opposition bloc.
""Brothers of Italy will raise the barricades in Alto Adige, in parliament and in every institution, and will ask President (Sergio) Mattarella to stop this undignified insult,"" she said in a statement.
Alto Adige was ceded to Italy by Austria after World War One. Despite moves by Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini to settle thousands of ethnic Italians there in the 1920s, German speakers still outnumber Italians by around two to one.
Italians and Germans have their own schools and largely frequent different bars and restaurants. But the region enjoys enormous autonomy and generous handouts from Rome, which have helped dampen secessionist sentiments in the province.
The new Austrian government portrayed its plan to offer citizenship to Alto Adige residents whose first language is German as a pro-European gesture to promote ""an ever-closer union of citizens of member states"".
Benedetto Della Vedova, a junior foreign minister in Rome, dismissed this, saying the offer was couched in a ""velvet glove of Europeanism"" but bore the ""scent of the ethno-nationalist iron fist"".
Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano was more cautious, saying he would raise the matter at a later date. ""It will be a conversation that requires enormous delicacy,"" he was quoted as saying by ANSA agency during a visit to China.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 02:31PM ET</span>",Powerful Afghan regional leader ousted as political picture clouds,"KABUL (Reuters) - One of Afghanistan's most powerful regional politicians was ousted as governor of the northern province of Balkh on Monday, setting up a confrontation that adds to the uncertainty around President Ashraf Ghani's Western-backed government.
Atta Mohammad Noor is one of the leading figures in Jamiat-e-Islami, a party which mainly represents Afghanistan's Tajik ethnic group, and has used his position in Balkh, on the northern border of the country, as a powerbase to push for a major role on the national stage.
His removal, at a time when tensions between Tajiks and Pashtuns, Afghanistan's two biggest ethnic groups, have been rising, injects extra uncertainty to the already fractured political landscape ahead of presidential elections in 2019.
""My dismissal has no legal or legitimate basis,"" Noor said on Afghan national television. ""For now we are only resorting to civil action but if this atrocity continues, there are many other options.""
Atta Noor is one of a clutch of powerful regional and ethnic leaders whom Ghani has struggled to control since he came to office after the disputed election of 2014. Ghani, a Pashtun, has tried previously to remove him but also discussed a possible role in the government for him.
He submitted his resignation several months ago but the move never took effect until Ghani approved it on Monday, announcing at the same time that Mohammad Daoud, also from Jamiat, would become the next governor of Balkh province. 
""The Afghan president has accepted Atta Mohammad Noor's resignation and announced Engineer Mohammad Daoud as the new governor,"" Shah Hussain Murtazawi a spokesman for Ghani said.
In his remarks on Monday, Atta Noor, who has demanded a number of senior positions in the government for some of his allies, said the resignation had been offered with conditions attached and said these had not been respected.
""Since they didn't meet their responsibilities, I don't accept it,"" he said.
Ghani's national unity government, formed after the 2014 election forced him into an uneasy power-sharing arrangement with his former rival Abdullah Abdullah from Jamiat, retains the support of the international community and the United States.
But it has faced mounting criticism from a growing array of opposition groups.
Parliamentary elections originally due to be held next year are in doubt and former President Hamid Karzai has called for a loya jirga, or traditional grand council of political leaders and elders to decide the future of the government.

The confrontation with Atta Noor comes several months after a standoff with Vice President Rashid Dostum over accusations of the sexual abuse of a political opponent. Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek leader and veteran of decades of Afghan politics, has been in Turkey since May, ostensibly for medical treatment.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States was further isolated on Monday over President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital when it blocked a United Nations Security Council call for the declaration to be withdrawn.
The remaining 14 council members voted in favor of the Egyptian-drafted resolution, which did not specifically mention the United States or Trump but which expressed ""deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem.""
""What we witnessed here in the Security Council is an insult. It won't be forgotten,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said after the vote, adding that it was the first veto cast by the United States in more than six years.
""The fact that this veto is being done in defense of American sovereignty and in defense of America's role in the Middle East peace process is not a source of embarrassment for us; it should be an embarrassment to the remainder of the Security Council,"" Haley said.
The U.N. draft resolution affirmed ""that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council.""
Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, generating outrage from Palestinians and the Arab world and concern among Washington's western allies.
""In the wake of the decision of the United States ... the situation has become more tense with an increase in incidents, notably rockets fired from Gaza and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces,"" U.N. Middle East peace envoy Nickolay Mladenov told the Security Council ahead of the vote.
EMERGENCY GENERAL ASSEMBLY SESSION 
Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. The draft U.N. resolution had called upon all countries to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Haley and Trump for the veto in a video clip posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city's eastern sector, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.
Following the U.S. veto, Egypt's Foreign Ministry said Arab states, which had agreed earlier this month to seek a Security Council resolution, would meet to evaluate the situation to determine what their next steps might be.
Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said the Palestinians would seek a rare emergency special session of the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on Trump's decision.
Under a 1950 resolution, an emergency special session can be called for the General Assembly to consider a matter ""with a view to making appropriate recommendations to members for collective measures"" if the Security Council fails to act.

Only 10 such sessions have been convened, and the last time the General Assembly met in such a session was in 2009 on Israeli actions in occupied Palestinian territories. Any outcome of such a session is non-binding, but carries political weight.

Visiting troops in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, von der Leyen criticized the rapid reduction in forces since the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) ended its mission in Afghanistan in 2014 but said the international community had now learned it needed to be more patient.
""I haven't forgotten how it was at the beginning when we got out of ISAF too quickly with too big a reduction in troop numbers,"" she said, adding that everyone knew the security situation in Afghanistan remained tense.
She said Afghans continued to need support, advice and training from foreign soldiers, adding: ""There's still a lot to do but I'm convinced that we're going in the right direction with our mission there.""
""We'll need to have a lot of stamina - Afghanistan will occupy us for a long time yet,"" von der Leyen said.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced a new open-ended policy toward Afghanistan in August, authorizing an increase in U.S. troop numbers to advise and train Afghan security forces and conduct counter-terrorism operations, with the aim of reversing territorial gains by Taliban insurgents and compelling them to agree to peace talks.
At the peak of the ISAF mission around 150,000 foreign soldiers were deployed in Hindu Kush compared with around 17,000 now - of which 10,000 are Americans.
U.S. officials are pressing Germany to send more troops to Afghanistan as part of the increased international presence but say they do not expect any decisions until after the formation of a new German government.

The German parliament voted last week to extend by three months Germany's military support for the Afghanistan mission to allow a new government to consider a longer-term extension.

The statement came several days after Reuters reported that the United States was suspending food and fuel aid for most of Somalia's armed forces over corruption concerns.
That announcement was a blow to the military, who will begin losing the support of African peacekeepers when they start to withdraw this month. Islamist insurgents are striking with ever-larger and more deadly attacks in the capital and major towns.
""I hereby certify that if a thing is halted, as a government we shall put effort five hundred percent so that the suspension does not affect anyone, President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed said in an address to military officials at the defense ministry that was broadcast on local radio.
""Whether it is salary or equipment, the government will bring what it can, he said. ""I am telling you that we should depend on ourselves. We thank the foreigners who were supporting us. If they mentioned criticism, we are required to rectify.""
The president did not mention a specific donor's support, but added: ""If you have someone who is ready to lend you a hand, you have to avoid things that can bring suspicion.""
Reuters reported that the U.S. has grown frustrated that successive governments have failed to build a capable national army.

Documents seen by Reuters paint a stark picture of a military hollowed out by corruption, unable to feed, pay or arm its soldiers, despite hundreds of millions of dollars of support.

The incident in August 2015 provoked an outcry in the East African country after images of the half-naked 18-year-old schoolgirl were posted on social media.
She pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana shortly after the incident and was sentenced to 18 months on probation.
In the lawsuit she later filed jointly with a child rights group, the young woman said the photos humiliated her and sought legal compensation. 
Kenyan high court judge John Mativo said in his ruling that the student was entitled to the four million shillings ($38,815) because her constitutional rights to dignity had been violated.
The student had been traveling with more than 40 others on a bus home for the holidays when she was stopped by the police. 
The court's ruling is a rare victory in the East African country's legal system against the police. Although no police officers were tried or found guilty in the case, the ruling was an acknowledgment of wrongdoing. 
A government civilian body exists to oversee the police, but few officers are charged and convictions are extremely rare.

1200,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 02:00PM ET</span>",'Nearly man' Ramaphosa edges closer to South Africa's top job,"By Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The nearly man of South African politics, deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, took a big step towards the top job on Monday when he was elected by a whisker as head of the ruling African National Congress (ANC).
Ramaphosa's ability has been apparent for decades. Whenever Nelson Mandela needed a breakthrough in talks to end apartheid, he turned to the then-trade union leader with a reputation as a tenacious negotiator.
Using skills honed in pay disputes with mining bosses, Ramaphosa steered those talks to a successful conclusion, allowing Mandela to sweep to power in 1994 as head of the victorious ANC after South Africa's first democratic vote.
Mandela wanted Ramaphosa to be his heir but was pressured into picking Thabo Mbeki by a group of ANC leaders who had fought apartheid from exile.
It has taken more than two decades for Ramaphosa to get another chance to run the country.
Monday's party vote, which handed him victory by less than 200 of nearly 5,000 ballots, puts that goal firmly within the 65-year-old's grasp. The rand surged as much as 4 percent, suggesting approval of the business community.
""Ramaphosa's ambition for the presidency has been clear through his whole adult life. He was quite clearly wounded by his materialization in the Mbeki period,"" said Anthony Butler, a politics professor who has written a biography of Ramaphosa.
The choice of Ramaphosa over his main rival for the ANC's top job, former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, is likely to chart a reformist course for South Africa, which has lost its lustre under President Jacob Zuma. 
A lawyer with an easygoing manner, Ramaphosa has vowed to fight corruption and revitalize an economy that has slowed to a near-standstill under Zuma's scandal-plagued leadership.
His message went down well with foreign investors and ANC members who thought Zuma's handling of the economy could cost the party dearly in 2019 parliamentary elections.
Dlamini-Zuma promised a radical brand of wealth redistribution popular with poorer ANC voters who are angry at racial inequality. 
While Ramaphosa has backed calls for ""radical economic transformation"", an ANC plan to tackle inequality, he tends to couch his policy pronouncements in more cautious terms.
LABOR LEADER
Unlike Zuma or Dlamini-Zuma, Ramaphosa was not driven into exile for opposing apartheid, which some of the party's more hardline members hold against him.
He fought the injustices of white minority rule from within South Africa, most prominently by defending the rights of black miners as leader of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).
A member of the relatively small Venda ethnic group, Ramaphosa was able to overcome divisions that sometimes constrained members of the larger Zulu and Xhosa groups.
A massive miners' strike led by Ramaphosa's NUM in 1987 taught business that ""Cyril was a force to be reckoned with,"" said Michael Spicer, a former executive at  Anglo American  (LON:AAL).
""He has a shrewd understanding of men and power and knows how to get what he wants from a situation,"" Spicer said.
The importance of Ramaphosa's contribution to the talks to end apartheid is such that commentators have referred to them in two distinct stages: BC and AC, Before Cyril and After Cyril. 
Ramaphosa also played an important role in the drafting of South Africa's post-apartheid constitution. 
INVESTOR FAVORITE
After missing out on becoming Mandela's deputy, Ramaphosa withdrew from active political life, switching focus to business.
His investment vehicle Shanduka - Venda for ""change"" - grew rapidly and acquired stakes in mining firms, mobile operator MTN and McDonald's South African franchise.
Phuti Mahanyele, a former chief executive at Shanduka, recalled that Ramaphosa was a passionate leader who required staff to contribute to charitable projects aimed at improving access to education for the underprivileged.
By the time Ramaphosa sold out of Shanduka in 2014, the firm was worth more than 8 billion rand ($584 million in today's money), making Ramaphosa one of South Africa's 20 richest people.
To his supporters, Ramaphosa's business success makes him well-suited to the task of turning around an economy grappling with 28 percent unemployment and credit rating downgrades.
In the Johannesburg township of Soweto last month, Ramaphosa called for a ""new deal"" between business and government to spur economic growth.
Pravin Gordhan, a respected former finance minister, told Reuters that if Ramaphosa was elected ANC leader, ""the whole narrative about South Africa's economy would change for the better within three months"".
But Ramaphosa has his detractors too.
He was a non-executive director at Lonmin when negotiations to halt a violent wildcat strike at its Marikana platinum mine in 2012 ended in police shooting 34 strikers dead. An inquiry subsequently absolved Ramaphosa of guilt. But some families of the victims still blame him for urging the authorities to intervene. 
""My conscience is that I participated in trying to stop further deaths from happening,"" Ramaphosa said about the deaths. Others are unconvinced that Ramaphosa, who has been deputy president since 2014, will be as tough on corruption as his campaign rhetoric suggests.
Bantu Holomisa, an opposition politician and former ANC member who worked closely with him in the 1990s, said he was by nature cautious.
""Cyril has been part of the machinery and has not acted on corruption so far,"" Holomisa said. ""It is not clear whether he will if he gets elected.""

The appeal argues that the ruling accepted a racist Kuwaiti law and allowed the airline to override German laws requiring that airlines transport any passenger with valid travel documents, according to the Lawfare Project, which filed the appeal.
""We cannot allow our laws to be subverted by the state-sponsored racism of other nations,"" said Nathan Gelbart, the German attorney for the group, which fights anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli discrimination around the world.
He said the decision by the Frankfurt district court had allowed ""anti-Semitic discrimination to be imported into our country and helped whitewash and sanitize it.""
Kuwait Airways has not commented on the decision.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have vowed to fight anti-Semitism and xenophobia with the full force of the law in recent weeks after protests that included the burning of Israeli flags. 
Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said Germany had a historic responsibility to stand by Israel and Jews everywhere.
Anti-Semitism remains a sensitive issue in Germany, one of Israel's closest allies, more than 70 years after the end of the Nazi-era Holocaust, in which six million Jews were killed.
The Frankfurt court last month ruled Kuwait Airways had the right to refuse to carry the Israeli man on a flight to Bangkok that began in Frankfurt and included a stopover in Kuwait City since it was abiding by the laws of Kuwait, a country that does not recognize the state of Israel.
It said Germany's anti-discrimination law applied only in cases of discrimination on the basis of race, ethnic background or religion, not citizenship.
The ruling was sharply criticized by German government officials and the Central Council of Jews in Germany, which said the Kuwaiti law was reminiscent of Nazi policies.
Three German state parliaments in Bavaria, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia, have passed resolutions condemning the airline for its policy.
Acting Transportation Minister Christian Schmidt also raised concerns about the issue in a letter to Kuwaiti officials, saying it was ""fundamentally unacceptable to exclude citizens because of their nationality,"" according to the Lawfare Project.
No comment was immediately available from Schmidt's office. A foreign ministry spokesman said Germany's ambassador to Kuwait had met Kuwaiti officials on Nov. 28 to deliver the letter and discuss the issue.
A spate of anti-Semitic acts in Germany in recent weeks, including the burning of Israeli flags, have triggered concern and calls by top officials to put more emphasis on the Holocaust in integration courses for migrants.
Rights groups say anti-Semitism and violent acts have increased in recent years amid growing support for far-right political groups and the influx of over a million migrants from Syria and other countries that are at war with Israel.

PARIS (Reuters) - The Kremlin-funded Russian broadcaster RT was due to launch its French language news channel on Monday night amid heavy suspicion by the government and President Emmanuel Macron who has dubbed it ""an organ of propaganda"".
Macron has led official criticism of RT, formerly known as ""Russia Today"", and openly accused it of sowing disinformation about him via its website and social media during the presidential election earlier this year which he won.
RT has denied the allegations and RT France's chief executive Xenia Fedorova, speaking at the channel's new offices in a western Paris suburb, again brushed off criticism, saying that RT stood for news ""not covered by mainstream media"".
The channel was being cold-shouldered by Macron and the channel had still not been granted accreditation to cover news conferences inside the French presidential Elysee palace, Fedorova said on Monday a few hours before the channel was due to start broadcasting.
""There was just one example of when we actually managed to visit. That was actually during the Trump visit to Paris,"" she added, referring to the visit by the U.S. president last in July. 
A spokesman for the French government said last week that the current administration was concerned by encroachment on freedom of expression but highlighted that RT was owned by a foreign power. 
Fedorova brushed off the remarks, citing other well-known international news channels that receive public funding such as BBC World, France 24 or Al Jazeera. 
""RT stands for news that are not covered by the mainstream media,"" she said. 
""We will keep the platform (open) to perspectives and opinions that are either not covered or silenced.""
CROWDED LANDSCAPE 
RT France has planned a budget of 20 million euros ($24 million) for its launch and aims to recruit a total of 150 people by the end next year. 
By comparison, BFM TV, France's number one news channel, started with 15 million euros and now has an annual budget of about 60 million euros. 
RT's first international channel was launched in December 2005. The network broadcasts in English, Arabic and Spanish and its programs are viewed by 70 million people in 38 countries, it says. 
The landscape for news channels is already crowded in France, with four round-the-clock local news channels. Unlike its rivals, RT will not reach all French households via the digital terrestrial television technology.
Rather, it can be viewed only online or by subscribers of Iliad's broadband services.  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom is also due to distribute RT France from the end of next February. 
The two biggest French telecom operators, Orange and Altice's SFR Group, are still in discussions with RT France, the firms said, underscoring the low audience level that RT is likely to have in its first few days.
Russia's international news outlets have come under the spotlight since 2016 after being accused of meddling in the U.S. presidential election. 
Russia has denied interfering in the election. 
In October, Twitter accused RT and Russian news agency Sputnik of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 01:43PM ET</span>",U.S. appeals judge steps down amid harassment inquiry,"By Jan Wolfe
(Reuters) - Alex Kozinski, a renowned U.S. federal appeals court judge based in San Francisco, resigned on Monday after the court's chief judge initiated an inquiry into harassment accusations, Kozinski said in a statement. 
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge said he was retiring immediately from the lifetime appointment to avoid being a distraction for the federal judiciary.
The Washington Post, which on Monday first reported the retirement, said earlier this month that six women had come forward to accuse Kozinski, 67, of subjecting them to inappropriate sexual conduct or comments. The newspaper followed with a second report with nine additional accusers. 
""Family and friends have urged me to stay on, at least long enough to defend myself. But I cannot be an effective judge and simultaneously fight this battle. Nor would such a battle be good for my beloved federal judiciary,"" Kozinski wrote in the statement, released by his lawyer. ""And so I am making the decision to retire, effective immediately."" 
The chief judge of the San Francisco-based court, Sidney Thomas, last week initiated an inquiry into the accusations by former law clerks and student externs against Kozinski.
The initiation of a complaint is not a finding of wrongdoing. Reuters has not verified any of the accusations.
Kozinski's statement said he has ""always had a broad sense of humor and a candid way of speaking to both male and female law clerks alike"" and ""may not have been mindful enough of the special challenges and pressures that women face in the workplace."" 
""It grieves me to learn that I caused any of my clerks to feel uncomfortable; this was never my intent,"" he said. 
There has been a wave of accusations in recent months of sexual harassment or other misconduct by prominent men in American politics, entertainment and media.
Circuit Court judges are just below the justices on the U.S. Supreme Court in their power to shape the country's law. Federal circuits hear appeals from federal trial courts within a larger geographic region. The 9th Circuit is the largest in the United States, covering nine Western states, including California, Arizona, Oregon and Washington.
Law students compete fiercely for clerkships with judges like Kozinski, which are considered highly prestigious and can affect a young lawyer's career prospects. 
Kozinski worked as a lawyer in President Ronald Reagan’s White House before being appointed to the appeals court in 1985.
A refugee from Romania and a self-described libertarian, Kozinski is known for his judicial opinions on free speech and due process rights of criminal defendants.
In a 2010 dissenting opinion, Kozinski wrote it was unconstitutional for police officers to use a GPS device to track a criminal suspect. Kozinski’s views in that case were later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.
In March, Kozinski criticized his fellow 9th Circuit judges for blocking President Donald Trump's travel ban targeting people from Muslim-majority countries, saying the president's campaign statements should not have been used as evidence of discriminatory intent. The U.S. Supreme Court in December allowed the latest version of the travel ban to go into effect.
A federal appeals court previously scolded but did not punish Kozinski for maintaining a personal server that contained some sexually explicit images that could be viewed by the public. In its 2009 report, the judiciary found Kozinski had not intended to make the images public and had removed them, but nevertheless had caused an embarrassment to the federal bench.

It is rare for accusations of misconduct against judges to result in impeachment, said Ronald Rotunda, a professor of legal ethics at Chapman University School of Law. But the latest misconduct proceeding against Kozinski could have resulted in a serious reprimand because of the ""tremendous nationwide publicity,"" Rotunda said.

5-Star, which leads in opinion polls ahead of an election expected in March, says if it wins power it will lobby Italy's EU partners to loosen the so-called Fiscal Compact which imposes steep budget cuts for high-debt countries like Italy.
The maverick party threatens to hold a referendum on Italy's euro membership unless it is allowed to boost public investment and raise the budget deficit above the current limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.
Di Maio has recently softened the party's anti-euro rhetoric, saying 5-Star is ""pro-Europe"" and calling the euro referendum a ""last resort"" to be used only if Italy is unable to win any concessions.
""If we should arrive at the referendum, which for me is a last resort because first I want to go to Europe and try to change a series of rules ... it's clear that I would vote to leave, because it would mean Europe hasn't listened to us on anything"" he said in a television interview on Monday.
""But today I see an opportunity for Europe (to reform)"", he told the private station La7.
Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, the leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD), said in a tweet that ""this time Di Maio has been clear... he would vote to leave the euro. I say it would be madness for the Italian economy.""

The PD, which has split under Renzi's leadership, lags 5-Star by some 4 percentage points in most opinion polls, but no party or coalition is seen winning an outright majority at the election, which is expected to result in a hung parliament.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was elected leader of the African National Congress on Monday in a close-run vote that will set the direction for the country and the scandal-plagued party that has ruled since the end of apartheid. 
Ramaphosa, a 65-year-old union leader who became a businessman and is now one of South Africa's richest people, has vowed to fight rampant corruption and revitalize the economy, a message hailed by foreign investors.
He narrowly beat Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, 68, a former cabinet minister and the ex-wife of President Jacob Zuma, in Monday's vote, marking a pivotal moment for the ANC which launched black-majority rule under Nelson Mandela's leadership 23 years ago. 
Zuma's presidency, tainted by graft accusations that he denies, has tarnished the image of 105-year-old liberation movement, and raised the prospect of splits.
As ANC leader, Ramaphosa is likely to become the country's next president after elections in 2019.
He smiled and hugged other party officials on Monday as the results were read out.
Dlamini-Zuma, 68, the president's preferred candidate, had campaigned on pledges to tackle the racial inequality that has persisted since the end of white-minority rule.

The rand currency  had risen to a nine-month high of 12.5200 earlier, in as the market priced in a Ramaphosa victory. Government bonds also closed firmer before announcement that Ramaphosa had won the race.

The ruling came with German authorities on high alert ahead of Tuesday's anniversary of an attack last year in which a failed Tunisian asylum-seeker plowed a truck into crowds at an outdoor Christmas market and killed 12 people.
Prosecutors said the suspect, identified only as Sascha L., had carried out two successful tests of a home-made explosive device in his hometown in January. 
An inquiry found two videos of the accused pledging allegiance to Islamic State's leader. However, the court ruled on Monday that there was no evidence that the man had a personal connection with the Islamist militia or that he was financially supported by the militia, German broadcaster NDR reported.
NDR said the court granted him leniency since he cooperated with authorities after his arrest and confessed his plans. 
German magazine Der Spiegel had reported that the man was part of the far-right scene in the past before converting to Salafism, an ultra-conservative Islamist creed.
The man, who was arrested in February, admitted planning an attack. Chemicals that could be used to make explosive devices were found during a search of his home in the town of Northeim in central Germany.
Three men charged as accomplices of the convicted man also appeared before the court. Two were convicted, with one sentenced to three years probation and the other to 100 hours of community service. The third person was acquitted. 
Last week, German police raided nine locations in Berlin and the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt in an investigation of four people suspected of planning an Islamist-motivated attack.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran military police fired tear gas at protesters who burned tires and attacked buildings on Monday, after the Organization of American States rejected a declaration of victory for President Juan Orlando Hernandez in a sharply disputed election. 
Electoral authorities said on Sunday that Hernandez won the election held three weeks ago, after partial recounts of voting tallies did not tip results in his opponent's favor, despite widespread allegations of irregularities. 
However, hours later, the Organization of American States (OAS) said the process did not meet democratic standards and called for a fresh election.
Fueling the confusion, European Union observers on Sunday said the vote recount showed no irregularities.
Furious that Hernandez had been declared winner, protesters clashed with police in the capital Tegucigalpa, blocked roads around the Central American country's main port, and partially burned a courthouse and bank branch in San Pedro Sula, Honduras's second biggest city.
""We are not going to stop protesting, we are not going to let them steal the elections from Salvador Nasralla or keep Juan Orlando Hernandez in power,"" said Antonio Tejada, 30, his face covered with a red bandana in the center of the capital. 
Nearby, military police cleared rocks and burning tires from the streets. 
Nasralla, a former TV host Salvador, leads a center-left coalition that seemed headed for a surprise upset in the hours after the Nov. 26 election, before results suddenly stopped coming in. When they restarted, the outcome began to favor the incumbent. 
Honduras has been roiled by political instability and violent protests since then. The count has been questioned by the two main opposition parties, including the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship, headed by Nasralla, as well as a wide swath of the diplomatic corps.
The OAS report described irregularities - including deliberate human intrusions in the electoral computer system, pouches of votes opened or lacking votes, and ""extreme"" improbability around voting patterns it analyzed - making it ""impossible to determine with the necessary certainty the winner.""
Former Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, who supports Nasralla, said on Monday the protesters should not back down.
However, Zelaya, who was ousted in a coup in 2009, said the Alliance was ready to accept new elections if Nasralla, who was meeting U.S. and OAS officials in Washington on Monday, agrees.
""We would accept that to guarantee peace,"" Zelaya said on a television show. ""The Honduran people don't want war, we don't want war."" 

Honduras's chaotic election marks the start of a voting season in Latin America that will see more than two-thirds of the region's population electing new leaders over the next 12 months.

The gang of three Kurds and four Bulgarians was charged with smuggling offences after they transported migrants from Turkey into Serbia and Romania, both countries that border Bulgaria. One member of the group was still not detained, prosecutors said.
South Eastern Europe was a key point of transit for more than 1 million migrants from the Middle East and Africa who came to Europe in 2015. Many came to escape conflict in Syria.
Very few of them, however, stayed in Bulgaria, the European Union's poorest state. Instead, most prefer to journey onwards to wealthier western EU countries like Germany and Sweden.
The influx provoked a political crisis for the European Union. Flows of migrants have diminished since then, though the bloc is yet to agree on a migration policy.
""The evidence gathered indicates that the final destination of the migrants were Western Europe's countries,"" a spokesman for the prosecutors office told Reuters, adding that some migrants came from countries other than Iraq, Iran and Syria.
The migrants paid 2,000 euros ($2,360.60) each for their transportation from Turkey to the Bulgarian capital Sofia. 
Bulgaria built a fence on its border with Turkey and has bolstered its border controls to prevent illegal migration.
Last month Bulgarian authorities smashed another gang suspected of smuggling migrants into Western Europe.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 10:44AM ET</span>",Palestinians may seek U.N. Assembly support if U.S. vetoes Jerusalem resolution: envoy,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The Palestinian leadership may turn to the U.N. General Assembly if Washington vetoes a draft U.N. Security Council resolution to reaffirm Jerusalem's status as unresolved, after President Donald Trump's decision to recognize it as Israel's capital.
The Palestinian United Nations envoy raised this option in remarks published in Saudi daily Arab News on Monday, ahead of a Security Council vote on an Egyptian-drafted resolution about Jerusalem's status which the United States is expected to veto.
The draft says any ""decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded"".
Trump's Dec. 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and to move the U.S. Embassy to the city has provoked widespread anger and protests among Palestinians as well as broad international criticism, including from top U.S. allies.
Israel says Jerusalem is its indivisible capital. It captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move never recognized internationally. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state they seek in territory Israel captured a half century ago. 
Arab News quoted Ambassador Riyad Mansour as saying that the Palestinians and Egyptians have worked closely with Security Council members while drafting the resolution to ensure that it gets overwhelming support.
""The Europeans in particular asked us to avoid terms like ‘denounce’ and ‘condemn,’ and not to mention the U.S. by name,"" it quoted Mansour as saying. ""We acceded to their request but kept the active clauses rejecting all changes to Jerusalem and the reaffirmation of previous decisions.""
Israel has long accused the United Nations of bias against it in its conflict with the Palestinians and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's move again on Sunday. 
The Palestinians have the option of invoking a rarely-used article of the U.N. Charter that calls for parties to a dispute not to cast a veto, Arab News said. But, it said, they are more likely to take the issue to the General Assembly under Resolution 377A, known as the ""Uniting for Peace"" resolution.
Resolution 377A was passed in 1950 and used to authorize the deployment of U.S. troops to fight in the Korean war.
Mansour said Palestinians resorted to the ""Uniting for Peace"" resolution in the 1990s after Israel began building a settlement on Jabal Abut Ghnaim, a hilltop on occupied West Bank land south of Jerusalem, but left that session in suspension. However, they could seek a resumption of the session, he said.

A violent crackdown by the security forces in response to attacks by militants in the state has caused around 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in recent months.
    In a statement posted on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of the military's commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the army said the unidentified bodies had been found at the cemetery in the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of state capital Sittwe. It did not say how many bodies were uncovered.
    ""A preliminary investigation was done by the security forces following a report, by someone who asked not to be named, of people being killed and buried,"" the army said.
    ""As a result of the investigations, unidentified bodies were found at the Inn Din village cemetery and a detailed investigation is being conducted to get to the truth,” according to the statement on Facebook, which the army often uses to make announcements.
    When contacted by Reuters, military spokesman Colonel Myat Min Oo declined to give further details.
The village is in Maungdaw township, one of the areas worst affected by the violence that has prompted the United Nations' top human rights official to allege that Myanmar's security forces may have committed genocide against the Rohingya.
    Myanmar's armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern Rakhine, where many of the stateless Muslim minority lived, after Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25.
    Rights monitors have accused troops of atrocities, including killings, mass rape and arson during those operations. The United States has said it amounted to ""ethnic cleansing"".
    The Myanmar military has said its own internal investigation had exonerated security forces of all accusations of atrocities.
    Myanmar's civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya.
    The civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. It has promised to investigate allegations of abuses in Rakhine if it is given evidence.

BEKAA, Lebanon (Reuters) - In a tent in Lebanon surrounded by snow, Syrian refugees Ammar and Khadija were married by a tribal leader from their homeland in a wedding they would soon come to regret.
What they had hoped would be a milestone on the path back to normal life became the start of a bureaucratic nightmare.
One year on, it shows no sign of ending for them, their newly born son or for many other refugees from Syria, whose misery at losing their homes has been compounded by a new fear they may never be able to return.
It is a dilemma with knock-on effects for stability in Lebanon, sheltering more than a million Syrian refugees, and potentially for other countries in the Middle East and Europe they may flee to if tension spills over.
After they had agreed their union with the sheikh in the insulated tent that had become home to Khadija's family, the newlyweds both spent months digging potatoes in the Bekaa valley, one of Lebanon's poorest districts, to make ends meet.
Only after they had a baby boy, Khalaf, did they realize the wedding had been a mistake.
When the couple went to register his birth at the local registry, they were told they could not because they had no official marriage certificate.
Without registration, Khalaf is not entitled to a Syrian passport or other ID enabling him to go there. Without proper paperwork, he also risks future detention in Lebanon.
Asked why they did not get married by an approved religious authority, Ammar and Khadija looked at each other before answering: ""We didn't know.""
CATCH 22
Laws and legislation seem very remote from the informal settlements in the northern Bekaa Valley, where Syrian refugee tents sit on the rocky ground amongst rural tobacco fields. Marriages by unregistered sheikhs are common but hard to quantify because authorities often never hear of them.
For whereas in Syria, verbal tribal or religious marriages are easy to register, Lebanon has complex and costly procedures.
You first need to be married by a sheikh approved by one of the various religious courts that deal with family matters, who gives you a contract. Then you have to get a marriage certificate from a local notary, transfer it to the local civil registry and register it at the Foreigners' Registry.
Most Syrians do not complete the process, as it requires legal residency in the country, which must be renewed annually and costs $200, although the fee was waived for some refugees this year. Now they have had a child, Ammar and Khadija also need to go through an expensive court case.
The casual work Ammar depends on -- picking potatoes, onions or cucumbers in five hour shifts starting at 6 am -- pays 6,000 LBP ($4) a day, not enough to live on, let alone put aside.
""One bag of diapers costs 10,000 liras,"" he said.
Sally Abi Khalil, Country Director in Lebanon for UK-based charity Oxfam, said 80 percent of Syrian refugees do not have valid residency, one of the main reasons why they do not register their marriages, alongside the issue of the sheikhs.
""Babies born to couples who didn't register their marriage risk becoming stateless,"" she said. D-REUTERSNEWS-T004/I41a553a0111811e6b2f6d9823502ce72
Refugees can only legally make money if they have a work permit, which requires legal residency, a Catch 22 situation partially tackled in February when the fee was waived for those registered with the UNHCR prior to 2015 and without a previous Lebanese sponsor.
Lebanon's Directorate General of Personal Status took another step to help the refugees on September 12, when it issued a memo which waived the parents' and child's residency prerequisite for birth registration, it said.
But if you are married by an unauthorized sheikh, which includes all Syrian sheikhs, the process is more complicated, made worse by a clock ticking over the fate of your offspring, whose birth has to be registered within a year.
""In registering marriages, the biggest problem we faced was the sheikh,"" said Rajeh, a Syrian refugee, speaking for his community in a village in southern Lebanon. ""In Syria, the child would be ten years old and you can register him in one day.""
POLITICAL PRESSURE
If the one-year deadline is missed in Lebanon, parents have to open a civil court case estimated to cost more than one hundred dollars and still requiring legal residency, which Ammar and Khadija, who met in the informal settlement, do not have.
Legal residency becomes a requirement in Lebanon at the age of 15. At that point, many Syrians pull their children from school and do not let them stray far from the house or neighborhood for fear they will be stopped and detained.
More than half of those who escaped the Syrian conflict that began in 2011 are under 18 years old, and around one in six are babies and toddlers, said Tina Gewis, a legal specialist from the Norwegian Refugee Council.
Politicians pressured by some Lebanese saying the country has carried too much of the burden of the refugee crisis are pushing harder for the return of the displaced to Syria, raising the stakes since documentation is required for repatriation.
If they have used an unauthorized sheikh, couples are encouraged to redo their marriages, said Sheikh Wassim Yousef al-Falah, Beirut's sharia (Islamic law) judge, who said the court's case load had tripled with the influx of Syrian refugees.
But that is not an option for Ammar and Khadija because a pregnancy or the birth of a child rules that option out.
Gewis said that in any case new marriages risked complicating future inheritance or other legal issues and costs were prohibitive, with courts charging up to $110 to register even straightforward marriages by an approved sheikh.
Ziad al Sayegh, a senior advisor in Lebanon's newly-formed Ministry of State for Displaced Affairs said Beirut was keen to help the refugees overcome their difficulties.
""We don't want them to be stateless, because if you're stateless you have a legal problem that will affect the child and affect the host country,"" he said.

TIRANA (Reuters) - Opposition lawmakers threw a flare at Albania's interim prosecutor general as she took the oath of office in parliament on Monday while their supporters scuffled with police outside.
Several protesters and policemen were hurt as the crowd tried to get inside the chamber, egged on by one lawmaker. It later dispersed. 
Arta Marku, 41, was elected as interim prosecutor general with 69 votes from the ruling Socialist Party.
Albania is rebuilding its judiciary to enable it to fight corruption but the body to elect a prosecutor general has yet to be set up because the reform has dragged on.
Under pressure from the European Union to crack down on crime and graft, the Socialists chose to elect an interim prosecutor.
The opposition was enraged because it says a prosecutor should be installed once some 800 judges and prosecutors are vetted and elected with three-fifths of votes in parliament.
Democratic Party head Lulzim Basha accused Prime Minister Edi Rama of a constitutional ""putsch"" in an effort to protect corrupt officials, including his former interior minister.
""We shall not become the facade of this criminal autocracy,"" Basha told the crowd. He called for protests in January.
The Socialists say the opposition Democrats rejected dialogue despite several offers this month.
""Electing a prosecutor with our votes was legitimate, constitutional, and this was confirmed by the U.S. and EU teams assisting the reform of the judiciary,"" Rama told reporters.
The European Commission has made it clear to Albania it wants to see results in the fight against crime and corruption before asks its members to approve accession talks with Tirana.

Journalists Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were arrested last Tuesday evening after they were invited to dine with police officers on the outskirts of Myanmar's largest city, Yangon.
""The Ministry of Home Affairs has already submitted the case to the Office of the President,"" Zaw Htay, spokesman for Aung San Suu Kyi, said by phone late on Sunday. He added that the president's office had given approval for the case to go ahead.
Zaw Htay could not be reached on Monday to clarify whether Htin Kyaw or Suu Kyi had been personally involved in the decision, or if other officials had signed off on the president's behalf.
Suu Kyi, head of the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD), is barred from the presidency under a constitution written by the military. But she effectively runs the country in the role of ""state counselor"".
Approval from the president's office is needed before court proceedings can begin in a case brought under the Official Secrets Act. Section 13 of the Act states: ""No Court shall take cognizance of any offense under this Act unless upon complaint made by order of, or under authority from, the President of the Union.""
A number of governments, including the United States, Canada and Britain, and United Nations' Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, as well as Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler and a host of journalists' and human rights' groups have criticized the arrests as an attack on press freedom and called on Myanmar to release the two men.
Zaw Htay said the journalists' legal rights were being respected. ""Your reporters are protected by the rule of the law,"" he said. ""All I can say is the government can guarantee the rule of law.""
SENIOR NLD FIGURES JOIN CRITICS
But two senior figures in the NLD on Monday joined the criticism of how the two men are being treated.
Nyan Win, a member of the NLD's central executive committee and one of Suu Kyi's defense lawyers during her years of house arrest under junta rule, said it was ""unfair"" that the families of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were not allowed to contact them or be told where they are being held.
He said the police were being ""very secretive"" and called for ""openness"", although said the NLD was unable to do anything about the issue as it was not being kept informed.
Although an NLD-led civilian government took office in April last year the police and home ministry, which are driving the case, remain under the control of the military.
Win Htein, another senior figure in the NLD, who was also critical of the journalists' detention, suggested they had probably been set up by the police. ""In my opinion this is a trap,"" he said. ""They met with two policemen and then they were arrested somewhere else with the documents.""
Police Lieutenant Colonel Myint Htwe, of the Yangon Police Division, had no comment when asked about the criticism of the men's detention.
Asked on Mizzima Television what he would do for the detained journalists, Information Minister Pe Myint said: ""When I know all the facts of the current case, I will work to do what I can.""
Pe Myint is a former editor of the People's Age in Yangon and was Wa Lone's boss when the journalist worked at the paper in his first job as a reporter.
The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis that has seen an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims flee from a fierce military crackdown on militants in western Rakhine state.
The Ministry of Information said last week that they had ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"", and released a photo of the pair in handcuffs.
    It said they were being investigated under the 1923 Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
The ministry said at the same time that two policemen, Police Captain Moe Yan Naing and Police Sergeant Khin Maung Lin, had also been arrested under the same act. No details have been released on whether a case against them is also proceeding.
    The authorities have not allowed the journalists any contact with their families, a lawyer or Reuters since their arrest.
The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) called on the authorities to immediately disclose the whereabouts of the pair.
""All detainees must be allowed prompt access to a lawyer and to family members,"" said Frederick Rawski, the ICJ's Asia-Pacific Regional Director, in a statement on Monday. 
""Authorities are bound to respect these rights in line with Myanmar law and the State's international law obligations.""
    Police told Wa Lone's wife on Thursday that the reporters were taken from Htaunt Kyant police station in north Yangon to an undisclosed location by an investigation team shortly after their arrest.
    They added the reporters would be brought back to the station in ""two to three days at most"". It is now six days since they were detained and there has been no further update on their whereabouts.
Lieutenant Colonel Myint Htwe and a second senior officer, Lieutenant Colonel Min Han of the Criminal Investigation Department, said on Monday they did not know where the journalists were being held.

""You don't need to worry for their safety,"" said Lt Col Myint Htwe. ""The investigative team will proceed according to the law.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" burst into theaters with a staggering $450 million in global ticket sales in its opening weekend, confirming that the celebrated space adventure franchise remained a powerful force at the box office.
The eighth movie in the ""Star Wars"" saga created by George Lucas in 1977 collected $220 million in the United States and Canada, according to box office estimates released by comScore on Sunday. The total ranked second only to the $248 million for ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" two years ago. 
The debut marks another major success for Walt Disney Co, which bought ""Star Wars"" producer Lucasfilm in 2012 and reinvigorated the story set in a galaxy far, far away. 
""There are very few brands that can sustain this kind of enthusiasm and relevance,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore. ""This supercharges the potential for all the other 'Star Wars' properties down the line."" 
At least five more ""Star Wars"" movies are in the works at Disney, including one about a young Han Solo due for release next May, followed by ""Episode IX"" in December 2019.
""Last Jedi"" features actress Carrie Fisher's final performance as Leia, the beloved princess who became a general leading resistance forces against the evil First Order. Fisher died of a heart attack in December 2016.
The film also gives a prominent role to original ""Star Wars"" hero Luke Skywalker, portrayed by Mark Hamill.
International sales for ""Last Jedi"" were the third biggest for films that did not include the Chinese market during their debut weekends, Disney said. ""Last Jedi"" opens Jan. 5 in China, the second largest movie market. 
Positive fan reaction suggested strong ticket sales over the coming holidays, said Dave Hollis, Disney president of worldwide theatrical distribution. Audiences awarded the film an ""A"" grade in polling by CinemaScore.
Box office analysts did not expect ""Last Jedi"" to repeat the opening weekend numbers of ""Force Awakens."" The 2015 movie had been subject to unprecedented interest because it was the first new ""Star Wars"" film in a decade. It eventually took in more than $2 billion worldwide.

Disney will take over distribution rights to all past ""Star Wars"" films as part of its $52 billion deal last week to buy film and some television businesses from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc Fox had released the first six ""Star Wars"" movies made by Lucas.

1224,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 08:30AM ET</span>",After UK's Grenfell Tower fire deaths review calls for ‘culture change’,"By Tom Bergin
LONDON (Reuters) - An interim review into UK building regulations commissioned after the Grenfell Tower social housing block fire in London which killed 71 people in June, has called for a ""culture change"" in respect to fire safety.
The review, sponsored by the Department For Communities and Local Government (DCLG), said the building industry aimed for ""minimum compliance"", that enforcement measures were poor and that competence levels among builders and regulators was weak.
""It has become clear that the whole system of regulation, covering what is written down and the way in which it is enacted in practice, is not fit for purpose, leaving room for those who want to take shortcuts to do so,"" the review said.
The Grenfell fire was started by a fridge-freezer but spread quickly, partly because of the use of flammable cladding panels which were afixed to the outside of the 24-storey building, experts have said.
The contractor who retrofitted the external insulation on the building said the work was compliant but the manufacturer of the cladding panels had advised in marketing material that non-flammable variants should be used on tall buildings.
The building industry's own guidance document said cladding should be able to pass the so-called BS 8414 combustibilty test, which is also stipulated in the building regulations. When tested by DCLG this summer the panels used at Grenfell failed this test.
A Reuters review published last week found that 60 high-rise buildings had been fitted with the same kind of cladding as Grenfell since 2006. [nL8N1O120P]
The interim report published on Monday, led by Judith Hackitt, a former civil servant and chair of EEF, a manufacturing trade body, also said the building regulations should be clearer.
Some industry figures have advocated more specific rules, such as the banning of any flammable materials from the outside of tall buildings.
However, many safety experts across different industries say that highly specific rules can invite a box-ticking approach and the emergence of loopholes.
After the Piper Alpha offshore oil platform disaster which killed 167 workers in 1988, Britain introduced the ""safety case"" offshore regulations. 
Rather than specify how to be safe, these said rig operators needed to be able to demonstrate that their practices were safe, taking account of industry understanding of risks.
The Hackitt review is based on discussions with building contractors, officials and housing authorities about flaws in the current system on the regulations. 

The DCLG declined to say if it planned to conduct an anlysis of the root causes of the failings at Grenfell or other housing blocks. Experts say root cause analyses are the best way to identify what failed in a system and therefore, what needs to be fixed.

Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said government troops attacked a rebel base in the town of Lasu in the south of the country late on Sunday. 
""They are in the IO base,"" he said, referring to the name of the rebel group. Army spokesmen were not immediately available to comment when called by Reuters on Monday afternoon. 
Earlier on Monday, army spokesman Lul Ruai Koang said four aid workers from the French organization Solidarites International had been kidnapped a day earlier by rebels near the western city of Raja. The organization said on Monday it had lost contact with three members of its team on Saturday. 
The talks in Addis Ababa have been convened by the East African bloc IGAD and are aimed at bringing the warring sides back to the negotiating table after a 2015 peace deal collapsed last year during heavy fighting in the capital, Juba. 
The war began in 2013 between soldiers of President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and his former vice president, Riek Machar, a Nuer. Tens of thousands of people have died and about one-third of South Sudan's 12 million population have fled their homes. 
It has mutated from a two-way fight into a fragmented conflict, making peace more elusive, the top United Nations peace-keeper in the country told Reuters earlier this year. 
Diplomats and analysts question whether the will to end the fighting exists, as Kiir's government holds the military upper hand and rebel leader Machar is under house arrest in South Africa. [L3N1NG5D4] Machar sent representatives to the Ethiopian capital for the talks.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn voiced strong criticism of the warring sides at the opening of Monday's forum in Addis Ababa.
""...More than half of the people of South Sudan are either refugees in neighboring countries, internally displaced within South Sudan or suffering from food insecurity in their own village,"" he said.

Still, the former president, whose 2010-2014 presidency was marked by massive student protests, will face a divided Congress and an upstart leftist coalition that has vowed to fight his plans to lower taxes and ""refine"" predecessor Michelle Bachelet's progressive policies. 
Chile's peso strengthened more than 2 percentage points on Monday, while the IPSA stock index hit an all-time high and was up nearly 8 percent, as investors bet on more business-friendly policies from the incoming Pinera administration.
Pinera, 68, won more votes than any president since Chile's return to democracy in 1990, with a nine-percentage point win over center-left senator Alejandro Guillier in the runoff vote.
It was the biggest ever loss for the center-left coalition that has dominated Chile's politics since the end of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, and followed other South American countries including Argentina, Peru and Brazil that have shifted to the political right in recent years. 
The results of a first round vote and a congressional election last month point to a more divided country, however. Far-left Beatriz Sanchez captured 20 percent of votes, nearly as many as the more moderate Guillier, suggesting some dissatisfaction with Chile's long-standing free-market model.
Guillier on Sunday acknowledged the ""harsh defeat"" and urged his supporters to defend Bachelet's progressive reforms.
Pinera's Chile Vamos party has 72 of 155 representatives in the lower house, more than any other bloc. Still, without an outright majority in either chamber, Pinera's allies will have to form alliances to pass most laws. 
Sanchez's coalition earned its first senate seat and around 20 seats in the lower house.
""The Frente Amplio commits to continuing to work for a changing Chile, with more rights and more democracy,"" she wrote in a Tweet congratulating Pinera. 
Efforts by Pinera's ideological allies in Brazil and Argentina to reduce fiscal deficits by cutting spending and reforming pension systems have faced political opposition and sparked protests in recent months.
Pinera, to be sure, has done his best to strike a conciliatory tone. He does not take office until March but was already met with Bachelet early Monday morning. 

In his victory speech Sunday night, Pinera addressed Guillier, saying, ""Despite our great differences, there are large points of agreement.""

KAMPALA (Reuters) - A move to change Uganda's constitution to allow aging President Yoweri Museveni to rule beyond the current age limit provoked rowdy scenes in parliament on Monday in which six legislators were ejected from the chamber.
Museveni, 73, has ruled the east African country for 31 years. With the constitution capping the age of a presidential candidate at below 75 years, he would be barred from standing again as president in 2021.
Parliament on Monday began debating a bill, presented by a Museveni loyalist, that proposes removing the age cap, something which opposition activists and rights groups say opens the door for him to be president for life. 
Religious leaders and even some MPs from Museveni's National Resistance Movement (NRM) party have criticized the proposed bill. 
After rowdy scenes, six lawmakers were suspended for a single session and ordered out of the chamber for ""undermining the authority of the speaker [and] undermining decorum in the house,"" parliament spokesman Chris Obore told Reuters.
The MPs had heckled speaker Rebecca Kadaga and ignored her orders to be seated, Obore said. 
The debate was expected to continue through Monday and Tuesday. 
In late September lawmakers brawled in parliament for two consecutive days as MPs opposed to the bill unsuccessfully tried to filibuster it. 
At least 25 MPs opposed to the proposed constitutional amendment to prolong Museveni's tenure were forcibly ejected on orders of the speaker for involvement in fighting. 
Museveni initially won broad international support for his embrace of market economics and restoring political order after years of turmoil in the east African country.
But in recent years he has come under a growing spotlight for a range of rights violations, corruption and his unwillingness to give up power.

The journalist, Laura Halminen, said she tried to smash up her computer with a hammer in her home, but the laptop then started smoking and she called the fire brigade, according to an interview published by her employer Helsingin Sanomat.
Police officers who came to her home with the fire service to investigate the blaze then took her computer and searched her property, police said - a rare operation in a country rated high for protecting press freedom.
The case centered on a story that Halminen and another journalist wrote on Saturday about a Finnish intelligence center that they said monitored neighboring Russia and, they reported, was about to get new powers to watch Finns online. 
After the article's publication, Finland's President Sauli Niinisto released a statement saying authorities had launched an investigation in to the leaking of material used in the story.
The reporter Halminen told her newspaper in the interview she had decided to destroy the computer ""to make sure sources were protected in the best possible way"".
On Sunday, the police's National Bureau of Investigation said, officers went to the property and found the computer burning in the basement. ""After that, a special home search was ordered to be carried out in the apartment and basement,"" the force added.
It said officers had had to act quickly because they feared material linked to an investigation could be destroyed. There were no reports of anyone being arrested or charged.
The newspaper said the police also took phones and memory sticks in what it called a ""very worrying"" raid. ""A house search of this scale targeting a journalist is totally exceptional in Finland,"" Editor-in-chief, Kaius Niemi, said.
Campaign group Reporters Without Borders ranked Finland third in its 2017 World Press Freedom Index, behind only Sweden and Norway.

In reply to written Reuters questions passed to him in prison, Oriol Junqueras, whose Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left) party is expected to become the largest separatist force in parliament, struck a conciliatory tone.
Junqueras, who is in custody on allegations of rebellion and sedition, wrote that he would continue to pursue independence if he becomes Catalonia's next president, but also to ""build bridges and shake hands"" with the Spanish state.
""I can assure you that we are democrats before we are separatists and that the aim (of gaining independence) does not always justify the means,"" he said in comments that appear to drop his party's earlier demand for unilateral secession.

Junqueras was deputy leader of the Catalan government that was dismissed by Madrid in October after the regional assembly declared unilateral independence from Spain. The assembly was also dissolved and fresh elections called.

The double abstention has jeopardised the launch of judicial proceedings against the three men and underscored the interwoven nature of public life on the Mediterranean island of Malta - the smallest nation in the European Union.
The initial magistrate assigned to the case stood down last Thursday after defence lawyers complained that she knew one of Caruana Galizia's sisters and had sent her condolences following the Oct. 16 killing.
On Monday, a replacement magistrate, Charmaine Galea, said she was also withdrawing from the case because the blogger had written about her and her alleged connections to the government. She said that justice had to be done and be seen to be done.
Another magistrate will now be assigned by the drawing of lots, but it was not immediately clear when that might happen. 
Under Maltese law, the compilation of evidence must begin within a 30-day time frame and a lawyer for Caruana Galizia's family warned the delays could sink the case.
The trio were charged on Dec. 4, giving the court until Jan. 4 to start hearing the evidence. Once police have made their case, the magistrate decides whether it should go to trial.
The three suspects, brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio, and Vince Muscat have denied any wrongdoing. The three were known to local police and had never been the target of any of Caruana Galizia's often fierce blogs. [nL8N1O56U9]
Caruana Galizia was killed instantly when the car she was driving was blown up. [nL8N1MU7FD]
According to Maltese media, the three suspects were arrested on the basis of phone intercepts and analysis of triangulation data showing their locations at the time of the murder. 
The reports said one of the suspects had to call a local telecom company shortly before the bomb went off to top up the credit on the mobile phone that was used to detonate the explosives - a error that led police straight to the trio. 
The government has announced a one-million-euro ($1.2-million) reward to anyone giving enough information for convictions. Caruana Galizia's family have denounced the handling of the case and expressed fears that those behind the murder will never be brought to justice. ($1 = 0.8482 euros)

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 07:10AM ET</span>",Malaysian PM gets likely boost with electoral boundaries ruling,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday likely gained ground ahead of national elections next year when the Court of Appeal ruled that the Election Commission can go ahead with a controversial redrawing of voting boundaries.
Critics have called out the government over what they describe as skewing the borders in Najib's favour in the redelineation process as he seeks to win a third term in an election that must be held by August.
The government denies the charge.
Opponents of the redrawing process say it does not address an imbalanced distribution of voters, instead shoving opposition-inclined voters into opposition-held seats to create super-constituencies and also reshaping constituencies to have more distinct ethnic majorities.
Electoral boundaries were last shifted nationwide in 2003, and even then the undefeated Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition was accused of manipulating the process. The commission is now seeking to redraw boundaries for more than 120 parliamentary seats, more than half of the 222 seats in total.
The Court of Appeal set aside a lower court's order barring the commission from the redrafting exercise amid a legal challenge by the government of the opposition-held state of Selangor over the constitutionality of the process.
""The Election Commission has until September 2018 to finish the whole process. There is no urgency,"" said Elizabeth Wong, an executive councillor with the Selangor state government, outside the court.
""Something is happening to ensure that the prime minister and BN have this list of delineated seats to help them win Selangor,"" Wong said in a recording heard by Reuters.
The prime minister's office denied Wong's charge, saying the exercise is ""is entirely normal, free from political interference"" and managed independently by the commission.
""The reality is that Malaysia's judiciary is free and fair. Decisions frequently go against the government, as is a matter of public record. The opposition only complain when decisions go against them,"" Tengku Sariffuddin, Najib's press secretary, said in an emailed statement.
Najib is under pressure to improve on BN's disastrous election outing in 2013, when it lost the popular vote.

While BN is widely expected to win its 14th straight polls, Najib's prospects are tempered by voters angered by rising living costs and an unprecedented challenge by former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has joined hands with jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim and now leads the opposition.

""We are delighted that The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have chosen the Willcocks Nursery School for Princess Charlotte,"" the school said in a statement. ""We look forward to welcoming Charlotte to our nursery in January.""

Unlike previous senior royals, Prince William attended nursery school as a child. 
His son George made the step up from nursery to primary school in September when he began at Thomas's Battersea, a private school in southwest London which is also close to the family's Kensington Palace home.
As well as announcing news of Charlotte's new school, William and Kate released a new portrait photograph of their family which adorns their Christmas cards this year. Kate is pregnant with the couple's third child with the new royal baby due in April.

Details of the attack remained unclear after a group of armed men seized a building under construction in a heavily populated area of the city.
""The number of attackers, possible casualties and their target is not yet clear,"" said Najib Danish, spokesman for the Ministry of Interior.
The Afshar area of Kabul where the attack was under way is close to a training facility of the National Directorate of Security, the main Afghan intelligence agency, as well as a private university.
Another government official said the attack was near the intelligence agency training center.
Islamic State claimed responsibility in a statement on its Amaq news agency, in which it said two of its fighters had attacked an intelligence agency center in Kabul.
The group, which first appeared in Afghanistan in 2015, has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in Kabul over the past several months.
But much remains unknown about how it operates and many observers are skeptical about its ability to mount complex attacks on its own.

Sixty-two of the suspects had been detained in the operation centered in Istanbul and spread over 20 other provinces, he said. Operations to locate the rest were ongoing.
The suspects were ""marriage officials"" for supporters of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who the Turkish government says was behind the failed July 2016 coup, the spokesman said. Gulen denies any involvement in the coup attempt.
They were believed to have helped set up arranged marriages for some of Gulen's followers, he said. Turkish officials say the Gulen network closely monitored the personal and professional lives of some supporters, including their education, careers and marriages. 
Turkish police and state intelligence officials identified the suspects in a joint operation using conversations traced on ByLock, an encrypted messaging application commonly used by Gulen's supporters, the spokesman said.
Turkey has identified 215,092 users of ByLock and has launched investigations into 23,171 of them, the interior minister said last month.
More than 50,000 people, including security officials, military personnel and civil servants, have been detained in the aftermath of the coup.
The crackdown has alarmed Turkey's Western allies and rights groups, who say President Tayyip Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent.
The government says the measures, taken under emergency rule that was imposed after the coup, are necessary due to the security threats Turkey faces.

Washington provided intelligence to Russia that helped thwart a potentially deadly bombing, U.S. and Russian officials said on Sunday, in a rare public show of cooperation despite deep strains between the two countries.
""It cannot be called anything but an ideal example of cooperation in fighting terrorism,"" Peskov told reporters at a conference call. ""We should aim for such standards.""
The tip-off resulted in the detention of seven alleged supporters of the Islamic State militant group in St. Petersburg last week, Peskov said.
Russia's Federal Security Service said on Friday that IS had planned attacks in public places on Dec. 16 and weapons and explosives were found when the suspects were searched.
Peskov said Russian and American security services have contacts but this was the first time when their cooperation was so efficient. ""This was very meaningful information that helped to save many lives,"" the spokesman told reporters.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somali security forces arrested a former minister and presidential candidate in an overnight raid on his home in which they killed five of his bodyguards, police and lawmakers said on Monday.
A spokesman for the Internal Security Ministry said Abdirahman Abdishakur was accused of treason. Abdishakur, who stood in the February presidential election, is an opposition politician and an outspoken critic of the weak, United Nations-backed government led by President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. 
""The former minister was legally arrested by decree from the attorney general and internal security minister. He was accused of treason. His guards fought the security forces,"" spokesman Abdiasis Ali told reporters on Monday.
A policeman confirmed five bodyguards were killed in the raid, while a local elder Abdullahi Ali told Reuters Abdishakur had been injured on the arm by a stray bullet. 
The raid drew angry responses from lawmakers and protesters. Hundreds of people marched in Mogadishu on Monday as government forces deployed to block main roads. 
""What the government is doing is against Islam and healthy politics,"" lawmaker Mahad Salad told Reuters. ""We condemn the government's immoral act. We also order for the release of the ex-minister."" 
The presidential election in February was praised by Western donors as a modest step forward from the previous election and it raised hopes that the country might be able to more effectively combat Islamist insurgents.
But the insurgency is striking with ever larger and more deadly attacks in the capital and major towns.

(Reuters) - Lighter winds expected in California early this week should help firefighters in their battle against one of the largest and most destructive wildfires in the state's history, the National Weather Service has said.
By late on Sunday, more than 8,500 firefighters had contained about 45 percent of the fire in Southern California. Dubbed the Thomas fire, it began Dec. 4 and has scorched 270,000 acres (109,000 hectares) along the scenic Pacific Coast north of Los Angeles.
Its size is approaching that of the 2003 Cedar blaze in San Diego County, the largest wildfire in state history, which consumed 273,246 acres and caused 15 deaths.
While wind and low humidity will still create dangerous fire conditions, ""improving weather conditions should allow firefighters to make progress on the fire"" on Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service said on Twitter.
Officials said calmer winds also helped make Sunday one of their most productive days yet battling a blaze that has been fueled by fierce Santa Ana winds sweeping in from eastern California deserts.
""We're just hoping to make it home for Christmas,"" Bakersfield Fire Department Captain Tim Ortiz said Sunday at a recreation center in Santa Barbara serving as a staging area and base camp for more than 3,000 firefighters.
The fire has destroyed more than 1,000 structures and threatened 18,000 others. Centered less than 100 miles (160 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, it has forced more than 104,000 people to evacuate or seek shelter. 
On Sunday firefighters paid their respects during a funeral procession for Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson, 32, who died of smoke inhalation and burns on Thursday while battling the flames near the Ventura County community of Fillmore.
Firefighters lined spots along the procession route that ran from Ventura County to his home near San Diego.
So far it has cost $123.8 million to battle the Thomas fire, which has forced many schools and roads to close for days and created poor air quality throughout southern California. 
""I've seen people who have lost everything,"" said Larry Dennis, 60, who sought refuge at a Ventura shelter Sunday after the blaze inundated the region with smoke and turned nearby hillsides red. Several areas of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties also saw evacuation orders lifted Sunday, Cal Fire said.

Five of the 20 most destructive fires in recorded history have ravaged the state in 2017, according to Cal Fire. The cause of the Thomas fire remains under investigation.

The SPD agreed only reluctantly to enter talks, after voters rewarded it in September for the last four years of ""grand coalition"" under Merkel by handing it its worst result since 1933.
SPD members will have the final say on any deal to renew the alliance with Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Christian Social Union (CSU) Bavarian allies.
General Secretary Lars Klingbeil said they would demand distinctive leftist policies, along the lines of the single ""citizen's insurance"" that the SPD wants to replace Germany's private and public healthcare systems.
""The Union (CDU/CSU) knows that the SPD members have the final say ... and we need to be able to convince them on substance,"" Klingbeil told the public broadcaster ZDF.
The SPD, which shed support to the far right and to the hard-left Die Linke in the election, says the existing hybrid health insurance system discriminates against the poor.
Conservatives, including Merkel, say switching to a unified system would erode competition and worsen services.
SPD members gave leader Martin Schulz the green light at a party congress last week to launch talks with Merkel's conservatives, raising hopes of an end to months of political deadlock created by an inconclusive election result.
SPD and conservative negotiators will hold their first meeting on Wednesday.
FAMILY REUNION
Immigration is expected to be another key point of contention.
The SPD opposes a conservative plan to extend beyond March a temporary halt on the right of some accepted asylum seekers to bring in family members.
It says the measure hampers efforts to integrate the 1.6 million people who entered Germany seeking asylum in 2015 and 2016. ""Integration works only with families,"" Klingbeil said.
Merkel's CDU hold a meeting on Monday to discuss the looming coalition talks, which also face a threat from strains within Merkel's conservative bloc.
The CSU, which fears losses to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in an election in Bavaria next year, is likely to put up more resistance to SPD policy demands than the CDU, notably on immigration.

""After a result of 20.5 percent, you simply cannot continue on the same path, and many issues have to be solved,"" SPD deputy leader Ralf Stegner told Bayern 2 radio. ""It is not certain this will work with the Union, where the CDU and CSU are quarrelling.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will lay out a new U.S. national security strategy on Monday based on his ""America First"" policy and will, among other items, make clear that China is a competitor, two senior U.S. officials said on Saturday.
Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping while also demanding that Beijing increase pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program and to change trade practices to make them more favorable to the United States.
The national security strategy, to be rolled out in a speech by Trump, should not be seen as an attempt to contain China but rather to offer a clear-eyed look at the challenges China poses, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The strategy, which was still being drafted, may also reverse Democratic President Barack Obama's declaration in September 2016 that climate change is a threat to security, one official said.

Trump, a Republican, is to lay out his foreign policy priorities, and will emphasize his commitment to ""America First"" policies such as building up the U.S. military, confronting Islamist militants and realigning trade relationships to make the United States more competitive, the officials said.

The 32-year-old is believed to have cut through bars in the ceiling of his cell before scaling a perimeter wall of the prison in an area being refurbished.
The Kerobokan prison, about 10 km (six miles) from the main tourist beaches in the Kuta area, often holds foreigners facing drug-related charges.
Representatives of Beasley could not immediately be reached for comment.
In June, an Australian, a Bulgarian, an Indian and a Malaysian tunneled to freedom about 12 meters (13 yards) under Kerobokan prison's walls.
The Indian and the Bulgarian were caught soon after in neighboring East Timor, but Australian Shaun Edward Davidson and Malaysian Tee Kok King remain at large.
Davidson has taunted authorities by saying he was enjoying life in various parts of the world, in purported posts on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 

Kerobokan has housed a number of well-known foreign drug convicts, including Australian Schappelle Corby, whose 12-1/2-year sentence for marijuana smuggling got huge media attention.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 04:20AM ET</span>",Protests muted this time as Austrian far right joins government,"By Francois Murphy
VIENNA (Reuters) - The last time the anti-immigration Freedom Party entered government in Austria, the street protests were so big the cabinet took a tunnel from the chancellery to the swearing-in ceremony at the president's office across the road.
There will be no such cowering on Monday when, almost 18 years on, the country once again becomes the only one in western Europe with a far-right party in its ruling coalition.
Much as the reaction across the continent has been more muted, protests planned around the time conservative and Freedom Party (FPO) ministers are sworn in at 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) are unlikely to draw crowds to compare with the tens of thousands who gathered in 2000.
""We will certainly not be going underground to the Hofburg, but rather with our heads held high in the street,"" FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache, who will become vice chancellor, said in an interview with the Kleine Zeitung newspaper, referring to the former imperial palace that houses the president's office.
Conservative leader Sebastian Kurz, who is just 31, will become chancellor after winning a parliamentary election two months ago with a hard line on immigration in a country that was swept up in Europe's refugee crisis in 2015. The FPO came third with 26 percent. 
The two parties reached a coalition deal on Friday that hands control of much of the country's security apparatus to the FPO and includes plans to slash public spending, cut taxes and curb benefits for asylum-seekers.
NO LONGER AN OUTLIER
The FPO's success was an outlier in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s when it was led by the late Joerg Haider, who praised Adolf Hitler's employment policies. 
Now it is one of many anti-establishment parties making electoral gains, capitalizing on voter frustration at mainstream politicians' handling of the economy, security and immigration. Its allies and sister parties this year entered the German parliament and made the French presidential run-off.
""The coalition now in power in Austria must prompt the vigilance of democrats attached to European values,"" European economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici, a Socialist, said on Twitter.
""The situation is no doubt different compared with the precedent of 2000. But the far right being in power is never insignificant.""
Other European countries imposed sanctions on Austria that year in protest at the FPO coming to power. There is no such action being taken this time.
Police said 1,500 officers were deployed in Vienna to deal with nine demonstrations that had been registered, with organizers having said they expect 5,000 people to attend. 
""For the moment, it's very, very quiet,"" a police spokesman said as protests were due to begin. Despite the relatively small numbers, a large area near the president's office has been sealed off.
A Reuters photographer saw several thousand people marching peacefully next to that area, carrying placards saying ""Nazis out"" and a banner reading ""Don't let Nazis govern"".
The FPO, which was founded in the 1950s by former Nazis, has backed away from calling for Austria to follow Britain in holding a vote on leaving the European Union. Polls show most Austrians want to remain part of the bloc.

While handing the foreign ministry to an independent who will work for the FPO, Kurz has taken control of European policy and obtained a guarantee that there will be no Brexit-style referendum.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 04:10AM ET</span>",China air force drills in Sea of Japan and again around Taiwan,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's air force carried out another round of long-range drills on Monday, flying into the Sea of Japan, prompting South Korean jets to scramble, and again around self-ruled Taiwan amid growing tension over China's assertiveness in the region.
China has in recent months ramped up its long-range air force drills, particularly around Taiwan, claimed by China as its own. 
The air force said in a statement that fighter and bomber aircraft flew through the Tsushima Strait that separates South Korea from Japan and into international waters in the Sea of Japan.
The Sea of Japan is not Japan's, and the drills were lawful and reasonable, air force spokesman Shen Jinke said in the statement, describing the exercises as routine and pre-planned.
In Seoul, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said five Chinese military planes were spotted entering the Korean Air Defence Identification Zone, and fighter jets scrambled in response. 
The Chinese aircraft also flew through Japan's air defense identification zone, it added.
""Our fighter planes took normal tactical measures, identifying the models of the Chinese planes and flying aerial surveillance until they left,"" the South Korean statement said.
Chinese air force spokesman Shen alluded to the scrambled aircraft, saying they ""responded to interference from foreign military aircraft"" but were able to achieve the aim of their drill.
There was no immediate reaction from the Japanese government.
Taiwan's military said that China had staged a separate drill at the same time, flying through the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines and then returning to base through the Strait of Miyako, to Taiwan's north and near Japan's southern islands.
Taiwan monitored Japan sending F-15 fighters to intercept, Taiwan's defense ministry added in its statement.
China's air force last week conducted ""island encirclement patrols"" near Taiwan, after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened that China would invade the self-ruled island if any U.S. warships made port visits there.
China suspects Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who leads the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, wants to declare the island's formal independence. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan's security.
China's air force exercises also come amid regional tensions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, with bellicose rhetoric from both North Korea and U.S. President Donald Trump.

1258,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 03:50AM ET</span>",Philippine Congress backs body cameras for police in bloody war on drugs,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine Congress approved a bill that removes a proposed 900 million pesos ($17.87 million) for the police war on drugs, now that police are no longer leading the operation, but which provides them with body cameras to record arrests.
Senator Loren Legarda, the head of senate's finance committee, said on Monday that Congress re-allotted the police-requested budget because the Drug Enforcement Agency was now leading the controversial war on drugs in which thousand of suspected dealers and users have been killed.
The bill, approved by Congress last week, is expected to be endorsed by President Rodrigo Duterte, who launched the crackdown, on Tuesday.
Duterte this month ordered the police to return to the drugs war, following a near eight-week layoff, but in a supporting role only.
Most of the money steered away from the war on drugs would go towards military and police housing, and the balance would be used to buy body cameras for police engaged in anti-drug operations.
""Maybe they would be fearful if they are monitored, to lessen if not totally eliminate untoward incidents,"" Legarda told the ANC news channel.
The anti-narcotics crackdown has drawn international criticism, with rights groups pointing out lapses in police operations and alleged executions of drug suspects.
Police say they have shot dead more than 3,900 drug suspects in self-defence during the 17-month campaign, but surveys have showed doubts among Filipinos about the validity of police accounts.

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 03:40AM ET</span>",China defends trade with U.S. as Trump set to brand it a competitor,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry on Monday defended trade with the United States as a win-win scenario ahead of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump laying out a new national security strategy that makes clear that China is a competitor.
Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping while also demanding that Beijing increase pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program and changes in trade practices to make them more favorable to the United States.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she was unable to comment on the strategy until it was unveiled.
But in principle, China hopes the strategy can play a constructive role in promoting world peace and stability and promoting China-U.S. strategic mutual trust, Hua told a daily news conference.
The essence of China-U.S. trade and economic ties is mutually beneficial and win-win, directly and indirectly supporting 2.6 million U.S. jobs, she added. 
In 2015, the profits of U.S. firms that invested in China reached $36.2 billion, and China will continue to support trade and investment liberalization, Hua said.
""We are willing to work hard with the U.S. side to dedicate ourselves to building a robust, stable and healthy trade and economic relationship,"" she added.
That was in the interests of both sides and the expectation of the international community, Hua said. 
The national security strategy to be rolled out in Trump's speech, should not be seen as a bid to contain China but rather to offer a clear-eyed look at the challenges it poses, said U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Trump made his first visit as president to China last month, where he lauded his meetings on trade and North Korea as ""very productive"".
Washington has refrained from pushing harder on trade because it needs China's cooperation on North Korea, though Xi, at least in public when Trump was in Beijing, went no further than reiterating China's determination to achieve denuclearization through talks.
China and the United States have also repeatedly clashed over trade issues, including state support for Chinese firms and intellectual property rights violations in China.
On Friday, China's finance ministry said it would cut export taxes on some steel products and ditch those for sales abroad of steel wire, rod and bars from Jan. 1, stirring concern in the United States and Europe that the world's top steel producer may be looking to sell its excess product abroad.

It follows a ministerial level G20 meeting in Berlin last month, where China and the United States remained at odds over how to tackle excess steel capacity. The global steel sector is worth about $900 billion a year.

1260,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 03:30AM ET</span>",Israel strikes Hamas targets in Gaza after Palestinian rocket attacks,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Israeli military said it attacked a Hamas training compound in Gaza on Monday in response to rocket strikes from the Palestinian enclave, which have surged since U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital on Dec 6.
Neither side reported any casualties in the overnight shelling exchange, which occurred days before U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visits Israel and neighboring Egypt, which also borders Gaza and is involved in its internal politics.
Militants in Gaza, territory controlled by the Hamas Islamist group, have launched more than a dozen rockets into southern Israel over the last two weeks, the most intensive attacks since a seven-week-long Gaza war in 2014.
Two rockets were fired late on Sunday, one of them exploding inside an Israeli border community and the other hitting an open area, the military said. Another rocket launched early on Monday fell short inside Gaza, it said.
Three structures in a Hamas training camp were hit in the Israeli counter-strike, the military said.
Hamas usually evacuates such facilities when tensions rise, and Israel's choice of the low-profile target appeared to signal a desire to avoid more serious confrontation with the group.
""Israel does not seek escalation,"" Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said on Army Radio.
But Zeev Elkin, another member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, said in an interview with the radio station that Israel's military response would ""have to be harshened"" if the rocket fire did not stop.
Israeli officials have blamed the fire on smaller militant groups in Gaza and called on Hamas to rein them in. Should Hamas fail to do so, both Shaked and Elkin said, Israel could eventually target the group's leadership for attack.

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 03:20AM ET</span>",India's muted response to Trump's Jerusalem move stokes Arab unease,"By Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A dozen Arab ambassadors have asked India to clarify its position on the U.S recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, diplomatic sources said, after New Delhi's muted response suggested a shift in support for the Palestinian cause.
U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, generating outrage from Palestinians. Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.
Countries around the world, including U.S. allies Britain and France, criticized Trump's decision, but India did not take sides.
Instead, the Indian foreign ministry in a brief statement, said India's position was consistent and independent of any third party. 
The bland statement made no reference to Jerusalem and prompted criticism at home that it was insufficient, vague and anti-Palestinian.
Israel maintains that all of Jerusalem is its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state and say Trump's move has left them marginalized and jeopardized any hopes of a two-state solution. 
Last week, envoys from Arab states including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kuwait based in New Delhi met Indian junior foreign minister M.J. Akbar to brief the government about an Arab League meeting on Dec. 9 condemning the U.S. decision, a diplomatic and an Indian government source said.
The envoys also sought a more forthright Indian response, the sources said. 
But Akbar gave no assurance and the Indian source said the government had no plans for a further articulation on Jerusalem, which is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
""Akbar did not promise anything,"" the diplomatic source briefed on the meeting said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities. 
India was one of the earliest and vocal champions of the Palestinian cause during the days it was leading the Non-Aligned Movement while it quietly pursued ties with Israel.
But under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, New Delhi has moved to a more open relationship with Israel, lifting the curtain on thriving military ties and also homeland security cooperation.
Modi's Hindu nationalist ruling group views Israel and India as bound together in a common fight against Islamist militancy and long called for a public embrace of Israel. 
Modi in July made a first trip to Israel by an Indian prime minister and did not go to Ramallah, the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority and a customary stop for leaders trying to maintain a balance in political ties.
P.R. Kumaraswamy, a leading Indian expert on ties with Israel at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said a ""major shift"" on India's policy had been evident since early this year when Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas visited New Delhi.
""With the Palestinian president standing by his side, Prime Minister Modi reiterated India’s support for Palestinian statehood but carefully avoided any direct reference to East Jerusalem,"" he said. 
For decades, India’s support for a Palestinian state was accompanied by an explicit reference to East Jerusalem being the Palestinian capital. But Delhi has moved to a more balanced position, refusing to take sides in an explosive dispute, he said.
During the meeting last week, the ambassadors of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Somalia and the Palestinian Authority spoke, the diplomatic source said. Besides the dozen envoys there were charges d'affaires from several other countries in the region. 
""They were expecting more from India, perhaps to denounce Israel and the U.S."" said former Indian ambassador to Jordan and Anil Trigunayat. ""But would it really make a difference, adding one more voice?""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will reshuffle his cabinet within a day, media said on Monday, a sign the embattled leader hopes to capitalize on a weekend by-election win to refresh his ministry.
Turnbull's center-right government regained its razor-thin parliamentary majority through the poll triggered by a constitutional crisis, shoring up his support in a country where three prime ministers have been ousted by their own party since 2010.
The changes could include Attorney-General George Brandis quitting parliament to become the high commissioner, or ambassador, to Britain, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. and other media said. 
Representatives for Turnbull and Brandis did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
""Winning that (byelection), allowing him to send off Brandis to London, and then to put in some new faces and get a bit of movement there, that's the positive message running into Christmas and then the new year,"" said Stewart Jackson, a specialist in Australian politics at the University of Sydney.
""He will last until March. If there's a new disaster there, or any more referrals to the High Court, then it will be on for young and old,"" he added, referring to the crisis over the disqualification of lawmakers holding dual citizenship.
When Turnbull unseated then prime minister Abbott in 2015, he said the move was necessary because the latter's government had lost 30 opinion polls in a row. Under Turnbull, the government has lost 25 opinion polls in a row.
Many commentators say that if the figure reaches 30, which could happen as soon as March, Turnbull's party may consider removing him.
Social services minister Christian Porter and employment minister Michaelia Cash are frontrunners to be the next attorney general, the Australian newspaper said. Turnbull may seek to exploit their relative youth - each is 47 - to appeal to a new generation of conservative voters.
A spokesman for Porter declined comment. A representative for Cash did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Australian prime ministers are particularly susceptible to poor polling, as political parties have the power to call a spill, or internal leadership vote, and replace the leader with a more popular candidate.
MID-YEAR BOOST
Turnbull's hopes to reinvigorate performance in opinion polls strengthened on Monday, as his government predicted the national deficit would shrink faster than expected and return to surplus in fiscal 2021 after a decade of deficits. 
Treasurer Scott Morrison saw a deficit of about A$23.6 billion ($18.1 billion) for the year to end-June 2018, down from a May forecast of A$29.4 billion, as stronger job creation and higher commodity export earnings offset weakness in wages and consumer spending.
The improved outlook enables Turnbull to trumpet his economic credentials by nudging closer to a balanced budget while enabling him to consider income tax cuts in the year before his next scheduled election, in 2019.

""The stronger fiscal position is a welcome Christmas present for Treasurer Morrison and the Turnbull Liberal-National government, as they head towards the end of an increasingly difficult 2017,"" said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australian economics at RBC Capital Markets.

1265,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 02:10AM ET</span>",At least 61 dead after days of violence in Ethiopia's Oromiya region,"By Aaron Maasho
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least 61 people have been killed in clashes between different ethnic groups in Ethiopia's Oromiya region, officials said, the latest bout of violence to highlight increasing instability in a province racked by bloody protests in 2015 and 2016.
From Thursday, 29 ethnic Oromos were killed by ethnic Somali attackers in the region's Hawi Gudina and Daro Lebu districts, regional spokesman Addisu Arega Kitessa said.
The violence triggered revenge attacks by ethnic Oromos in another district, resulting in the killing of 32 Somalis who were being sheltered in the area following a previous round of violence.
""The region is working to bring the perpetrators to justice,"" the spokesman said in a statement.
The cause of the latest violence was not known, but it followed protests in Oromiya's Celenko town where the region's officials said 16 ethnic Oromos were shot dead on Tuesday by soldiers trying to disperse the crowd.
""We do not know who ordered the deployment of the military. This illegal act should be punished,"" said Lema Megersa, the region's president.
The clashes are likely to fuel fears about security in Ethiopia, the region's biggest economy and a staunch Western ally.
Lema's comments also illustrate growing friction within Ethiopia's ruling EPRDF coalition, since unrest roiled the Oromiya region in 2015 and 2016, when hundreds of people were killed.
At that time, the violence forced the government to impose a nine-month state of emergency that was only lifted in August.
The unrest was provoked by a development scheme for the capital Addis Ababa that dissidents said amounted to land grabs and turned into broader anti-government demonstrations over political and human rights.
It included attacks on businesses, many of them foreign-owned, including farms growing flowers for export.

Typhoon Kai-tak, which triggered landslides and floods in the deadliest storm to hit the country this year, also left 46 people missing.
Military spokesman Colonel Edgard Arevalo said two soldiers were wounded when about 50 rebels of the New People's Army (NPA), the military arm of a communist movement, fired on a convoy of troops carrying relief aid on Samar island on Saturday.
The NPA has yet to comment on the accusation and it was not possible to contact the group due to power outages and disrupted communications.
The Philippines has not declared a Christmas truce with the rebels for the first time in three decades after President Rodrigo Duterte halted peace talks and this month designated the NPA a terrorist organization.
""(The attacks) only validated the aptness of the government's decision to terminate the peace negotiations and to discontinue the traditional Christmas truce,"" Arevalo said.
The 3,000-member Maoist rebel forces have been waging a protracted guerrilla warfare for nearly 50 years in a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people and stunted growth in resource-rich rural areas. The Philippines also faces Islamist insurgencies in the south.
The NPA guerrillas have been targeting mines, plantations and other businesses, demanding ""revolutionary taxation"" to finance arms purchases and recruitment.
Mina Marasigan, spokeswoman for the national disaster risk reduction and management council, called on the NPA to halt the violence.
""This is not an armed conflict,"" she said, adding the rebels should let ""relief work to go unhampered"".
Marasigan said emergency workers were working around the clock to restore power, clear debris and make roads and bridges passable to allow humanitarian assistance to reach about 220,000 people affected by the storm.
Duterte is expected to visit the worst-hit typhoon areas later in the day to assess the damage.
Storms regularly batter the Philippines. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan killed about 8,000 people and left millions homeless in the same region.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was set to win an election in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state on Monday, the vote count showed, but with a reduced margin, which will be a boost for the opposition.
A combined opposition led by the Congress party had mounted a tough challenge in the western state of Gujarat, hoping to weaken Modi in his home base by exploiting discontent over a lack of jobs and a national sales tax that hit business.
The BJP won more than 100 seats in the 182-member state assembly, projections by India Today, CNN News18 and TimesNow showed.
A party needs 92 seats to rule the state. Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, who formally took over as party president at the weekend, was set to win more than 70 seats, far better than it had done in the past.
A relieved BJP said Modi's popularity remained intact.
""There is no other leader close,"" said Shyam Jaju, party vice president. 
The mood in the BJP headquarters in New Delhi and in Gujarat’s main city Ahmedabad was initially tense as early trends showed a close fight. 
But later workers gathered to shout slogans and cheer victory. 
Modi's party was also ahead in Himachal Pradesh, the Himalayan state in the north also voting for a new state assembly.
Modi faces a general election in 2019, but before then, the opposition aims to slow down Modi's momentum in state elections, with two more next year.
Businesses across India have been struggling with the poor implementation of a goods and services tax that aims to harmonize an array of state and federal taxes but entangled them in cumbersome procedures.
STOCKS FIRM AFTER EARLY WEAKNESS
Modi's shock ban of high-value currency notes in November last year, as part of his fight against corruption, also disrupted small business that forms the bedrock of his support base.
Indian stock markets opened weaker, with the 50-share NSE index down almost 2 percent as early trends showed a close contest in Gujarat. 
But stocks reversed the losses later - the 50-share NSE index was trading up 0.7 percent at 0455 GMT.
The partially convertible rupee was trading at 64.32/33 to the dollar versus its previous close of 64.04. The rupee had dropped to a low of 64.74 in early trade.
Almost all pre-vote and exit polls had predicted a comfortable victory, but the polls have often gone wrong in the past.
To ensure his party’s prospects, Modi addressed dozens of rallies during his campaign in Gujarat, performed rituals and even waved from a seaplane on his last day on the campaign trail.
""If they had lost Gujarat, the BJP would have collapsed like a pack of cards,"" said Congress member Sharmistha Mukherjee.
""This is their citadel, they threw everything at it."" 
In the Congress party office in Ahmedabad, posters of Rahul Gandhi were being pasted on the wall. 

""Rahul Gandhi’s hard work has paid off in the state and it proves that Modi’s governance is not making anyone happy,"" said a Congress leader, Shaktisinh Gohil.

(Reuters) - One of the heaviest travel weeks of the year began with the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights on Sunday at the world's busiest airport in Atlanta, where a power outage that lasted nearly 11 hours left passengers stranded in darkened terminals or in aircraft idling on tarmacs.
The early afternoon outage paralyzed operations at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport before power was finally restored at 11:45 p.m. Sunday EST for flight operations, wreaking havoc on holiday travel plans for thousands of people hit by airline cancellations extending into Monday.
Delta said it was cancelling about 300 flights on Monday, on top of the 900 Sunday cancellations as a result of the Atlanta outage. United Air Lines also warned on social media that travel on Monday may be affected. 
The incident on Sunday led the Federal Aviation Administration to ground flights bound for Atlanta. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) were also among the major carriers that suspended operations at the airport on Sunday. Southwest canceled 70 departures on Sunday.
Georgia Power, the utility that provides electricity to the sprawling airport, said the failure was linked to a fire in an underground facility that damaged substations serving Hartsfield. The blaze, possibly started when a piece of gear failed, damaged access to a backup system, the company said.
All passengers had safely disembarked from aircraft by approximately 10 p.m., or nine hours after the outage began, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said on Twitter.
Photo and videos posted on social media showed passengers huddled in partial darkness inside crowded terminals. Some said they sat on planes for hours. 
""Stuck on a plane at Atlanta Airport as the power is out there ... bedlam inside and boredom out here!"" Jack Harris wrote on Twitter.
The FAA said earlier that it was staffed to handle the expected resumption of commercial traffic on Monday.
Some stranded passengers found lodging in local hotels, and the city was providing shelter at the Georgia International Convention Center. By early Monday, airport officials said on social media that they had served more than 5,000 meals for passengers.
""We’re just focusing on the comfort of our passengers,"" Reed told a news conference on Sunday. ""We know they have had a very, very long and difficult day.
Delta, hit hard because of its hub in Atlanta, said customers flying to or from the airport could make a one-time change to travel plans within certain guidelines. Other airlines also offered waiver for flight changes. Delta said its flight schedule in Atlanta was expected to return to normal by Monday afternoon. 
For all carriers, more than 1,170 flights in or out of Hartsfield were scratched Sunday, airline tracking service FlightAware said.

The airport serves on average about 275,000 passengers each day, according to its website.

1269,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 12:37AM ET</span>",Explainer: Myanmar wields colonial-era law against Reuters journalists,"By Simon Lewis
(Reuters) - Myanmar has accused Reuters reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, of breaching the country's Official Secrets Act, a little-used hangover from colonial rule. Sam Zarifi, secretary general of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), said the law can ensnare working journalists ""at any time"".
The two reporters were arrested on Tuesday evening after they were invited to meet police officers for dinner in the north of Yangon.
The Ministry of Information said they had ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"", and published a photo of the pair in handcuffs standing behind a table with documents laid on it.
ORIGINS OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT
The law dates back to 1923, when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was a province of British India. At the time British administrators worried that rival powers could seek to exploit anti-colonial unrest in its South Asian empire. 
The act, which amended earlier anti-spying legislation, was controversial in India even at the time, according to a history published in 2009 by the United Service Institution of India, a New Delhi-based think tank.
British military officers pushed for the stronger law over concerns about an ""increase in Bolshevik activity"", along with geopolitical threats including ""the possibility of racial war between Japan and the USA affecting India"", the history said.
WHAT THE ACT SAYS
The Official Secrets Act covers trespassing in prohibited areas, handling documents deemed secret and communicating with ""foreign agents"". It carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.
Zarifi of the Geneva-based ICJ - a human rights group made up of 60 senior international judges, lawyers and legal academics - said the definition of an official secret in the act is ""incredibly broad"".
""Just about anyone in possession of unpublished government documents could find themselves facing prosecution and the harsh penalties a conviction may carry,"" Zarifi said. ""Under this law many good journalists could be prosecuted at any time.""
In India, where the same law also remains on the statute book, courts have ruled that it even applies to parliamentary papers such as budget proposals if they are leaked before they are presented in the legislature.
USE OF THE ACT
Legal experts say prosecutions under the act have been rare in Myanmar in recent decades. 
The military junta that ruled until 2011 frequently used other laws or the Penal Code - also inherited from the colonial era - to lock up its critics alongside common criminals. The sprawling code was drafted in 1860, and gives magistrates more than 500 sections under which to charge alleged offenders.
In 1990, a military court sentenced two leaders of the then opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) to 10 years in prison under the Official Secrets Act after they passed an official letter to foreign embassies. The prosecution was part of a broad crackdown following an election won by the NLD that the junta ignored. 
They were freed in 1992, in an amnesty, according to a New York Times report at the time.
Reports of at least two other cases brought under the act are recorded in the online archives of the Asian Human Rights Commission in 2009 and 2010. 
The first case involved a man jailed for trespassing on military land and recording video footage to allegedly send abroad. He had been helping a farmer file a land grab complaint against the military. The second concerned a former army officer who was jailed in 2010 for allegedly having secret information on his laptop that he passed to foreign news agencies.
The most well-documented recent case involving the Official Secrets Act came in January of 2014, when the Yangon-based weekly, Unity Journal, published a front page article it said exposed a secret chemical weapons factory run by the military in central Myanmar. 
Police arrested the newspaper's CEO and four journalists involved in publishing the story, raided its offices, and attempted to seize all copies of the edition from newsstands.
A civilian court in Pakkoku, near the alleged factory, sentenced them in July 2014 to 10 years in prison with hard labor - later reduced to seven years. The case was widely seen by the domestic media as a warning that military affairs remained off-limits even though direct military rule had ended.
The 'Unity Five' were released in an amnesty in April 2016, soon after the NLD, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, had come to power following an election in 2015.
The Unity Journal subsequently closed. 
Reuters was unable to reach government legal officials over the weekend and a Monday public holiday to request details of any other past cases in which the Official Secrets Act was used.
THE LATEST CASE
Little is known of the allegations against the two Reuters journalists, other than that police said they were ""arrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces"" and are charged under Section 3 of the Official Secrets Act.
Two policemen are also being investigated in the case, according to police.
Section 3 covers entering prohibited places, taking images or handling secret official documents that ""might be or is intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy"".
Human Rights Watch in 2016 said Section 3 ""defines the offence of ‘spying’ extremely broadly"". 
""Where a military establishment is involved, section 3(2) of the statute effectively places the burden on the defendant to prove that they are not guilty,"" the group said.
HAS ANYTHING CHANGED UNDER SUU KYI?
In May 2016, the month after Suu Kyi took power, the 1975 State Protection Act that had been used to keep her under house arrest for years was repealed.
The Emergency Provisions Act, introduced in 1950 and frequently used against activists after the military seized power in a 1962 coup, was swept away in October the same year.
But the Official Secrets Act and other laws, such as the 1908 Unlawful Associations Act, that have been used to jail journalists and activists, remain in force.

Reuters was unable to reach Suu Kyi's spokesman to seek comment from Suu Kyi on the use of the Official Secrets Act to detain the two Reuters journalists.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduras' electoral tribunal on Sunday declared conservative President Juan Orlando Hernandez the official winner of the Nov. 26 presidential election, sparking fraud accusations and calls for renewed street protests after a bitterly disputed contest.
Hernandez beat center-left challenger and TV star Salvador Nasralla by 1.53 percentage points, according to the official count.
David Matamoros, the head of the tribunal, said in a nationally televised address that all of the challenges presented to it had been resolved and votes were recounted at select polling stations, declaring Hernandez ""the president-elect for the Republic of Honduras.""
Nasralla said in a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that it was clear there had been fraud ""before, during and after"" the election, saying the decision by the tribunal was a ""desperate move."" The candidate said he was headed to Washington to meet with U.S. State Department officials and the head of the Organization of American States.
The outcome of those meetings would help determine what steps to take next, he added.
The secretary general of the OAS, Luis Almagro, said earlier on Sunday that ""serious questions"" still surrounded the election results and he asked that ""irresponsible announcements"" be avoided.
Honduras has been roiled by political instability and violent protests since the vote, which initial counts suggested Nasralla had won. The count has been questioned by the two main opposition parties, including the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship, headed by Nasralla, as well as a wide swath of the diplomatic corps.
European Union election observers said the vote recount showed no irregularities.
""After comparing a large random sample of voting records provided to us by the Alliance and the original records published on the tribunal's website, the mission observed that the results presented practically no differences,"" said Jose Antonio de Gabriel, the adjunct head of the EU's mission.
Former Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, who backed Nasralla, took to Twitter, saying Hernandez ""is not our president"" and calling for people to take to the streets in protest.
The tribunal had initially declared Nasralla the leader in an announcement on the morning after the vote, with just over half of the ballot boxes counted. It then gave no further updates for about 36 hours.
Once results started flowing in again, Nasralla's lead began narrowing and eventually disappeared.

That prompted national protests, in which 22 people were killed, including two police officers, according to data tallied by the Committee of Detained Disappeared Persons in Honduras.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian homicide detectives on Sunday took the lead in investigating the mysterious deaths of pharmaceuticals billionaire Barry Sherman and his wife, Honey, a day after relatives complained about the handling of the case. 
The development does not mean the deaths are being treated as homicides, Toronto Police Service spokeswoman Michelle Flannery told Reuters. 
The couple, who were celebrated for their philanthropy and financial success, were found on Friday hanging from a railing by the side of their pool by a real estate agent involved with selling their house in Toronto, Canadian media reported.
Police have said there was no sign of forced entry to the home, which is listed for sale at C$6.9 million ($5.4 million). 
Autopsies conducted on Saturday and Sunday determined that Barry Sherman, 75, and his wife, 70, died from ligature neck compression, police said in a statement. They asked anybody with information on the case to contact authorities.
Flannery would not say whether police were looking for a suspect. Police had said on Saturday they had nobody in custody and were not seeking any suspects.
The case has dominated the Canadian news, with employees, friends and leading politicians expressing shock. 
The Globe and Mail, Toronto Sun and Toronto Star reported Saturday that police were operating on the theory that Barry Sherman had killed his wife and hanged himself. 
A statement issued late Saturday on behalf of the Shermans' four children criticized that idea. 
""We are shocked and think it's irresponsible that police sources have reportedly advised the media of a theory which neither their family, their friends nor their colleagues believe to be true,"" the statement reads. 
""We urge the Toronto Police Service to conduct a thorough, intensive and objective criminal investigation,"" it said.
Barry Sherman founded Apotex Inc in 1974 and built it into one of the world's biggest generic drug makers, making him one of Canada's richest people.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 09:50PM ET</span>",Paraguay senator with dictatorship ties to run for president,"ASUNCION (Reuters) - Paraguayan Senator Mario Abdo Benitez, a lawmaker with ties to a former Paraguayan dictator, won the ruling Colorado Party's presidential primary on Sunday in a sharp rebuke for President Horacio Cartes, the party's flagbearer.
Abdo, the son of former dictator Alfredo Stroessner's private secretary, beat out ex-finance minister Santiago Pena, a young economist and Cartes' hand-picked successor, in a surprise outcome that followed increasing dissatisfaction with Cartes, who has been in power since 2013.
Abdo will face lawyer Efrain Alegre, who won the opposition Liberal Party's nomination, in the April presidential election in the land-locked nation of 6.8 million, long one of South America's poorest. 
The Colorado party has governed Paraguay for nearly 70 years, including during Stroessner's 1954-1989 dictatorship, with a brief interruption when leftist Fernando Lugo was elected in 2008 and impeached in 2012. 
With over 96 percent of primary votes counted, Paraguay's electoral authority said that Abdo had received 50.9 percent of the vote. Pena had garnered 43.3 percent.
""The arrogant establishment has been defeated today and forever ... we all have scars but are urging unity for the Colorados and later, Paraguay,"" Abdo told his supporters following his victory.
Cartes, a former soft-drink and tobacco executive, has run a low-tax policy that investors credit with spurring one of the fastest economic growth rates in Latin America. But his attempt to change laws enabling him to run for re-election spurred protests and was widely criticized.
Abdo, known in Paraguay by his nickname ""Marito,"" has been a harsh critic of Cartes, and aligned with the opposition in Congress to fight his proposed re-election amendment.

More than one million members of the Colorado Party voted on Sunday, an estimated turnout of 50 percent.

MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States provided intelligence to Russia that helped thwart a potentially deadly bomb attack in St. Petersburg, U.S. and Russian officials said on Sunday, in a rare public show of cooperation despite deep strains between the two countries.
Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday to thank him for the tip-off, which the Kremlin said helped prevent a militant bomb attack on a cathedral in the Russian city, as well as other sites.
The White House did not disclose details about the plot itself, but said the attack ""could have killed large numbers of people."" Neither the Kremlin nor the White House identified the would-be attackers.
The U.S. warning allowed Russian law enforcement agencies to arrest the suspects before they could carry out their plans, the White House and Kremlin said.
Relations between Washington and Moscow have been damaged by disagreements over the wars in Ukraine and Syria, although Trump pledged during his election campaign to pursue better ties with Moscow. 
That has been complicated by U.S. allegations - denied by Russia - that the Kremlin meddled in last year's U.S. presidential election to help Trump win.
Russian officials say Putin believes Trump is not to blame for the tensions. 
The phone call on Sunday between Trump and Putin was at least the second such call in the past week. On Thursday, Putin and Trump discussed the crisis in North Korea.
CATHEDRAL THREAT
The foiled attack was to have been carried out on Kazansky Cathedral, in Russia's second city of St. Petersburg, and on other locations in the city where large numbers of people gather, the Kremlin statement said. The cathedral is a popular tourist site.
The White House seized on the foiled plot in St. Petersburg as a sign of what Moscow and Washington could do if they cooperate.
""Both leaders agreed that this serves as an example of the positive things that can occur when our countries work together,"" the White House said, adding Trump appreciated the call from Putin. 
Russian media reported last week that the Federal Security Service had detained followers of the Islamic State group who had been planning a suicide bomb attack on Kazansky Cathedral on Saturday. 
The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for additional details on the foiled plot.
Putin said Russia would alert U.S. authorities if it received information about any attack being planned on the United States, the Kremlin said.
Russia has repeatedly been the target of attacks by Islamist militant groups, including an attack in April that killed 14 people when an explosion tore through a train carriage in a metro tunnel in St. Petersburg.

Russian police detained several suspects in that attack from mainly Muslim states in ex-Soviet central Asia.

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",U.N.'s Zeid toughens warning of 'genocide' in Myanmar,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The top U.N. human rights official has said he would not be surprised if a court one day ruled that acts of genocide had been committed against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, according to a television interview to be shown on Monday.
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein told the BBC that attacks on the Rohingya had been ""well thought out and planned"" and he had asked Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi to do more to stop the military action.
Zeid has already called the campaign ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" and asked rhetorically if anyone could rule out ""elements of genocide"", but his latest remarks put the case plainly, toughening his stance.
“The elements suggest you cannot rule out the possibility that acts of genocide have been committed,” he said, according to excerpts of his interview provided in advance by the BBC.
“It’s very hard to establish because the thresholds are high,” he said. “But it wouldn’t surprise me in the future if the court were to make such a finding on the basis of what we see.”
Myanmar denies committing atrocities against the Rohingya and has previously rejected U.N. criticism for its ""politicization and partiality"". The Myanmar military says the crackdown is a legitimate counter-insurgency operation.
Zeid said Myanmar's ""flippant"" response to the serious concerns of the international community made him fear the current crisis “could just be the opening phases of something much worse”.
He told the BBC he feared jihadi groups could form in the huge refugee camps in Bangladesh and even launch attacks in Myanmar, perhaps targeting Buddhist temples there.
He did not say, in the excerpts provided, which court could prosecute suspected atrocities. Myanmar is not a member of the International Criminal Court, so referral to that court could be done only by the U.N. Security Council. But Myanmar's ally China could veto such a referral. 
The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare under international law, but has been used in contexts including Bosnia, Sudan and an Islamic State campaign against the Yazidi communities in Iraq and Syria.
Almost 870,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, including about 660,000 who arrived after Aug. 25, when Rohingya militants attacked security posts and the Myanmar army launched a counter-offensive. 
U.N. investigators have heard Rohingya testimony of a ""consistent, methodical pattern of killings, torture, rape and arson"".
Zeid said he had phoned Suu Kyi in January, asking her in vain to stop the military operation.

Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi’s less than two-year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under Myanmar’s transition after decades of military rule.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",UK's May to pitch status quo Brexit transition to parliament,"By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May will pitch her plan for a Brexit transition period with unchanged access to European Union markets when she briefs lawmakers on Monday about her latest negotiating trip to Brussels.
May secured an agreement last week to move previously-deadlocked talks forward onto the topic of interim and long-term trading arrangements.
On Monday she will report back to parliament on those talks, setting out the framework of a time-limited implementation period designed to smooth Britain's EU exit and provide clarity for businesses and citizens. 
""This will help give certainty to employers and families that we are going to deliver a smooth Brexit,"" May will say, adding that the guidelines agreed last week point to a shared desire with the EU to make ""rapid progress"" on a deal.
The outline of the transition period that May will present is consistent with plans she has previously set out, and remains subject to negotiation in Brussels.
""During this strictly time-limited implementation period which we will now begin to negotiate, we would not be in the Single Market or the Customs Union, as we will have left the European Union,"" May will say according to advance extracts of her statement. 
""But we would propose that our access to one another's markets would continue as now, while we prepare and implement the new processes and new systems that will underpin our future partnership.""
END-STATE TALKS 
But the plan is not guaranteed to be universally accepted by lawmakers in May's Conservative Party, which is still deeply divided over the best route out of the bloc, and for some even the principle of leaving the EU. 
May is reliant on the backing of all members of her party to put her Brexit plans into action, having lost her parliamentary majority in an ill-judged snap election earlier this year which left her needing the support of a small Northern Irish party. 
On Saturday, some Conservatives who want to see Britain make a more radical break with the bloc baulked at a suggestion by Finance Minister Philip Hammond that the implementation phase would amount to recreating the status quo with the EU.
May will say that during the interim period, Britain wants to begin registering EU citizens' arrival in the country in preparation for a new immigration system, and would hope to agree, and possibly even sign, post-Brexit trade deals with non-EU states.
As well as briefing parliament, May is expected to meet key ministers on Monday to discuss the even thornier issue of what the country's long-term relationship with the EU should be - the first time since the June 2016 vote to leave that she has broached the topic with senior cabinet members.
A full cabinet discussion on the so-called ""end state"" of the Brexit talks is then due on Tuesday. 

One of the key pro-Brexit voices in the cabinet, foreign minister Boris Johnson, on Sunday set out his own long-term view, warning May that Britain must avoid becoming subordinate to the EU.

The North African oil producer has been in chaos since the 2011 uprising that unseated Muammar Gaddafi, but Misrata, Libya's biggest port, had been relative peaceful until now.
Gunmen chased the car of Mayor Mohamed Eshtewi after he left Misrata airport following his arrival on a plane from Turkey, a security official said, adding it was unclear who was behind it.
In October, a bomb exploded at the city's court, killing about four people and wounding 40 others in an attack claimed by Islamic state.
Misrata, almost 200 km (125 miles) east of Tripoli, is the gateway for food and other imports into Libya and the country's only tax-free zone. It is one of the few places still frequented by foreign business people fearing poor security elsewhere.

Attacks on aid workers are relatively rare in the conflict with the Islamist insurgency, compared with assaults on the military and civilians in Nigeria's northeast.
The years of fighting have spawned what the United Nations calls one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with 8.5 million people in need of life-saving assistance.
""WFP can confirm that a convoy escorted by the Nigerian military including WFP-hired trucks was the subject of an attack by armed groups 35 km southwest of Ngala in Borno State on Saturday,"" she said in an emailed statement. 
""Four people, including the driver of a WFP-hired truck and a driver's assistant, were killed in the incident,"" the statement said, adding that ""WFP is working with the authorities to determine the whereabouts of the trucks.""
The spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the driver and assistant were WFP staff, or give details about the other two people killed.
A military spokesman declined to comment.
Last year, the United Nations suspended aid deliveries in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno, the epicenter of the conflict, after a humanitarian convoy was attacked, leaving two aid workers injured.
Last week, the Nigerian government approved the release of $1 billion from the country's excess oil account to the government to help fight the Boko Haram insurgency, despite a two-year narrative that Boko Haram has been all but defeated.
There are other signs the government and military may be abandoning that narrative.
Nigeria's long-term plan is now to corral civilians inside fortified garrison towns - effectively ceding the countryside to Boko Haram.
Earlier this month, Nigeria replaced the military commander of the campaign against Boko Haram after half a year in the post. Military sources told Reuters that came after a series of ""embarrassing"" attacks by the Islamists.

VENTURA, Calif. (Reuters) - Calming winds on Sunday helped slow the spread of a California wildfire that already ranks as the third largest in state history, having scorched 269,000 acres (109,000 hectares) along the scenic Pacific Coast north of Los Angeles.
Officials said more than 8,500 firefighters were battling the so-called Thomas Fire in Southern California, which began on
Dec. 4. It has destroyed more than 1,000 structures and threatened 18,000 others, including homes in the wealthy town of Montecito just outside the coastal city of Santa Barbara.
The blaze, centered less than 100 miles (160 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, has forced evacuations that turned neighborhoods into ghost towns and filled the air with smoke. 
Communities near Santa Barbara saw a break from the gusting winds that had stoked the fire and helped it spread, opening a window for authorities to contain the disaster during the next two days. 
""We want to make sure we get a hold of this thing before Wednesday,"" said Captain Rick Crawford, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire.
Strong winds persisted on Sunday in Ventura County, which remained under a red flag warning. Crawford said the threat level was expected to drop later in the day. 
The fire is now 40 percent contained. Firefighters were employing more than 970 fire engines and 34 helicopters to battle the blaze.
Larry Dennis, 60, sought refuge at a shelter in the city of Ventura on Sunday after the blaze inundated the coastal region with smoke and turned nearby hillsides red. 
""I've seen people who have lost everything,"" he said.
Charlotte Garcia, 25, had been at the shelter for almost a week after the fire burned down her house in Ojai, about 30 miles (48 km) north of Ventura. She lamented that firefighters had not done more to stop the destruction.
""The house next door to us got burnt down too, because they were too busy on the hill,"" she said.
Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson, 32, died on Thursday while battling the flames near the Ventura County community of Fillmore. The blaze's first fatality, he died of smoke inhalation and burns, the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office said.
Five of the 20 most destructive fires in recorded history have ravaged the state in 2017, according to Cal Fire.

The Thomas fire, the seventh-most destructive in state history, forced many schools to close for days, shut roads and drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. It was also responsible for poor air quality throughout Southern California.

""I don't idolize nuclear energy at all. But I think you have to pick your battle. My priority in France, Europe and internationally is CO2 emissions and (global) warming,"" he told France 2 television in an interview. 
Macron, who has worked to establish his role as a global leader since his election win in May, presided over a climate summit in Paris last week to breathe new life into a collective effort to fight climate change.
But renewable energy only amounts to a tiny share of French electricity production, which is dominated by nuclear for 75 percent of it.
""Nuclear is not bad for carbon emissions, it's even the most carbon-free way to produce electricity with renewables,"" Macron said.
The 39-year old, who has sought to forge strong ties with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, did not show any enthusiasm for her decision to phase out nuclear energy, one of her landmark policies.
""What did the Germans do when they shut all their nuclear in one go?,"" Macron said.
""They developed a lot of renewables but they also massively reopened thermal and coal. They worsened their CO2 footprint, it wasn't good for the planet. So I won't do that.""
Macron said he wanted to boost the growth of renewable energy but would wait for the French nuclear watchdog's opinion before shutting ageing nuclear reactors or upgrading others.
The ASN nuclear regulator said last month it would rule on a potential lifespan extension of France's 58 nuclear reactors - all operated by state-owned EDF (PA:EDF) - in 2020-21.

""This is what we'll base our decisions on,"" Macron said. ""So it'll be rational. So in the face of that, we'll have to shut some plants. Maybe we'll have to modernize others,"" he said.

Despite being a leading backer of the Syrian opposition, France has sought a more pragmatic approach to the Syrian conflict since the arrival of President Emmanuel Macron, saying that the departure of al-Assad was not a pre-condition for talks. 
Assad's government has been backed by Russia and Iran. President Vladimir Putin last week announced a significant scaling back of Russian forces in Syria, saying their mission was largely complete.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian state television broadcast on Sunday what it described as the confessions of an Iranian academic with Swedish residency who it said had provided information to Israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists. 
His wife, speaking by telephone from Stockholm, said he had been forced by his interrogators to read the confession.
Iran's Supreme Court upheld last week a death sentence against Ahmadreza Djalali, a doctor and lecturer at the Karolinska Institute, a Stockholm medical university.
Djalali was arrested in Iran in April 2016 and later convicted of espionage. He denied the charges.
In the television report, Djalali was linked to the assassination of four Iranian scientists between 2010 and 2012 that Tehran said was an Israeli attempt to sabotage its nuclear energy program. 
Djalali said in the report that he had given the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad information about key nuclear scientists.
""They were showing me pictures of some people or satellite photos of nuclear facilities and were asking me to give them information about that,” Djalali said in the television report.
Vida Mehrannia, Djalali’s wife, said her husband had been forced to read a pre-agreed confession in front of the camera.
""After three months in solitary confinement, his interrogators told him that he would be released only if he reads from a text in front of the camera,"" she told Reuters by telephone from Stockholm.
""My husband told me that they shouted at him each time he was saying something different from the text and stopped the filming,"" Mehrannia added.
DEATH SENTENCE CRITICIZED
The film said Djalali had agreed to cooperate with Israel in return for money and residency of a European country.
""We have not received money from anyone and our lifestyle shows that. We don't have a house or a car. We got our Swedish residency after finishing our studies here,"" Mehrannia said.
The film also contained interviews with Majid Jamali Fashi, an Iranian athlete who was hanged in 2012 over the killings of the nuclear scientists.
Djalali is the second person found guilty in the same case.
""Djalali did not have any sensitive information about Iran’s nuclear program. If he had, he would have been barred from leaving the country,"" Mehrannia said.
Sweden has condemned the death verdict against Djalali and said it had raised the matter with Iranian envoys in Stockholm and Tehran.
Seventy-five Nobel prize laureates petitioned Iranian authorities last month to release Djalali so he could ""continue his scholarly work for the benefit of mankind"".
They said Djalali has suggested it was his refusal to work for Iranian intelligence services that led to this “unfair, flawed trial”.
The United Nations and international human rights organizations regularly list Iran as a country with one of the world’s highest execution rates. 
Iran's Revolutionary Guards have arrested at least 30 dual nationals during the past two years, mostly on spying charges.

The National Liberation Army (ELN) and the government have been in public peace talks in Quito for 10 months, after a long exploratory phase of negotiations, in a bid to end more than 53 years of war.
The group's first-ever ceasefire began in October and is set to expire Jan. 9. It is being supervised by the Catholic Church and the United Nations.

""If we succeed, Europe will be changed and we won’t need a referendum on the euro. Otherwise we'll ask Italians if they want to stay in or not,"" he said.
Earlier this month, Di Maio told Reuters 5-Star had not totally withdrawn the idea of a referendum on the euro, but called it ""a last resort"" to be employed only if it was not possible to ease EU governance rules. 
The comments come just weeks before parliament is expected to be dissolved ahead of elections early next year which look unlikely to produce a clear winner.
The 5-Star Movement is predicted to emerge as the largest single party in the next parliament, but it has repeatedly ruled out joining any coalition.

Italy has just introduced a new electoral system that is expected to handicap 5-Star, favoring instead mainstream political blocs.

Known as the Law of Internal Security, it will formally regulate the deployment of the military in Mexico more than a decade after the government dispatched it to fight drug cartels in a conflict that has claimed well over 100,000 lives.
Bucking widespread protests from rights groups, Congress on Friday gave a green light to the law, which was backed by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and some members of the center-right opposition National Action Party. It will now head to President Enrique Pena Nieto's desk to be signed into law.
The new law could lead to the ""violation of Mexicans' basic rights and freedoms, affect the design and constitutionally established balance between institutions, state organs and powers, and lead to states of emergency being imposed on Mexican society,"" the CNDH said in a statement late Saturday.
Supporters of the legislation say it will set out clear rules that limit the use of soldiers to fight crime.
Multiple human rights groups and international organizations, including the United Nations, attacked the bill, mindful of the dozens of reported cases of abuses by members of the military in Mexico over the past 11 years. They say it could usher in greater abuses and impunity by the armed forces.
Opponents of the bill have taken to the streets to protest and demand the measure not be signed into law.

The CNDH said it has asked Pena Nieto to make the necessary changes to the bill to make sure it upholds human and civil rights.

In Bucharest, an estimated 4,000 protesters marched from government headquarters to parliament, where lawmakers will begin debating changes on Monday to the criminal code.
Earlier this month, the Social Democrats used their solid majority to approve a judicial overhaul in the lower house that threatens to put the justice system under political control. The senate is expected to approve the bills next week.
The European Commission, the U.S. State Department, the country’s centrist president and thousands of magistrates have criticized the changes to judicial legislation, saying they could derail the rule of law.
The government denies this is the case.
Outside parliament, the marchers chanted ""Thieves’ nest"" and ""We want justice, not corruption"" under sleet and rain. Thousands more protested in the cities of Iasi, Cluj, Timisoara and others.
Attempts by the ruling Social Democrats to change anti-corruption legislation have taken place on and off throughout 2017 in one of the European Union's most corrupt states.
Romania's anti-corruption prosecution unit has sent 72 deputies and senators to trial since 2006 alongside cabinet ministers, a sitting Prime Minister and hundreds of mayors and other public officials.
The speakers of parliament’s lower house and senate are both currently on trial in separate cases.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 02:20PM ET</span>",SPD leader wants Merkel to relinquish finance ministry: Handelsblatt,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) leader Martin Schulz wants Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives to leave the powerful finance ministry to his center-left party in coalition talks, a report in business daily Handelsblatt said. 
SPD leaders agreed on Friday to open exploratory talks on forming a government with Merkel's center-right bloc, providing a chance to end a rare period of political deadlock in Europe's economic powerhouse after an inconclusive federal election.
Merkel, who lost many supporters to the far-right in the Sept. 24 election, is banking on the SPD to extend her 12-year tenure after attempts to cobble together an awkward three-way alliance with two smaller parties failed in November.
SPD members fear the party risks losing its identity and sustaining further electoral defeats if it signs up for another ""grand coalition"" with the conservatives. The SPD was Merkel's junior coalition partner from 2005-2009 and from 2013-2017.
Handelsblatt said in a report to be published on Monday that Schulz had told a group of SPD lawmakers that his party should take control of the finance ministry which was led by veteran conservative Wolfgang Schaeuble for the past eight years.
""The goal is (to get) the Federal Finance Ministry,"" Schulz was quoted as saying, adding that the past years had shown how important the finance department had become.
The SPD was not immediately available to comment on the report.
Merkel's conservatives and the SPD are expected to meet next Wednesday to discuss the timetable and agenda of exploratory talks which will not start in serious before early January.
Then another SPD party convention will have to give green light to kick off official coalition negotiations, scheduled for mid-January. Any agreement would finally be subject for approval by SPD members afterwards. That could mean that Germany most probably will not have a new government in place before March.
If the SPD were to agree to another ""grand coalition"" - an option that the SPD says is by no means a foregone conclusion - and demand the finance ministry, it would likely result in changes to Germany's European policy such as more focus on spending and investment rather than austerity.
Schaeuble, who has taken on the role of president in the Bundestag lower house of parliament, became unpopular among struggling euro zone states during his eight years in office due to his focus on fiscal restraint and structural reforms.
Merkel ally Peter Altmaier has taken over the role as finance minister in the current caretaker government.

Schulz has repeatedly said Europe could not afford to undergo another four years of the kind of European policy that Schaeuble had practiced.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Monday on a draft resolution calling for the withdrawal of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, diplomats said, a move likely to face a Washington veto.
The one-page Egyptian-drafted text, seen by Reuters, does not specifically mention the United States or Trump. Diplomats say it has broad support among the 15-member council, and while it is unlikely to be adopted, the vote will further isolate Trump on the issue. 
To pass, a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Britain, Russia or China.
Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, generating outrage from Palestinians. Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has praised Trump's decision as ""the just and right thing to do.""
The U.S. mission to the United Nations was not immediately available to comment on Sunday. 
Arab foreign ministers agreed to seek a U.N. Security Council resolution on the issue. The draft U.N. text expresses ""deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem."" 
It ""affirms that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered, the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council.""
The draft also calls upon all countries to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem.
Israel considers the city its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. 
""No vote or debate will change the clear reality that Jerusalem"" is the capital of Israel, Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a statement on Saturday. 
Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city's eastern sector, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. 
The draft council resolution ""demands that all states comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem, and not to recognize any actions or measures contrary to those resolutions.""
A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted in December 2016 ""underlines that it will not recognize any changes to the 4 June 1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations.""

That resolution was approved with 14 votes in favor and an abstention by former U.S. President Barack Obama's administration, which defied heavy pressure from longtime ally Israel and Trump, who was then president-elect, for Washington to wield its veto.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Fifty couples from China tied the knot in the Sri Lankan capital on Sunday in a mass wedding ceremony, conducted in the island's Buddhist traditions, as the island aims to woo more tourists.
The couples included newly-weds as well as already married couples aiming to re-dedicate their marriages, officials said. 
Some were dressed in the traditional attire of Sri Lanka's mountainous central region while others wore Chinese or Western clothes at the main ceremony in the central Colombo area. 
""There’ll be many more couples who want to come here and celebrate true marriages from China and other parts of the world,"" Tourism Minister John Amaratunga told Reuters. 
""It’ll be an opening to say Sri Lanka is the best destination for foreigners.""
Chinese tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka have been rising and now account for around 13 percent of the two million tourists a year who visit the country, second only to the number of Indian visitors, official data show.
Tourism accounts for around 5 percent of gross domestic product and arrivals this year have already reached about 2.3 million.
China is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Sri Lanka for major infrastructure projects and Colombo is one of the major partners in Beijing’s ""One Belt One Road"" project.
""This is a beautiful country. We love the traditional ceremony,"" bridegroom Wei Ying Nang, 28, told Reuters after the wedding, standing beside his wife, who was dressed in a white wedding frock while he wore a suit.
Alice Wu, dressed in a golden sari from Sri Lanka's mountainous region, said she was interested in the culture since she studied traditional Kandyan dancing in Sri Lanka three years ago.

Her husband, 25-year old Henry Liu, wore a traditional red costume resembling the dress of the ancient kings of Sri Lanka.

The confrontation, which included the firing of tear gas canisters, was the latest chapter in the former Georgian president's stand-off with Ukrainian authorities that led to his detention and release from custody last week.
The October Palace, a cultural center, became a symbol of revolt when it was a key location in the 2013-14 pro-European uprising that ousted a Moscow-backed president and installed Poroshenko, who promised to eliminate widespread corruption.
Saakashvili, president of his native Georgia in 2004-2013, moved to Ukraine after an uprising there and served as a regional governor in 2015-16 before falling out with Poroshenko, whom he accuses of failing to stamp out endemic graft and being corrupt himself. Poroshenko denies the accusations.
Sunday's scuffles at the October Palace were an offshoot of a larger, peaceful opposition rally in which several thousand people marched through central Kiev earlier in the day, calling for Poroshenko's impeachment.
The situation was relatively calm at the Palace after darkness fell with a large number of riot police blocking the entrance to the center, whose doors protesters had earlier tried to break through, some throwing stones and other objects. 
""We have to be calm, keep the peace,"" Saakashvili told a few hundred of his supporters, who remained outside the building.
No serious injuries were reported in the clashes.
Saakashvili accused the authorities of engineering the situation to provoke violence. Earlier, he had called on protesters to set up a headquarters in the building. But later, he condemned any attempt to seize administration buildings.
Interior ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko held Saakashvili responsible for the clashes.
""Despite all the provocations as a result of which Mikheil Saakashvili wants to spill the blood of Ukrainians, he has not succeeded,"" he said in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The comments continue a long-running blame game that has included prosecutor's accusing Saakashvili of assisting a criminal organization, charges he says are trumped up to undermine his campaign to unseat Poroshenko.
Police said the attempt to charge into the October Palace occurred while a children's concert was going on inside.

Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko, who attended the rally, joined other opposition MPs in condemning Saakashvili's actions. ""This behavior could destroy the remnants of trust among like-minded political associates and alienate society,"" he said on Facebook.

The poll, conducted by Ipsos Peru for the daily newspaper El Comercio, came just four days before Congress votes on removing Kuczynski from office on the grounds he is morally unfit to lead.
The poll found that only 18 percent of Peruvians had a favorable opinion of Kuczynski´s administration. That is down nine percentage points from November.
Fifty-seven percent of respondents now prefer that he leave office, Ipsos said.
The new data suggests that Peruvians are quickly losing faith in Kuczynski after documents sent to Congress showed scandal-plagued Odebrecht had paid $4.8 million to two companies owned by Kuczynski or a close business associate for financial and advising services.
The number of Peruvians who said they disapproved of him rose 10 percentage points to 75 percent, Ipsos said.
Kuczynski, who has denied any links to Odebrecht, has resisted calls to resign over the transactions and said there was nothing improper about them.
Odebrecht, which admitted in a plea deal last year to bribing officials in 12 countries including Peru, said on Saturday the $4.8 million were legitimate payments and not part of its past corrupt dealings.
Late Friday, lawmakers passed a motion to start ""presidential vacancy"" procedures to unseat Kuczynski in a vote scheduled for Thursday.
If Kuczynski is removed, Vice President Martin Vizcarra, who is also serving as ambassador to Canada, would take over. New elections would only be called if Vizcarra as well as Kuczynski's second vice president resigned or were removed from office.
In the poll, 67 percent of Peruvians said new elections should be held. Only 30 percent said Vizcarra should take over, the Ipsos poll found.
""At this point, it seems inevitable that Kuczynski will fall,"" said Ipsos president Alfredo Torres. ""Independent of the legality of his conduct ... it's undeniable that his credibility has been profoundly hurt."" 
Two former Peruvian presidents, Ollanta Humala and Alejandro Toledo, have been ensnared in the Odebrecht probe over alleged payments - which they have denied. Humala was jailed in July pending trial and authorities hope to extradite Toledo from the United States.

The poll of 1,287 Peruvians conducted Dec. 13-15 has a margin of error of 2.7 percentage points.

The remains of his wife, Queen Elena, also returned to Italy on Friday for reburial with those of the king at the Sanctuary of Vicoforte, near the Piedmont town of Cuneo, a spokesman for the sanctuary said.
Elena died in 1959 and her remains had lain in Montpelier in France.
Victor Emmanuel III's 46-year reign, which started in 1900 after the assassination of his father Umberto I, encompassed the period of fascist rule in Italy under dictator Benito Mussolini.
He drew criticism for failing to prevent Mussolini's seizure of power in 1922 and for fleeing Rome in 1944 to avoid an invading German army.
The monarch - known as ""sciaboletta"", or small sabre, due to his stature - abdicated the throne in 1946 in favor of his son Umberto II in a vain effort to avert a plebiscite to decide whether Italy should remain a monarchy or become a republic.
After Italians voted for a republic, Victor Emmanuel went into exile in Alexandria, Egypt, where he died the following year.
Italy's post-war constitution barred male descendants of the royal House of Savoy from setting foot in Italy because of the family's support for Mussolini. The ban was lifted in 2002.
The grandson of Umberto II, Emanuele Filiberto, told the Italian press recently that he believed the right place for the remains of former Italian kings was the Pantheon in Rome.

QUETTA, Pakistan/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Two suicide bombers stormed a packed Christian church in southwestern Pakistan on Sunday, killing at least nine people and wounding up to 56, officials said, in the latest attack claimed by Islamic State in the country.
Police guards stationed at the church entrance and on its roof killed one of the bombers but the second attacker detonated his explosives-filled vest outside its prayer hall just after Sunday services began in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan province, said Sarfraz Bugti, the provincial home minister.
Baluchistan police chief Moazzam Jah said there were nearly 400 worshippers in the church for the pre-Christmas service. The death toll could have been much higher if the gunmen had forced their way into the sanctuary, he said.
Jah said the venue - Bethel Memorial Methodist Church - was on high alert as Christian places of worship are often targeted by Islamist extremists over the Christmas season.
""We killed one of them, and the other one exploded himself after police wounded him,"" he said.
Islamic State claimed the attack, the group's Amaq news agency said in an online statement, without providing any evidence for its claim.
Another police official, Abdur Razaq Cheema, said two other attackers escaped. 
Broken wooden benches, shards of glass and musical instruments were scattered around a Christmas tree inside the prayer hall that was splashed with blood stains.
Kal Alaxander, 52, was at the church with his wife and two children when the attack happened.
""We were in services when we heard a big bang,"" he told Reuters. ""Then there was shooting. The prayer hall's wooden door broke and fell on us ... We hid the women and children under desks."" 
Maryam George, 20, cried at a hospital where her younger sister Alizeh was fighting for life with two broken legs and multiple other wounds.
Pakistani Christians, who number around 2 million in a nation of more than 200 million people, have been the target of a series of attacks in recent years.
STRATEGIC REGION
Baluchistan, a strategically important region bordering Iran as well as Afghanistan, is plagued by violence by Sunni Islamist sectarian groups linked to the Taliban, al Qaeda and Islamic State. It also has an indigenous ethnic Baloch insurgency fighting against the central government.
Middle East-based Islamic State has created an active branch in Pakistan and Afghanistan in recent years mostly by recruiting among established militants, and its followers have claimed some of Pakistan's most deadly attacks in recent years.
A suicide bomber killed 52 people and wounded over 100 at a Baluchistan Sufi shrine in November last year, in an attack claimed by Islamic State. In February, Islamic State attacked a Sufi shrine in Pakistan's southern Sindh province, killing 83 people.
Violence in Baluchistan has fueled concern about security for projects in the $57 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan’s southern deep-water port of Gwadar.
The church attack came a day after the third anniversary of a Pakistani Taliban attack on an army-run school that killed 134 children, one of the single deadliest attacks in the country's history.
Pakistan's army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, condemned the attack. 
""Quetta church attack targeting our brotherly Christian Pakistanis is an attempt to cloud Christmas celebrations,"" he said. ""We stay united and steadfast to respond against such heinous attempts.""
Last year's Easter Day attack in a public park that killed more than 70 people in the eastern city of Lahore was claimed by a Taliban splinter group previously associated with Islamic State.

The United States strongly condemned ""the shocking and brutal attack on innocent worshippers,"" U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan David Hale said in a statement.

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 10:09AM ET</span>",East Libyan commander Haftar says will listen to will of 'free Libyan people',"By Ayman al-Warfalli
BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces control parts of the country, said on Sunday he would listen to the will of ""free Libyan people"", in the strongest indication so far that he might run in elections expected next year.
Haftar styles himself as a strongman capable of ending the chaos that has gripped Libya since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
His comments, made at a military graduation ceremony, recall those of Egypt's General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi when he was testing the ground before becoming a presidential candidate. Sisi was eventually elected in 2014.
Just as Sisi built up wide support after toppling Egypt's Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in 2013, supporters of Haftar speak of a similar situation developing in Libya, with rallies held in some eastern cities calling on him to run.
""We declare clearly and unequivocally our full compliance with the orders of the free Libyan people, which is its own guardian and the master of its land,"" Haftar said in a speech.
He spoke in the eastern city of Benghazi, from where his forces managed to expel Islamist militants during a three-year battle.
Haftar, a general from the Gaddafi era, also dismissed a series of U.N.-led talks to bridge differences between Libya's two rival administrations, one linked to him in the east and one backed by the United Nations in the capital Tripoli.
""All the dialogues starting from Ghadames and ending in Tunis and going through Geneva and Skhirat (in Morocco) were just ink on paper,"" he said, listing host cities of U.N. talks.
OBSTACLE
The United Nations launched a new round of talks in September in Tunis between the rival factions to prepare for presidential and parliamentary elections in 2018, but they broke off after one month without any deal.
A major obstacle to progress was the issue of Haftar's own rule. He remains popular among some Libyans in the east weary of the chaos but faces opposition from many in western Libya.
In his speech Haftar said his forces, known as the Libyan National Army (LNA), could be only placed under an authority that had been elected by the Libyan people, in a further indication that he might take part in the election.
Haftar's supporters had set Sunday as a deadline for a U.N. deal or calling on the general to take over for several years. The U.N. has rejected this. 
The large North African country has been in turmoil since Gaddafi's downfall gave space to Islamist militants and smuggling networks that have sent hundreds of thousands of migrants across the Mediterranean to Europe.
Haftar is just one of many players in Libya, which is controlled by armed groups divided along political, religious, regional and business lines.
The president of the eastern House of Representatives backing Haftar, Aguila Saleh, said it was time to start preparing for elections, according to a video posted on social media.

""I urge to join preparing parliamentary and presidential elections,"" he said.

Kai-tak cut power supplies in many areas, forced the cancellation of several flights, stranded more than 15,000 people in various ports in the region and prompted nearly 88,000 people to seek shelter in evacuation centers.
The Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office of Biliran island said 26 residents had died, but the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) has yet to make any official announcement about fatalities.
Biliran Governor Gerardo Espina Jr confirmed the deaths in an interview with DZMM radio, with 23 people still missing, he said.
""We received reports of three deaths coming from the DILG (Department of the Interior and Local Government) but these are for confirmation,"" said NDRRMC spokeswoman Romina Marasigan. ""We are still trying to check the others.""
Many areas were flooded, damaging crops and infrastructure.
Kai-tak has weakened to a tropical depression after barrelling through the eastern region of Visayas on Saturday, hitting islands and coastal towns such as Tacloban City where supertyphoon Haiyan claimed 8,000 lives in 2013.

It was not clear how he would carry out the move, as Israel controls all of Jerusalem and calls the city its indivisible capital. Palestinians want the capital of a future state they seek to be in East Jerusalem, which Israel took in a 1967 war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally.
The Muslim nation summit was a response to U.S. President Donald Trump's Dec. 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. His move broke with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that the city's status must be left to Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
Erdogan said in a speech to members of his AK Party in the southern province of Karaman that Turkey's consulate general in Jerusalem was already represented by an ambassador.
""God willing, the day is close when officially, with God's permission, we will open our embassy there,"" Erdogan said.
Jerusalem, revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, is home to Islam's third holiest shrine as well as Judaism's Western Wall - both in the eastern sector - and has been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades.
Foreign embassies in Israel, including Turkey's, are located in Tel Aviv, reflecting Jerusalem's unresolved status.

A communique issued after Wednesday's summit of more than 50 Muslim countries, including U.S. allies, said they considered Trump's move to be a declaration that Washington was withdrawing from its role ""as sponsor of peace"" in the Middle East.

The crowd sang Happy Birthday in Italian as the pontiff appeared at the window of the Apostolic Palace overlooking St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) for his weekly message and blessing.
The first Latin American pope was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio on Dec. 17, 1936 in Buenos Aires. The former cardinal of the Argentine capital became leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics in 2013. 
In keeping with a long-standing tradition in Rome, the children faced the pope's window and held up small statues of the baby Jesus for him to bless. The statues are placed in home nativity scenes, a custom still practised in many Italian families.
Francis, who has often warned against excessive materialism during the holiday season, departed from his address to say: ""This is the real Christmas. If we remove Jesus, what is left? An empty feast.""

He appealed for the release of six Roman Catholic nuns kidnapped from their convent in the town of Iguoriakhi, Nigeria, last month. Francis said he hoped they and all other victims of kidnappings could be home for Christmas.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Sabih al Masri, a Palestinian billionaire and Jordan's most influential businessman, was released after several days of detention in Saudi Arabia, the latest in a series of events marking the worst crackdown on the rich and powerful in the country's modern history.
Masri, the chairman of Amman-based Arab Bank, the country's largest lender, was detained last Tuesday hours before he was planning to leave after chairing meetings of companies he owns, sources said. He said on Sunday Saudi authorities had given him ""all respect"".
The authorities have not commented on his detention, which came after his confidants had warned him against traveling to the Saudi capital following a series of mass arrests in early November, the sources said.
Sources familiar with the case said he was questioned about his links to Saudi partners among the royals, ministers and officials who were rounded up in last month's crackdown.
His case carried echoes of that of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, who announced his resignation from Riyadh, drawing accusations from Lebanese officials that he had been coerced by the Saudis. Both the Saudis and Hariri denied that, but Hariri later rescinded his resignation.
Masri's detention sent shockwaves through business circles in Jordan and the Palestinian territories. Masri's multi-billion- dollar investments in hotels and banking in Jordan are a cornerstone of the economy of the kingdom and he is by far the biggest investor in Palestinian territories.
Arab Bank shares, which account for almost a quarter of the $24 billion market capitalization of the Amman exchange, ended just 1.44 percent lower at start of weekly trade as investor fears ebbed with news of his release.
Officials and businessmen had warned of the reverberations of the crisis on an aid-strapped Jordanian economy already plagued by high debts. Saudi Arabia is a major donor. 
Masri has since taking the helm at Arab Bank in 2012 helped boost confidence in one of the Arab world's largest private financial institutions. 
The bank, which was first established in Jerusalem in 1930, has a balance sheet of over $45 billion and has earned a reputation of resilience in the face of regional political turmoil.
Masri said on Sunday that he would be returning to Jordan after finishing business meetings in Riyadh in the next two days.
""All is well and am happy (to be released) and I was given all respect by everyone here,"" a Saudi citizen of Palestinian origin, told Reuters from his home in Riyadh.
A member of a prominent merchant family from Nablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Masri amassed a fortune by partnering with influential Saudis in a catering business to supply troops during the U.S.-led military operation to retake Kuwait from Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.
Masri is the founder of Saudi Astra Group, which has wide interests in diversified industries ranging from agro-industry to telecommunications, construction and mining across the region. 
Reasons for Masri's detention were not clear, but political sources said the Saudis might have used him to put pressure on Jordan's King Abdullah not to attend a Muslim summit last week to discuss U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
The Jordanian monarch attended the Istanbul summit, however. He is a custodian of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem and has been vocal in criticizing Trump over his decision on Jerusalem.
Saudi Arabia, whose relations with the United States have warmed with Trump taking a harder line against its arch-rival Iran than his predecessor, appears to have taken a softer line on the decision on Jerusalem than in the past, according to analysts. Riyadh sent a junior minister to the Istanbul meeting.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - A small Christmas market has opened in Algeria's capital, catering to a rising number of Christian African migrants as well as diplomats and locals in the overwhelmingly Muslim country.
Around 99 percent of Algeria's population is Sunni Muslim but the number of Christians has been rising due to an influx of migrants from sub-Saharan countries such as Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.
The market, organized by the Caritas charity, is also a sign of stable security in a country that has rebounded from a decade of Islamist militant violence during which 200,000 people died.
Diplomats used to hunker down in fortified embassies, rarely venturing out, but now live alongside Algerians in residential quarters. No militant attack has been reported in Algiers for more than 10 years.
Caritas staged a similar Christmas market last year but kept it low profile. This year it advertised the market in advance, calling for a ""living together"" between Christians and Muslims.
No official figure is available for the number of African migrants, but some estimates put it at around 100,000.
""It is not about making money, but rather about using the money to help the most vulnerable, whether Algerians, African migrants or Syrians,"" Caritas Algeria director Maurice Pilloud said.
Veiled Muslim women mix with foreigners at the market in Algiers' El Biar district, where honey, chocolate, cakes, jewelry and trinkets are sold. Many donations came from Muslims, said Pilloud.
The market offers the chance for young people to make a contribution to society in a political system where the ruling party has dominated all aspects of the oil-producing North African state since independence in 1962.
""Charitable work remains most attractive for a majority of young Algerians who shun political action because it doesn't bring change,"" said Cherif Lounes, 47, who was visiting the market along with his mother.
""We need 50 Caritas associations in Algeria to help the vulnerable, whether Algerians or migrants,"" added Saida, his 79-year-old mother.

Speaking at a gathering of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in his hometown Davao City, Duterte vowed to protect the rights of homosexuals and invited them to nominate a representative to work in his government.
""I said I am for (same) sex marriage if that is the trend of the modern times,"" he said. ""If that will add to your happiness, I am for it.""
Duterte previously was quoted by local media as saying he was opposed to gay unions because marriage in the Philippines is only between a man and a woman.
Duterte had brought up the gender issue in the past while attacking Western countries that allow it, especially those who criticize his brutal war on drugs.
Many countries, mostly in Western Europe and the Americas, have already recognized same-sex unions. Australia is the latest to legalize it.
Catholic bishops in the Philippines, who also oppose Duterte's bloody anti-narcotics campaign, have voiced concern over legalizing same-sex marriage after his top ally in Congress vowed earlier this year to push for it.
""Why impose a morality that is no longer working and almost passed,"" Duterte said, in an apparent reference to traditional church teaching on the issue. ""So I am with you.""
He asked the LGBT community to nominate a representative whom he could appoint to a government post, saying he needed ""the brightest"" to replace those he has recently fired over allegations of corruption.

""You nominate somebody who is honest, hardworking. I give you until the second week of January to nominate,"" he said.

All 14 passengers, as well as the bus driver and his assistance, survived the attack, although their luggage were burned with the bus.
The attack occurred in Yala, one of the predominantly ethnic Malay Muslim provinces in the south where a separatist insurgency has dragged on for more than a decade. More than 6,500 people have been killed since 2004.
Police said at least 10 gunmen were involved in the latest attack. They all escaped, blocking the road with tree trunks and nails to thwart any pursuers.
An army spokesman was not available for comment. As with most violence in Thailand's deep south, there was no claim of responsibility.
The insurgents are fighting for secession from predominantly Buddhist Thailand.
Thailand's military government has, since 2015, held talks brokered by Malaysia, aim at ending the violence. The process, which aim to established a ""safety-zone"" as a confidence-building measure by early next year, has been stalled.

The poll comes just weeks before parliament is expected to be dissolved before elections early next year.
The PD share of the vote fell 1 percent, from eight days ago, to 23.4 percent, its lowest level in five years, according to the Ipsos poll in the newspaper Corriere della Sera.
Support for the PD, headed by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, has fallen steadily in recent months, with the group damaged by deep schisms and personality clashes.
The party has also come under fire over allegations cabinet undersecretary Maria Elena Boschi took steps to try to save Banca Etruria, a local bank based in her home town of Arezzo. Boschi has repeatedly denied exerting any political pressure in deciding the future of Banca Etruria.
The Ipsos poll said growing support from smaller allies had raised the center-left bloc's share of the vote to 26.2 percent, as of Dec. 14, from 24.8 percent. That was well short of the 36 percent polled by the center-right bloc led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. It was also behind the 28.2 percent share of the 5-Star anti-establishment party.
The 5-Star Movement is predicted to emerge as the largest single party in the next parliament, but it has repeatedly ruled out joining any coalition.
Italy has just introduced a new electoral system that is expected to handicap 5-Star, favoring instead mainstream political blocs.

Italy's parliament is likely to be dissolved between Christmas and the New Year, opening the way for national elections in early March that look unlikely to produce a clear winner.

After his arrest, the 53-year-old suspect, who has lived in Gabon for two decades, told authorities he was carrying out a revenge attack against America for recognizing Israel's capital as Jerusalem, Makaga said, giving no further explanation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday she would not be derailed from leaving the European Union, laying the groundwork for difficult meetings this week in which she will try to unite a divided cabinet behind her vision for post-Brexit Britain.
May was applauded by European Union leaders in Brussels on Friday after securing an agreement to move previously-deadlocked talks forward onto the topic of interim and long-term trading arrangements.
The progress has gone some way to easing concerns of businesses and investors who fear Britain could crash out of the bloc without an exit deal, or that May's fragile government could collapse under the pressure of delivering Brexit.
""Amid all the noise, we are getting on with the job,"" May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. ""My message today is very clear: we will not be derailed from this fundamental duty to deliver the democratic will of the British people."" 
But May can expect some difficult exchanges this week when she and senior ministers discuss the so-called ""end state"" of the Brexit negotiations for the first time since Britain voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016. 
The type of long-term relationship the country should have with the EU is a vexed question at every level in Britain, including within May's cabinet where some want to keep close ties with the EU and others want a more radical divorce from Brussels.
Mindful of the need to keep both sides happy, May has so far plotted a careful path. 
May says she wants a wide-ranging free trade deal with the EU and a more outward-looking trade policy, but has largely steered clear of the more contentious issues such as whether Britain should stay aligned with EU trading rules and the future role of European courts. 
Meetings expected to take place on Monday and Tuesday are likely to force those issues out into the open.
One of the key pro-Brexit voices in the cabinet, foreign minister Boris Johnson, has set out his own view ahead of the meetings, warning May that Britain must avoid becoming subordinate to the EU.
""What we need to do is something new and ambitious, which allows zero tariffs and frictionless trade but still gives us that important freedom to decide our own regulatory framework, our own laws and do things in a distinctive way in the future,” he told the Sunday Times newspaper.

He said that mirroring EU laws would leave Britons asking ""‘What is the point of what you have achieved?’ because we would have gone from a member state to a vassal state.""

Taiwan dispatched its aircraft and ships to ""monitor and deal with"" the Yun8, which returned to its base after flying through the Bashi Channel and Miyako waterway, Defense Minister Feng Shih-kuan said. It was unclear whether one plane or more made the flight.
There was no untoward incident and the public should not be alarmed, Feng said. He did not give further details.
China has considered Taiwan to be a wayward province since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops fled to the island in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war to Mao Zedong's Communist forces on the mainland.
Beijing suspects Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party wants to declare the island’s formal independence. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend the island's security.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring the self-ruled democratic island under its control.
China has conducted numerous similar patrols near Taiwan this year, saying such practices have been normalized as it presses ahead with a military modernization program that includes building aircraft carriers and stealth fighters to give it the ability to project power far from its shores.
In September, the U.S. Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States.
That prompted a senior Chinese diplomat to say this month China would invade the island if any U.S. warships made port visits there.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 03:10AM ET</span>","Billionaire, former journalist face off for Chile presidency","By Caroline Stauffer
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chileans vote in an uncertain runoff presidential election on Sunday that will determine if the world's top copper producer stays on its center-left course or joins a tide of Latin American nations turning to the right in recent years. 
Billionaire former President Sebastian Pinera, 68, a conservative who was considered the front-runner but earned fewer votes than expected in last month's first round, faces center-left journalist and senator Alejandro Guillier, 64.
Both candidates would keep in place Chile's longstanding free-market economic model, but Pinera has promised lower taxes to turbocharge growth while Guillier wants the government to press on with outgoing President Michelle Bachelet's overhaul of education, taxes and labor.
The contest comes ahead of a long stretch of elections in Latin America in 2018. While populist candidates are polling near the top for the region's largest economies of Brazil and Mexico, none advanced to the second round in Chile. 
""One of the striking features, if you stand back, there’s this anti-establishment sentiment gaining ground in Latin America and the choices the (Chilean) voters face on Sunday are fairly mainstream,"" said Michael Shifter, President of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue.
Chilean financial markets rallied in the final week of campaigning, after falling in the weeks after the first round vote on Nov. 19 when far-left Beatriz Sanchez performed better than pollsters had foreseen with over 20 percent of votes, finishing third.
Guillier, the flagbearer for Bachelet's Nueva Mayoria coalition, garnered just 23 percent of first round votes, the weakest performance by any center-left candidate since Chile's return to democracy in 1990 and a reflection of broad discontent with Bachelet. 
Leftists complain her social policies are too timid while the conservative opposition says they have stoked market uncertainty and crimped private investment, causing average economic growth to slow to 1.8 percent per year under Bachelet.
Confidence in Pinera winning the presidency has increased, according to a report from Credicorp Capital, because of his perceived strong performance in the final debate. Growing hopes about his victory, along with firm copper prices, propelled Chile's IPSA stock index to a 7-percent gain last week, its strongest weekly rally in eight years.
""I'm voting for Pinera, he's better for my work,"" said Bea Vaccari, 28, a publicist from Argentina living in and registered to vote in Santiago. 
Unlike most countries in Latin America, voting is not mandatory in Chile, a country of 17 million people with a $250 billion economy. While Sanchez has said she personally will vote for Guillier to protest Pinera, who led Chile between 2010 and 2014, it is not clear her supporters will do the same.
There have been no major polls made public since the first round when Pinera and Guillier were the top two candidates and earned the right to face each other on Sunday. 
""Not coming to vote is handing a victory to the powerful elite. We can keep fighting for a more just Chile,"" Guillier said at his closing rally on Thursday. 
SLIGHT EDGE FOR PINERA
Consultancy Teneo Intelligence said in a report that Pinera, who took more than 36 percent of first-round votes, ""is likely to retain a slight edge"" although the difference was tighter than ever.
""If anything, that margin is likely to have narrowed even further over recent days, as both candidates have scored and lost points on the campaign trail in equal measure,"" it said in a report.
Strong support for Sanchez and far-right Jose Antonio Kast in the first round pushed Pinera and Guillier to try to attract voters unhappy with the status quo in what is widely considered Latin America's most developed nation. 
Pinera, a Harvard-trained economist who made his fortune introducing credit cards to Chile in the 1980s, said he would create a public pension fund to compete with Chile's much-criticized private pension funds, and expand free education.
By contrast, Guillier, a former radio and television journalist from northern Chile of more modest means, has pledged to increase access to free higher education and write workers' and indigenous rights into a constitution to replace the current dictatorship-era document.

""I'm voting for the best of the worst - Guillier,"" said Eduardo Salas, a 72-year-old craftsman and Sanchez supporter. ""Chile needs a more radical change, the economy is concentrated in the hands of too few.""

The man had been charged with two counts under an act preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, police said, and with another four under legislation enforcing United Nations and Australian sanctions against North Korea.
The Sydney man was identified by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and other media as 59-year-old Chan Han Choi, who they said had been living in Australia for more than 30 years and was of Korean descent.
He was arrested in the Sydney suburb of Eastwood on Saturday and was due to face court later on Sunday, police said. He came to the attention of authorities earlier this year, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said.
""This man was a loyal agent of North Korea, who believed he was acting to serve some higher patriotic purpose,"" AFP Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan told reporters.
""This case is like nothing we have ever seen on Australian soil,"" he said.
Police will allege the man tried to broker the sale of missile components, including software for the guidance systems of ballistic missiles, as well as trying to sell coal to third parties in Indonesia and Vietnam.
Gaughan said the trade could have been worth ""tens of millions of dollars"" if successful.
Cash-strapped North Korea has come under a new round of stricter United Nations sanctions this year after pressing ahead with its missile and nuclear programmes in defiance of international pressure.
Tensions have risen dramatically on the Korean peninsula because of the North's ballistic missile launches and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, as well as joint military drills between South Korea and the United States that the North describes as preparation for war.
Pyongyang claimed that its latest intercontinental ballistic missile launch in November had the range to reach all of the United States. 
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged North Korea on Friday to carry out a ""sustained cessation"" of its weapons testing to allow talks about its missile and nuclear programmes.
However, the North has shown little interest in talks until it has the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, which many experts say it has yet to prove.
Gaughan said the man had been in touch with high-ranking North Korean officials but no missile components ever made it to Australia. He also said there was no indication officials in Indonesia or Vietnam had been involved in the attempted coal sales.
""This is black market 101,"" Gaughan said.
""We are alleging that all the activity occurred offshore, and was purely another attempt for this man to trade goods and services as a way to raise revenue for the government of North Korea,"" he said.
The man faces up to 18 years in jail if convicted. He did not apply for bail and will next face court on Wednesday.

A total of six prototypes will eventually conduct test flights, China Central Television reported, with engine tests to be a particular focus.
The aim was to conduct another long-distance test flight in late January, chief engineer Wang Wei was quoted as saying. More than 1,000 tests would be carried out.
The narrow-body aircraft, which will compete with Boeing's 737 and the Airbus A320, is a symbol of China's ambitions to penetrate the global passenger jet market, estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years.
The C919 made its maiden flight on May 5 after numerous delays. Analysts have questioned the long periods between previous test flights.
It completed its first long-distance flight on Nov. 10, flying for 2 hours and 23 minutes from Shanghai to the central Chinese city of Xi'an, covering more than 1,300 km (800 miles) and reaching an altitude of 7,800 meters (25,590 feet).
Its manufacturer, the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], called the maiden flight a milestone that marked the plane's move into an airworthiness certification phase.
COMAC is aiming to obtain certification for the plane from Chinese regulators as well as Europe's aviation safety regulator, which agreed in April to start the certification process.

The plane has dozens of customers who have placed orders and commitments for 785 jets, COMAC has said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Muslims marched from the main mosque in Indonesia's capital to a square in Jakarta on Sunday to protest against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
It was the biggest protest in Indonesia since Trump's controversial move earlier this month to reverse decades of U.S. policy. Police estimated the number attending the rally, organized by various Muslim groups, at about 80,000.
The protest was peaceful but rows of police behind coils of barbed wire held back the crowd outside the U.S. embassy in Jakarta. A police spokesman said 20,000 police and members of the military were deployed to ensure security. 
""We urge all countries to reject the unilateral and illegal decision of President Donald Trump to make Jerusalem Israel's capital,"" Anwar Abbas, the secretary general of the Indonesian Ulema Council, told the crowd.  
""We call on all Indonesian people to boycott U.S. and Israel products in this country"" if Trump does not revoked his action, Abbas said, reading from a petition due to be handed to the U.S. ambassador in Indonesia.
Many of the protesters were clad in white and waved Palestinian flags and held up placards, some reading: ""Peace, love and free Palestine"".
There have been a series of protests in Indonesia over the issue, including some where hardliners burned U.S. and Israeli flags.
The status of Jerusalem, a city holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, is one of the biggest barriers to a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace.
Jerusalem's eastern sector was captured by Israel in a 1967war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally.

Palestinians claim East Jerusalem for the capital of an independent state that they seek, while Israel maintains that all of Jerusalem is its capital.

The need to confront the threat posed by North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear tests comes despite lingering tension over the issue of sexual slavery during Japan's wartime occupation of Korea.
Kang Kyung-wha will arrive in Tokyo on Tuesday and meet Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono during her two-day visit, her first trip to Japan as South Korea's top diplomat, the foreign ministry in Seoul said in a statement. 
""The two ministers will exchange views on issues of common interests focusing on bilateral relations and North Korea-related issues, including its nuclear programme,"" the ministry statement said.
South Korea and Japan are seeking to improve security cooperation over North Korea, but there have been conflicting signals over whether they can resolve a feud over ""comfort women"" who were forced to work in Japan's wartime military brothels.
Ties have been frozen over the issue, with South Korean President Moon Jae-in has promising to renegotiate an unpopular 2015 pact signed with Japan. 
Under that pact, Japan apologized again to former comfort women and promised 1 billion yen ($8.9 million) for a fund to help them. The two governments agreed the issue would be ""irreversibly resolved"" if both fulfilled their obligations.

GWADAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - China is lavishing vast amounts of aid on a small Pakistani fishing town to win over locals and build a commercial deep-water port that the United States and India suspect may also one day serve the Chinese navy.
Beijing has built a school, sent doctors and pledged about $500 million in grants for an airport, hospital, college and badly-needed water infrastructure for Gwadar, a dusty town whose harbor juts out into the Arabian Sea, overlooking some of the world's busiest oil and gas shipping lanes.
The grants include $230 million for a new international airport, one of the largest such disbursements China has made abroad, according to researchers and Pakistani officials.
The handouts for the Gwadar project is a departure from Beijing's usual approach in other countries. China has traditionally derided Western-style aid in favor of infrastructure projects for which it normally provides loans through Chinese state-owned commercial and development banks.
""The concentration of grants is quite striking,"" said Andrew Small, an author of a book on China-Pakistan relations and a Washington-based researcher at the German Marshall Fund think tank.
""China largely doesn't do aid or grants, and when it has done them, they have tended to be modest.""
Pakistan has welcomed the aid with open hands. However, Beijing's unusual largesse has also fueled suspicions in the United States and India that Gwadar is part of China's future geostrategic plans to challenge U.S. naval dominance.
""It all suggests that Gwadar, for a lot of people in China, is not just a commercial proposition over the longer term,"" Small said.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
Beijing and Islamabad see Gwadar as the future jewel in the crown of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship of Beijing's Belt and Road initiative to build a new ""Silk Road"" of land and maritime trade routes across more than 60 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa.
The plan is to turn Gwadar into a trans-shipment hub and megaport to be built alongside special economic zones from which export-focused industries will ship goods worldwide. A web of energy pipelines, roads and rail links will connect Gwadar to China's western regions.
Port trade is expected to grow from 1.2 million tonnes in 2018 to about 13 million tonnes by 2022, Pakistani officials say. At the harbor, three new cranes have been installed and dredging will next year deepen the port depth to 20 meters at five berths.
But the challenges are stark. Gwadar has no access to drinking water, power blackouts are common and separatist insurgents threaten attacks against Chinese projects in Gwadar and the rest of Baluchistan, a mineral-rich province that is still Pakistan's poorest region. 
Security is tight, with Chinese and other foreign visitors driven around in convoys of soldiers and armed police.
Beijing is also trying to overcome the distrust of outsiders evident in Baluchistan, where indigenous Baloch fear an influx of other ethnic groups and foreigners. Many residents say the pace of change is too slow.
""Local people are not completely satisfied,"" said Essar Nori, a lawmaker for Gwadar, adding that the separatists were tapping into that dissatisfaction.
Pakistani officials are urging Gwadar residents to be patient, vowing to urgently build desalination plants and power stations.
CAUTIONARY TALE
China's Gwadar project contrasts with similar efforts in Sri Lanka, where the village of Hambantota was transformed into a port complex - but was saddled with Chinese debt.
Last week, Sri Lanka formally handed over operations to China on a 99-year lease in exchange for lighter debt repayments, a move that sparked street protests over what many Sri Lankans view as an erosion of sovereignty.
The Hambantota port, like Gwadar, is part of a network of harbors Beijing is developing in Asia and Africa that have spooked India, which fears being encircled by China's growing naval power.
But Pakistani officials say comparisons to Hambantota are unfair because the Gwadar project has much less debt. 
On top of the airport, Chinese handouts in Gwadar include $100 million to expand a hospital by 250 beds, $130 million towards upgrading water infrastructure, and $10 million for a technical and vocational college, according to Pakistani government documents and officials.
""We welcome this assistance as it's changing the quality of life of the people of Gwadar for the better,"" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the parliamentary committee that oversees CPEC, including Gwadar.
China and Pakistan jointly choose which projects will be developed under the CPEC mechanism, Sayed added.
When China suggested a 7,000 meter runway for the new airport, Pakistan pushed for a 12,000 meter one that could accommodate planes as large as the Airbus 380 and be used for military purposes, according to Sajjad Baloch, a director of the Gwadar Development Authority.
The scale of Chinese grants is extraordinary, according to Brad Parks, executive director of AidData, a research lab at the U.S.-based William and Mary university that collected data on Chinese aid across 140 countries from 2000-2014.
Since 2014, Beijing has pledged over $800 million in grants and concessional loans for Gwadar, which has less than 100,000 people. In the 15 years before that, China gave about $2.4 billion in concessional loans and grants during this period across the whole of Pakistan, a nation of 207 million people.
""Gwadar is exceptional even by the standards of China's past activities in Pakistan itself,"" Parks said.
HEARTS AND MINDS
There are early signs China's efforts to win hearts and minds are beginning to bear fruit in Gwadar.
""Baluchistan is backward and underdeveloped, but we are seeing development after China's arrival,"" said Salam Dashti, 45, a grocer whose two children attend the new Chinese-built primary school.
But there are major pitfalls ahead.
Tens of thousands of people living by the port will have to be relocated. 
For now, they live in cramped single-story concrete houses corroded by sea water on a narrow peninsula, where barefoot fishermen offload their catch on newly-paved roads strewn with rubbish. Many of the fishermen say they fear they'll lose their livelihoods once the port starts operating. 
Indigenous residents' fear of becoming a minority is inevitable with Gwadar's population expected to jump more than 15-fold in coming decades. On the edge of town, mansions erected by land speculators are popping up alongside the sand dunes.
Analysts say China is aware that previous efforts to develop Gwadar port failed partly due to the security threat posed by Baloch separatists, so Beijing is trying to counter the insurgents' narrative that China wants to exploit Baluchistan.
""That weighs heavily on the minds of the Chinese,"" Parks added. ""It's almost certainly true that they are trying to safeguard their investments by getting more local buy-in.""
Chinese officials, meanwhile, are promoting the infrastructure development they are funding.
""Every day you can see new changes. It shows the sincerity of Chinese for development of Gwadar,"" Fijian Zhao, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Islamabad, tweeted last month.
NAVAL FACILITY
For its investment in Gwadar, China will receive 91 percent of revenues until the port is returned to Pakistan in four decades' time. The operator, China Overseas Ports Holding Company, will also be exempt from major taxes for more than 20 years.
Pakistan's maritime affairs minister, Hasil Bizenjo, said the arrival of the Chinese in the region contrasted with the experience of the past two centuries, when Russia and Britain, and later the United States and the Soviet Union, vied for control of the warm water ports of the Persian Gulf.
""The Chinese have come very smoothly, they have reached the warm waters,"" Bizenjo told Reuters. ""What they are investing is less than a peanut for access to warm waters.""
When a U.S. Pentagon report in June suggested Gwadar could become a military base for China, a concern that India has also expressed, Beijing dismissed the idea.
""Talk that China is building a military base in Pakistan is pure guesswork,"" said a Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman, Wu Sian.
Bizenjo and other Pakistani officials say Beijing has not asked to use Gwadar for naval purposes.

""This port, they will use it mostly for their commercial interests, but it depends on the next 20 years where the world goes,"" Bizenjo said.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A mudslide on Saturday tore through a small village in southern Chile near a popular national park, leaving five people dead and at least 15 missing after a night of torrential downpours, authorities said.
A video taken from a helicopter by Chilean police showed a vast swath of the remote town of Villa Santa Lucia, near Chaiten in coastal Patagonia, buried beneath the mud as the landslide plowed its way down a flooded river valley.
Four Chileans and a male tourist whose name and nationality have not been disclosed were died in the mudslide, authorities said. 
Rescue workers were continuing to search through the debris for at least 15 people.
The mudslide also destroyed a school and several homes and roadways as well as a voting center ahead of Chile´s presidential election on Sunday.
President Michelle Bachelet declared the area a disaster zone.
""I have ordered rescue workers to put all the necessary resources toward protecting the people of Villa Santa Lucia,"" she said on social media.
More than 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) of rain fell in 24 hours, the country's Interior Ministry said, but weather conditions were expected to improve later in the day.
Villa Santa Lucia borders Chile's Corcovado National Park, a popular tourist region of volcanoes, fjords and vast forests.

The nearby Chaiten volcano erupted in 2008, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is considering a draft resolution that would insist any decisions on the status of Jerusalem have no legal effect and must be rescinded after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized the city as Israel's capital. 
The one-page Egyptian-drafted text, which was circulated to the 15-member council on Saturday and seen by Reuters, does not specifically mention the United States or Trump. Diplomats say it has broad support but will likely be vetoed by Washington.
The council could vote early next week, diplomats said. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Britain, Russia or China to pass.
Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, generating outrage from Palestinians. Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.
After the decision, Arab foreign ministers agreed to seek a U.N. Security Council resolution. While the draft is unlikely to be adopted, it would further isolate Trump over the Jerusalem issue. 
The U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment on the draft. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has praised Trump's decision as ""the just and right thing to do.""
The draft U.N. resolution ""affirms that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered, the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council.""
It calls upon all countries to refrain establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem.
Israel considers the city its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. 
“No vote or debate will change the clear reality that Jerusalem” is the capital of Israel, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said in a statement. 
Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city's eastern sector, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. 
The draft council resolution ""demands that all states comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem, and not to recognize any actions or measures contrary to those resolutions.""
A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted in December last year ""underlines that it will not recognize any changes to the 4 June 1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations.""

That resolution was approved with 14 votes in favor and an abstention by former U.S. President Barack Obama's administration.

Hilda Hernandez, 51, was a close advisor to her brother, who is embroiled in political turmoil in the wake of a Nov. 26 presidential election, which remains unresolved. She was previously the government's communications secretary.
Two reconnaissance helicopters were sent to comb the missing Eurocopter AS350 Ecureuil helicopter's planned flight path from Toncontin international airport in capital city Tegucigalpa to Comayagua, some 50 miles (80 km) northwest, but because of inclement weather conditions land teams were sent in, the Honduran armed forces said in the statement.

A government source, who asked not to be named said: ""The six people aboard the aircraft, including Hilda Hernandez have been found dead.""

Honduras has been roiled by political instability following the presidential vote, with center-left Salvador Nasralla, a TV star, trailing conservative incumbent Hernandez by 1.6 percentage points according to the official count.

""We arrive in 2018, an election year, with the candidacy of Lula consolidated in such a way that it doesn't belong to the PT; it belongs to the Brazilian people,"" read the resolution, drafted by the party's national committee after a two-day meeting in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city. 
""We must defend the candidacy against systemic attacks from coup mongers, that are going to use all means to stop the people from expressing their will in the elections.""
Lula, a former union leader who ran Brazil from 2003 to 2011, was convicted in July of accepting 3.7 million reais ($1.12 million) in bribes from an engineering firm in exchange for public works contracts. If an appeals court fails to overturn the conviction on Jan. 24, he will be barred from running for elections scheduled for October 2018.
Even after the conviction, Lula remains beloved by much of Brazil's working class for bringing millions out of poverty through generous social welfare programs. A Datafolha poll released on Dec. 2 showed Lula getting at least 34 percent of votes if a presidential election were held today, double the support for his nearest rival.
""If they dare find Lula guilty, it will prove the political nature of the entire process,"" the PT resolution read.

Failure to ditch EU law would make the United Kingdom a ""vassal state,"" Johnson said in an interview to be published on Sunday. The government must aim to ""maximize the benefits of Brexit"" by getting divergence from the bloc's rules so that it could do ""proper free trade deals"" with other countries.
Prime Minister Theresa May this week secured an agreement with the EU to move Brexit talks on to trade and a transition pact. But she must now unite her deeply divided cabinet over what trade deal Britain actually wants. [nL8N1OF03W]
Separately, in a measure of the difficulty May will face in bringing her side together, finance minister Philip Hammond caused a stir amongst some Brexit supporters because he said that after Britain formally leaves the EU in March 2019, it will seek to replicate the current status quo in a transition period. [nL4N1OG05L]
Former work and pensions minister Ian Duncan Smith criticized Hammond, as did other leading Brexit supporters, for making a statement which he said was ""not government policy"".

Johnson told the Sunday Times he would advance the case for a ""liberal Brexit"" in a new intervention in the debate this week in which he would play up the advantages of leaving the EU.

The BMG poll of 1,400 people for The Independent published on the newspaper's website on Saturday came as Britain moves into a second phase of negotiations on exiting the EU, which will focus on trade.
The Independent said the lead for ""remain"" over ""leave"" was the biggest in any poll so far since the vote in June 2016.
But the head of polling at BMG, quoted in the Independent, said that the reason for the change was a shift in opinion among those who did not vote in last year's referendum, while around nine in 10 ""leave"" and ""remain"" voters were unchanged in their views. The survey was carried out from December 5 to 8.
In the referendum last year, 52 percent of Britons voted to leave the EU and 48 percent voted to remain.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2017 04:10PM ET</span>","Winds fuel California wildfire, state's third-largest on record","By Alex Dobuzinskis
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A raging California wildfire on Saturday became the state's third-largest on record, with more devastation possible from a resurgence of the harsh winds that have fueled the deadly blaze since the beginning of the month.
The so-called Thomas Fire has destroyed more than 1,000 structures, including about 750 homes, in Southern California coastal communities since erupting on Dec. 4, the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement. The cause of the blaze is not yet known. 
Authorities described the current conditions, including returning winds and extremely low humidity, as ""critical fire weather."" Coastal Santa Barbara and more sparsely populated inland areas were of special concern, they said. 
Mandatory evacuations were in place in several Santa Barbara County communities, including Carpinteria and Montecito, and parts of Ventura County. An evacuation order for the city of Ventura, which was hit hard in the first days of the fire, was lifted on Saturday morning.
The cost of fighting the blaze has already reached $104 million, with more than 8,000 firefighters working around the clock, and helicopters and airplanes dropping retardant on the flames.
""Each fire has a unique circumstance,"" Cal Fire spokesman Gabe Lauderdale said on Saturday. ""This one has impacted a lot of communities. The sheer size of the fire is what's unique about it.""
For California, this year has been unprecedented in terms of structures lost and the size of the wildfires, Lauderdale said. Five of 20 most destructive fires in recorded history ravaged the state in 2017, according to Cal Fire. 
The vast landscape charred by the blaze, centered fewer than 100 miles (161 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, reached 259,000 acres (104,800 hectares) early on Saturday. That surpassed the 257,314 acres (104,131 hectares) that California's Rim Fire, which had been the state's third-largest on record, destroyed in 2013, authorities said. 
The Thomas Fire is only 40 percent contained, and it threatens 18,000 structures, officials said, including some in the wealthy enclave of Montecito just outside the city of Santa Barbara. The blaze is chewing up tall grass and bone-dry brush as it spreads along the scenic Pacific Coast.
The hot Santa Ana winds have propelled the fire's expansion, at times sending embers far ahead of its main flank. They were forecast to remain strong through Saturday evening in the Santa Barbara County mountains, the National Weather Service warned. Gusts of up to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) were expected.
From Saturday night through Sunday evening, the winds could lash neighboring Ventura County, the Weather Service said. 
Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson, 32, died on Thursday while battling the flames near the Ventura County community of Fillmore. Fire officials said Iverson, the blaze's first fatality, left behind a pregnant wife and 2-year-old daughter.
""Even though many of us didn't work with him personally, we lost a brother,"" Lauderdale said.
The Thomas Fire was one of several major blazes that broke out in Southern California this month, although the others have been contained.

The fires forced many schools to close for days, shut roads and drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. They were also responsible for poor air quality throughout Southern California.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian police are investigating the mysterious deaths of pharmaceuticals billionaire Barry Sherman, founder of Apotex Inc, and his wife Honey, whose bodies were found in their Toronto mansion on Friday.
Authorities were conducting post-mortem examinations on Saturday and treating the deaths as suspicious. A Toronto Police spokesman said that nothing had been ruled out in the probe.
Two Canadian newspapers reported that police were investigating the deaths as a possible murder-suicide, citing unidentified police sources. 
The bodies were found hanging from a railing on the edge of a basement swimming pool, the Globe and Mail and Toronto Sun reported, citing police sources.
The newspapers reported that investigators were working on the theory that Barry Sherman, 75, killed his wife, hung her body and then hanged himself at the pool's edge. 
The Sun reported that police had not found a suicide note and were searching the mansion for evidence. 
Toronto Police Constable David Hopkinson said police are awaiting post-mortem results and no determinations have been made as to the cause and manner of deaths. 
""There’s a whole bunch of different scenarios here. We are not ruling anything out,"" he said. He declined to say how or where the bodies were found in the home. 
An Apotex spokesman declined to comment on Saturday's newspaper reports. He said that a lawyer representing the family was unavailable for comment.
""As you can imagine, this is a pretty challenging time right now for everybody,"" Apotex spokesman Jordan Berman said.
Lawyers who have represented Sherman in recent court cases could not be reached for comment.
The deaths shocked Canada’s political, business and philanthropic elite, prompting a flood of condolences from business leaders and politicians including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
LIBERAL PARTY SUPPORTER
Barry Sherman was a prominent donor to Canada's ruling Liberal Party, drawing on a fortune that Forbes estimated at $3.2 billion. Canadian advocacy group Democracy Watch criticized him last year for involvement in a fundraiser for the Liberals while registered as a government lobbyist.
Sherman founded generic drugmaker Apotex in 1974, building it into one of the world's largest pharmaceutical makers. It has annual sales of more than C$2 billion in more than 45 countries, according to its website.
He stepped down as CEO in 2012, but stayed on as chairman.
Sherman was involved in a series of lawsuits, including a decade-long battle with cousins seeking compensation over allegations he cut them out of the company that would make him rich.
Police found out about the Shermans' deaths at about midday Friday while responding to an emergency call. 
Authorities have not said who made the call, though Canadian media reported the couple's bodies were found by a real estate agent helping them sell their home, which was on the market for C$6.9 million ($5.4 million). 
The real state agent could not be reached for comment.
The Shermans, who had four children, were major donors to hospitals, universities and Jewish organizations.
Honey Sherman sat on the boards of several hospital, charitable and Jewish foundations, and last month was awarded a Senate medal for community service. 
She immigrated to Canada as a child when Jewish Immigrant Aid Services relocated her family shortly after the Holocaust, according to a profile of the couple on the Jewish Foundation of Greater Toronto's website.

The assertion might strengthen Kuczynski's bid to survive a vote to remove him from office on Thursday in the opposition-ruled Congress over allegations he took bribes from Odebrecht, which is at the center of Latin America's biggest graft scandal.
Earlier this week, Odebrecht sent Congress a requested report detailing deposits totaling $4.8 million that it paid to two companies owned by Kuczynski or a close business associate of his for financial and advising services.
Kuczynski, who previously denied any links to the company, has resisted calls to resign over the transactions and said there was nothing improper about them.
Odebrecht denied accusations by an influential journalist with the newspaper La Republica that the disclosure was an attempt to overthrow Kuczynski in collusion with the right-wing opposition.
It was able to disclose the transactions because there was no sign they were part of any of its past criminal activities, which it can only discuss with public prosecutors, Odebrecht said.
""They were duly paid and officially accounted for,"" Odebrecht said in a letter to La Republica that it made public on Twitter on Saturday.
""Odebrecht is obligated by law to send requested information to relevant authorities,"" including an investigative committee in Congress, the company said.
Odebrecht has rocked Latin American politics with its public confession a year ago that it orchestrated sophisticated kickback schemes across a dozen countries for more than a decade - landing elites in jail from Colombia to the Dominican Republic.
Late on Friday, lawmakers passed a motion to start ""presidential vacancy"" procedures with enough votes to unseat Kuczynski in a vote it scheduled for Thursday.
The center-right president's supporters cited Odebrecht's letter to La Republica to argue that his only fault was misleading Peru about his connections to Odebrecht.
If Kuczynski is ousted by Congress, he would lose his presidential immunity from prosecution and First Vice President Martin Vizcarra would be authorized to replace him for the rest of his term ending in 2021.

Two former presidents in Peru, Ollanta Humala and Alejandro Toledo, have been ensnared in the Odebrecht probe over alleged payments they deny. Humala was jailed in July pending trial and authorities hope to extradite Toledo from the United States.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's Jacob Zuma gave his last speech as African National Congress head on Saturday, as the only party in power since the end of apartheid prepared to pick its next leader, and likely future president, in a vote that was too close to call.
The election is perhaps the most pivotal moment for the ANC in its 23 years of power. Scandal and corruption allegations have tainted Zuma's presidency and the party that launched black majority rule under Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nelson Mandela is now deeply divided, its image tarnished at home and abroad. 
The race to succeed the 75-year-old as ANC leader has been dominated by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, 65, generally favored by financial markets, and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, 68, an ex-cabinet minister, chairwoman of the African Union Commission and Zuma's ex-wife.
Zuma, who is backing Dlamini-Zuma in the race, can remain head of state until 2019.
The ANC will announce Zuma's successor on Sunday, concluding a bruising leadership battle that threatens to splinter the 105-year-old liberation movement. 
A trained lawyer and former union leader, Ramaphosa, 65, has vowed to fight corruption and revitalize an economy that has slowed to a near-standstill under Zuma with 28 percent unemployment and credit rating downgrades.
That message has played well with foreign investors and Ramaphosa is expected to be backed by ANC veterans, labor unions and civil society organizations. 
In contrast, Dlamini-Zuma is seen as a fierce campaigner against racial inequality whose hostility to big business has rattled investors. 
""She has not made corruption the only pillar of her campaign, because the most critical issue in South Africa is this huge inequality,"" said Carl Niehaus, a key member of Dlamini-Zuma's campaign. 
PIVOTAL MOMENT
Colin Coleman, managing director of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in South Africa, said the candidates' distinct positions on the economy made the choice between them a clear one.
""This is a pivotal moment. It is a choice between refreshing the ANC and putting South Africa on a course of a modern economy, or the party outlook may move deeper down a patronage path which would lead to a low-growth and high-unemployment outcome for the people of South Africa.""
In a boost to Ramaphosa, courts ruled that some senior officials from provinces seen as supporting Dlamini-Zuma had been elected illegally and were barred from the conference. The rand currency firmed more than 2 percent after that news on Friday.
The ANC's National Executive Committee, a decision-making group of senior leaders, met before the conference began and decided that barred delegates could not vote at the conference.
ANC Youth League leader Collen Maine, who backs Dlamini-Zuma, said that meant 122 delegates - out of about 6,000 - would be prevented from voting , something he called ""not significant"".
Asked if barring the delegates helped Ramaphosa, a senior official of Cosatu, South Africa's largest union federation, said: ""Definitely. But we are not banking only on that. We have trust that ANC delegates know what the country needs at the moment.""
John Ashbourne, Africa economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Early signs of a win for Cyril Ramaphosa, the more investor-friendly option, have provided support for the rand.
""But while Mr. Ramaphosa is popular among party members, the result will be decided by political insiders, who may opt for his leftist opponent, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma."" 
Zuma cracked jokes, sang and danced after reading his last speech as ANC leader. 
Zuma warned members not to run to the courts to resolve party problems. He did not specifically mention the barring of delegates at the conference by the courts this week.
""Factionalism has become the biggest threat to the organization,"" he said. 
The president also said allegations against businessmen accused of wielding undue influence over his government would be investigated. The High Court ruled on Wednesday that Zuma must set up a judicial inquiry into state influence-peddling within 30 days. 

Zuma announced plans to raise subsidies to universities to 1 percent of GDP over the next five years from nearly 0.7 percent at present, a move analysts said was timed to appeal to the more populist members of the party.

Rivals have branded former investment banker Macron ""president of the rich"" for policies such as the scrapping of a wealth tax and cutting housing benefit, moves the president framed as reforms to boost investment and social mobility.
Macron is staying with his wife Brigitte in a guest house close to the Chateau de Chambord, a former royal palace on the Loire that dates back to the 16th century.
His office denied media reports that the celebrations would take place inside the chateau and said the trip was being paid for by the couple.
Left-wing leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who ran against Macron in the presidential election this year, called the chateau stay ""ridiculous"" for its royal symbolism.
Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a right-wing politician who also ran for the presidency, said: ""Times change but the oligarchy remains detached from the people."" 
Macron's weekend retreat came as several of his ministers were shown to be millionaires.
Figures released on Friday by a body charged with ensuring financial transparency in politics showed Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud had the largest personal fortune, around 7.5 million euros ($8.8 million).
Penicaud, at the forefront of Macron's push to shake up the economy, has been criticized for a gain made on stock options when she was an executive at food giant Danone.
Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot declared personal wealth of over 7 million euros and revealed he owned six cars. The former TV presenter and campaigner has called for France to stop selling petrol and diesel cars by 2040.
Career politicians in the government had smaller fortunes, with Prime Minister Edouard Philippe's declaration showing 1.7 million euros and Public Finances Minister Gerard Darmanin just 48,000 euros.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2017 09:57AM ET</span>",Myanmar journalists' group to don black T-shirts over arrest of Reuters' reporters,"YANGON (Reuters) - A group of Myanmar journalists said they would begin wearing black T-shirts on Saturday in protest at the detention of two Reuters reporters accused of violating the country's Official Secrets Act, as pressure builds on Myanmar to release the pair.
The Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists, a group of local reporters who have demonstrated against past prosecutions of journalists, decried the ""unfair arrests that affect media freedom"".
In a statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the committee said its members would don black T-shirts ""to signify the dark age of media freedom"" in Myanmar. They demanded the unconditional and immediate release of the two reporters, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27.
""Journalists all over the country are urged to take part in the Black Campaign,"" the group said. It said it also planned to stage official protests and prayers.
The group has staged several protests on behalf of arrested reporters from other media this year, including one in June in which around 100 journalists took part. It was not immediately clear how many journalists have joined the black T-shirt protest.
The Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists was formed in response to the arrest in June of a newspaper editor over the publication of a cartoon that made fun of the military, said video journalist A Hla Lay Thu Zar - one of the group's 21-member executive committee.
""A reporter must have the right to get information and write news ethically,"" said A Hla Lay Thu Zar in reference to the case of the two Reuters' journalists.
Myo Nyunt, deputy director for Myanmar's Ministry of Information, told Reuters the case had nothing to do with press freedom.
""It's related to the Official Secrets Act,"" he said. ""Journalists should be able to tell what is secret and what is not... We already have press freedom. There's freedom to write and speak... There's press freedom if you follow the rules.""
Asked about the local reporters' ""black campaign"", he said: ""Everyone can express his feelings."" 
PRESSURE FROM ACROSS THE WORLD
The journalists were arrested on Tuesday evening after they were invited to dine with police officers on the outskirts of Myanmar's largest city, Yangon.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani, and government officials from Canada, Britain, Sweden, and Bangladesh, have all called for their release.
The two reporters had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis that has seen an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims flee from a fierce military crackdown on militants in western Rakhine state.
The Ministry of Information said the journalists had ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"", and released a photo of the pair in handcuffs. It said they were being investigated under the 1923 Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
Human rights advocates say press freedom is under attack in Myanmar, where the young civilian-led government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi shares power with the military that ran the country for decades. At least 11 journalists have been detained in 2017, although some have since been released.
Police told Wa Lone's wife on Thursday that the reporters were taken from Htaunt Kyant police station in north Yangon by an investigation team to an undisclosed location shortly after their arrest.
They added the reporters would be brought back to the station in ""two to three days at most"". It is now four days since they were detained.
Separately, police lieutenant colonel Myint Htwe of the Yangon Police Division told Reuters on Thursday the reporters’ location would not be disclosed until the investigation was complete. 

Since then, the authorities have not provided any further information on their whereabouts.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2017 09:38AM ET</span>",Palestinian billionaire Masri detained in Saudi Arabia: sources,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
AMMAN (Reuters) - Sabih al-Masri, Jordan's most influential businessman and the chairman of its largest lender Arab Bank, was detained in Saudi Arabia for questioning after a business trip to Riyadh, family sources and friends said on Saturday.
Masri's arrest, which follows the biggest purge of the Saudi kingdom's affluent elite in its modern history, has sent shockwaves through business circles in Jordan and the Palestinian territories, where the billionaire has major investments. 
A Saudi citizen of Palestinian origin, Masri was detained last Tuesday hours before he was planning to leave after he chaired meetings of companies he owns, according to the sources. 
He is the founder of Saudi Astra Group, which has wide interests in diversified industries ranging from agro-industry to telecommunications, construction and mining across the region. 
""Masri was heading to the airport and they told him to stay where you are and they picked him up,"" said a source familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.
He canceled a dinner in Amman on Wednesday that he had invited board members of Arab Bank and business associates to attend on his return. 
Masri could not be reached for comment. The Saudi authorities did not respond to requests for comment.
Confidants said Masri had been warned not to travel to the Saudi capital after mass arrests of Saudi royals, ministers and businessmen in early November.
""He has been answering questions about his business and partners,"" said a source familiar with the matter who did not elaborate nor confirm he was held. 
POLITICAL MOTIVE
Reasons for Masri's detention were not clear but political sources said the Saudis might have used him to put pressure on Jordan's King Abdullah not to attend a Muslim summit last week to discuss U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
The Jordanian monarch attended the Istanbul summit, however. He is a custodian of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem and has been vocal in criticizing Trump over his decision on Jerusalem.
Saudi Arabia, whose relations with the United States have warmed with Trump taking a harder line against its arch-rival Iran than his predecessor, appears to have taken a softer line on the decision on Jerusalem, according to analysts. Riyadh sent a junior minister to the Istanbul meeting. 
Masri, who comes from a prominent merchant family from Nablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, amassed a fortune from partnering with influential Saudis in a major catering business to supply troops during the U.S.-led military operation to retake Kuwait from Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.
Reports of his detention surfaced on Thursday in the local media in Jordan where Masri's multi-billion dollar investments in hotels and banking are a cornerstone of the economy.
He was elected chairman of Arab Bank in 2012 after the resignation of Abdel Hamid Shoman whose family had founded the bank in Jerusalem in 1930.
The bank, which has earned a reputation of resilience in the face of political upheaval, played a prominent role in supporting former Palestinian leader, the late Yasser Arafat during past Middle East turmoil. 
Arab Bank, which operates in 30 countries and five continents, has an extensive network in Palestinian territories where it is the largest bank. It also owns 40 percent of Saudi Arabia's Arab National Bank ANB.
Masri led consortium of Arab and Jordanian investors who bought a 20 percent stake in Arab Bank Group from Lebanon's Hariri family business empire for $1.12 billion last February.
He was also instrumental in agreeing in 2015 to settle litigation brought by hundreds of Americans who accused Arab Bank of providing financial services in the West Bank that facilitated militant attacks in Israel.
They had sued Arab Bank under the U.S Anti-Terrorism Act, which permits U.S. citizens to pursue claims arising from international terrorism.
Masri is also the leading investor in the Palestinian territories with a large stake in Paltel, a public shareholding company, which is the largest private sector firm in the West Bank. 
Masri's family ranks among the wealthiest in the Palestinian territories, with majority holdings in real estate, hotels and telecommunications firms set up after a self-rule agreement with Israel in 1993.

Born in 1921, Michael ruled Romania twice, switched its alliance away from Nazi Germany to the Allied side during the war and was subsequently forced into exile by a Communist takeover in 1947.
He died in Switzerland on Dec. 5 at the age of 96, having retired from public life due to severe illness in 2016.
On Saturday, Bucharest churches rang their bells and mourners, many in tears, threw white flowers at the funeral procession, chanting ""King Michael"" and ""Down with communism"".
European royalty attended, including Spain's former king, Juan Carlos, Britain’s Prince Charles, King Carl Gustaf of Sweden and his wife Queen Silvia.
Even though the restoration of the monarchy is not an issue in the European Union state, Michael commanded great respect from Romanians who saw him in sharp opposition to a political class which they link with poverty and corruption.   
His death comes at a time of deep divisions in Romanian society. Massive street protests against attempts by the ruling Social Democrats to weaken the fight against corruption and the rule of law have taken place on and off throughout 2017.
Earlier this month, the Social Democrats used their solid majority to approve a judicial overhaul in the lower house that threatens to put the justice system under political control. On Monday, lawmakers begin debating changes to the criminal code that critics say will derail law and order.
A descendant of the German Hohenzollern dynasty and a cousin of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, Michael was in his early twenties when he participated in a 1944 coup that overthrew fascist leader Marshal Ion Antonescu. 
Romania then broke with Nazi Germany and switched to the Allied side. Historians have said his actions might have shortened the war and saved thousands of lives.
After communism collapsed, politicians fearing Michael's influence blocked his first few attempted visits after decades of exile in Switzerland, Britain and the United States. He finally returned to Romania in 1992 and regained citizenship in 1997.

With his passing, the Romanian royal family’s relevance will likely fade, since his children have little public standing. Princess Margareta, his eldest daughter, remains custodian of the crown.

Libya's western shores are the main departure point for migrants mainly from sub-Saharan countries fleeing poverty and conflict trying to reach Europe.
Arrivals to Italy have fallen by two-thirds since July from the same period last year after officials working for the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, Italy's partner, managed to cut back human smuggling in the city of Sabratha west of the capital.
That has pushed the trade further east, with the coast guard intercepting several boats off the coast near Qaraboulli and Zliten, two towns located east of Tripoli.
""The naval forces' Ibn Ouf vessel rescued (on Friday) illegal migrants including women, children and men ... they are from different sub-Saharan and Arab countries,"" Coast Guard Captain Abdulhadi Fakhal told Reuters.
""They were rescued off Qaraboulli and Zliten towns ... and they are about 250 to 270 persons,"" Fakhal said.

Libya has plunged into chaos since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising. A U.N.-backed Government of National Accord in Tripoli has been trying to gain control of territory.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's conservative coalition government regained its razor-thin parliamentary majority on Saturday after inner Sydney voters re-elected a former professional tennis player in a special poll triggered by a constitutional crisis.
The Liberal Party victory in the blue-ribbon Sydney seat of Bennelong is a much-needed relief for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, whose leadership has been increasingly unpopular with the public over the past two years.
A loss in Bennelong would have plunged his government into a parliamentary minority, forcing it to rely on independent lawmakers to complete its agenda. A loss would also have placed Turnbull's personal position in danger.
With around 73 percent of the two-party preferred vote counted by late Saturday, the opposition Labor Party candidate Kristina Keneally has secured a swing of about 5.6 percent against the Liberal Party's John Alexander, according to the Australian Electoral Commission.
While a sizeable swing, that was well short of the 10 percent plus needed to install Keneally, a high-profile former premier of New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, in federal politics, and the Labor Party conceded defeat.
The battle for Bennelong was bitterly fought. Turnbull campaigned personally for Alexander in the electorate both in the run-up to the vote and on the day of the poll.
""Thank you Bennelong, the people of Bennelong have put their faith in this man,"" Turnbull told cheering supporters as he raised Alexander's arm in a victory celebration. ""Liberals have come from across the state, across the nation.""
But Keneally, who ran a robust campaign urging voters to use the by-election to punish the federal government, warned Turnbull that he should be concerned about the swing to Labor.
""The verdict is in, the message is clear, we have had enough of your lousy leadership,"" she said in her concession speech. 
""Malcolm Turnbull injected himself in this campaign, he owns this result.""
Turnbull's coalition has been forced to govern in minority since October, when a citizenship crisis cost him several cabinet members and wiped out his flimsy majority. Among those forced out was Turnbull's deputy, Barnaby Joyce, who has since won back his seat.
Turnbull, who has lagged in opinion polls all year, and his minority government were forced to accept a widespread banking inquiry after independent members in parliament flexed their new-found power.
The race tightened in recent days amid a diplomatic spat between Australia and China, sparked when Turnbull accused Beijing of improper interference in Canberra. One in five Bennelong voters has Chinese heritage, raising fears of a backlash.
Alexander was forced to re-contest his seat after becoming one of 10 lawmakers, alongside Joyce, to leave parliament in recent months as they were swept up in the citizenship crisis.
Alexander left parliament because he believed he might hold dual British citizenship, which he has since rescinded. Australia's constitution bars foreign nationals from sitting in parliament to prevent split allegiances.

The arrest came as photographs of Naranon Narakamin 44 circulated on social media earlier in the week, including one that showed her standing behind a tourist with one of her foot placed on a pagoda at Bangkok's iconic Temple of Dawn.
It is unclear when the photograph of Naranon was taken but it has outraged many conservatives who say her behavior was disrespectful to Buddhism.
Tourist Police Deputy commissioner Police Major General Surachet Hakpal told a press conference on Saturday that the tour guide has exhibited ""inappropriate behavior at a Buddhist temple,"" and set a bad example for Thais and foreign tourists. 
Naranon, who has publicly apologized for her action, will be charged with breaching the national archaeological site act and could face up to one month jail term and a fine of up to 10,000 baht ($307.50), the police said.
In Thailand, using feet to point at people or objects, particularly sacred objects is considered very rude. Revealing clothing and inappropriate action at places of worship is also considered offensive in the predominantly Buddhist country.
Last month two American tourists were arrested and fined for public indecency after posing for a ""butt selfie"" at a temple in Bangkok.

LIMA (Reuters) - President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's chances of surviving the political crisis gripping Peru faded on Friday after Congress passed a motion to start ""presidential vacancy"" procedures with enough votes to unseat him within a week.
The opposition-controlled Congress voted 93-17 on Friday to seek his removal from office over graft allegations, which he denies. Eighty-seven votes will be needed to oust him in a session scheduled for Dec. 21, when he will be asked to defend himself.
A Brazilian construction company at the center of Latin America's biggest graft scandal disclosed this week payments totaling $4.8 million to companies owned by Kuczynski or a close friend, triggering calls for him to resign.
Kuczynski had previously denied any links to the Brazilian company, Odebrecht, and said on Thursday there was nothing improper about the payments. Flanked by his Cabinet, Kuczynski vowed not to resign in a defiant message to the nation.
However, Kuczynski was aware his chances of surviving the scandal were slim, said a government source who asked not be identified. By resisting calls to step down, he hopes to clear his name and defend due process as the Odebrecht graft investigation widens, the source said.
""This is a national disgrace,"" said opposition lawmaker Lourdes Alcorta. ""The less harmful option for Peru would be his resignation. He's forcing us to impeach him.""
Odebrecht has rocked politics in Latin America since agreeing a year ago to provide details on bribery schemes across the region - landing elites in jail from Colombia to the Dominican Republic and nearly toppling a president in Brazil.
Two former presidents in Peru, Ollanta Humala and Alejandro Toledo, have been ensnared in the Odebrecht probe over alleged payments they deny. Humala was jailed pending trial in July and authorities are seeking Toledo's extradition from the United States.
Opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, whom Kuczynski unexpectedly defeated in last year's presidential election, is also under investigation and denies wrongdoing.
If Kuczynski is forced out, he would be replaced by First Vice President Martin Vizcarra, a former governor of a copper-rich mining region and Peru's current ambassador to Canada.
Kuczynski was once lauded by many as a brilliant technocrat who would help uproot widespread corruption in Peru. But his 16 months in office have been marked by clashes with the right-wing opposition party that controls Congress.
Kuczynski said late on Thursday he was the owner, but not the manager, of a company paid by Odebrecht while he held senior government posts. He also acknowledged providing financial services for an Odebrecht project as a consultant for a friend's firm when he did not hold public office.

The opposition slammed the explanation as too little, too late. ""It's really unfortunate that President Kuczynski has put the country in this situation,"" said congresswoman Cecilia Chacon.

Expectations have been low for the talks being held in the Dominican Republic. Some critics have described them as a stalling tactic by the ruling Socialist Party which is struggling to control a worsening economic crisis.
""We will meet again on January 11 for a meeting with the Venezuelan opposition,"" said Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez, leader of the government delegation, in a brief statement released by state television.
Opposition leaders are demanding that President Nicolas Maduro accept humanitarian assistance from abroad to ease the crisis, which has left millions of people unable to eat properly due to triple-digit inflation and chronic product shortages. 
They also want the release of several hundred jailed opposition activists.
Government leaders want the opposition to help seek the elimination of sanctions by Washington, which have been levied this year by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump on accusations that Maduro is undermining democracy.
An initial round of talks two weeks ago in the Dominican Republic also ended without a agreement.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The front-runner in Mexico's 2018 election has embraced a small, socially conservative party in his bid for the presidency, sparking criticism among progressives that could splinter his support in what is expected to be a tight race.
Earlier this week, two-time presidential runner-up Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador entered into a coalition with the Social Encounter Party (PES), a tiny party with religious roots that pushes an anti-gay and anti-abortion agenda.
The coalition is led by Lopez Obrador's left-of-center MORENA party and also includes the socialist-leaning Labor Party.
Lopez Obrador, who is leading in most polls, has been Mexico's best-known leftist since he served as mayor of the capital a decade ago. In previous elections he favored tie-ups with left-wing parties.
Some political analysts said a coalition with social conservatives could provide Lopez Obrador with the margin he needs to prevail in a crowded field of candidates, including first-time independents. But cracks in his progressive base are emerging.
""It looks like our rights will have to keep waiting,"" said Lol Kin Castaneda, a leading gay rights activist who helped push Mexico City's approval of marriage equality in 2010.
Mexico's Supreme Court ruled that gay marriage is lawful. Still, fewer than half of the country's 32 states have laws on the books that permit civil marriage for gays and lesbians, and individual same-sex couples in most states must fight to be recognized, often at great cost.
""It's an error for MORENA to join forces with PES... In this alliance, PES wins,"" Andres Lajous, a left-leaning writer and television pundit, posted on Twitter.
Leo Zuckermann, a socially liberal commentator, suggested that Lopez Obrador, popularly known by his initials AMLO, is revealing his true colors by aligning himself with the PES.
""People of the left, it's time to recognize that AMLO is a conservative on these issues,"" he wrote in newspaper Excelsior.
Lopez Obrador, like many Latin American leftists, has traditionally focused on fighting poverty and graft, not divisive social issues like gay rights or a woman's right to an abortion.
In the past, he has said such issues are not ""so important"" compared to the fight against corruption.
He has also proposed putting same-sex marriage and abortion to a popular vote, which rankles activists like Castaneda. Asked if she might still support Lopez Obrador, Castaneda was quick to answer.

""Right now, I haven't made a decision.""

The priest was arrested on Friday after a member of the Bajrang Dal, a powerful Hindu group associated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party, accused 50 members of a seminary of distributing the Bible, photos of Jesus Christ and singing carols in a village in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.
""Our members have registered a criminal case because we have proof to show how Christian priests were forcibly converting poor Hindus,"" said Abhay Kumar Dhar, a senior member of the Bajrang Dal in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh. 
The Bajrang Dal has direct links with Modi's ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Madhya Pradesh, governed by the BJP, has strict religious conversion laws. People must give formal notice to local administrators in order to change religion.
""We have arrested the priest but have not booked him under the anti-conversion law because the probe into the allegations is still on,"" said Rajesh Hingankar, the investigating official in Satna district, where the incident occurred.
The Catholic Bishops' Conference of India said they were ""shocked, and pained at the unprovoked violence against Catholic priests and seminarians"".
""We were only singing carols, but the hardline Hindus attacked us and said we were on a mission to make India a Christian nation ... that's not true,"" said Anish Emmanuel, a member of the St. Ephrem’s Theological College in Satna.
Two senior police officials in Bhopal said they had detained six members of the Bajrang Dal who had allegedly torched a car owned by a Christian priest in Satna, 480 km (300 miles) northeast of Bhopal.
Religious conversion is a sensitive issue in India, with Hindu groups often accusing Christian missionaries of using cash, kind and marriage to lure poor villagers to convert to their faith.
Modi's government has been criticized for failing to do enough to stop attacks on minority Christians and Muslims by hardline Hindu groups.
The government rejects the allegation and denies any bias against Christians or Muslims.

Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court rejected an attempt by the PNG government to stop the asylum-seekers seeking compensation on Friday, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
The government had tried to argue that the time frame for such attempts to sue for compensation had passed but the court rejected its application.
""The finding opens the way to a major compensation and also for consequential orders against both the PNG and Australian governments,"" Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul told Australian Associated Press.
The decision comes two months after the PNG government closed the detention center on remote Manus Island, which had housed about 400 male asylum-seekers.
Conditions in the camp, and another on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, have been widely criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups.
The two camps have been cornerstones of Australia's contentious immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum-seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores.
The policy, aimed at deterring people from making a perilous sea voyage to Australia, has bipartisan political support.
The closure of the Manus island camp, criticized by the United Nations as ""shocking"", caused chaos, with the men refusing to leave the compound for fear of being attacked by Manus island residents.
Staff left the closed compound and the men were left without food, water, power or medical support before they were expelled and moved to a transit camp.
Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court declared in 2016 that the detention of asylum-seekers on behalf of the Australian government was illegal and that it breached asylum-seekers' fundamental human rights.
The asylum-seekers will now go back to court in February to seek orders from Australia and Papua New Guinea for them to be settled in a safe third country.
The United States announced on Friday that it had agreed to accept about 200 more refugees from Manus island and Nauru under a deal struck between Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and former U.S. President Barack Obama.

Another 50 refugees had already been accepted as part of the deal, under which Australia agreed to accept refugees from Central America. U.S President Donald Trump has called the deal ""dumb"".

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian police said they were investigating the mysterious deaths of Barry Sherman, founder of Canadian pharmaceutical firm Apotex Inc, and his wife, Honey, one of the nation's wealthiest couples whose bodies were found in their mansion on Friday.
Police said they learned of the deaths after responding to a midday (1700 GMT) medical call at the Sherman's home in an affluent section of northeast Toronto. Two bodies covered in blankets were removed from the home and loaded into an unmarked van on Friday evening.
""The circumstances of their death appear suspicious and we are treating it that way,"" said Constable David Hopkinson. Homicide detectives later told reporters gathered outside the home that there were no signs of forced entry.
Their neighbors, business associates and some of Canada's most powerful politicians said they were saddened by the deaths. 
""Our condolences to their family & friends, and to everyone touched by their vision & spirit,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrote on Twitter.
Toronto Mayor John Tory said in statement he was ""shocked and heartbroken"" to learn of the deaths, noting that the couple had made extensive contributions to the city.
""Toronto Police are investigating, and I hope that investigation will be able to provide answers for all of us who are mourning this tremendous loss,"" Tory said.
The Shermans recently listed their home for sale for nearly C$7 million ($5.4 million). A real estate agent discovered the bodies in the basement while preparing for an open house, the Toronto Globe and Mail reported, citing a relative.
Sherman, 75, founded privately held Apotex in 1974, growing it by introducing large numbers of low-cost generic drugs that took market share from branded pharmaceuticals. He stepped down as chief executive in 2012 but remained executive chairman. 
Forbes has estimated Sherman's fortune at $3.2 billion.
Apotex is the world's No. 7 generic drugmaker with 11,000 employees and annual sales of more than C$2 billion in more than 45 countries, according to its website.
The couple was known for their philanthropy, giving tens of millions of dollars to hospitals, universities and Jewish organizations, CBC reported.
""They were extremely successful in business, but also very, very giving people,"" former Ontario Premier Bob Rae told CBC. ""It's going to be a very, very big loss.""

WASHINGTON/YANGON (Reuters) - The United States has identified one person it might impose sanctions on over the brutal crackdown in Myanmar against minority Rohingya Muslims and is examining others, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday.
Tillerson, who last month declared the violence against the Rohingya to be ""ethnic cleansing,"" has said Washington was considering ""targeted sanctions"" against those deemed responsible.
More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to southern Bangladesh since the end of August.
""We are continuing to examine the circumstances around all of the events since the August attacks that have led to the enormous migration of people out of Myanmar, and have already identified one individual and we are examining other possible individuals to hold responsible for targeted sanctions from the U.S.,"" Tillerson told reporters at the United Nations.
U.S. officials told Reuters that President Donald Trump's administration was considering only limited action at this stage. They said it was preparing narrow, targeted U.S. sanctions against Myanmar's military and could roll out the punitive measures by year-end.
The sanctions will be aimed at increasing pressure on Myanmar authorities, but are not expected to hit the highest levels of the military leadership and will stop short of reimposing broad economic restrictions suspended under former President Barack Obama, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The limited nature of any new sanctions is expected to be seen as little more than a warning for Myanmar and are not likely to satisfy international human rights groups and some U.S. lawmakers who have accused Myanmar's armed forces of crimes against humanity.
Other world powers and the United Nations called Myanmar's campaign against the Rohingya population ""ethnic cleansing"" well before the United States did so in late November.
U.S. OPTIONS MULLED
U.S. officials in Washington and Yangon have been looking in particular at ways to use the Global Magnitsky Act, a law originally designed to target Russian human rights violators, but which has recently been expanded to allow sanctions for abuses anywhere in the world, the sources said. 
That can take the form of U.S. asset freezes as well as bans on travel to the United States.
A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said the administration was in the final stages of preparing this year's Global Magnitsky report and had taken ""an expansive view of implementation"" of the act in the past year, but could not say when it might be delivered.
Myanmar's powerful army chief, General Min Aung Hlaing, is expected to be spared from the latest sanctions, according to three U.S. officials and a congressional aide familiar with the matter.
In November, Myanmar's military said it had replaced Major General Maung Maung Soe, the general in charge in Rakhine state, but gave no reason for his transfer from a post as the head of the country's Western Command.
It was not immediately clear how far down the chain of command the U.S. measures would reach and who might be named.
Two of the U.S. officials said the Trump administration is considering only limited action at this stage to avoid upsetting the delicate political balance in Myanmar, where the civilian-led government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi must still contend with an influential military.
Washington also wants to hold tougher options in reserve to escalate the U.S. response if needed, the officials said.
Although the sanctions plan was still being finalized, the U.S. officials said the aim was to roll it out before the end of December, possibly before Christmas, though one person close to the matter said an announcement could be delayed until early next year.
""We have nothing to announce on sanctions,"" a White House National Security Council spokesman said when asked the coming measures. He declined comment on who might be named.
Preparations for Myanmar sanctions come at the same time that Washington has expressed concern over the detention this week of two Reuters journalists.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had worked on stories about the military crackdown on the Rohingya population in Rakhine state.
Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh say their exodus from the mainly Buddhist country was triggered by a military offensive in response to attacks by Rohingya militant on security forces.

Washington has sought to balance its wish to nurture the civilian government in Myanmar, where it competes for influence with China, with its desire to hold the military accountable for the abuses.

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 05:50PM ET</span>",Argentine Congress to make fresh attempt at pension debate on Monday,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's lower house of Congress will try on Monday to debate the government's pension bill, lawmakers said on Friday, after the first attempt at discussing it this week ended with violent protests that forced the legislature to suspend session.
The bill, key to President Mauricio Macri's effort to lower business costs and reduce Argentina's fiscal deficit, has already passed the Senate, leaving the lower house to give final legislative approval.
But Thursday's debate was suspended after it sparked riots in the capital that were put down by police firing rubber bullets and tear gas. Opposition protesters, politicians and unions say the legislation will hurt pensioners.
For Monday's debate, the bill will be amended to provide a bonus to the country's most needy retirees, the government said. The move may increase its chances of passage. 
The amendment ""will make a strong effort"" to compensate those most in need, Macri-allied house member Mario Negri told reporters. The agreement to include the bonus came after a long meeting on Friday among lawmakers, provincial governors and Macri administration officials. 
Macri is aiming to cut the fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product next year from 4.2 percent this year, and to reduce inflation to between 8 and 12 percent from above 20 percent this year.
The pension bill would change the formula used to calculate benefits. Payments would adjust every quarter based on inflation, rather than the current system of twice-yearly adjustments linked to wage rises and tax revenue.
Economists say the current formula means benefits go up in line with past inflation. Left unchanged, that could harm Macri's efforts to cut the fiscal deficit.
Under the new formula, benefits would increase by 5 percentage points above inflation, according to Cabinet Chief Marcos Pena. The plan would take effect at a time of lower inflation expectations, hence slowing the pace of pension benefit increases.

Gordillo, 72, was unexpectedly arrested in 2013 in the first year of President Enrique Pena Nieto's government, in what appeared to show the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) taking a stand against corruption.
But the attorney general (PGR) this week stopped fighting Gordillo's lawyer's attempts to get her out of prison, and a tribunal approved, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The judicial source said that in a matter of hours or days she would be allowed to go home.

The decision to let Gordillo see out her trial under house arrest came as the political party she founded, the New Political Alliance Party (Panal), said it would back the PRI in the 2018 election.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will underscore the U.S. partnership with Israel during a trip to the Middle East next week while seeking to shore up U.S. relations with the Arab world after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Pence, a strong supporter of Trump's decision, will spend three days in the region with stops in Israel and Egypt, the first high-level official to visit after the president reversed decades of U.S. policy and announced the United States would start the process of moving its embassy from Tel Aviv.
The status of Jerusalem, which holds Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites, is one of the thorniest obstacles to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who were furious over Trump's move and have declined to meet with Pence. The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the full city.
Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal capital, while Palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city’s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.
Pence, an evangelical Christian who had planned to highlight the plight of Christian minorities during his trip, will not meet with Palestinian Christians or with officials from the Coptic Christian church, who declined a meeting in response to the U.S. move. 
Officials said Pence still would discuss the persecution of Christians as well as the Jerusalem decision, countering Iran, defeating Islamic State militants and fighting ""extremist ideology.""
The dates of his trip have been in flux because of Trump's U.S. tax overhaul push and the possibility that Pence would be needed to provide a tie-breaking vote in the Senate. 
He is now scheduled to depart Washington on Tuesday, arriving in Cairo on Wednesday for a meeting with Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. 
He flies to Israel later on Wednesday and will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin, deliver a speech to the Israeli parliament, and visit Jerusalem's Western Wall.
""We can’t envision a scenario under which the Western Wall would not be part of Israel,"" one administration official told reporters on a conference call.
The trip will be dominated by the continuing fallout from Trump's announcement. 
""The last couple weeks in the region have been a reaction to the Jerusalem decision,"" another administration official said. ""This trip is part of ... the ending of that chapter, and the beginning of what I will say is the next chapter.""
That view may not be shared by Arab leaders. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the United States abdicated its responsibility as a mediator on peace and Pence's planned visit to Bethlehem was scrapped.
Pence does not plan to encourage Egypt to pressure the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table, an official said.
""We think it's appropriate for the Palestinians to digest what has happened. And once they review the president's remarks clearly, they will realize that nothing has changed in terms of being able to reach an historic peace agreement,"" he said.
Arab legislators have announced they will stay away from Pence's speech to the Knesset. 
In Egypt, the Sisi government will have a chance to discuss the recent U.S. decision to suspend some of Egypt's military aid package because of Washington's concerns over civil liberties.
Egypt is a strategic U.S. partner because of its control of the Suez Canal and Sisi presents himself as a bulwark against Islamist militants in the region.

On Friday Pence departs Israel for Germany, where he will visit U.S. troops on his way back to Washington.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 04:39PM ET</span>",Peru president fights for political life as impeachment looms,"By Marco Aquino and Mitra Taj
LIMA (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Peru's opposition-ruled Congress filed a motion on Friday to impeach center-right President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski on grounds he was morally unfit to lead after he resisted calls to resign over alleged corruption.
Kuczynski vowed to fight for his political life in a defiant speech just before midnight on Thursday and denied anything improper about payments that a company he owns received a decade ago from scandal-plagued Brazilian builder Odebrecht.
But a government source said Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, and his Cabinet were aware that his chances of holding onto power were slim.
By refusing to resign, Kuczynski hopes he can clear his name of the graft allegations and defend due process, said a source who asked not to be named. Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio told Kuczynski he is planning to resign, the source and a second government source said.
""The less harmful option for Peru would be his resignation. He's forcing us to impeach him,"" said opposition lawmaker Lourdes Alcorta.
Odebrecht has rocked Latin American politics with its public confession in a leniency deal a year ago that it orchestrated sophisticated kickback schemes across a dozen countries for more than a decade - landing elites in jail from Colombia to the Dominican Republic and nearly toppling a president in Brazil.
Now banned from new bids in Peru, the company once won lucrative contracts and built ambitious projects across the South American country, from a highway that stretched from the Pacific Ocean to the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to a 12-mile-long irrigation tunnel it drilled through the Andes.
Two former presidents in Peru, Ollanta Humala and Alejandro Toledo, have been ensnared in the Odebrecht probe over allegations they deny. Humala was jailed pending trial in July and authorities are now seeking Toledo's extradition from the United States.
Opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, whom Kuczynski unexpectedly defeated in last year's presidential election, is also under investigation and denies wrongdoing.
LEADER SAYS VICTIM OF AUTHORITARIAN REVIVAL 
Kuczynski, who would be the first sitting president toppled in the Odebrecht scandal, was once lauded by many as a brilliant technocrat who would clean up widespread corruption in Peru. But his 16-months in office have been marked by clashes with the opposition and slowing economic growth.
Peru's central bank chief Julio Velarde said he did not think the crisis would have major impacts on Peru's growth or investments, and suggested he felt let down by Kuczynski.
""I used to have a very good image of him, but I'll leave it at that,"" Velarde told journalists when asked on Friday if Kuczynski had disappointed him.
Opposition lawmakers control enough seats to remove Kuczynski from office with 87 out of 130 votes required in the single-chamber Congress. Luis Galarreta, the president of Congress, said that could happen as soon as Thursday of next week.
As recently as last month, Kuczynski, a former prime minister and finance minister in Toledo's government, denied taking money from Odebrecht or having any professional links to the company.
But this week Odebrecht sent Congress a requested report in which it detailed deposits totaling about $800,000 to Westfield Capital Ltd, Kuczynski's company, and about $4 million to First Capital Inversiones y Asesorias, a firm controlled by a close friend of Kuczynski.
Kuczynski said on Thursday that he did not manage Westfield when it received the deposits because he was in public office. He acknowledged providing financial services for an Odebrecht project as a consultant for First Capital.
If Kuczynski is ousted, the constitution requires him to be replaced by First Vice President Martin Vizcarra, a former governor of a copper-rich mining region and Peru's current ambassador to Canada.
The first government source said Vizcarra would likely make Cabinet changes to assuage the main opposition party, Popular Force, made up of the rightwing followers of jailed former authoritarian President Alberto Fujimori and his family. 
Kuczynski has sought to portray himself as a victim of what many in Peru view as Popular Force's bid to sabotage institutions in the country's relatively recent return to democracy. In recent weeks, Popular Force has proposed legislation to oust the attorney general and justices in the country's top court.

""That strategy includes toppling the president of the Republic,"" said ruling party lawmaker Gino Costa. ""We demand his right to defend himself is respected.""

Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, hijacked a truck on Dec. 19, killed the driver and then plowed it into a crowded Berlin Christmas market, killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others.
About 2,600 Christmas markets reopened in late November with added security staff on patrol and concrete barriers to protect shoppers. 
Merkel this week paid a surprise visit to the site of the attack, where a permanent memorial for victims will be unveiled on Tuesday. She will meet on Monday with relatives of victims, many of whom say they felt neglected by the government after the attack. 
In an open letter to Merkel published in Der Spiegel magazine this month, victims and survivors complained that the chancellor had not met with them personally.
Kurt Beck, a Social Democratic politician who is representing victims and survivors, told reporters Merkel's handling of the tragedy stood in contrast with how the French government had responded to terrorist attacks in Paris.
He also blasted what he called an ""unbelievable"" case in which the family of one victim was sent a bill for an autopsy and then hounded by bill collectors.
""There are incidents which must not be repeated,"" Beck said, urging the government to increase hardship compensation for the victims' relatives and the survivors.
German officials say they have tightened security and increased information sharing among security forces after investigations exposed a range of failures in the Amri case.
But experts say much work remains to be done. 

""Cooperation between intelligence agencies and between police authorities must be improved,"" said Malte Roschniski, a Berlin security expert.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 04:03PM ET</span>",Tillerson urges long halt to North Korea weapons tests before any talks,"By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday urged North Korea to carry out a ""sustained cessation"" of weapons testing to allow the two countries to hold talks about Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
""North Korea must earn its way back to the table. The pressure campaign must and will continue until denuclearization is achieved,"" Tillerson told a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on North Korea's weapons programs. He did not specify how long the lull should last.
He told reporters after the meeting that the United States would not accept any preconditions for talks with North Korea.
Tillerson had raised hopes this week that the United States and North Korea could negotiate to resolve their standoff when he said that the United States was “ready to talk any time North Korea would like to talk.""
But the White House distanced itself from those remarks by Tillerson and said that now is not the time for negotiations.
North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations on Friday made no mention of Tillerson's call for a halt to testing when he addressed the same U.N. meeting.
Ambassador Ja Song Nam said his country would not pose a threat to any state, as long as its interests were not infringed upon.
He described the Security Council session as ""a desperate measure plotted by the U.S. being terrified by the incredible might of our Republic that has successfully achieved the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.""
LITTLE INTEREST
North Korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations with the United States until it has developed the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, something most experts say it has yet to prove. 
North Korea conducted missile tests at a steady pace since April, then paused in September after firing a rocket that passed over Japan's Hokkaido island.
But it renewed tests in November when it fired a new type of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), the Hwasong-15, which flew higher and further than previous tests. 
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono told the Security Council that North Korea was ""nowhere near ready"" to abandon its nuclear and missile programs and was not interested in a meaningful dialogue. He said any lull in missile tests did not mean that North Korea was sitting idly.
“The latest launch was conducted 75 days after North Korea’s provocations in September. Some optimistic views labeled 75 days of silence as a positive signal. However, the missile launch in November made it clear that North Korea was continuing to relentlessly develop its nuclear and missile programs even while they were seemingly silent,"" Kono said. 
Tillerson also urged China and Russia on Friday to increase pressure on North Korea by going beyond the implementation of U.N. sanctions but the two countries were wary of the idea.
China’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Wu Haitao said all parties must implement U.N. sanctions, but added that unilateral sanctions undermine the unity of the Security Council and “hurt the legitimate right and interests of other countries and should therefore be abandoned.""
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow was committed to implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and echoed China's concerns about unilateral sanctions. 
U.S. President Donald Trump wants China, North Korea's main ally and trading partner, to impose an oil embargo on Pyongyang, over and above Beijing's adherence to U.N. sanctions.
The Security Council has ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea over its weapons programs since 2006. 

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council on Friday it was time to immediately re-establish and strengthen communication channels with North Korea, including inter-Korean and military-to-military channels, to reduce the risk of a misunderstanding escalating into conflict.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 03:53PM ET</span>",Austria's Kurz strikes deal to bring far right into government,"By Shadia Nasralla and Francois Murphy
VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian conservative party leader Sebastian Kurz reached a coalition deal with the anti-immigration Freedom Party on Friday, paving the way for Austria to become the only western European country with a far-right party in government.
The agreement, two months after a parliamentary election dominated by Europe's migration crisis, ends more than a decade in opposition for the Freedom Party (FPO), which last entered government in 2000 with the People's Party (OVP) that Kurz now leads.
Kurz's party won the Oct. 15 election with a hard line on immigration that often overlapped with the Freedom Party's. The FPO came third with 26 percent of the vote.
""We can inform you that there is a turquoise-blue agreement,"" Kurz said in a joint statement to reporters with FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache, referring to their two parties by their colors. 
Strache and Kurz said the details of their agreement would be presented to the public on Saturday, after a meeting with President Alexander Van der Bellen and discussions with their parties' leadership structures.
Party officials had said a news conference with Kurz and FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache would take place at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT), but as the talks in a Vienna palace dragged on, the timing slipped. The two men emerged more than three hours later.
""We want to reduce the burden on taxpayers ... and above all we want to ensure greater security in our country, including through the fight against illegal immigration,"" Kurz said.
Anti-establishment parties have made large electoral gains in Europe in recent years, capitalizing on voter dissatisfaction with mainstream parties' handling of the economy, security and immigration.
Most -- including French National Front leader Marine Le Pen, an ally of the FPO's who made it to her country's presidential runoff this year -- have fallen short of entering government, but the FPO is expected to hold key posts.
A person familiar with the talks said the far-right party was poised to secure the Interior, Foreign and Defence Ministries.
When the Freedom Party last entered government in 2000, other EU countries imposed short-lived sanctions on Austria in protest. Given the changed political landscape in Europe since then, the reaction is likely to be more muted.

Kurz has, however, sought to head off potential criticism by offering assurances that his government will be pro-European. He plans to shift some EU departments from the Foreign Ministry to his office, and has secured a guarantee that there will be no Brexit-style referendum on leaving the bloc, a source said.

NEAR RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - I went to the road just outside Ramallah, as on previous days, because that is one of the places in the West Bank where Palestinians have been protesting against U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
The 100-metre stretch leads from the city limits of Ramallah to the Jewish settlement of Beit El, and has a filling station and a traffic circle. 
Earlier on Friday, which Palestinians were calling a ""Day of Rage"", I had tried working at the Kalandia crossing point into the West Bank, but the Israelis had thrown tear gas and I knew this would make taking good photographs difficult. 
Outside Beit El, a group of paramilitary Israeli police had driven back hundreds of Palestinians who were throwing rocks and burning tyres. I was photographing the protesters, and did not see another Palestinian who apparently emerged close to the Israeli squad from a hiding place near the traffic circle. 
I heard the Israeli police shooting, and turned around. On instinct, I started taking pictures, all the time trying to keep well out of the line of fire. 
When the Palestinian fell, I could see that he was holding a knife, and wearing what looked like a suicide bomb vest.

Israeli police said he had managed to stab and wound one of their number before being shot. Palestinian medics later said the attacker was dead, and that his bomb belt had been fake.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Human rights activist Juan Carlos Soni fears a new security law passed by Mexico's Congress on Friday could mean his death after he suffered beatings, electrocution and abduction at the hands of the armed forces four years ago.
Bucking widespread protests from rights groups, Congress approved the Law of Internal Security, which will formally regulate the deployment of the military in Mexico more than a decade after the government dispatched it to fight drug cartels.
Proponents of the law argue it is needed to delimit the armed forces' role in combating crime, while critics fear it will enshrine their purview, encouraging greater impunity and abuses in a country where justice is often notoriously weak.
Multiple human rights groups and international organizations, including the United Nations, attacked the bill, mindful of the dozens of reported cases of abuses by members of the military in Mexico over the past 11 years.
Soni, 46, a teacher from the central state of San Luis Potosi, whose case was documented by Mexico's national human rights commission, related how in 2013 he was detained, blindfolded and tortured by marines after being warned by them to stop looking into alleged rights abuses.
While being held in a cellar, Soni said, he was made to leave fingerprints on guns and bags of marijuana and cocaine.
He was then arrested on charges of carrying an illegal weapon and drug possession, and spent 16 months in prison until he was released with the aid of U.N. representatives in Mexico.
""If they give them that power and send out the Navy again, I'm going to seek political asylum in another country,"" Soni told Reuters shortly before the law passed Congress. ""Much though I love my country, if I stay, they'll kill me.""
The Navy subsequently acknowledged participating in abuses against Soni, but he said he has yet to receive any restitution.
The Navy did not immediately reply to request for comment.
""THE JOB WE WERE ASKED TO DO""
Well over 100,000 people have been killed in turf wars between the gangs and clashes with security force since former President Felipe Calderon first sent in the military to combat drug gangs shortly after taking office in December 2006.
Reports of abuse gradually crept up as the battle with the cartels intensified, and tens of thousands of people have gone missing or disappeared in the tumult.
Many of the most damaging scandals, from extra-judicial killings of suspected gang members to questions over the army's failure to stop the disappearance of 43 students near a base in 2014, have come under President Enrique Pena Nieto.
Opponents of the military deployment say it has undermined trust in one of the most respected institutions in Mexico, as exposure to sickening violence and organized crime corroded the Army and the Navy just as it had the police.
""We don't want to be on the streets, but this is the job we were asked to do,"" said a soldier who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
Noting that personnel were often separated from their families for long periods, the soldier said the task of attempting to keep order was made harder by the lack of regulations governing how the military should proceed.
""It should be the police who are doing this, but they don't have the necessary training,"" he said.
Under Calderon and Pena Nieto, the armed forces played a major role in capturing or killing most of the top capos in Mexico. But they have not managed to pacify the country.
October was the most violent month on record since the government began keeping regular monthly tallies 20 years ago.
Relatives of the victims of abuses believe the new law will only give the military more cover to do what it wants.

""The Law of Internal Security won't just protect them, it offers them more faculties to carry out human rights violations masquerading as security operations,"" said Grace Mahogany Fernandez, whose brother was kidnapped and disappeared by the armed forces in December 2008 in the northern state of Coahuila.

It was the first time Temer has said how many votes are still needed to reach the three-fifths super majority to pass the unpopular legislation that investors see as vital to bringing a huge budget deficit under control.
""That is the reason why we put off the vote until February,"" Temer said at the swearing-in of a cabinet minister who will be responsible for mustering the votes shortfall.
The measure is due to be put to the vote on Feb. 19, after the Christmas to Carnival (LON:CCL) Congressional recess, when it could meet with greater reluctance from lawmakers as the 2018 general election approaches. 
The delay has increased market skepticism over Brazil's ability to rein in a deficit that caused the loss of its investment grade credit rating. 
Temer's new minister of political affairs, Carlos Marun, said the bill's approval will be his biggest challenge as he takes over government relations with Congress.

Marun was sworn in to succeed Antonio Imbassahy, whose PSDB party quit Temer's governing coalition and is split over delivering its 46 votes in the lower house to help pass Temer's pension plan.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a ""death sentence"" for democracy.
Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year.
Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban's conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival.
Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang.
Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is ""an open book"".
Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party.
The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban's Fidesz party.
""What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik's name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,"" Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd.
A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks.
ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that.
On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.
""This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,"" Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday.
For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis.
Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.

""This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Soccer leagues such as England's Premier League and Germany's Bundesliga won a reprieve on Friday when EU ambassadors agreed to exclude them from the scope of a copyright reform that would help make content more easily available online.
The entertainment and sports industries have been fiercely lobbying against the European Commission's proposed reform of EU copyright law to make films and TV program more available across borders, arguing it would undermine the financing model of the whole sector.
Films and TV program are often financed by selling exclusive distribution rights on a country-by-country basis. Rights to show sports, such as Premier League soccer matches, can fetch billions of pounds. 
The Commission has said it is not seeking to force anyone to make content more available online, but merely to make it easier for broadcasters to obtain the necessary rights.
EU member states agreed on Friday to exclude all sports events, TV program co-produced by broadcasters and other third parties, as well as content licensed to a broadcaster by a third party.
That means that only content produced and financed entirely by the broadcaster will be able to be shown online across the EU after the rights are obtained in the home country. That mostly includes TV shows made by public broadcasters for home audiences, as opposed to blockbuster TV shows such as ""Game of Thrones"".
At issue is the so-called ""country of origin principle"", which allows satellite broadcasters to acquire the rights for content in their home country rather than in every country where the program is received by satellite.
Under the Commission's proposal broadcasters could choose to make their catch-up TV and live streaming services available online across the EU after securing the rights in their home country.
The agreement is not final and means EU member states can enter into negotiations with the European Parliament to strike a final deal.
The Parliament had restricted the scope of the reform even further, limiting it to just news and current affairs program.
The Commission has pointed to the large number of European citizens living abroad who may want to watch content from their home country online without resorting to piracy.
It says 67 percent of all films are only shown in one EU country and that its proposal could help free up over 50 percent of own productions from broadcasters like the BBC, should they choose to make it available.

Supporters of the center-left Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship, led by TV star Salvador Nasralla, set fire to tires across the country, blocking major thoroughfares in the capital, Tegucigalpa, and the second city of San Pedro Sula. 
Police and soldiers responded with tear gas to rock-throwing protesters who set fire to a vehicle for carrying soldiers in Tegucigalpa. In San Pedro Sula, security forces sought to move protesters who blocked a road leading to the key Puerto Cortes port, which exports manufacturing and agricultural goods.
Honduras has been roiled by political instability in the wake of the Nov. 26 vote, which remains unresolved. Nasralla trails conservative President Juan Orlando Hernandez by 1.6 percentage points according to the official count, which has been questioned by the two main opposition parties and a wide swathe of the diplomatic corps.
Honduras' electoral tribunal said on Sunday that a partial recount of votes showed broadly the same result as previously, maintaining Hernandez's lead. It has until Dec. 26 to declare a winner.
Last week, Honduras' two main opposition parties presented formal requests to annul the results of the election.

Hector Marcos Diaz, a lawyer and academic with a long career in Mexico's electoral bodies, was approved as the newest prosecutor for electoral crimes with 92 senators' votes, the Senate said in a statement. 
The previous incumbent, Santiago Nieto, was fired by Mexico's acting attorney general in October on the grounds that he broke a code of conduct for officials. 
Nieto had given a newspaper interview in which he accused Emilio Lozoya, the former boss of state oil firm Pemex and a senior member of the president's 2012 campaign team, of writing to him to ask that he be declared innocent of funneling cash from Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht into Pena Nieto's campaign.
Odebrecht is at the heart of a Brazilian bribery and kickback probe, known as Lava Jato or Car Wash, that has reverberated across Latin America.
The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has been trying to shake a reputation for graft that threatens to undermine the party's efforts to stay in power in next July's presidential election. The firing of Nieto was widely seen as a setback to those efforts. 
The PRI has overseen the arrest of various former state governors, but Lozoya poses a more difficult challenge, given his proximity to the president.
Both Pena Nieto and Lozoya have denied involvement in any wrongdoing related to the 2012 campaign.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration put new requirements in place on Friday for the 38 countries participating in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, including that they use U.S. counterterrorism data to screen travelers, officials said.
The program allows citizens of mainly European countries to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. Citizens from the 38 countries are required to obtain a so-called travel authorization to enter the United States.
President Donald Trump has sought to tighten the rules for those seeking to visit or live in the United States in several ways, saying restrictions are necessary for security reasons.
The changes will apply to all countries in the program. One change is that they will be required to use U.S. information to screen travelers crossing their borders from third countries. Many countries in the program already do that, one administration official said.
Countries whose citizens stay longer than authorized during visits to the United States at a relatively higher rate will be required to conduct public awareness campaigns on the consequences of overstays, the officials said. One existing penalty is that people who overstay a visit may not travel visa-free to the United States in the future.
The threshold for the overstay rate triggering the public information campaign requirement is two percent, the officials said. In the 2016 fiscal year, of the VWP countries, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, and San Marino, a wealthy enclave landlocked inside central Italy, had total overstay rates higher than two percent, according to a report by the Department of Homeland Security.
The overall overstay rate for VWP countries is 0.68 percent, lower than non-VWP countries excluding Canada and Mexico, which is at 2.07 percent, according to the DHS report.
Members of Congress have expressed concern about the security risks of overstays. A May 2017 report by the DHS inspector general found the department lacked a comprehensive system to gather information on departing visitors, forcing it to rely on third-party data to confirm departures, which is sometimes faulty.
The United States will also start assessing VWP countries on their safeguards against ""insider threats"" at their airports, especially those with direct flights to the United States, officials said.

The goal is to ensure countries ""make sure that airport employees, aviation workers et cetera, aren't corrupted or are co-opted to pose a threat to aircraft, especially those that are U.S.-bound,"" an official said.

The United States on Thursday presented for the first time pieces of what it said were Iranian weapons supplied to the Houthis, describing it as conclusive evidence that Tehran was violating U.N. resolutions. 
The arms included charred remnants of what the Pentagon said was an Iranian-made short-range ballistic missile fired from Yemen on Nov. 4 at King Khaled International Airport outside Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh, as well as a drone and an anti-tank weapon recovered in Yemen by the Saudis.
When asked whether Paris believed that evidence was irrefutable, foreign ministry deputy spokesman Alexandre Giorgini declined to respond directly.
""The United Nations secretariat has not, at this stage, drawn any conclusions. France continues to examine the information at its disposal,"" he said.
Tensions between Iran and France have increased in recent weeks after President Emmanuel Macron said Tehran should be less aggressive in the region and clarify its ballistic missile program.
Giorgini said France remained concerned by Iran's ballistic missile program and urged it to abide fully by U.N. Security Council resolution 2231.
Resolution 2231, which enshrined the landmark nuclear deal with world powers, calls on Iran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs, including launches using such technology. It stops short of explicitly barring such activity.
France's foreign minister is due in Washington on Monday to in part to discuss Iran and will travel to Tehran at the start of January.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - South Sudan's president has given top jobs to three generals facing U.N. sanctions over alleged violations during a four-year-old civil war.
Campaign group Human Rights Watch called the promotions ""a slap in the face of justice"" - but the presidency said the three men were good officers who had been falsely accused.
    In a decree read out on state radio late on Thursday, President Salva Kiir appointed Marial Chanuong as his new head of army operations, training and intelligence, and Santino Deng Wol as the head of ground forces.
    Gabriel Jok Riak was named deputy chief of defense. 
The U.N. Security Council imposed travel bans and asset freezes on the three and others in 2015.
It accused Chanuong of commanding troops who ""led the slaughter of Nuer civilians in and around (the capital) Juba"" in December 2013, including hundreds it said were reportedly buried in mass graves.
    ""I am in my country. I can do anything in my own country,"" Chanuong told Reuters Friday.
The United Nations said Wol commanded troops who killed children, women and old men during a 2015 offensive, while Riak violated a ceasefire in early 2014.
    Kiir's spokesman, Ateny Wek Ateny, said the three generals were ""very genuine, obedient commanders"" who had been falsely accused.
But Human Rights Watch said the announcement, made on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the war's outbreak, showed the impunity enjoyed by commanders accused of abuses.
    ""Having these people nominated to new positions is a slap in the face of justice and a slap in the face of the international community,"" the organization's Jonathan Pednault told Reuters.
South Sudan plunged into civil war in December 2013 when a political crisis escalated into fighting between forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and rebels allied with his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer.
    The conflict has reopened ethnic fault lines and spread across the country, where more than a dozen armed groups are battling for land, resources, revenge, and power amid widespread reports of rape, murder and torture.
    Several ceasefires have been agreed but broken. Tens of thousands have been killed since the war broke out.

It was not clear who was doing the shelling, which took place on Dec. 9 and 12 and came from the mountains overlooking the area, the spokeswoman, Liz Throssell, told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva.
""Iraqi forces are still working to discover the exact locations from which the shelling has come and the identity of those responsible,"" she said.
The shelling of the ethnically-mixed town happened after many of its Kurdish population was displaced following clashes with Turkmen paramilitary groups. 
Tuz Khurmatu is made up of Turkmen, Kurds and Arabs located 75 km (47 miles) south of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. It came under the full control of Iraqi government forces and mostly Iran-backed Shi'ite paramilitaries known as Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) in October. 
It had been under control of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters since 2014. 
Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) unilaterally held an independence referendum on Sept. 25 and Kurds voted overwhelmingly to secede, defying Baghdad and alarming neighboring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities.
The referendum was held in Kurdish areas and disputed territories claimed by both Baghdad and Erbil.
The Iraqi government responded by seizing Kurdish-held Kirkuk and other territory disputed between the Kurds and the central government, including Tuz Khurmatu. 
It also banned direct flights to Kurdistan and demanded control over border crossings.
Clashes broke out between the Peshmerga and Turkmen PMF units in recent weeks, Throssell said, leaving an unconfirmed number of deaths from both groups. 
U.N. human rights officers visited the town on Dec. 7 and 14 to investigate reports of the burning of homes and looting of businesses and found some 150 premises burned.
Thousands of residents, mainly Kurds, left for the KRG, and many have not returned.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - More than a quarter of Canadian firms could move part of their operations to the United States amid uncertainty over the future of the NAFTA trade pact, the nation's export credit agency said on Friday.
The semi-annual forecast by Export Development Canada underlines the challenges posed by the more isolationist approach to trade of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
Canada sends 75 percent of all goods exports to the United States and could be badly hit if Washington walks away from the North American Free Trade Agreement. One way to cushion the potential blow is to set up shop in the United States.
EDC said 26 percent of the 1,002 firms surveyed ""indicated that they are moving - or are considering moving - part of their operations inside the U.S. border in response to the elevated uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policy"".
Talks to modernize the treaty have so far failed to resolve major differences between the United States on one hand and Canada and Mexico on the other.
The survey of 1,000 firms from Oct. 2 to Oct. 25 found 23 percent of respondents said the NAFTA talks were hitting their Canadian operations. The same percentage said they were trying to diversity their exports to new markets, with the focus on the European Union and China.
Despite the tensions, the vast majority of exporters expected overall conditions to remain the same or improve over the next six months, with little change in new orders from U.S. customers.
""Trade confidence is holding steady ... we can only imagine what it would look like without the NAFTA uncertainty,"" EDC chief economist Peter Hall said in a commentary.

The forces advanced into Bayhan, about 300 km (190 miles) southeast of the Houthi-held capital Sanaa, killing dozens of the militants in clashes, the sources said.
Bayhan is important in Yemen's war because it is located on a major road linking Shabwa province with Houthi-held Maarib province to the north. The army's advance means that the Houthis have been expelled from Shabwa, sources said.
Yemen's more than two-year-old war pits the Iran-allied Houthis, who control Sanaa, against a Saudi-led military alliance that backs the government now based in the southern port of Aden. The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered a humanitarian crisis.
The government-run Sabanew agency said the remaining Houthis had fled after battles for strategic positions in the Bayhan area which had left hundreds of them dead and wounded.
The agency said the army also seized other positions in the area, where the movement of heavy artillery had been difficult because of sand dunes.
This month the Saudi-led coalition, which is backed by U.S. and British weapons and intelligence, intensified air strikes after the Houthis killed former president Ali Abdullah Saleh when he switched sides in the civil war. There has been relatively little change in positions on the ground around the capital.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - The United Nations on Friday urged the Sri Lankan government to urgently implement reforms to end war-time arbitrary detention and strengthen independent monitoring of tough legislation.
Sri Lanka has used the 1979 Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to pursue a tough line to prevent aiding and abetting terrorism in the island nation's long conflict with Tamil Tiger rebels.
That legislation gives wide powers to police to arrest a suspect without informing the immediate family, restricts access to lawyers and allows detention of up to 18-months without charging.
The war ended in 2009, but the government has not repealed PTA, though it had promised to end arbitrary detentions.
Many ethnic minority Tamils who have been arrested under the PTA have complained of years of detention without being charged.
The U.N. is now asking Sri Lanka to repeal the draconian law and introduce an internationally acceptable law.
The government says it has begun moves to replace the PTA and is in the process of introducing new legislation. 
""There are no effective safeguards against arbitrariness in this context and there is an urgent need to strengthen mechanisms for independent monitoring and oversight,"" Leigh Toomey, a member of the UN working group on arbitrary detention told reporters in Colombo after concluding a 11-day mission.
She said they had identified significant challenges to the right of personal liberty in Sri Lanka, resulting in arbitrary detention across the country.
The Working Group also said their attention had been drawn to a loss of liberty among the socially vulnerable, such as children, women, elderly people, people with psycho-social problems and the poor.
Sri Lanka is under criticism from the rights groups over its slow progress on the commitments it made to the UN human Rights council following a U.N. resolution that called for post-war reconciliation and an investigation of all alleged war crimes.
Sri Lanka ended a 26-year-civil war crushing the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelan in 2009. The United Nations and rights groups have accused the military of killing thousands of civilians, mostly Tamils, during the final weeks of the conflict.
The Tamil Tigers were also accused of widespread abuses during the war, such as using child soldiers and targeting civilians with suicide bombers.
In November European lawmakers said they were disappointed about Sri Lanka's slow roll-out of human rights reforms that it had promised in exchange for trade concessions.
    A U.N. rights watchdog in 2016 called on Sri Lanka to investigate documented allegations of torture and rape of detainees by security forces and to rein in broad police powers.
The U.N. Committee against Torture described continuing reports of abductions, deaths in custody, poor conditions of detention and the use of forced confessions in court.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - With the map of Syria's conflict decisively redrawn in President Bashar al-Assad's favor, his Russian allies want to convert military gains into a settlement that stabilizes the shattered nation and secures their interests in the region.
A year after the opposition's defeat in Aleppo, government forces backed by Russia and Iran have recovered large swathes of territory as Islamic State's ""caliphate"" collapses. 
As U.N.-backed talks in Geneva fail to make any progress, Russia is preparing to launch its own political process in 2018. President Vladimir Putin declared mission accomplished for the military on a visit to Russia's Syrian air base this week, and said conditions were ripe for a political solution.
Though Washington still insists Assad must go, a senior Syrian opposition figure told Reuters the United States and other governments that have backed the rebellion had finally ""surrendered to the Russian vision"" on ending the war.
The view in Damascus is that this will preserve Assad as president. A Syrian official in Damascus said ""it is clear a track is underway, and the Russians are overseeing it"".
""There is a shift in the path of the crisis in Syria, a shift for the better,"" the official said.
But analysts struggle to see how Russian diplomacy can bring lasting peace to Syria, encourage millions of refugees to return, or secure Western reconstruction aid.
There is no sign that Assad is ready to compromise with his opponents. The war has also allowed his other big ally, Iran and its Revolutionary Guard, to expand its regional influence, which Tehran will not want to see diluted by any settlement in Syria.
Having worked closely to secure Assad, Iran and Russia may now differ in ways that could complicate Russian policy. 
Assad and his allies now command the single largest chunk of Syria, followed by U.S.-backed Kurdish militias who control much of northern and eastern Syria and are more concerned with shoring up their regional autonomy than fighting Damascus. 
Anti-Assad rebels still cling to patches of territory: a corner of the northwest at the Turkish border, a corner of the southwest at the Israeli frontier, and the Eastern Ghouta near Damascus. Eastern Ghouta and the northwest are now in the firing line. 
""The Revolutionary Guards clearly feel they have won this war and the hardliners in Iran are not too keen on anything but accommodation with Assad, so on that basis it is a little hard to see that there can be any real progress,"" said Rolf Holmboe, a former Danish ambassador to Syria.
""Assad cannot live with a political solution that involves any real power sharing,"" said Holmboe. ""The solution he could potentially live with is to freeze the situation you have on the ground right now."" 
THE WORLD IS ""TIRED OF THE CRISIS"" 
The war has been going Assad's way since 2015, when Russia sent its air force to help him.
The scales tipped even more his way this year: Russia struck deals with Turkey, the United States and Jordan that contained in the war in the west, indirectly helping Assad's advances in the east, and Washington pulled military aid from the rebels.
Though Assad seems unbeatable, Western governments still hope to effect change by linking reconstruction aid to a credible political process leading to ""a genuine transition"". 
While paying lip service to the principle that any peace deal should be concluded under U.N. auspices, Russia aims to convene its own peace congress in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. The aim is to draw up a new constitution followed by elections. 
The senior Syrian opposition figure said the United States and other states that had backed their cause - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and Turkey - had all given way to Russia. Sochi, not Geneva, would be the focal point for talks.
""This is the way it has been understood from talking to the Americans, the French, the Saudis - all the states,"" the opposition figure said. ""It is clear that this is the plan, and there is no state that will oppose this ... because the entire world is tired of this crisis.""
Proposals include forming a new government to hold elections that would include Syrian refugees. 
But ""the time frame: six months, two years, three years, all depends on the extent of understanding between the Russians and Americans"", the opposition figure said. ""If the Russians and Americans differ greatly, the whole table could be overturned.""
IRAN, RUSSIA DIVERGE ON KURDS
Russia is serious about accomplishing something with the political process, but on its own terms and turf, said senior International Crisis Group analyst Noah Bonsey.
""I am not sure they have a good sense of how to accomplish that and to the extent that they seek to accomplish things politically, they may run into the divergence of interests between themselves and their allies,"" he said.
The Syrian Kurdish question is one area where Russia and Iran have signaled different goals.
While a top Iranian official recently said the government would take areas held by the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces, Russia has struck deals with the Kurds and their U.S. sponsors.
""From the start of the crisis, there's been a difference between the Russians and the Iranians and the regime,"" said Fawza Youssef, a top Kurdish politician. The Russians believe the Kurds ""have a cause that should be taken into account"".
Damascus, while issuing its own warnings to the Kurds, may continue to leave them to their own devices as it presses campaigns against the last rebel-held pockets of western Syria. 
The situation in the southwest is shaped by different factors, namely Israel's determination to keep Iran-backed forces away from its frontier, which could prompt an Israeli military response.

""There are still major questions and a lot of potential for escalating violence in various parts of Syria,"" said Bonsey.

Queen Elizabeth's grandson, fifth-in-line to the throne, and Markle, who stars in the U.S. TV legal drama ""Suits"", announced their engagement last month with the marriage to take place in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.
""His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales and Ms. Meghan Markle will marry on 19th May 2018,"" Kensington Palace said in a statement. 
The couple said they had chosen to marry in Windsor, west of London, because it was ""a special place for them"", having spent time there regularly since they met in July 2016 after being introduced through a mutual friend. 
Harry's 91-year-old grandmother, Elizabeth, will attend the ceremony. However, the date they have chosen clashes with English soccer's FA Cup Final which is usually attended by Harry's elder brother Prince William who, as President of the Football Association, awards the trophy to the winners.
""The couple of course want the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family,"" Harry's Communications Secretary Jason Knauf said last month.
""They also want the day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too and are currently working through ideas for how this might be achieved.""
The wedding is likely to attract huge attention across the world, as did the marriage of William to his wife Kate in 2011 which was watched by an estimated two billion people.
The royal family have said they will pay for the core aspects of the wedding, such as the church service and reception.
Markle, 36, who attended a Catholic school as a child but identifies as a Protestant, will be baptized and confirmed into the Church of England before the wedding.
She intends to become a British citizen, though she will retain her U.S. citizenship while she goes through the process.
The Gothic St George's Chapel is located in the grounds of Windsor Castle, which has been the family home of British kings and queens for almost 1,000 years. Within the chapel are the tombs of ten sovereigns, including Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, and Charles I.

On Wednesday, Kensington Palace announced Markle would join the queen and other senior Windsors for their family Christmas celebrations at her Sandringham estate in eastern England in what commentators said was a break with royal protocol under which such an invitation would normally only be extended to Markle after the wedding.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Gang life in the poor Central American country of El Salvador is hard, but for a dozen former members of the feared 18th Street Gang, building a new life outside is no less difficult. 
Wilfredo Gomez, 40, joined a gang as an adolescent in Los Angeles, the U.S. city to which his parents emigrated. He said he was enticed by the guns, the girls and the camaraderie of gang life. 
He wound up in jail before being deported back to his native country. With few links to El Salvador, he quickly returned to gang life. A 10-year jail sentence for stealing an Uzi submachine gun gave him time to reckon with his choices.
Returning to civil society is arduous in the midst of the government's militarized battle against the ""maras,"" which has led to claims of rights abuses and, according to police, an average daily tally of 16 dead.
Former gang members often struggle to find lodging and work, and may be rejected by their families. 
For Gomez and 12 other ex-gangsters, the Eben-Ezer evangelical church in the gang-ridden neighborhood of Dina in San Salvador, the capital, has been a lifeline, offering food, accommodations, and a spiritual second chance. 
""I've only had losses being part of the gang,"" Gomez said. ""I haven't won anything. I lost my youth, which was spent in jail. I lost my family due to my bad decisions. I lost my home, my woman, my son, and I lost the best years of my life due to a pointless ideology.""
Gomez now runs a bakery that employs 10 other former gang members.
""Now, my fun, my enjoyment, is to see them smile, to have dreams,"" Gomez said. ""They say they're going to open a bigger bakery, and that one day we'll have our own store and compete against Pizza Hut.""
Rejected by a society weary of violence, they nonetheless struggle to eradicate the stain of gang life.
In October, police went to the bakery and stripped the employees to expose their gang tattoos. They were arrested on suspicion of illicit association, a crime that carries a 5-year sentence. A week later, they were released without charges.
Once known as ""The Shadow,"" Raul Valladares, 34, is undergoing a painful process to remove tattoos from his face and arms. He has received death threats from his former gang associates because removing gang insignia is punishable by death.
""It's definitely cost me a lot to leave the gang,"" he said. ""But I'm fighting to keep going.""

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 09:37AM ET</span>",Israeli troops wound more than 40 Palestinians in protests over U.S. Jerusalem move,"RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Israeli troops shot and wounded more than 40 Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank on Friday, medical officials said, as protests over U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital entered a second week. 
Near the Palestinian city of Ramallah in the West Bank, Israeli police troopers said they shot a man after he stabbed and hurt one of their unit. Reuters photographers who saw the wounded Palestinian fall said he was holding a small knife and wore what looked like a bomb belt.
Medical officials said three more Palestinians were shot and wounded in the West Bank. A further 38 were wounded on the border of the Gaza Strip, whose dominant Hamas Islamists have called for a revolt against Israel in protest against Trump's Dec. 6 decision. 
The Israeli military said that about 2,500 Palestinian took part in riots in the West Bank, rolling flaming tires and throwing firebombs and rocks at soldiers and border police. Troops took action to break up the riots, it said in a statement.
Similar scenes occurred along the border with Gaza Strip, where about 3,500 Palestinians demonstrated.
""During the violent riots IDF soldiers fired selectively towards main instigators,"" the military said.
Gaza has also seen almost nightly rocket launches into Israel by Palestinian militants, which have not caused casualties. An Israeli counter-strike on Gaza killed two Hamas gunmen.
Trump's announcement, reversing decades of U.S. policy which treated Jerusalem's status as a matter for Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, stirred anger across the Arab and Muslim world and concern among Washington's European allies.
Jerusalem is holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians.
Israel captured East Jerusalem from Arab forces in the 1967 Middle East War and later annexed it in a move not recognized internationaly. Palestinians hope that part of the city will be the capital of a future independent state and Palestinian leaders say Trump's move is a serious blow to an already moribund peace process.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to visit Israel, as well as Egypt, next week.

More than a million migrants have arrived in Germany in the last three years, many of them fleeing conflict in the Middle East, causing concern that anti-Semitism could increase.
German police have reported protesters setting Israeli flags ablaze and using anti-Semitic slogans in Berlin and other cities in demonstrations against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
In a piece for weekly magazine Der Spiegel, Justice Minister Heiko Maas wrote that the Holocaust, in which the Nazis killed six million Jews, and its significance needed to become an even more important part of integration courses and migrants should be tested on it in the examination at the end of their course.
""The lessons from the Holocaust need to be one of the guiding ideas in those lessons and not just some chapter of German history,"" he said.
""Racism has no place in Germany, so everyone who wants to stay in Germany for the long term needs to be clear that we fight the Neonazis' anti-Semitism and we won't tolerate any imported anti-Semitism from immigrants either,"" Maas added.
Jens Spahn, a senior member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), told Der Spiegel he thought immigration from Muslim countries was one of the causes of recent anti-Semitic demonstrations in Berlin.
Spahn said incidents in recent days ""were related to immigration from a culture in which people are not prissy about how they deal with Jews and homosexuals"".
Speaking at an event marking the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Israel, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Friday Germany needed to remember its historical responsibility, including the lessons of two world wars, the Holocaust, ensuring Israel's security and rejecting any form of racism and anti-Semitism.
""There's no end to this responsibility for people born afterwards and no exceptions for immigrants,"" he said, adding that those who burned Israeli flags did not understand or respect what it meant to be German.
In an interview with the Funke newspaper consortium, Israel's ambassador in Berlin Jeremy Issacharoff called for a ban on burning flags. ""Anyone who burns flags questions Israel's right to exist,"" he said.
Stephan Kramer, the head of a state intelligence agency in the eastern region of Thuringia, warned in Der Spiegel that anti-Semitism was becoming ""ever more uninhibited"" and many Jews were too scared to identify themselves as such.

ROME/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Italy wants Libya's coastguard to take responsibility within three years for intercepting migrants across about a tenth of the Mediterranean even as Libyan crews struggle to patrol their own coast and are accused of making deadly mistakes at sea.
Six years after the revolution that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is split between rival governments in the east and west while ports and beaches are largely in the hands of armed groups.
Migrant smuggling has flourished, with more than 600,000 making the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean in four years. Migrants transiting through Libya often endure appalling conditions, including rape, torture and forced labor.  
The Italian plan, outlined in a slide presentation seen by Reuters, shows that Italy and the European Union are focusing on rebuilding Libya's navy and coastguard so they can stop boats. But aid groups say the Libyans are poorly trained and accuse them of mishandling a rescue last month in which some 50 people are thought to have died. 
The Libyans return all migrants, including refugees, to Libya even though the situation on the ground there is far from resolved. Italy has been coordinating rescues off the Libyan coast since 2013.   
The 30 slides show spending of 44 million euros ($52 million) to expand Libya's capacity by 2020, equipping the coastguard and enabling it to establish its own rescue coordination center as well as a vast maritime search-and-rescue region. It also foresees a pilot project for monitoring Libya's southern border. The project draws on European Union and Italian funds, and needs EU approval. 
The plan was presented by the Italian coastguard at a conference hosted by the EU's anti-trafficking mission, Sophia, in Rome last month. Representatives from the EU, non-governmental groups and various Mediterranean navies and coastguards attended the closed-door presentation, said a source who was present.
Libya's coastguard has already been pushing further into international waters, often firing warning shots or speeding close to charity boats. Over the summer, three charities abandoned rescue operations in part because of fears of the increasing Libyan sea presence.
Arrivals to Italy have fallen by two-thirds since July from the same period last year after officials working for the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, Italy's partner, persuaded human smugglers in the city of Sabratha to stop boats leaving. 
The Libyan coastguard also increased the rate of its interceptions, turning back about 20,000 this year, though it still only stops a portion of the boats. 
The crisis remains a major issue in Italy. State shelters for asylum seekers are nearly full, and with elections looming politicians across the spectrum insist the flows from North Africa be stopped, which the new scheme is likely to address.
""UNPROFESSIONAL RESCUE""
Italy's coastguard did not reply to a request for comment. The prime minister's office referred questions to the interior ministry, which is spearheading the effort to fight people smuggling in Libya and also had no comment. 
""Each nation has the right to declare its own search-and-rescue zone, and to carry out search-and-rescue operations,"" a Defence Ministry spokesman said, citing international law. 
Ayoub Qassem, a Libyan coastguard spokesman, said he did not have details of the plan, but both sides recognized the need to cooperate in tackling irregular migration. 
""Recently the Italian side has been eager to cooperate with Libya because it's more effective than working without Libya -- that's natural,"" he said.
   Italy has supplied Libya with four refurbished vessels so far, and six more have been promised, while the EU has trained about 220 Libyan coastguards.
But rights groups and aid workers say partnering with Libya's ""unprofessional"" coastguard risks exposing migrants to drowning during rescues or to further rights abuses if sent back to detention centers inside Libya.
    ""From the testimony we hear from the migrants, we know that people intercepted at sea have then re-entered the circle of violence and imprisonment and abuse that they were fleeing,"" said Nicola Stalla, search-and-rescue chief for SOS Mediterranee, one of the charities still operating off Libya. 
    Activists also point to incidents such as one on Nov. 6, when crew members of the German humanitarian ship Sea Watch 3 witnessed a Libyan naval vessel draw alongside an inflatable migrant boat. 
    When people fell into the water, Sea Watch used small rubber speedboats to pull people from the water while the Libyans looked on. Some migrants who climbed on board the Libyan vessel were whipped with ropes, and the Libyan boat sped off with a man still dangling in the water, according to videos shot by Sea Watch and crew member Gennaro Giudetti, who pulled the body of a lifeless 2 1/2-year-old Nigerian boy named Great from the water. 
    ""They watched us and shot videos. They even threw potatoes at us. That's not how you save lives,"" said Giudetti. 
    
    BROKEN SPEEDBOATS
    Libya's naval coastguard accused Sea Watch of obstructing the rescue and trying to lure away migrants who had already boarded their ship. Some migrants jumped into the water to try to reach Sea Watch rescuers. 
    The Libyans said their smaller speedboats, which are mounted on larger patrol vessels and are the safest to use for rescues, were broken.
    ""We have only one or two of these boats and they do not work, so how we can put them into the water?"" Qassem, the coastguard spokesman, told Reuters. 
The expansion of Libyan patrols has led to confusion and competition over who should take the lead during rescues. Some charity ships say they have been directed to hold off rescues to allow the Libyans to arrive, putting migrants at risk. 
    Libya's search-and-rescue region extends 90 miles from shore in some places, and 200 miles in others, Qassem said. 
    This summer the Libyans notified the International Maritime Organization about plans to take over a large search and rescue region, but withdrew the notification this month, saying it would resubmit a new one soon, an IMO spokeswoman said. 
    It would be the first time Libya has set up a search-and-rescue region, she said.

    The Italian plan proposes helping Libya formally declare such a zone. It would also provide for training, maintenance, new cars, ambulances and buses, communications equipment and clothing. ""Full operation capability"" is seen by the end of 2020.

The 58-year-old woman ordered the murder - which was never carried out - in March, transferring 4.1 bitcoin, then worth around $4,000, to the hitman's virtual wallet, the court found.
Bitcoin can be transferred electronically between users without an intermediary such as a bank, making it potentially attractive for buying illegal goods or services.

The Second Court of Appeal of San Salvador on Wednesday upheld the sentence for Teodora Vasquez, who was convicted in 2008 of aggravated homicide in the death of her child the previous year.
Prosecutors said Vasquez strangled the baby after birth. Her lawyers said she suffered health complications and the baby was stillborn.
Since 1997, El Salvador has had one of the world's most severe laws against women who have abortions or are suspected of assisting them.
""It is absolutely astounding, astonishing, appalling that these women are in essence being convicted of having a miscarriage, having a child stillborn,"" Throssell said. 
""They are basically being convicted for being women, for losing a child and for being poor,"" she said, adding that at least 41 other women have been similarly convicted over the past decade or so.
The U.N. was not aware of El Salvador jailing any women from wealthier backgrounds under the same law, Throssell said.

1384,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 08:30AM ET</span>","Poland gives government key election role, opposition sounds alarm","By Marcin Goettig
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's parliament has passed a bill that gives the government, rather than a panel of top judges, control over who conducts elections, a move the opposition called ""satanic"".
Minutes before midnight on Thursday, lawmakers of the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party and their allies approved a bill that allows the interior minister to nominate all candidates for head of the National Election Bureau.
The PiS has said its bill will make voting more transparent, but critics have said the real aim is to boost the electoral prospects of the party, which has denied European Commission accusations of eroding democratic standards.
The head of the judges' panel, the State Electoral Commission (PKW), said the bill would undermine the electoral process.
""De facto, the minister will take decisions, not us,"" PKW head Wojciech Hermelinski told reporters on Friday.
Poland is already at risk of sanctions from the EU over a PiS judicial reform; Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Thursday he expected the European Commission to launch an unprecedented punishment procedure against Warsaw next week. 
Hermelinski said Germany had a functioning system where government officials organized elections, but that the Polish government should not leave the independent PKW in place as a ""camouflage"" without real powers.
According to the bill, if none of the minister's candidates meet with the judges' approval, the minister can simply appoint the head of the Election Bureau. Lawmaker Jacek Protas from the opposition Civic Platform said in parliament that the bill was a ""satanic idea"" that would give a controlling stake in democracy to a single political party.
The PKW head said he would speak to members of the PiS-dominated upper house, the Senate, and President Andrzej Duda to urge them to prevent the measures passing into law.
The changes will also require the PKW to appoint about 100 lower-ranking election officials from lists of candidates presented by the interior minister. Those candidates will no longer have to be judges themselves and, as with the head of the bureau, if the PKW rejects all the names put forward, the minister will have the power to impose a choice.

The PiS-dominated Senate is set on Thursday to approve the overhaul of the judiciary - the deepest since Poland's transition from communism nearly three decades ago - which the opposition says violates the constitution.

A deal between the center-right People's Party (OVP) led by 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz and the anti-immigration Freedom Party would mark a major victory for a European far-right party after a flurry of elections this year.
""We are putting effort into this and we would be happy if it was possible to announce an agreement to you today, but I cannot promise it yet,"" said Gernot Bluemel, a close Kurz ally and leader of the conservatives in Vienna.
""We hope that we can properly conclude (the last issues) over the course of today. If you want to compare it to a skiing race, we are now doing the last turns before the finish line... I am in good spirits.""
Conservative Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka, whom local media and a source close to the coalition talks have named as a candidate for finance minister, told ORF radio ""a new government will be sworn in on Monday"".
An FPO source confirmed the envisaged timing for an agreement and swearing-in ceremony, adding a news conference with Kurz and Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache was planned for 1800 Vienna time (1700 GMT) on Friday.
The Freedom Party last entered government in 2000, triggering European sanctions against Austria. Such a step has not been flagged this time around, with many European countries having shifted to the political right.
Kurz, whose party won just over 31 percent in October's parliamentary elections, is all but certain to become chancellor with Strache -- whose FPO got 26 percent for third place after the Social Democrats -- as his deputy.
Freedom Party officials are set to fill major ministries, including the interior, foreign, defense, health and social affairs and infrastructure portfolios. This list has been neither confirmed nor denied by party officials.

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 08:20AM ET</span>",Multi-summit Macron burns energy in hunt for results,"By Luke Baker
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - If European leaders earned points for the amount of time they spend at summits, French President Emmanuel Macron would probably top the rankings this week. 
A two-day gathering in Brussels - with talks running past midnight on Thursday - was merely the icing on the cake for Macron, who had already hosted a global climate conference and a counter-terrorism summit in the past four days.
""He certainly comes with a lot of energy and ideas,"" one European Council official said of the 39-year-old, who in seven months in office has earned a reputation for burning the candle at both ends, stretching his youthful staff. 
""We just hope we can find a way to channel it.""
The question is, is it delivering results?
When it comes to Europe, the report card is so far mixed, although that's not necessarily Macron's fault. 
During his election campaign and early months in office, he put euro zone reform at the heart of his program, hoping to work hand-in-hand with Germany and other member states on it.
But the German election in September weakened Chancellor Angela Merkel's position and she is still trying to put together a coalition, a process unlikely to be completed before March. Without her, Macron lacks a partner to push things along. 
The discussions he wanted to have on ideas like a separate budget for the single currency area have been pushed back, an acknowledgement that the timing is not right.
There are talks on migration, security and defense, all topics addressed by EU leaders on Thursday, but progress is slow and halting, particularly on migration, which led to divisive discussions late into the night.
Macron, who in recent weeks has made trips to Africa, met Middle East leaders and brokered the return of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri from Saudi Arabia, is at the heart of all the exhausting debates.
TAKING THE REINS
He may want to steer a course somewhere between former President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose hyperactive EU style drove some partners to distraction, and his immediate predecessor Francois Hollande, who was at times considered too low-key.
""His energy is much appreciated, especially after the blow of Brexit, but he must also try to stay a bit realistic,"" said a diplomat, mentioning that Macron had managed to raise the Ukraine crisis, the Middle East, euro zone reform and demands that the bloc offer more social protection to citizens.
One problem the former investment banker faces is that getting 28 EU leaders to agree on a single course of action is always hard.
When he acts outside the EU bubble, he has arguably had more success. His One Planet summit this week drew new green pledges from corporations and international organizations, keeping the battle against climate change high up the global agenda.
An unscheduled stop in Saudi Arabia last month for talks with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman helped clinch the release of Hariri, who flew to Paris and then back to Lebanon, where he withdrew his resignation as prime minister.
Macron has in some ways taken the international reins at a time when several Western leaders are otherwise engaged - Britain's Theresa May is tied up with Brexit, Merkel is bogged down in coalition politics and President Donald Trump's first year in office has been chaotic and unpredictable.

His main rival for geopolitical engagement is Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has invited him to be guest of honor at the economic forum in St. Petersburg next May. No confirmation yet of whether Macron will find the time to go.

Erdogan was speaking two days after a Muslim leaders meeting in Istanbul condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's decision, calling on the world to respond by recognizing East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. 
""We will work for the annulment of this unjust decision firstly at the UN Security Council, and if a veto comes from there, the General Assembly,"" Erdogan told crowds gathered in the central Anatolian city of Konya via teleconference.
The United States is a permanent Security Council member with veto powers, meaning any move to overturn Washington's decision at the council would certainly be blocked.
Jerusalem, revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, is home to Islam's third holiest site and has been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in an action not recognized internationally.
Trump's decision broke with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that the city's status must be left to Israeli-Palestinian talks, leading to harsh criticisms from Muslim countries and Israel's closest European allies, who have also rejected the move. 
A communique issued after Wednesday's summit of more than 50 Muslim countries, including U.S. allies, said they considered Trump's move to be a declaration that Washington was withdrawing from its role ""as sponsor of peace"" in the Middle East.
Asked about the criticism during an interview with Israel's Makor Rishon daily, the U.S. ambassador to Israel said Trump had done ""what is good for America"".

""President Trump...does not intend to reverse himself, despite the various condemnations and declarations,"" Ambassador David Friedman said.

Myanmar's Ministry of Information said on Wednesday that the reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, and two policemen, faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act, though officials have since disclosed that they have not been charged. The 1923 law carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
The journalists had worked on stories about a military crackdown in Rakhine state, which has triggered the flight of more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to southern Bangladesh since the end of August.
""We remain concerned about Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo,"" the U.S. embassy said in a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. ""Their families and others have not been allowed to see them, and don't even know where they are being held.""
In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's spokesman Motosada Matano, said the Japanese government is closely watching the situation. He said Japan has been conducting a dialogue with the Myanmar government on human rights in Myanmar in general. 
Bangladesh, which is struggling to cope with the influx of refugees into its southern tip, condemned the arrests of reporters working for an agency that had shone a light for the world on the strife in Rakhine state.
""We strongly denounce arrests of Reuters journalists and feel that those reporters be free immediately so that they can depict the truth to the world by their reporting,"" said Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury, information adviser to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday that the arrests were a signal that press freedom is shrinking in Myanmar and the international community must do all it can to get them released.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo went missing on Tuesday evening after they had been invited to meet police officials over dinner on the northern outskirts of Yangon.
Gutteres said they were probably detained because they were reporting on the ""massive human tragedy"" in Rakhine state.
Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh say their exodus from the mainly Buddhist nation was triggered by a military offensive in response to Rohingya militant attacks on security forces.
The United Nations has branded the military's campaign ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" of the minority Rohingya.
POLICE HAVE 28 DAYS TO FILE A CASE
The Ministry of Information said the reporters ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"", and released a photo of the pair in handcuffs.
As of Friday evening, Reuters had not been formally contacted by officials about the detention of Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27.
A court official in the northern district of Yangon where they were detained, said that no paperwork had yet been filed relating to either journalist. The official said that usually cases are lodged 20-30 days after an arrest as suspects can be held in custody for up to 28 days without being charged.
Reuters President and Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of the journalists, saying in a statement on Wednesday that the global news organization was ""outraged by this blatant attack on press freedom"".
Britain has expressed ""grave concerns"" to the government of Myanmar over the arrest of the two journalists, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told reporters in London on Thursday.
""We are committed to freedom of speech and people's ability to report the facts and bring into the public domain what is happening in Rakhine state,"" he said.

MADRID (Reuters) - An election in Catalonia will fail to conclusively resolve a political crisis over an independence drive in the region, the final surveys before the Dec. 21 vote showed on Friday.
The ballot will result in a hung parliament, a Metroscopia poll showed, with parties favoring unity with Spain tipped to gain a maximum of 62 seats and pro-secession factions 63, both short of a majority in the region's 135-seat legislature. 
Spain's worst political crisis since its transition to democracy four decades ago erupted in October, when Madrid cracked down on an independence referendum it had declared illegal and took control of the wealthy northeastern region.
The standoff has bitterly divided society, led to a business exodus and tarnished Spain's rosy economic prospects, with the central bank on Friday blaming events in Catalonia for a cut in its growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019. 
Both the Metroscopia poll, published in El Pais, and a second survey in another newspaper, La Razon, predicted a record turnout for a Catalan election. 
But the vote looks likely to trigger weeks of haggling between different parties to try to form a government.
Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is campaigning from Brussels, where he moved shortly after he was fired by Madrid following a unilateral declaration of independence by the region. 
With Friday the last day polls were permitted before the ballot, the El Pais survey - which questioned 3,300 people in Catalonia between Dec. 4 and Dec. 13 - showed his party winning 22 seats.
Pro-unity party Ciudadanos, which has backed the minority central government of Mariano Rajoy's People's Party (PP) in parliamentary votes, will win most seats, closely followed by pro-independence ERC.
But at a maximum of 36 for Ciudadanos and 33 for ERC, both fall far short of the 68 seats needed for a majority. 
The survey's inconclusive split between pro-unity and pro-independence parties would leave the regional offshoot of left-wing party Podemos, which supports unity but wants a referendum on independence, as potential kingmaker.
Further muddying the waters, its leader Xavier Domenech favors a left-wing alliance across parties that both back and reject independence. 

The La Razon poll, which surveyed 1,000 Catalans also between Dec. 4 and Dec. 13, showed parties in favor of independence winning 66 seats and unity supporters 60, leaving the Catalan Podemos arm with nine.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a petition to disqualify cricket hero and opposition leader Imran Khan from parliament for not declaring assets, months after former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was removed by the court on a similar charge.
The ruling was hailed as a vindication by Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party but drew questions from Sharif's ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, which had filed the case.
The two parties will contest general elections in 2018, along with the Pakistan People's Party and several smaller parties.
""No dishonesty or omission can be attributed to (Khan). This petition has no merits and is hereby dismissed,"" Chief Justice Saqib Nisar told the court. 
Khan had led the legal drive that led to Sharif being disqualified in July over unreported income and the opening of a criminal corruption case against the former prime minister.
A lawmaker from Sharif's ruling party filed a separate complaint late last year alleging Khan and PTI secretary general Jahangir Tareen owned offshore companies and had not disclosed their assets.
While Khan was cleared on Friday, the Supreme Court disqualified Tareen.
""The respondent is declared not to be an honest person. He ceased to be member of the parliament. The respondent is disqualified,"" Nisar said of Tareen. 
PTI spokesman Naeem Ul Haq said the party was disappointed with the judgment on Tareen.
A senior PML-N leader, Miftah Ismial, told Reuters the party accepted Friday's Supreme Court decision as final. 
""However, not being a lawyer I don't follow how Imran Khan was not considered an owner of the offshore company ... given that the flat owned by it was only used by Imran Khan and the sale proceeds from the flat also went to Imran Khan.""

Sharif's supporters have alleged that some elements of Pakistan's military may have had a hand in the court's disqualification of the former prime minister.

The International Criminal Court said Lubanga was liable to pay the full amount to his young victims and their relatives, but added it recognized there was no way he would be able to afford it.
So it said part of the payment would be made by a court Trust Fund for Victims - and said the fund should ask for contributions from the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Lubanga was convicted in 2012 of committing war crimes during fighting in the northeastern, mineral-rich Ituri region from 2002-2003.
Aid agencies estimated that 5.4 million people died as a result of war and ensuing hardship in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1998 and 2007 - more than in any other conflict since World War II.
The court in The Hague said the payment would fund psychological support and job training programs for 427 victims identified during the proceedings.
It acknowledged that many more children had been conscripted as soldiers. ""Further evidence established the existence of hundreds or even thousands of additional victims affected by Mr Lubanga's crimes,"" the court said in a statement.
The judges awarded $8,000 per person, or $3.4 million for the 427 victims recognized so far, with an additional $6.6 million for potential future awards.
The court said it would monitor Lubanga's financial situation as he served out the remaining year of his sentence to see how much he might be able to contribute.
In March, the ICC ordered another Congolese convict, former militia leader Germain Katanga, to pay $1 million in damages to victims.

""We are deeply shocked and appalled at the mass execution,"" the spokeswoman, Liz Throssell, told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva, adding that the human rights office had ""huge concerns"" about Iraq's use of the death penalty and - not for the first time - urged the government to halt all executions.
""Given the flaws of the Iraqi justice system, it also appears extremely doubtful that strict due process and fair trial guarantees were followed in these 38 cases. This raises the prospect of irreversible miscarriages of justice and violations of the right to life.""
The 38 male prisoners were convicted by Iraq's judiciary for terrorism-related crimes, she said. She did not have information on their ages or nationalities.
In September, Iraq hanged 42 prisoners in a single day, and the U.N. has learned of 106 executions this year, Throssell said. Last year the Ministry of Justice announced 88 executions, but the U.N. believes the number may have been as high as 116.
The world body had repeatedly asked the Ministry of Justice for data about prisoners, sentencing and executions but no such information had been provided since 2015, she said.
Previously the United Nations had spoken of about 1,200 people being on death row, but it was now impossible to confirm that information, she said. 
The Justice Ministry said in a statement on Thursday that all those convicted were members of Islamic State. Officials have said all the appeal options available to the condemned had been exhausted, according to the statement.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union agreed on Friday to move talks forward with London on Britain's exit from the bloc as leaders warmed to the British premier, but there was little clarity on trade issues and Austria warned the Irish border issue remained a ""riddle"".
On the second day of a summit in Brussels, leaders said that ""sufficient progress"" was made after a deal on citizens' rights, the Irish border and Britain's outstanding payments, giving negotiators a mandate to move onto the main phase of talks.
""EU leaders agree to move on to the second phase of Brexit talks. Congratulations PM Theresa May,"" European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs EU summits, said on Twitter. 
Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said those talks would likely formally start in March.
A day after she suffered a defeat in parliament over her blueprint for quitting the EU, May won applause from her peers on Thursday evening. She said she was on course to deliver Brexit and urged them to speed up the talks to unravel more than 40 years of membership.
But several hours later as leaders reconvened, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Italy's Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni warned that the hardest decisions were still to come as Britain tries to extricate itself from rules agreed over years in the bloc.
Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern went further, saying even a primary school student could see that the ""first phase"" deal on the Irish border would come back to haunt the talks because it was impossible for Britain to leave the bloc's single market while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.
""There cannot be any border controls between Northern and southern Ireland, there cannot be border controls between Northern Ireland and the UK, but there can between UK and the EU,"" he said. 
""So our primary school students can see that there is a riddle to be solved.""
As May left to return to London -- she will not join the other 27 leaders for further discussions on Brexit and the euro zone -- she said she was eager to move on, once her peers give the formal green light to trade talks on Friday.
The EU is willing to start talks next month on a roughly two-year transition period to ease Britain out after March 2019, but has asked for more detail from London on what it wants before it will open trade negotiations from March of next year.
""TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE""
Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar cautioned that there were ""quite divergent opinions"" on how a new relationship and transition would look. EU officials are divided over whether Britain should continue to receive the full, unfettered economic benefits of EU membership during a transition after it leaves, even if it loses political representation in Brussels.
A British government official said the prime minister was approaching the next phase, which will discuss a transition period as well as the terms of the future trading relationship, ""with ambition and creativity"".
German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave her stamp of approval, but cautioned time was running out.
""We made clear that Theresa May has made an offer that should allow us to say that we have seen sufficient progress,"" she told reporters. ""Nevertheless, there are still a lot of problems to solve. And time is of the essence.""
Tusk will call May on Friday to update her.
May, weakened after losing her Conservative Party's majority in a June election, has so far carried her divided government and party with her as she negotiated the first phase of talks on how much Britain should pay to leave the EU, the border with Ireland and the status of EU citizens in Britain.
But the next, more decisive phase of the negotiations will further test her authority by exposing the deep rifts among her top team of ministers over what Britain should become after Brexit.

The ARA San Juan was delivered in 1985 and built by a unit of Thyssen AG, which merged with Krupp to form Thyssenkrupp in 1999.
""We have offered our support for the technical investigation into this tragedy and are in contact with the Argentinian navy in this respect,"" the spokesman said.
He said maintenance of the submarine was not conducted by Thyssenkrupp.
The submarine went missing on Nov. 15 with 44 crew members aboard in South Atlantic waters. The navy said on Nov. 27 that water that entered the submarine's snorkel caused its battery to short circuit before it went missing.
The tragedy underscored what some critics have described as the parlous state of Argentina's military, which has faced dwindling funding for years.
German magazine WirtschaftsWoche earlier reported that a delegation of the Argentinian Navy had traveled to Kiel in northern Germany to discuss questions about the submarine with Thyssenkrupp. It did not identify its sources.

Argentinian President Mauricio Macri has called for a ""serious and deep"" investigation into the incident.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO allies on Friday publicly raised concern about a Russian cruise missile system that the alliance says may break a Cold War-era pact banning such weapons, in a show of support for Washington.
The United States believes Russia is developing a ground-launched cruise missile system with a range that is prohibited by a 1987 treaty, which could give Russia the ability to launch a nuclear strike on Europe on short notice. 
""Allies have identified a Russian missile system that raises serious concerns,"" the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said in a statement. ""NATO urges Russia to address these concerns in a substantial and transparent way, and actively engage in a technical dialogue with the United States.""
In a separate statement, the U.S. envoy to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, said: ""Russia's behavior raises serious concerns.""
Russia has denied it is violating the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
U.S.-led NATO's concerns are likely to further strain relations between Moscow and the West that are already at a low over Russia's 2014 seizure of Crimea, Western sanctions on the Russian economy and U.S. accusations that Moscow used computer hackers to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Moscow denies that it interfered in the election.
The NATO statement follows a meeting between Russia and the United States in Geneva this week to mark the 30th anniversary of the treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union.
According to an April U.S. State Department report, Washington determined in 2016 that Russia was in violation of its treaty obligations ""not to possess, produce, or flight-test"" a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km (310-3,417 miles), ""or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles."" 
Last week, the State Department said it is reviewing military options, including new intermediate-range cruise missile systems, the first response by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to the U.S. charges.
The Russian foreign ministry said last week it was ready for talks with the United States to try to preserve the treaty and would comply with its obligations if the United States did.
In a statement marking the 30th anniversary of the IMF treaty last week, the Russian foreign ministry said Moscow considered ""the language of ultimatums"" and sanctions unacceptable.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Firefighters in California will be tested by vicious winds on Friday morning as they battle a huge wildfire that has claimed the life of one of their colleagues and torched more than 700 homes. 
Cory Iverson, 32, a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection engineer, was killed on Thursday while tackling the so-called Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.
""Cory Iverson ... made the ultimate sacrifice to save the lives of others,"" said Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean during a community meeting on Thursday night. 
Fire officials released little information about the circumstances surrounding Iverson's death. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that he perished in an accident near the community of Fillmore, where a mayday alert was sounded. 
Santa Ana winds and humidity in the single digits has helped stoke the blaze that has swept through dry vegetation since it erupted on Dec. 4 near a small private college in Ojai. It has since blackened more than 249,000 acres (about 390 square miles, or 1,000 sq km) and is now the fourth-largest wildfire on record in California since 1932. 
On Friday morning powerful winds are forecast which will subside during the day, the National Weather Service said. 
""Winds will weaken Friday, turn westerly early Saturday, then become offshore and gusty again late Saturday night through Sunday evening,"" the service said in an advisory. 
The wildfire remained a threat to some 18,000 homes and other structures in the communities of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, Summerland and Montecito along California's coastline, especially if hot, dry Santa Ana winds return.
The Thomas Fire, which was 35 percent contained as of Thursday evening, has burned 729 homes to the ground and damaged another 175. The blaze has displaced more than 94,000 people.
The fire and others to the south in San Diego and Los Angeles counties have disrupted life for millions of people over the last 11 days. 

They have caused schools to close for days, shut roads and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes and into shelters. The fires are also responsible for poor air quality throughout Southern California, forcing some commuters to wear protective face masks, local media reported.

In an interview late on Thursday, Hamburg mayor Olaf Scholz, who is the center-left party's deputy chair, said Germany had a responsibility to Europe to form a stable government and urged colleagues not to clutter negotiations with unhelpful red lines.
""Germany needs a stable government because it's the biggest country in the European Union,"" he said.
The SPD, bruised by its disastrous showing in September's national election, when voters deserted it after four years in coalition with Merkel, had originally planned to go into opposition.
But after Merkel failed to assemble an alternative three-way coalition, senior SPD leaders have concluded they have a responsibility to govern and are attempting to convince reluctant party members to give their consent.
The party's leadership was meeting on Friday morning to discuss an invitation from Merkel's conservative camp to enter coalition talks, with party leader Martin Schulz expected to give an answer in the early afternoon.
For Merkel, winning over the SPD is her only realistic chance of securing a fourth term in office, meaning many in the SPD hope to sell the about-face to members by implementing a raft of popular worker-friendly measures.
But while Scholz told public broadcaster NDR that the party needed to push signature themes like employment and education, it should avoid hampering negotiations by setting down red lines.
""I don't think much of red lines: they mean that instead of talking to each other, you're just sending each other messages. That's not negotiation,"" he said.
In some areas, notably migration policy, the SPD will struggle to achieve concessions. While the SPD wants to retain the right for successful asylum seekers to bring their families, Merkel's arch-conservative Bavarian allies, fearing defeat in regional elections next year, are equally adamant that it should be scrapped.
A poll for ARD television showed that 61 percent of voters would support a renewed ""grand coalition"" between the conservatives and the SPD.

Any agreement to help form a new government could fall short of a formal coalition. Many in the SPD advocate various forms of minority government or ad hoc governing contract would better preserve the SPD's identity among disillusioned core voters.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Swapping new cars for cheaper models, cutting back on pricy supermarket shopping and giving up holidays abroad, middle-class Egyptians are finding strategies to stay afloat after a currency reform a year ago sent their living costs soaring.
Egypt floated its pound in November 2016 as part of a $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan package, and the currency lost half its value, eroding spending power and pushing inflation to record highs over 30 percent this summer.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government has been praised by IMF and World Bank economists for reform progress and for measures to shield the poorest from the fallout. But middle-income Egyptians say it has been a year of cutbacks, cost saving and crisis management. 
Presidential elections are due early next year and Sisi is expected to seek another term. But some Egyptians are finding that their new economic reality is crowding out politics as they struggle to maintain standards.
Others are digging deep and insist that despite the pain of austerity, Sisi remains the only candidate to provide stability after the years of turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak.
Overcoming voter apathy may be a challenge if the former military commander decides to run when critics say he will face little competition after what rights groups describe as an unprecedented crackdown on opponents and dissidents. 
Low turnout was a worry in 2014, when Sisi won by a landslide, as a popular figure who had overthrown president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood after mass protests the previous year.
""The rise in prices changed things,"" said Ayman, a Cairo bookstore owner. ""We hoped for good things from President Sisi ... He is a good man and I voted for him, but we are not feeling the progress, all I care about is giving my son a good life, a good home.""
Economic reforms have come at a fast pace.
The IMF deal called for broad adjustments to Egypt's state subsidies to slash deficits as part of Sisi's promise to revive an economy hit hard by unrest, protests and militant attacks in the last six years.
Backed by the IMF and the World Bank, Sisi's government says the overhaul will lead to long-term growth and the return of foreign investment. Officials have adopted programs to provide the poor and vulnerable with cash and other protections. 
Still, fuel costs have doubled with two increases in subsidized prices. Electricity prices are up and a new tax helped push inflation to more than 30 percent in July. That has now eased to 25 percent and is expected to fall further soon. But it has been a crushing struggle for some.
Hisham Azz al Arab, chairman of Egypt's largest private bank CIB, said those on middle and upper incomes were the most affected by the economic reforms, but it would take time for their impact to balance out for those families.
""We saw that clearly in their behavior of spending, it started to change,"" he told CNBC. ""For the middle and upper class it is a matter of time before income and productivity start to catch up to pre-reform levels."" 
A 2016 World Bank survey found the middle class represented around 10 percent of the country's population of about 90 million just before the Arab Spring protests. Middle-class activists were among the leaders of the 2011 uprising. 
CUTBACKS, BARGAINS
For professionals like Karim, a Cairo small business owner, it was a stark adjustment. Monthly food bills went from 1,200 pounds ($67) to 3,200 pounds ($179). That meant for the first time bargain-hunting for food, giving up luxury goods, and using the car less to cut back on fuel spending.
It also meant paying employees more to keep them, while at the same time making sacrifices to keep his children in school.
""The middle class has only two options, fall into the lower class, which is hard for them to do, or get more enterprising,"" he said. ""Everyone is trying to show they are still in the middle class, people want to tell themselves that.""
For others, maintaining a middle-class lifestyle has meant dipping into savings and giving up restaurants or even turning to relatives for help with the cost of family holidays. 
""It's extinct,"" said Islam Askar, a contracting company owner, of the country's middle class. ""There isn't a household in Egypt that hasn't been hit by the decrease in the pound and the rise in the prices.""
Economists say middle-class erosion had been reflected in figures for car sales, the weakness in some consumer stocks and in outbound tourism.
For some, like Mahmoud Al-Abadaly, hunting for bargains among the crash-damaged vehicles at a second-hand car shop, politics comes second to cash considerations. A car normally worth 300,000 pounds ($17,000) can be fixed up and had for half that price, he said.
""When a car has been in an accident, its price drops,"" he said. ""Everyone is trying to do this now because they need to save."" 
But Egypt's inflation outlook is already improving a year after the float, falling to 26 percent in November. Finance Minister Amr el-Garhy said that would fall to around 14 percent by August next year.
What impact a year of austerity will have on Sisi's popularity is unclear. He has yet to announce his intentions, though supporters have already started a petition campaign for him to run for a second term. For his hardcore backers, it is time to rally behind him despite hard times.
""I will be for Sisi again for the presidency even with inflation, rising prices and the poor state of the economy,"" said Ali Abou Al-Saoud, a sales representative.
But some of the president's high-profile backers have turned against him, partly over the economy.
Turnout may be key for credibility, analysts say, as the government rebrands Egypt as a more stable bet for foreign investment after years of unrest. In 2014, turnout was about 47 percent, less than Sisi had called for.
At the time, Sisi was idolized by many, although his support base has since slipped, critics say. However, protests are now restricted by law and secular activists have been rounded up. Other Egyptians say political fatigue has set in.

""There is still a strong sense of wanting to maintain and enjoy the relative security,"" said Ziad Bahaa Eldin, a deputy former prime minister who now works as an economist. ""People are suffering from inflation but they want stability.""

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 05:06AM ET</span>",EU leaders clash over refugees,"By Gabriela Baczynska and Robert Muller
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Two years after the Mediterranean migrant crisis shook the European Union, a tentative effort by the bloc to patch up differences over refugee policy has stumbled, revealing enduring rifts among the bloc's leaders over the contentious question.
A candid discussion over a Brussels summit dinner that began on Thursday night and spilled into the wee hours of Friday was intended to clear the air and see if there was a way to reconcile opposing views on how to reform defunct asylum rules.
But leaders emerging from nearly three hours of talks made clear that while there was little of the angry passion of 2015, when a million people flooded into Greece and headed for Germany, the ""frank and sober"" exchanges failed to blunt sharp rifts pitting some eastern states against many of the rest.
""We have a lot of work to do,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. ""The positions have not changed.""
Divisions over how to share out relatively small numbers of refugees have poisoned relations in the EU, complicating efforts to present a united front in talks with London on Brexit and to agree an EU budget out to 2028.
New Polish and Czech leaders stuck to lines shared with Hungary and Slovakia that their ex-communist societies cannot accept significant immigration, especially of Muslims.
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis called the debate ""quite stormy"". But, he said, the four ex-communist eastern allies, known together as the Visegrad Four, would not let the majority impose obligatory refugee quotas on them.
Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni were among those who demanded that all countries take in a mandatory share of people requiring asylum, who have been concentrated on the Mediterranean coast, or after chaotic movements across Europe, in the richer northwest of the bloc.
""The discussion on migration in general was a step forward. But a hurdle remains. We were not able to overcome the resistance of the Visegrad countries that refuse to abide by the agreement on obligatory relocation,"" Gentiloni told reporters on arrival for the second day of the summit.
He added that no concessions could be made on this point and that a deal must be reached next year with the support of all states. 
German officials said Merkel has been critical of the summit chair, Donald Tusk, a former Polish premier, who in an letter to leaders earlier in the week, said that a controversial scheme of the European Commission - the EU's executive arm - to relocate refugees around the bloc according to mandatory quotas had failed.
That echoed the complaints of the eastern skeptics but it irritated many western states and the European Commission itself. 
Merkel said there was a broad appreciation for work on bolstering the bloc's common borders, which has sharply reduced the number of people arriving, notably through deals with Turkey and Balkan states to close off the migrant route through Greece.
But she said offers from the east of ""selective solidarity"" - the four central European states on Thursday offered Italy 35 million euros to help hold back African migrants in Libya - could not relieve EU members of a duty to help out their allies by taking in some of those refugees who do reach Europe.
""I made very clear that I am not satisfied with the fact that the rules we have are not working,"" she said. ""Solidarity cannot just apply externally, but must also be internal.""
One EU official, anxious to accentuate the positive in the discussions, said Tusk had succeeded in having an honest and open debate on the most contentious issues that would help EU leaders see where there was room for compromise.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he would not rule out ramming through mandatory relocation quotas by majority vote next year, something Tusk has been trying to avoid to prevent a repeat of the bitter rift a similar vote caused in 2015. 
A diplomat from a country in favor of compulsory quotas said there could be a move to vote if there was no consensus in sight by the time leaders discuss asylum reform in June.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen encouraged the United States and European Union on Friday to freeze the assets of Cambodian leaders abroad in response to his government's crackdown on the opposition and civil society.
Hun Sen, the strongman who has ruled Cambodia for more than three decades, has taken a strident anti-Western line ahead of a 2018 election and has dismissed donor criticism of the dissolution of the main opposition party.
The United States and European Union have suspended funding for next year's election and Washington has put visa curbs on some Cambodian leaders. There is no current proposal for asset freezes by either the United States or European Union, but some lawmakers have floated the idea.
""I encourage the European Union and United States to freeze the wealth of Cambodian leaders abroad,"" Hun Sen told a group of athletes in Phnom Penh, the capital.
Hun Sen said he has no money abroad and any actions by the EU and the U.S. would not hurt him.
The U.S. embassy made no comment. EU Ambassador George Edgar said on Friday there had been no decision on further measures by the bloc.
The Supreme Court dissolved the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) last month at the request of the government, on the grounds it was plotting to seize power.
Hun Sen accused Kem Sokha, the leader of the CNRP of a U.S.-backed anti-government plot. The opposition leader and the United States denied that.

China, Cambodia's largest aid donor, has leant its support to Hun Sen, saying it respects Cambodia's right to defend its national security.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia should introduce a law forcing religious leaders to report child abuse, including Catholic priests told of abuse in the confessional, said a report on Friday which detailed institutional abuse, particularly in the Catholic Church.
One the country's top catholics, Melbourne Archbishop Denis Hart, said such a law would undermine a central tenet of Catholicism, the sacredness of the confessional, and warned that any priest breaking the seal of confession would be excommunicated.
The 17-volume document from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse marks the end of one of the world's biggest inquiries into child abuse and leaves it to the government to decide whether to enact its recommendations.
The five-year investigation found ""multiple and persistent failings of institutions to keep children safe, the cultures of secrecy and cover-up, and the devastating affects child sexual abuse can have on an individual's life"", the commission said in a statement.
The report detailed tens of thousands of child victims, saying their abusers were ""not a case of a few rotten apples"".
""We will never know the true number,"" it read.
The inquiry spanned religious, government, educational and professional organisations but heard many accounts alleging abuse cover-ups in the Australian Catholic Church, including allegations of moving priests suspected of abuse between parishes to avoid detection.
Of survivors who reported abuse in religious institutions, more than 60 percent cited the Catholic Church, which demonstrated ""catastrophic failures of leadership"", particularly before the 1990s, the report said.
It said clergy told of child abuse in the confessional should be required by law to report it and called for the Catholic Church to make celibacy voluntary for clergy, adding that it contributed to child abuse.
""I would feel terribly conflicted, and I would try even harder to get that person outside confessional, but I cannot break the seal,"" Hart told reporters.
""The penalty for any priest breaking the seal is excommunication, being cast out of the church, so it's a real, serious, spiritual matter, and I want to observe the law of the land ... but as part of my identity as a priest, I have to observe the seal of the confession.""
A similar recommendation was made during Ireland's 2009 child abuse inquiry, leading to a mandatory reporting law in 2015. Some U.S. states have similar requirements.
The Australian report also called for a National Office for Child Safety and national child safety standards, child abuse reporting and record keeping, which would cover all institutions engaged in child-related work.
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the inquiry had ""exposed a national tragedy"" and that the government would consider the recommendations and respond in full next year.
Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher, said in a statement that he was ""appalled by the sinful and criminal activity of some clergy, religious and lay church-workers (and) ashamed of the failure to respond by some church leaders"".
The inquiry heard previously that the Australian Catholic Church paid A$276 million ($212 million) in compensation to thousands of child abuse victims since 1980.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Winter is bringing a frigid existence and an uncertain future for migrant workers in Beijing deprived of electricity and heating as they resist a month-long campaign to evict them from the city's urban villages.
A deadly fire in a hamlet of ramshackle dwellings on the capital's southern fringes last month prompted a fire safety blitz by the authorities, forcing thousands of the workers out of homes and businesses.
But not everyone has left, and a handful of holdouts are preparing for tough times as temperatures plunge below freezing.
""There's no electricity when we're coming home. We can't see where we're going,"" said Feng, a migrant worker hailing from the southwestern province of Sichuan, pointing to a pile of blankets.
Feng, who was willing to reveal only his surname, had been renting a room in a shared apartment block built and run by migrants in Picun, a village in northeast Beijing, until the authorities cut off their power and ordered everyone to leave.
""I sold my house in the northeast, there is nothing to go back to,"" said another worker, Wang Liping, who said she paid 200,000 yuan ($30,000) to buy part of the apartment block where migrants like Feng rent rooms for a few hundred yuan each month.
""I'd rather freeze to death than leave here,"" added Wang, who is refusing to leave despite efforts to remove her. 
The evictions have sparked unusually direct criticism from China's intellectuals, students and journalists, who say the government is unfairly targeting the vulnerable underclass.
""Originally it was just a fire, but they used the fire as an excuse to force people young and old onto the streets in the middle of the coldest days of winter,"" independent political commentator Zhang Lifan told Reuters.
But the city could not do without migrants, Cai Qi, the city's Communist Party chief and a close ally of President Xi Jinping, said during a visit to the migrants this week, in a bid to allay the fears.
The capital's need for cheap labor has attracted thousands of workers, even though they are denied official residency permits because of government curbs on internal migration.
Migrant enclaves have grown into full-fledged communities today, from clusters of shanty towns. Picun, one of the most developed, has its own literature society and houses numerous aspiring artists and musicians.
One young couple living by torchlight in their block said they were considering going to Tangshan, a steel-producing hub in their home province of Hebei, but after 10 years of living in Beijing, they would miss the lifestyle.

""To be honest, if it wasn't for all the migrants, Beijing wouldn't be any better than any other city,"" the woman, who is surnamed Xiang, told Reuters.

""On Sunday morning as we arrive we should be able to make an announcement of the top six and take nomination of the rest of the leadership. We need to take out this item from the conference agenda as quickly as possible,"" party spokesman Zizi Kodwa said.
The ANC holds an election this weekend to replace Zuma as party leader in a closely fought contest whose winner is likely to emerge as the nation's next president.
The front runners are Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a former trade union leader and one of South Africa's richest people, and Zuma's preferred candidate, his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former minister and chairwoman of the African Union Commission.
The top six lead the party's national executive committee which sets the tone for policy and the appointment of members of parliament. 
The structure includes the president, deputy and key positions of secretary general and treasurer.
In the last 18 months, the executive has been the scene of fierce factional battles as Zuma's leadership came under scrutiny, particularly after the most recent cabinet reshuffle in March that saw Pravin Gordhan fired as finance minister.

In August, Zuma narrowly survived an umpteenth attempt in parliament to force him from office after some members of his party voted with the opposition.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's presidential hopefuls ended their campaigns in downtown Santiago on Thursday ahead of an uncertain runoff election whose outcome will determine whether the world's top copper producer turns to the right or maintains its center-left track.
Voters on Sunday will choose between billionaire conservative Sebastian Pinera and center-left senator and journalist Alejandro Guillier. During the November first-round election, a surprise surge by harder leftists confounded pollsters, sent markets plummeting and set the stage for a tighter-than-expected runoff.
""Everything points to a narrow margin of victory,"" said Guillermo Holzmann, a professor at the University of Valparaiso. ""It's an unusual race in that it's been difficult to gauge the electorate.""
Both Pinera and Guillier would keep in place the longstanding free-market economic model in Latin America's most developed country. But candidates with more extreme views on both the right and left performed better than expected in November, leading both men to make concessions to try to win over voters whose first-round choice dropped out.
Uruguay former president Jose ""Pepe"" Mujica, a leftist icon in a Latin America that has largely turned to the political right, turned out to support Guillier.
""The conservative right has no future in Chile,"" Guillier told his fans. 
Pinera, 68, a former president and the market favorite, placed first with 36.6 percent of the vote in the first round. He has vowed to boost growth by cutting the corporate tax rate and scaling back outgoing President Michelle Bachelet's tax, labor and education reforms that Guillier has vowed to deepen. 
At Santiago's Caupolicán theater, he promised ""a new and better treatment of the middle class, older adults and children.""
The bearded Guillier, 64, from northern Chile, garnered 22.7 percent of the vote in November from backers hoping to preserve gains made in Bachelet's government for students, women and workers, measures such as lower university fees and laws empowering unions.
Guillier has courted leftists by proposing to overhaul the country's privatized pension system and rewrite the constitution. Pinera has sought to appeal to centrist voters by calling for free technical education for the poor and a public pension option.
Guillier narrowly edged out third place finisher Beatriz Sanchez of the leftist Frente Amplio. She received support from 20 percent of voters with promises to tax the ""super-rich"" to boost social spending and fight inequality.
Sanchez's 1.3 million voters are seen as pivotal in the upcoming election. Voting is voluntary in Chile, and abstention has run high in recent years.

""It comes down to how many people stay home, and particularly, how many people stay home on Guillier's side,"" said University of Chile professor Robert Funk.

Images from the scene showed the bus split in two, with a long line of emergency vehicles on an approach to the crossing.
Another 20 people were injured in the crash, 11 of them seriously, according to French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who traveled immediately to the scene. Most of the injured were schoolchildren aboard the bus, aged 13-17.
Philippe told reporters the authorities were focused on getting accurate information to families, a process ""made difficult by the question of identification of those who have died and some of the injured.""
A crisis coordination center has been set up at Millas town hall on Perpignan's western outskirts, about 850 kilometers (530 miles) from Paris. According to local media reports, the bus was transporting pupils from the town's Christian Bourquin college.
""All my thoughts (are with) the victims and their families,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter.
The causes of the crash are unknown, pending a full investigation, officials said. The bus and train drivers both survived and will be interviewed by police.
The train was carrying 25 passengers and traveling at 80 kmh, the regulatory speed for the section of track where the collision occurred, a spokeswoman for the national SNCF railway told Reuters. Three train passengers sustained relatively minor injuries, according to the interior ministry.
Witnesses had reported that the barriers of the crossing were down at the moment of impact, the SNCF spokeswoman said, adding that all such preliminary information was ""subject to confirmation"" by investigators.

France has suffered several serious rail accidents in recent decades. One of the deadliest was in 1988, when a commuter train heading into Paris' Gare de Lyon crashed into a stationary train, killing 56 people, after its brakes failed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While attention in Asia has been distracted by the North Korean nuclear crisis in the past year, China has continued to install high-frequency radar and other facilities that can be used for military purposes on its man-made islands in the South China Sea, a U.S. think tank said on Thursday.
Chinese activity has involved work on facilities covering 72 acres (29 hectares) of the Spratly and Paracel islands, territory contested with several other Asian nations, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. The report cited satellite images. 
The United States and its allies oppose China's building of artificial islands in the South China Sea and their militarization, given concerns Beijing plans to use them to deny access to strategic routes.
The report said that in the last several months China had constructed what appeared to be a new high-frequency radar array at the northern end of Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratlys.
Subi Reef had seen tunnels completed that were likely for ammunition storage and another radar antenna array and radar domes, the report said.
Construction on Mischief Reef included underground storage for ammunition and hangars, missile shelters and radar arrays.
Smaller-scale work had continued in the Paracel Islands, including a new helipad and wind turbines on Tree Island and two large radar towers on Triton Island.
It said the latter were especially important as waters around Triton had been the scene of recent incidents between China and Vietnam and multiple U.S. freedom-of-navigation operations, which the U.S. navy has used to assert what it sees as its right to free passage in international waters.
Woody Island, China’s military and administrative headquarters in the South China Sea, saw two first-time air deployments ""that hint at things to come at the three Spratly Island air bases farther south,"" the report said.
At the end of October, the Chinese military released images showing J-11B fighters at Woody Island for exercises, while on Nov. 15, AMTI spotted what appeared to be Y-8 transport planes, a type that can be configured for electronic surveillance.
The Pentagon has conducted several patrols near Chinese-held South China Sea territory this year, even as it has sought China's help in northeast Asia to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program.

On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reiterated a call for a “freeze” in China's island building and said it was unacceptable to continue their militarization.

Roy Moore, the conservative Christian Republican whose campaign was tainted by accusations that he pursued teenaged girls while in his 30s, made a second statement on Wednesday night in which he did not concede the election.
Jones, a former federal prosecutor, will be the first Democrat to hold a Senate seat in Alabama in a quarter-century, narrowing Republicans' majority in the Senate to 51 of 100 seats and potentially making it more difficult for them to pursue President Donald Trump's agenda.
With 99 percent of the vote counted, Jones had a lead of 1.5 percentage points over Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court Justice.
Alabama's secretary of state, a Republican, has said the remaining ballots from Tuesday's election were unlikely to shrink the victory to the half a percentage point margin required to trigger a recount.
Jones said in an interview with NBC that he was confident of the outcome.
""It's time to move on,"" he said. ""The people of Alabama have now spoken ... Let's get this behind us so the people of Alabama can get someone in there and start working for them.""
Asked whether Moore should concede, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters, ""I'm surprised. It sounds like it ... should have already taken place.""
Jones on Wednesday said he had received congratulatory phone calls from Trump, who had endorsed Moore, as well as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A round of Syria peace talks that ended on Thursday was a big missed opportunity but there may be more talks next month if ideas can be found to encourage President Bashar al-Assad's government to engage, U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura said.
He said neither side had actually ""sabotaged"" the latest talks by refusing to attend, but he laid most of the blame for the failure of the round at the feet of the government side. 
De Mistura voiced milder disappointment with the Syrian opposition, after they arrived in Geneva ruling out any future role for Assad. But he said that tough public stance had been tempered by a mature position in the closed-door discussions.
""The goal we had was to bring about real negotiations,"" de Mistura told a news conference. ""Let me be frank. We did not achieve, we did not achieve these negotiations. In other words, negotiations in reality did not take place.
""I would conclude by saying (it was) a big missed opportunity. A golden opportunity at the end of this year when in fact there is a clear indication by many sides that the military operations are coming to a close,"" he added.
De Mistura said he was leaving Geneva for consultations in New York with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, followed by a meeting with the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.
""I will probably need to come up with new ideas, parameters, about how to move the talks forward, particularly on constitution and elections,"" he said, adding that plans for a new round of Geneva talks in January depended on their outcome.
Civil war has ravaged Syria for more than six years.
CHARADE
Chief opposition negotiator Nasr Hariri said the international community needed to do more to persuade government negotiator Bashar al-Ja'afari to come to the table, warning that the talks were in ""great danger"".
""The international community needs to find a new approach, otherwise this stalemate will continue and unfortunately it will be at the expense of Syrians,"" he said.
One European diplomat said the talks had been a ""charade"" because of the government's behavior.
“Although the regime has presented itself here, that is all that it has done. I would go further: it’s not just a kind of disengagement that they’ve shown, it’s an extraordinary contempt,"" he said.
""I understand that a large amount of their time here was spent negotiating personal admin matters and expenses, rather than the substance of the talks.""
As he left the talks, Ja'afari accused the opposition, backed by Western countries and Saudi Arabia, of sabotaging the round.
Ja'afari said Damascus did not want the talks to fail but the opposition had put down a precondition last month by concluding a conference known as ""Riyadh 2"" with a declaration that Assad had no role in Syria's political transition.
De Mistura said the Damascus government had wanted him to insist that the opposition withdraw the statement.

""That was not possible or a logical approach because to me it sounded like a precondition. The government engaged me with only on (discussions about) terrorism. The truth is there is not one single subject they accepted except that one.""

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 04:14PM ET</span>","In first, U.S. presents its evidence of Iran weaponry from Yemen","By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday presented for the first time pieces of what it said were Iranian weapons supplied to the Iran-aligned Houthi militia in Yemen, describing it as conclusive evidence that Tehran was violating U.N. resolutions.
The arms included charred remnants of what the Pentagon said was an Iranian-made short-range ballistic missile fired from Yemen on Nov. 4 at King Khaled International Airport outside Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh, as well as a drone and an anti-tank weapon recovered in Yemen by the Saudis.
Iran has denied supplying the Houthis with such weaponry and on Thursday described the arms displayed as ""fabricated.""
The United States acknowledged it could not say precisely when the weapons were transferred to the Houthis, and, in some cases, could not say when they were used. There was no immediate way to independently verify where the weapons were made or employed.
But U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley expressed confidence the transfers could be blamed on Tehran. 
""These are Iranian made, these are Iranian sent, and these were Iranian given,"" Haley told a news conference at a military hangar at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, just outside Washington. 
All of the recovered weapons were provided to the United States by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the Pentagon said. Saudi-led forces, which back the Yemeni government, have been fighting the Houthis in Yemen's more than two-year-long civil war.
The unprecedented presentation - which Haley said involved intelligence that had to be declassified - is part of President Donald Trump's new Iran policy, which promises a harder line toward Tehran. That would appear to include a new diplomatic initiative. 
""You will see us build a coalition to really push back against Iran and what they're doing,"" Haley said, standing in front of what she said were the remnants of the Nov. 4 missile.
Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who view Tehran as a threat, seized upon the U.S. presentation in calls on Thursday for international action.
Still, it was unclear whether the new evidence would be enough to win support for sanctions on Iran from some U.N. Security Council members, like Russia or China.
British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said he didn’t think ""there’s anything that could convince some of my council colleagues"" to take U.N. action against Iran. Still, he said ""we're going to be pursuing with them nonetheless.""
Under a U.N. resolution that enshrines the Iran nuclear deal with world powers, Tehran is prohibited from supplying, selling or transferring weapons outside the country unless approved by the U.N. Security Council. A separate U.N. resolution on Yemen bans the supply of weapons to Houthi leaders.
Iran rejected the U.S. accusations as unfounded and Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, on Twitter, drew a parallel to assertions by then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations in 2003 about U.S. intelligence on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion.
IRAN LINKS
The Pentagon offered a detailed explanation of all of the reasons why it believed the arms came from Iran, noting what it said were Iranian corporate logos on arms fragments and the unique nature of the designs of Iranian weaponry.
That included the designs of short-range ""Qiam"" ballistic missiles. The Pentagon said it had obtained fragments of two Qiam missiles, one fired on Nov. 4 against the airport and another fired on July 22.
The Pentagon cited corporate logos it said matched those of Iranian defense firms on jet vanes that help steer the missile's engine and on the circuit board helping drive its guidance system. It also said the missile's unique valve-design was only found in Iran.
Iran, it said, appeared to have tried to cover up the shipment by disassembling the missile for transport, given crude welding used to stitch it back together.
""The point of this entire display is that only Iran makes this missile. They have not given it to anybody else,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Laura Seal said. ""We haven't seen this in the hands of anyone else except Iran and the Houthis.""
A Dec. 8 U.N. report monitoring Iran sanctions found that the July 22 and Nov. 4 missiles fired at Saudi Arabia appeared to have a ""common origin,"" but U.N. officials were still investigating the claims that Iran supplied them.
A separate Nov. 24 U.N. report monitoring Yemen sanctions said four missiles fired into Saudi Arabia this year appear to have been designed and manufactured by Iran, but as yet there was ""no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.""
The U.N. Iran and Yemen sanctions monitors ""saw a majority"" of the weaponry displayed by Haley, said a spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations. 
The Pentagon put on display other weapons with designs it said were unique to Iran's defense industry. It pointed to a key component of a Toophan anti-tank guided missile and a small drone aircraft, both of which it said were recovered in Yemen by the Saudis.
It also showed components of a drone-like navigation system like the one the Pentagon says was used by the Houthis to ram an exploding boat into a Saudi frigate on Jan. 30. The United Arab Emirates seized the system in late 2016 in the Red Sea, the Pentagon said.

The U.N. Security Council is due to be briefed publicly on the latest U.N. report monitoring Iran sanctions on Tuesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The online video's message was clear: Supporters of Islamic State who could not travel overseas to join the militant group should carry out attacks wherever they were in the United States or Europe.
Bangladeshi immigrant Akayed Ullah, 27, followed those instructions on Monday when he tried to set off a homemade bomb in one of New York's busiest commuter hubs, in an attack that illustrates the difficulty of stopping ""do-it-yourself"" attacks by radicals who act alone.
While harder to stop than attacks coordinated by multiple people - whose communications may be more easily monitored by law enforcement or intelligence agencies - they also tend to do less damage. Ullah was the person most seriously wounded when his bomb ignited but did not detonate in an underground passageway linking the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the Times Square (NYSE:SQ) subway statin; three others sustained lesser injuries.
""They tend to be less organized and less deadly,"" said Seamus Hughes, a former adviser at the U.S. government's National Counterterrorism Center. ""That's because you're dealing with more, for lack of a better word, amateurs.""
The do-it-yourself style of attack is on the rise in the United States, according to research by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, where Hughes is deputy director.
The United States has seen 19 attacks perpetrated by Islamic State-inspired people since the group declared a ""caliphate"" in June 2014 after capturing broad swaths of Iraq and Syria. Of those, 12 occurred in 2016 and 2017, almost twice as many as in the two preceding years.
""You're going to see continued numbers of plots and, unfortunately, attacks,"" Hughes said.
Ullah began immersing himself in Islamic State propaganda as early as 2014, three years after he arrived in the United States as a legal immigrant, according to federal prosecutors who charged him with terrorism offenses. They said in court papers that Ullah's computer records showed that he viewed ISIS videos urging supporters of the group to launch attacks where they lived.
Experts said the success of Western allies in retaking most of Islamic State's territory could inspire more attacks out of anger or vengeance.
""No group has been as successful at drawing people into its perverse ideology as ISIS,"" Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray said in congressional testimony last week. ""Through the internet, terrorists overseas now have access into our local communities to target and recruit our citizens.""
National security analysts generally divide such perpetrators into three broad categories.
Some attackers act at the direction of a group, like the Islamic State-backed militants who carried out coordinated attacks in Paris in 2015, killing 130; others have some limited contact with an organization but act largely on their own. A third type has no communication with a group but engage in violence after being radicalized by online propaganda.
It is easier for trained, battle-hardened ISIS fighters to travel from the Middle East to Europe than for them to reach the United States. That helps explain why U.S. attacks have largely been the work of ""self-made"" terrorists, said Brandeis University professor and radicalization expert Jytte Klausen.
""In these recent cases, we've seen very few indications that there was any type of direct training,"" Klausen said.
Self-directed perpetrators are the hardest for investigators to identify. Their ranks appear to include Ullah, as well as two other recent New York attackers: Ahmad Rahimi, the man who injured 30 with a homemade bomb in Manhattan in September 2016, and Sayfullo Saipov, the Uzbek immigrant accused of killing eight by speeding a rental truck down a bike lane in October.
While that type of attacker typically is less destructive, there are important exceptions. Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols killed 168 people, and Omar Mateen gunned down 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando last year.
""A single individual or two can still create a lot of damage,"" said Max Abrahms, a professor at Northeastern University who studies terrorism. ""But they're not able to wage sustained terrorist campaigns.""

The Gulf Clan, also known as the Usuga Clan and the Autodefensas Gaitanistas, has been accused of operating drug trafficking routes in partnership with Mexican cartels and taking part in illegal gold mining. It announced a ceasefire on Wednesday and has said its members were willing to turn themselves in.
Santos, speaking at a event about the eradication of coca crops in Antioquia province, hailed the ceasefire and said a surrender of the group would be welcome, but added that security forces will not halt actions against the group. 
""If this organization wants to surrender to justice it's very welcome and we're working with the justice minister to put together some decrees and there's a law in Congress to facilitate the collective surrender of the Gulf Clan that we are classing as urgent,"" Santos said.
The president has said the government will not negotiate with the group because members are criminals and not politically motivated rebels like the now-demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) or National Liberation Army (ELN).
Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas, speaking at the same event, said operations against the Clan will continue.
""The fact that they won't shoot is good news but if they continue to commit crimes they will be targeted,"" he said. ""We are not going to suspend operations or lower our guard.""

Left-winger Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who had a 12-point lead in one recent poll, wants to overhaul Mexico's approach to the economy, security and education, vowing more support for the poorest but without new taxes or higher debt levels.
Lopez Obrador, or AMLO as he is affectionately known, proposed a cabinet made up of an equal number of men and women. He is familiar with the work of Urzua, who served as AMLO'S finance minister from 2000 to 2003 when he presided over the government of Mexico City.
Urzua, an author, researcher and university professor, earned a PhD and Master in Economics from the University of Wisconsin and a degree in Mathematics from Mexico's Tecnologico de Monterrey. He is also a poet who writes about inequality.
A win by 64-year-old self-declared nationalist AMLO next year could reverse a Latin American trend towards right-leaning governments and set the stage for friction with U.S. President Donald Trump over his anti-migrant language and policies.

""This will be the team that will support me in the fulfillment of the actions that we will carry out for the transformation of the country,"" grey-haired AMLO said as he named eight women and eight men to his cabinet.

The sanctions, which target Russia's energy, defense and financial sectors, would otherwise expire at the end of January 2018. 
Donald Tusk, the chairman of EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, said the 28 were ""united on roll-over of economic sanctions on Russia.""
Moscow says it will never return Crimea, which it annexed in 2014 in a move that has not been recognized internationally.
The West says Russia has also been providing a lifeline to separatists in eastern Ukraine, where a conflict with Kiev troops has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014.

Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman, said the F-22 aircraft were providing air cover to partnered ground forces when the Russian jets came into airspace near Albu Kamal. The incident lasted for about 40 minutes and coalition officials contacted the Russians through a communication link to avoid a miscalculation. 
At one point, Pahon said, a Russian jet came close enough that one of the F-22 aircraft had to ""aggressively maneuver to avoid a midair collision.""
U.S. officials have said that as the battlefield against Islamic State shrinks, they expect Russian and U.S. aircraft to be in closer proximity.
Since early November, Russian jets have flown east of the Euphrates river in the deconflicted airspace about six to eight times a day, according to the U.S. military.
""It's become increasingly tough for our pilots to discern whether Russian pilots' actions are deliberate or if these are just honest mistakes,"" Pahon said.
""The Coalition's greatest concern is that we could shoot down a Russian aircraft because its actions are seen as a threat to our air or ground forces,"" he added.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said the U.S. military will fight Islamic State in Syria ""as long as they want to fight,"" describing a longer-term role for U.S. troops after the insurgents lose all of the territory they control.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's lower house on Thursday suspended a vote on President Mauricio Macri's pension reform plan, after the debate became a shouting match and protesters and police clashed violently outside Congress.
The bill, which passed the Senate last month, is crucial for Macri's efforts to cut the fiscal deficit but has drawn criticism from opposition politicians and labor unions, who say it will hurt retirees and welfare recipients.
Before Thursday's scheduled vote, the country's top union called a general strike for the following day. Demonstrators threw stones at metal barriers set up outside parliament, and security forces responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. 
The incident showed strong obstacles remain for Macri's pro-business agenda, which includes tax and labor reforms. While his ""Let's Change"" coalition swept October's legislative midterm vote, he lacks a majority in either chamber.
""We will not back down,"" opposition lawmaker Mirta Tundis told local television. ""It is outrageous that year after year, those who have less are affected most.""
The pension reform would change the formula used to calculate benefits. Payments would adjust every quarter based on inflation, rather than the current system of twice-yearly adjustments linked to wage rises and tax revenue.
Economists say the current formula means benefits go up in line with past inflation. Left unchanged, that could harm Macri's efforts to cut the fiscal deficit.
Under the new formula, benefits would increase by 5 percentage points above inflation, according to Cabinet Chief Marcos Pena. The plan would take effect at a time of lower inflation expectations, hence slowing the pace of pension benefit increases.
""This formula guarantees the sustainability of the system and that retirees will not lose to inflation,"" Macri-allied lawmaker Luciano Laspina told reporters.
Macri is aiming to cut the fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product next year from 4.2 percent this year, and to reduce inflation to 8-12 percent from above 20 percent this year.

""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia welcomes the U.N. report that asserted that the hostile Iranian intervention and its support for the terrorist Houthi militia with advanced and dangerous missile capabilities threatens the security and stability of the kingdom and the region,"" SPA said.
The agency said Saudi Arabia also welcomed the U.S. position announced by Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who presented pieces of what she said were Iranian weapons supplied to the Iran-aligned Houthi and described them as conclusive evidence that Tehran was violating U.N. resolutions.
SPA said the evidence, which emerged after the Houthis fired a missile toward the capital Riyadh last month, was proof of violations of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 2216 and 2231 on Yemen, and 1559 and 1701, which relate to Lebanon.
""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia demands the international community to take immediate measures to implement the aforementioned Security Council resolutions and to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its hostile actions,"" it said.
Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of smuggling missiles to the Houthis through ports used to deliver humanitarian aid and food shipments to Yemen. It said the evidence means the United Nations should tighten its inspection and verification regime for vessels allowed into Yemen.

In a statement, the coalition said the Maghawir al Thawra, the rebel group, and the coalition detected a convoy near at-Tanf, near the Syrian border with Jordan and Iraq, early on Wednesday and carried out an operation ""to prevent their further incursion.""
""Despite the presence of Russian-backed, pro-Syrian regime forces in the area, Daesh still finds ways to move freely through regime lines and pose a threat,"" Brigadier General Jonathan Braga, the director of operation for the coalition, said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. 
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the convoy had come within the established 55 km (34 miles) around the Tanf base, where U.S. special forces operate.
Another U.S. official said more than a dozen militants had been captured by the rebel group. 
The statement added that Islamic State militants have been moving freely through areas controlled by pro-Syrian regime forces.

Two websites - one detailing the accomplishments of President Uhuru Kenyatta and the other attacking opposition leader Raila Odinga - share an IP address with Texas-based Harris Media LLC, according to Privacy International's report.
Privacy International said the company used data analytics to target audiences using information gleaned from social media accounts in Kenya, where 1,200 people were killed in inter-ethnic violence after a disputed election a decade ago.
Kenyans vote largely along ethnic lines, and candidates appeal to voters on that basis.
""This raises serious concerns about the role and responsibility of companies working for political campaigns in Kenya, in which tribal affiliation and region of origin are particularly politically sensitive data, and volatile 'coded language' was widely deployed,"" Privacy International said.
Social media in the East African nation were flooded with ads linking to the ""Real Raila"" and ""Uhuru for Us"" sites in the weeks before the Aug. 26 vote.
An official for Kenyatta's Jubilee Party denied the report, saying it handled all its campaigns locally. The company, U.S.-based Harris Media LLC, did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the report.
But the allegations by Privacy International recalled how, for the first time in Kenya's history, social media including fake news, hashtags and trolls dominated the public discussion and stoked tensions in the run-up to the hotly contested presidential election on Aug. 26.
Kenyans went to the polls amid concerns over the credibility of the vote and bitter online hate campaigns stoking ethnic tensions, leading to fears of a return to the bloodshed that followed the disputed 2007 vote.
The August vote was eventually nullified by the Supreme Court over irregularities. Kenyatta won an October re-run that Odinga boycotted. But violence marred the extended election season, and more than 70 people were killed, mainly by police.
Raphael Tuju, Jubilee Party secretary general, denied the party had hired or used Harris Media.
""We have heard a lot of those kinds of accusations. We were running a campaign from the Jubilee Headquarters, and we employed local communications experts, led by our own team, and that is it for us,"" he told Reuters by phone.
Days before the August vote, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) released a tool enabling Kenyan users to evaluate content displayed prominently when they log on. The tool contained tips on how to spot fake news, including checking web addresses and looking for other reports on the topic.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 01:35PM ET</span>",'Bad news for our enemies': EU launches defense pact,"By Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union nations, now unfettered by Britain's decision to quit, achieved a 70-year-old ambition on Thursday to integrate their defenses, launching a pact between 25 EU governments to fund, develop and deploy armed forces together.
European Council President Donald Tusk deemed the move ""bad news for our enemies"".
First blocked by the French parliament in the 1950s and later by Britain, which feared creation of an EU army, the pact aims to end the squandering of billions of euros by splintered defense policies.
It is also aimed at lowering Europe's heavy reliance on the United States.
""More than half a century ago, an ambitious vision of the European Defence Community was created but what was missing was the unity and courage to put it into practice,"" Tusk, who chairs EU summits, said of the failed 1950s attempt. 
""The dream was at odds with reality. Today this dream becomes reality,"" he said in a speech in front of EU leaders and military personnel from each of the 25 countries involved. 
Denmark, which has an opt out from EU defense matters, and Malta, were the only EU countries not to sign up, along with Brexiting Britain.
French President Emmanuel Macron, whose election victory in May gave new impetus to efforts to revive defense cooperation after Britons voted in 2016 to leave the bloc, hailed ""concrete progress."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the pact would make the EU more agile abroad and would support NATO.
The pact, called Permanent Structured Cooperation, or PESCO, is meant as a show of unity and a tangible step in EU integration, diplomats said, particularly after Britain's decision to leave.
Caught off guard by Russia's Crimea annexation in 2014 and facing threats ranging from state-sponsored computer hackers to militant attacks, EU governments say the pact is justified by EU surveys showing most citizens want the bloc to provide security.
EU governments proved unable to act as a group in the 1990s Balkan wars and relied on U.S.-led NATO to stop the bloodshed on their doorstep.
In Libya in 2011, a Franco-British air campaign ran out of munitions and equipment and was again forced to turn to the United States, in what is considered an enduring embarrassment for the EU, a major economic power. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's criticism of low European defense spending, a host of divisions on foreign policy, and Trump's warnings to allies that they could no longer rely on the United States if they did not pay up, have also played a role.
""It's sad that we needed Donald Trump to give us a boost, but whatever, it is the right outcome,"" said former German foreign minister Joschka Fischer, who as minister backed NATO's intervention in Kosovo in 1999 but opposed the 2003 Iraq war.
BRITISH INTEREST
Unlike past attempts at European defense integration, NATO backs the project, but NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who attended part of the summit, warned against duplication. Twenty-two EU countries are also members of NATO.
""There has to be coherence between the capability developments of NATO and the European Union. We cannot risk ending up with conflicting requirements from the EU and from NATO to the same nations,"" he told reporters.
""Forces and capabilities developed under EU initiatives also have to be available for NATO because we only have one set of forces,"" Stoltenberg said. 
Issues remain about financing future EU missions. An EU defense fund, with money from the European Commission for the first time, still needs to be approved, although a pilot phase is already underway for defense research.
In one irony noted by EU diplomats, British Prime Minister Theresa May, who attended the summit, was left seeking a way into the project now that it was an actuality. 
A 1998 Anglo-French EU defense accord is considered the genesis of Thursday's agreement. In a possible compromise on PESCO, Britain may be able to join in later on, but only on an exceptional basis if it provides funds and expertise.
Britain and France, both nuclear-armed, are Europe's two biggest military powers, and in 2010 set up a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force to cement long-standing ties in defense.

""We do face a number of threats across Europe,"" May said. ""I'm very clear that although the British people took a sovereign decision to leave the EU, that does not mean that we were going to be leaving our responsibilities in terms of European security,"" she told reporters.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 12:50PM ET</span>",Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitary chief seeks to put troops under national army,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The commander of Iraq's biggest Shi'ite Muslim paramilitary group told its fighters on Thursday to take their orders from the national military and cut their ties with the group's political wing.
Hadi al-Amiri, leader of the Iran-backed Badr Organisation, also called on the group's fighters to withdraw from the cities under their control.
The move paves the way for Amiri to stand in parliamentary elections on May 12.
Participation in the election by members of Iraq's Iran-backed Shi'ite paramilitaries, collectively known as Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), has been hotly debated in Iraq. PMF members cannot run for office unless they formally resign their posts.
Amiri is the second commander to issue such a call in as many days. He called on those in charge of his armed wing to cut their ties with the group's political party, which holds 22 seats in the Iraqi parliament.
""I also call on all my brothers, the commanders of various formations, to clear cities of all signs of militarisation,"" he said in a speech.
Badr, which says it is loyal to both Iraq and Iran, is the biggest group within the PMF, which fought alongside security forces against Islamic State.
Sunni Muslims and Kurds have called on Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who declared victory over Islamic State last week, to disarm the PMF, which they say are responsible for widespread abuses.
The PMF were officially made part of the Iraqi security establishment by law and formally answer to Abadi in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
Abadi has said the state should have a monopoly on the legitimate use of arms.
Qais al-Khazali, head of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, announced a similar move on Wednesday when he said he would place his fighters under Abadi's command. The fighters and their political wing were now separate entities, he said.
Powerful Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr set out conditions on Monday for his followers to give the government the weapons they used to fight Islamic State.

Iran-backed Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba, which has about 10,000 fighters and is one of the most important militias in Iraq, said last month it would give any heavy weapons it had to the military once Islamic State was defeated.

Last month, the U.S. military said it did not kill any civilians when it accompanied Somali forces on a deadly raid in the village of Bariire.
At the time, it described the dead as ""enemy combatants"" and that they were members of al Shabaab, the al-Qaeda linked insurgent group. 
However, eyewitnesses have told Reuters that 10 civilians were killed and that the military had been drawn into a local clan conflict.
In a statement, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) said it had referred the incident to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service after media reports alleged misconduct by U.S. personnel to ""ensure a full exploration of the facts given the gravity of the allegations.""
""AFRICOM takes all allegations of misconduct seriously and will leverage the expertise of appropriate organizations to ensure such allegations are fully and impartially investigated,"" the statement said. 
The United States has stepped up operations in Somalia this year after President Donald Trump loosened restrictions on the military's operations in March. A Navy SEAL was killed in Somalia in May, the first U.S. combat casualty there since Somali militiamen shot down U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in 1993.
The United States has also ramped up its use of air strikes, conducting twice as many strikes this year as last year.
Somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991. It now has a weak, internationally-backed government, supported by African peacekeepers.

Photo essay: http://reut.rs/2Ap07MI
Torokman was on assignment near the Jewish settlement of Beit El, close to the Palestinian hub city of Ramallah, on Wednesday where protests were underway against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Hundreds turned out, as they had done for days following Trump's announcement. Some burnt tires, others hurled stones at Israeli troops, all oblivious to the surprise military move that awaited them.
""The undercover personnel were posing as Palestinian protesters and were standing behind the stone-throwers,"" said Torokman, who has covered clashes in the region for nearly two decades.
""All of a sudden, they started to fire their pistols into the air and throw sound grenades at the same time.""
The din of the grenades and guns caused panic among the protesters.
Torokman saw eight Israeli personnel, wearing masks fashioned from Arab headdresses or the Palestinian flag, leap into action and detain protesters.
He kept photographing, thereby capturing the moment as an undercover agent grappling with a protester swung round, briefly pointing his gun directly at Torokman.
""He shouted at me and told me to go away,"" said Torokman, who described the atmosphere as terrifying.
""I heeded his order for my own safety and I quickly moved away.""
The remaining protesters fled as uniformed Israeli troops moved in. Torokman took photographs from a safer location. The incident was over in less than five minutes.
It was the third time Torokman saw at first hand the work of the undercover commandos, known in Hebrew as ""Mistaravim"" or ""in Arab disguise"", but this was by far the most scary.

""The level of risk was the highest this time as the personnel were aiming their weapons at me,"" he said.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 11:30AM ET</span>","Arms supplied by U.S., Saudi ended up with Islamic State, researchers say","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Arms provided by the United States and Saudi Arabia to Syrian opposition groups frequently ended up in the hands of Islamic State, an arms monitoring group that analyzed weapons found on the battlefield said on Thursday.
Conflict Armament Research (CAR) said most Islamic State weapons were looted from the Iraqi and Syrian armies. But some were originally provided by other countries, mainly the United States and Saudi Arabia, to Syrian opposition groups fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
""These findings are a stark reminder of the contradictions inherent in supplying weapons into armed conflicts in which multiple competing and overlapping non-state armed groups operate,"" the group said in a 200-page report.
CAR documented at least 12 cases of weaponry purchased by the United States that ended up in Islamic State's hands, either captured on the battlefield or acquired through shifting alliances within the Syrian opposition. Most of these items later ended up in Iraq, the monitor said.
In one case, it took only two months for Islamic State fighters in Iraq to get their hands on a guided anti-tank missile the United States bought from a European country and supplied to a Syrian opposition group.
All of the items were made in EU states, and in most cases the United States broke contractual clauses prohibiting retransfers by giving the weapons to armed groups in Syria.
""Evidence collected by CAR indicates that the United States has repeatedly diverted EU-manufactured weapons and ammunition to opposition forces in the Syrian conflict. IS forces rapidly gained custody of significant quantities of this materiel.""
CAR said it similarly traced numerous items used by Islamic State back to exports from Bulgaria to Saudi Arabia, and that these were also subject to non-retransfer clauses that should have barred them from being supplied to Syrian warring parties.
Around 90 percent of weapons and ammunition used by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq were made in China, Russia, and Eastern European countries, CAR said, with China and Russia alone accounting for over 50 percent.
""These findings support widespread assumptions that the group initially captured much of its military materiel from Iraqi and Syrian government forces,"" the report said.
Russian-made weapons used by Islamic State in Syria outnumbered Chinese ones, ""presumably reflecting Russian supplies to the Syrian regime,"" CAR said.
Russia is allied with Assad and launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015, its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in his favor.
On Saturday Iraq declared final victory over Islamic State, which seized more than a third of the country's territory in 2014. Last week Russia declared victory over the group in Syria.
CAR reported last year that Islamic State had been making its own weapons on a scale and with sophistication matching national military forces, and that it had standardized production across its realm.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 11:10AM ET</span>",Planned changes to criminal code in Romania seen as weakening anti-graft fight,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - A fresh row over judicial changes in Romania broke out on Thursday with prosecutors and the political opposition warning that proposed amendments to the criminal code would weaken the fight against corruption and other crimes.
A parliamentary commission will start next Monday to debate the changes which have been introduced by the ruling Social Democrats. Under the proposals, prosecutors will have to tell potential suspects they are about to be investigated and restrict the types of evidence prosecutors can use to prove cases.
Temporary 30-day arrest warrants, much used by police and prosecutors in corruption cases, might be scrapped.
Prosecutors may also be restricted from drawing on wiretaps, street camera footage and digital evidence. They could also be forbidden from publicly disclosing the names of suspects until their cases effectively go to trial.
Another proposed change would have witnesses give testimony in the presence of the accused - something which could prove to be an ordeal for a victim of human trafficking, for example.
Romania's anti-corruption prosecution unit (DNA) has sent 72 deputies and senators to trial since 2006 alongside cabinet ministers, a sitting Prime Minister and hundreds of mayors and other public officials. 
Transparency International ranks Romania among the European Union's most corrupt states though Brussels, which has Romania's justice system under special monitoring, has praised magistrates for their efforts to curb graft.
Prosecutors said the changes, if they went through, would seriously hinder the fight for law and order.
""Approving these changes will limit prosecutors' ability to carry out their activities as well as exercising their constitutional role of representing society's general interest and defending the rule of law and citizens' rights,"" the prosecutor general's office said in a statement.
""These changes could have a devastating impact on criminal investigations because they eliminate the indispensable legal instruments needed to investigate,"" the DNA said in a statement.
While the Social Democrats have said the changes are needed to bring legislation in line with an EU directive, the Commission has criticized the proposed overhaul.
The Social Democrats have already used their solid majority to approve a judicial overhaul in the lower house that threatens to put the justice system under political control. The senate, which has the final say, is expected to approve the bills next week.
The proposed reforms have been criticized by the European Commission, the U.S. State Department, thousands of magistrates and centrist President Klaus Iohannis. 
Thousands of Romanians staged protests against them in recent weeks but the coalition has so far shrugged them off.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Senate passed into law on Thursday a bill allowing severely ill people to refuse treatment that would prolong their lives.
The bill passed 180 votes to 71 in the face of opposition from right wing parties. It allows all adults to prepare a document to express their preferences on how to be treated if they lose the faculty to choose or express their choice.
Some 10 years after legislation on patients' rights to choose what care to receive at the end of their lives was first proposed, the lower house of parliament approved the bill in April.
This will be one of the government's last acts before parliament is dissolved ahead of elections next year.
The ruling Democratic Party (PD) had pledged another civil rights measure, making it easier for the children of migrants to obtain citizenship, but this law now looks unlikely to pass.
""Parliament's decision makes everyone takes a step forward in terms of civilization for the country and of human dignity,"" Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, who is not a party leader and is unlikely to run in the election, said in Brussels. 
By Italian parliamentary standards, the bill's passage was relatively swift thanks to an agreement between two of the biggest parties - the PD and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement - to vote it through.
The deal was a rare example of cooperation between the two parties, which are usually bitter enemies.
The anti-immigrant Northern League, which vies with former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party for the most votes on the right, fiercely fought the bill. Forza Italia also opposed it, though less strongly. 
""This law is a precursor to euthanasia,"" said Northern League senator Gian Marco Centinaio.
Final discussion of the bill coincided with the high-profile case of a disc jockey paralyzed and blinded in a road accident who went to Switzerland to be helped to die.
A Radical party member and right-to-die activist who accompanied Fabiano Antoniani, known as DJ Fabo, to the Swiss clinic, is currently on trial in Milan for aiding suicide.
In the living wills, which can be recorded on video if the patient cannot write, food and water can be refused as well as medical treatment.
However if a patient refuses treatment, the doctor is still obliged to reduce their suffering, and can also use sedation. The law also gives doctors scope to object on conscientious or religious grounds.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling group will sweep an election in his home state of Gujarat, surveys showed on Thursday, shaking off the most serious challenge yet from a combined opposition. 
The election for a new state assembly in Gujarat is seen as a litmus test for Modi ahead of a national election in 2019. Voting closed on Thursday. 
A win would help him dismiss critics who said the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's support base was eroding after last year's shock move to ban high-value currency notes in the fight against graft, and poor implementation of a national sales tax this year hit businesses.
The Congress party led by Rahul Gandhi and teaming up with regional politicians has run a tough campaign aiming to weaken Modi in his home base and rouse public discontent over lack of jobs and a softening economy. 
But three separate television exit polls at the close of the final round of voting on Thursday showed the BJP winning more than 100 seats in the 182-member state house, well clear of the half-way mark of 92 required to rule. 
Congress, the main opposition party, will win 70-74 seats, the polls showed, better than in the past but not enough to oust the BJP from power. 
Another exit poll, conducted by a Today's Chanakya group, gave the BJP a two-thirds victory. 
The actual votes will be counted on Monday and exit polls and other surveys have often gone wrong in India, where millions vote. The Congress party said it was too quick to call the election based on exit polls. 
The BJP has ruled Gujarat since 1998, with Modi as its chief minister for more than a decade before he became prime minister three years ago. 
Modi has won praise for transforming the coastal state into an economic powerhouse and deploying business-friendly policies to lure foreign investors.
To ensure his party's prospects, Modi led from the front to campaign in the state and addressed dozens of public rallies, performed rituals and even waved from a sea plane on the last day of his campaign trail.
On Thursday, Modi cast his ballot in Gujarat's Ahmedabad city and then hit the streets again, showing off his inked finger as he walked, surrounded by hundreds of supporters. 

In separate exit surveys released for state polls held in Himachal Pradesh state also showed Modi's party emerging as a winner.

1447,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 09:40AM ET</span>",Indian tycoon's extradition hearing told of abuse of UK 'Chennai Six',"LONDON (Reuters) - One of the ""Chennai Six"" group of ex-British soldiers jailed in India was dragged to a psychiatric hospital and force-fed anti-psychotic tablets during his time in jail, a London court considering whether to extradite Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya was told on Thursday.
Mallya, 61, is wanted in India on fraud and money-laundering charges relating to his defunct  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines and Indian authorities want to recover about $1.4 billion they say Kingfisher owes. 
The businessman, co-owner of the Force India Formula One team, who moved to Britain in March last year, says the case him is politically motivated and is fighting extradition on several grounds including a claim that jail conditions in India are incompatible with British human rights laws.
As part of this, his lawyer quizzed prison conditions expert Dr Alan Mitchell about a conversation he had had two days ago with one of the former British soldiers who had been held for four years in India on weapons-smuggling charges after the vessel they were working on strayed into Indian waters in 2013.
The soldiers were released from jail in Chennai, eastern India, after a successful appeal and began arriving back in Britain last week.
The ex-soldier, named only as ""A"", said he had been grabbed by 15 prison guards and prisoners and taken to a psychiatric hospital because he had been ""excessively walking"" around the prison, Mitchell told London's Westminster Magistrate Court.
""While in the psychiatric hospital, he stated he was tied up, gagged, he was beaten and he was forcibly injected. In addition he described being force-fed anti-psychotic tablets that he managed to spit out,"" Mitchell said.
Asked by Mallya's lawyer Clare Montgomery about assurances given over the treatment of Mallya, who she said had diabetes, coronary artery disease and sleep apnoea, Mitchell said the British government had likewise told parliament that the Chennai Six were being well looked after.
""Despite assurances having been given in parliament, 'A' was extremely disappointed by what effect the involvement of the High Commission and the UK government had on conditions in which he and his fellow prisoners were held,"" he said.
Mark Summers, the lawyer representing the Indian government, said Mitchell's evidence involved an uncorroborated account which could be used as a ""platform for a compensation claim against the UK government"".

He said conditions in Chennai would bear no relation to the jail in Mumbai where Mallya would be held.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. travelers will hit the roads, rails and skies this Christmas holiday in their largest numbers on record, lured by cheap plane tickets and a growing economy, the nation's largest motor advocacy group said on Thursday.
Roughly 107.3 million Americans will journey 50 miles (80 km) or more from home during Dec. 23 through Jan. 1, a 3.1 percent increase from a year earlier and the most ever recorded, AAA said in a report.
That would be the sixth consecutive record high for the holiday season, the Heathrow, Florida-based organization said.
“More expensive gas prices are not swaying holiday revelers to stay home,” AAA Senior Vice President Bill Sutherland said. ""We’ve seen the strong economy and growing consumer confidence fuel holiday travel all year long.”
The largest share of travel, roughly 90.7 percent, will be on U.S. roads. Energy traders watch this activity closely because it accounts for 10 percent of global oil demand.
U.S. motor trips will rise to 97.3 million for this holiday season, the seventh consecutive annual increase, AAA said.
The group expects air travel to grow by 4.1 percent to 6.4 million trips, the highest since 2004 as passengers take advantage of lower ticket prices.
Air travel now accounts now for 5.9 percent of all travel, following four consecutive years of share increases, AAA said.
For 2017, motorists are on pace to break the record for most vehicle miles driven on U.S. roads, helping spur potential record demand for gasoline.
U.S. gasoline demand and vehicle miles traveled both set records in 2016. [nL1N1OC196]
Gas prices jumped more than 10 percent after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, peaking on Sept. 8 at an average of $2.67 a gallon. Prices were at $2.45 a gallon on Thursday, up about 9 percent from a year earlier, AAA said.

ROME (Reuters) - The leader of Italy's far-right Northern League said on Thursday he was suspending contacts with his main political ally, former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, because of a disagreement over how tough courts should be on murderers and rapists.
The public fight over law and order delighted the rightists' opponents just as campaigning picked up ahead of a national election that look certain to be held in early March.
""I always said the (right) as a coalition didn't exist,"" said Luigi Di Maio, the prime ministerial candidate of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. ""We are getting ever closer to government.""
The right bloc, which includes Berlusconi's Forza Italia! (Go Italy), is ahead in the polls, with 5-Star in second place. Pollsters predict no-one will win an outright majority, raising the specter of political instability in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
Northern League leader Matteo Salvini has regularly sparred with Berlusconi, but his anger bubbled over this week after Forza Italia lawmakers voted against efforts to prevent courts from offering sentence reductions for murder and rape.
""We are receiving hundreds of calls and emails from men and women angry and disappointed by Forza Italia's astonishing decision to protect rapists and murderers,"" Salvini was quoted as saying by AGI news agency.
""As far as we are concerned ... we are suspending all our contacts and discussions with Forza Italia and Berlusconi until there is an official clarification,"" he added.
Berlusconi promised to talk to Salvini shortly, saying he was unsure why his parliamentarians had spurned the reform.
Support for the right bloc has risen steadily in recent months with Berlusconi returning to frontline politics after years of sex and finance scandals.
However he has failed to paper over divisions between himself and Salvini who has pushed the Northern League to the far-right of European politics, aligning himself with Marine Le Pen's National Front in France.
Whereas the right is committed to running together in the forthcoming election, the ruling centre-left Democratic Party (PD) has split from its traditional leftist allies, who have refused to form any electoral alliance.
""(The right) will argue before, during and, above all, after the election, but on the day itself they will pretend to be united to scrape together a few more seats,"" PD leader Matteo Renzi wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Thursday. 

""This is pure hypocrisy because everyone knows the truth but pretends not to see.""

1451,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 09:17AM ET</span>","Putin says U.S. gripped by fabricated spymania, praises Trump","By Vladimir Soldatkin and Jack Stubbs
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday the United States was in the grip of a fabricated spymania whipped up by President Donald Trump's opponents but he thought battered U.S.-Russia relations would recover one day.
Putin, who said he was on first name terms with Trump, also praised the U.S. president for what he said were his achievements.
""I'm not the one to evaluate the president's work. That needs to be done by the voters, the American people,"" Putin told his annual news conference in Moscow, in answer to a question. 
""(But) we are objectively seeing that there have been some major accomplishments, even in the short time he has been working. Look at how the markets have grown. This speaks to investors' trust in the American economy.""
Trump took office in January, saying he was keen to mend ties which had fallen to a post-Cold War low. But since then, ties have soured further after U.S. intelligence officials said Russia meddled in the presidential election, something Moscow denies. 
Congress is also investigating alleged contacts between the Trump election campaign and Russian officials amid allegations that Moscow may have tried to exercise improper influence.
Putin dismissed those allegations and the idea of a Russia connection as ""fabricated."" He shrugged off accusations that Russia's ambassador to the United States had done something wrong by having contacts with Trump campaign figures saying it was ""international practice"" for diplomats to try to have contacts with all candidates in an election. 
""What did someone see that was egregious about this? Why does it all have to take on some tint of spymania?,"" said Putin. 
""This is all invented by people who oppose Trump to give his work an illegitimate character. The people who do this are dealing a blow to the state of (U.S.) domestic politics,"" he added, saying the accusations were disrespectful to U.S. voters.
Moscow understood that Trump's scope for improving ties with Russia was limited by the scandal, said Putin, but remained keen to try to improve relations. 
""COMMON THREATS""
Washington and Moscow had many common interests, he said, citing the Middle East, North Korea, international terrorism, environmental problems and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
""You have to ask him (Trump) if he has such a desire (to improve ties) ... or whether it has disappeared. I hope that he has such a desire,"" said Putin.
""We will normalize our relations and will develop (them) and overcome common threats.""
However, Putin lashed out at U.S. policy on North Korea, warning a U.S. strike there would have catastrophic consequences.
In one of the most dramatic moments of the news conference, Ksenia Sobchak, a TV personality who has said she plans to run against Putin in a presidential election in March, asked him about what she said was the lack of political competition.
Putin, 65, has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since the end of 1999.
In particular, Sobchak asked about the case of opposition leader Alexei Navalny who looks unlikely to be allowed to run in the election due to what Navalny says is a trumped up criminal case.
Putin, who polls suggest will be comfortably re-elected, warned that candidates like Navalny would destabilize Russia and usher in chaos if elected.
""Do you want attempted coups d'etat? We've lived through all that. Do you really want to go back to all that? I am sure that the overwhelming majority of Russian citizens do not want this.""
Putin said the authorities were not afraid of genuine political competition and promised it would exist.
Navalny, commenting on social media, said Putin's response showed that barring him from taking part in next year's presidential election was ""a political decision.""
""It's like he's saying we're in power and we've decided that it (Navalny running) is a bad idea,"" Navalny said.
Putin disclosed he planned to run as an independent candidate and garner support from more than one party, in a sign the former KGB officer may be keen to strengthen his image as a ""father of the nation"" rather than as a party political figure. 
Putin named as priority issues nurturing a high-tech economy, improving infrastructure, healthcare, education and productivity and increasing people's real incomes.

He coughed his way through the first part of the news conference at times, and misread a placard held up by a journalist which he incorrectly thought said ""Bye Bye Putin,"" an error he quipped was due to age affecting his eyesight.

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 09:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. suspends aid to Somalia's battered military over graft,"By Katharine Houreld
NAIROBI (Reuters) - The United States is suspending food and fuel aid for most of Somalia's armed forces over corruption concerns, a blow to the military as African peacekeepers start to withdraw this month.
African Union (AU) troops landed in Mogadishu a decade ago to fight al Shabaab Islamist militants and Somali forces are supposed to eventually take over their duties.
But the United States, which also funds the 22,000-strong peacekeeping force, has grown frustrated that successive governments have failed to build a viable national army.
Diplomats worry that without strong Somali forces, al Shabaab could be reinvigorated, destabilize the region and offer a safe haven to other al Qaeda-linked militants or Islamic State fighters.
The U.S. suspension of aid came after the Somali military repeatedly failed to account for food and fuel, according to private correspondence between the U.S. and Somali governments seen by Reuters.
""During recent discussions between the United States and the Federal Government of Somalia, both sides agreed that the Somali National Army had failed to meet the standards for accountability for U.S. assistance,"" a State Department official told Reuters last week, on condition of anonymity. 
""We are adjusting U.S. assistance to SNA units, with the exception of units receiving some form of mentorship, to ensure that U.S. assistance is being used effectively and for its intended purpose,"" the official said.
The U.S. suspension comes at a sensitive time. The AU force - with troops from Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda - is scheduled to leave by 2020. The first 1,000 soldiers will go by the end of 2017.
The State Department official said Washington would continue to support small, Somali special forces units mentored by U.S. personnel and would work with the Somali government to agree criteria that could restore support to other units.
""It is true that some concerns have been raised on how support was utilized and distributed. The federal government is working to address these,"" Somali Minister of Defence Mohamed Mursal told Reuters.
WHERE'S THE AID?
Documents sent from the U.S. Mission to Somalia to the Somali government show U.S. officials are increasingly frustrated that the military is unable to account for its aid.
The documents paint a stark picture of a military hollowed out by corruption, unable to feed, pay or arm its soldiers - despite hundreds of millions of dollars of support.
Between May and June, a team of U.S. and Somali officials visited nine army bases to assess whether the men were receiving food the United States provides for 5,000 soldiers.
""We did not find the expected large quantities of food at any location ... there was no evidence of consumption (except at two bases),"" the U.S. team wrote to the Somali government.
    At one base, less than a fifth of the soldiers listed by Somali commanders were present. The best-staffed base had 160 soldiers out of 550. Only 60 had weapons.
""Many appeared to be wearing brand new uniforms. This implied they were assembled merely to improve appearances,"" the letter, seen by Reuters, said.
An ongoing assessment of the Somali military this year by the Somali government, African Union and United Nations drew similar conclusions. 
The joint report seen by Reuters said many soldiers lacked guns, uniforms, food, vehicles or tents. Troops relied on support from AU forces or local militias to survive.
""The SNA is a fragile force with extremely weak command and control,"" the report said. ""They are incapable of conducting effective operations or sustaining themselves.""
Most units don't have radios, leaving soldiers to rely on runners to get help when mobile networks go down, the report said. Troops lacked paper to write reports, toilets, boots and medical equipment such as tourniquets. Many slept under trees. 
SNA units were at 62 percent of their authorized strength on average. Only 70 percent of them had weapons, the report said.
Although the report was deeply critical, diplomats praised the government for trying to quantify the scope of the problem. 
""The government deserves massive praise for doing it and being willing to talk about it,"" Michael Keating, the U.N.'s top official in Somalia, told Reuters.
CASH PAYMENTS SUSPENDED
The United States also suspended a program paying soldiers $100 monthly stipends in June after the federal government refused to share responsibility for receiving the payments with regional forces fighting al Shabaab.
Washington has spent $66 million on stipends over the past seven years but has halted the program several times, concerned the money was not going to frontline soldiers.
One Somali document seen by Reuters showed members of a 259-strong ceremonial brass band were receiving stipends this year meant for soldiers fighting militants.
The State Department's watchdog said in a report published in October there were insufficient checks on the program and U.S. stipends could fund forces that commit abuses - or even support insurgents. 
Officially, Somalia's military is 26,000 strong, but the payroll is stuffed with ghost soldiers, pensioners and the dead, whose families may be receiving their payments, diplomats say. 
Intermittent payments from the government have forced many active soldiers to sell their weapons, ammunition or seek other work - practices the U.S. stipends were designed to curb.
Washington has whittled down the number of troops it pays to 8,000 from over 10,000 but there is still no reliable payroll, said a Mogadishu-based security expert. 
Defence Minister Mursal said the United Nations is creating a biometric database and plans to help the Somali government make cash payments directly to soldiers via mobile phones. 
The new government will also set up a separate system for widows, orphans, and the wounded so the payroll would adequately represent military strength, he said.
    
UNDER ATTACK
The weakness of Somali forces has deadly consequences. The insurgency is striking with ever larger and more deadly attacks in the capital Mogadishu and major towns.
A truck bomb killed more than 500 people in October and a suicide bomber killed at least 18 at a police academy on Thursday.
Yusuf, a 35-year-old Somali soldier stationed near the Indian Ocean port of Kismayu, knows what it's like to depend on local militias and AU forces to stay alive.
On Sept. 26, insurgents attacked his base at Bula Gadud, killing 15 colleagues and wounding scores more before the local Jubaland militia and AU peacekeepers saved them. 
""We lost several key members in that battle especially my close friend,"" he told Reuters. ""We tried to retreat ... after using all the ammunition we had."" 
A senior Somali security source said when the attack happened, the battalion of more than 1,000 soldiers had only been issued 300 guns. 
Defence Minister Mursal said the Somali troops at Bulagadud have since been sent more weapons.
Somalia's national security plan calls for a military of 18,000 soldiers, funded by the central government and operating country-wide. 
Getting there will be hard. Security experts say the military is dominated by a powerful clan, the Hawiye, which would be reluctant to lose control of the lucrative security assistance revenue stream. 
Many regional governments within Somalia already see the Hawiye-dominated federal forces as rivals rather than allies.
The government's ability to push reforms depends on balancing demands from federal member states, lawmakers, clan leaders and international partners, the U.N.'s Keating said.
""It's going to take a long time and its going to run into massive clan resistance,"" he said. ""Some clans are very dominant in the security forces.""
Somalia's partners also need to get serious and coordinate better, said Matt Bryden of the think-tank Sahan Research.
According to Sahan, donors - including the EU, AU, Turkey and Uganda - have trained more than 80,000 Somali soldiers since 2004. Bryden said records are so poor it was not clear if many had taken multiple courses, or just quit afterwards. 

""It's like sand through your fingers – where are they all?""

Temer was due to swear in Congressman Carlos Marun as his political affairs minister, who will be charged with drumming up support for an unpopular overhaul of the costly social security system, his key measure to bring Brazil's budget deficit under control.
The president was also due to meet leaders of Congress' two chambers to discuss whether the proposal has enough support to go to a vote or if it should wait until February, after the year-end recess.
Romero Jucá, the government's chief whip in the Senate, stunned Temer's administration on Wednesday by declaring that the ruling coalition had agreed a postponement until next year would be necessary to allow time to secure votes needed for the bill's approval.
Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles, who wants the legislation enacted as soon as possible to help balance government accounts, said there was no such agreement and urged lawmakers to vote by next week, the last before Congress packs up for Christmas.
Marun told reporters the administration had not given up and was still trying for a vote next week, but said Temer's cabinet was already considering the need to delay until 2018. 
The bill would require Brazilians to work longer before retiring and cut back generous pensions for public-sector employees. Lawmakers will be more reluctant to back the austerity measure in 2018, an election year.
Investors fear that a failure to streamline social security could weaken Brazil's currency and stock market, while boosting interest rates and possibly fueling new credit rating downgrades for the nation next year.
Temer warned on Wednesday that the economy would suffer if the pension bill does not pass. But he had to interrupt a flurry of meetings to rally support for it and fly to Sao Paulo for surgery for a narrowing of his urethra.

His office said Wednesday's surgery was successful and that he needed 48 hours to recover, remaining in the hospital until Friday.

BEIJING (Reuters) - War must not be allowed to break out on the Korean peninsula and the issue must be resolved through talks, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Thursday, while U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of the danger of ""sleepwalking"" into conflict.
Xi made his comments to visiting South Korean President Moon Jae-in just days after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered to begin direct talks with North Korea without pre-conditions.
But the White House said on Wednesday that no negotiations could be held until North Korea improved its behavior. The White House has declined to say whether President Donald Trump, who has taken a tougher rhetorical line toward North Korea, approved Tillerson's overture.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tillerson's offer of direct contacts with North Korea was ""a very good signal"", while warning that a U.S. strike on the North would have catastrophic consequences.
North Korea tested its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile on Nov. 29, which it said could put all of the United States within range, in defiance of international pressure and U.N. sanctions.
The United States has said all options were on the table in dealing with North Korea, including military action. 
While South Korea and China share the goal of getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and stop testing increasingly sophisticated long-range missiles, the two have not seen eye-to-eye on how to achieve this.
Meeting in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Xi told Moon that the goal of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula must be stuck to, and war and chaos cannot be allowed, Chinese state media said.
""The peninsula issue must, in the end, be resolved via dialogue and consultation,"" Xi was cited as saying.
China and South Korea have an important shared interest in maintaining peace, and China was willing to work with South Korea to promote talks and support North and South to improve relations, Xi said.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency said Xi and Moon agreed war on the peninsula would not be tolerated and they would cooperate in applying sanctions and pressure on North Korea.
The apparently warm tone of their talks followed nearly a year of tense relations between the two countries.
'DRAMATIC CIRCUMSTANCES'
China has been furious about the deployment of the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, saying its powerful radar can see far into China and will do nothing to ease tension with North Korea.
China and South Korea agreed in October to normalize exchanges and move past the dispute, which froze trade and business exchanges.
Xi reiterated China's position on THAAD and said he hoped South Korea would continue to ""appropriately handle"" the issue.
Guterres, speaking to reporters in Tokyo after meeting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said Security Council resolutions on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs must be fully implemented by Pyongyang and other countries.
""Security Council resolutions must be fully implemented, first of all by North Korea, but by all other countries whose role is crucial,"" Guterres said.
He said he expected a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday would deliver a strong expression of unity and the need for diplomacy to resolve the issue.
""The worst possible thing that could happen is for us all to sleepwalk into a war.""
Japan says now is the time to keep up pressure on North Korea, not start talks on its missile and nuclear programs. 
China and Russia, however, have welcomed Tillerson's overture.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said a U.S. strike on North Korea by the United States would have catastrophic consequences and he hoped to work with Washington eventually to resolve the crisis on the Korean peninsula.
Russia does not accept North Korea's nuclear status, Putin told a news conference. But he also said some U.S. actions had provoked North Korea.
""We believe the two sides should now stop aggravating the situation,"" Putin said.
North Korea justifies its weapons programs as necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.
The North's state news agency KCNA said Trump was taking a big step towards nuclear war in seeking a naval blockade and North Korea would take ""merciless self-defense"" measures if the United States tried to impose one.
North Korea would regard a naval blockade as ""an act of war"" and a ""wanton violation"" of its sovereignty and dignity, the agency cited a foreign ministry spokesman as saying, adding that North Korea was a responsible nuclear power.

White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said in September that even military options short of a preventative strike, such as a naval blockade meant to enforce sanctions, carried risks of military escalation.

The four suspects, aged between 18 and 21, are accused of being members of the Islamic State group, prosecutors and police said in a statement.
Three are believed to be in Syria: two traveled from Berlin via Istanbul to Islamic State-held territory in Syria in November 2016 and a third is accused of receiving military training in Syria. The fourth is believed to have helped the other three travel there.
Prosecutors did not say if any arrests were made in the raids, mounted by some 130 officers, including special forces, who confiscated electronic devices.

1458,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 08:40AM ET</span>","Broke South Sudan hike fees, blocks aid despite appeal for cash","By Maggie Fick
NAIROBI (Reuters) - South Sudan is hiking fees for humanitarians and blocking them from reaching hungry families, even as the oil-rich country appeals for nearly 2 billion dollars to help avert starvation amid a civil war, five aid groups told Reuters.
The government and the United Nations announced on Wednesday that South Sudan needs $1.7 billion in aid next year to help 6 million people -- half its population -- cope with the effects of war, hunger and economic decline.
But aid groups said bureaucracy, violence and rocketing government fees were stopping their work, despite a promise from President Salva Kiir to allow unhindered access after the United States threatened to pull support to the government in October.
All the aid workers spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of expulsion from the country. 
Alain Noudehou, the U.N.'s top humanitarian official in the country, said the increased fees are a major concern.
"" (It) will take away from the resources we have to address the crisis,"" Noudehou, humanitarian coordinator for the U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), said on Wednesday. 
Juba announced plans in March to charge each foreign aid worker $10,000 per annual permit but later dropped them. It revised the fees steeply upwards last month, however, requiring some foreign aid workers to pay $4,000 for a permit -- 16 times the old rate. 
At least two aid groups have paid, they told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
Humanitarian Affairs Minister Hussein Mar Nyout said on Wednesday he had received many complaints over the new fees and restrictions on travel for some aid workers. 
""This is not in the spirit of the president and we are going to implement the order of the president,"" he said in response to questions at a news conference. 
About one-third of South Sudan's 12 million population have fled their homes since the civil war began in 2013, two years after it won independence from Sudan. The United Nations describes the violence as ethnic cleansing. Earlier this year, pockets of the country plunged briefly into famine. 
The economy has nosedived, there is hyperinflation, and the government is unable to pay civil servants and soldiers because oil production has collapsed and official corruption is rampant. 
The confusion over permits delays aid, organizations said. 
""Nobody understands who is giving directives and who is supposed to implement,"" said the head of one international aid group in South Sudan. He said customs have seized his organization's IT equipment, despite an import tax waiver for aid groups.
Last week, a team of doctors said they were denied permission to travel outside the capital because they had not received work permits they had paid for. 
Another aid group said it is unable to bring in foreign medical staff to complete a government-approved project because authorities said even a consultant visiting South Sudan for a week had to pay $4,000 for a permit that takes months to obtain.
""The first issue is the inherent absurdity and impracticality of the rules,"" said an employee of the aid group. ""The second is that laws are being tried inconsistently by four government agencies that are at loggerheads.""
South Sudan expelled the Norwegian Refugee Council's country director last year, while some 28 aid workers have been killed this year, with nine shot dead in November alone, according to the United Nations. 
UNMISS staff are exempt from the work permit requirement but the government has forced some contractors to pay, in violation of an agreement with the U.N., an UNMISS spokeswoman said. 
Juba is not honoring a similar treaty exempting aid agencies receiving U.S. funding, a Western diplomat said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The new prime ministers of Poland and the Czech Republic vowed not to give any ground on the divisive issue of hosting refugees as they arrived in Brussels on Thursday for their first summit of European Union leaders.
More than two years after a massive influx of refugees and migrants from the Middle East and Africa created deep divisions in the EU, members are still feuding over how to share the burden of caring for asylum seekers.
The row pits frontline countries Italy and Greece, and rich destination countries like Germany, against four ex-communist states on the EU's eastern edge - Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia - that have refused to welcome refugees.
Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki and the Czech Republic's Andrej Babis, who both took office this month and said they wanted good and pragmatic ties with the EU, made clear that they would maintain the hard line of their predecessors on migration.
""It is worth investing considerable amounts of money in helping refugees in (regions) they are fleeing from. The help on the ground there is much more effective,"" said Morawiecki, explaining Warsaw would do that instead of accepting refugees.
The four eastern prime ministers offered 35 million euros to Italy on Thursday to support EU-backed migration projects in Libya aimed at curbing immigration to Europe. [L8N1OB30J]
Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, arriving at the summit, welcomed the financial contribution but said the four still needed to accept refugees.
""I think it was a very important decision,"" he said of the money pulled together by the four easterners. ""Differences, however, remain. We will continue to insist that a commitment on the relocation of refugees is needed.""
Two years after the biggest influx of refugees and migrants into Europe since World War Two, an EU deal with Turkey has shut the main eastern Mediterranean route through Greece and across the Balkans used by more than 1 million people in 2015.
The biggest remaining route is from Libya across the Mediterranean to Italy. Hundreds of thousands have been making the trip each year and thousands have died at sea. New efforts to curb smuggling from Libya's coast have reduced the numbers in recent months, but human rights groups say thousands of African migrants are now stuck in squalid conditions in Libyan camps.
The southern EU countries where most migrants first arrive, and the wealthier northern countries where many seek asylum, want all EU states to accept at least some refugees. The ex-communist eastern states say this amounts to bullying them to help solve political problems for their wealthier neighbors.
All EU leaders will discuss the issue over dinner in Brussels on Thursday, though no decisions are expected, with a French source stressing the controversy would take much more time to untangle. [L8N1OD360]. 
The dispute reopened this week when Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who now chairs the summits, came out against obligatory relocation quotas, ruffling feathers in many EU states and the bloc's executive Commission.
""Divisions on migration...are accompanied by emotions which make it hard to find common ground. We should work even more intensively to keep our unity,"" Tusk said ahead of the summit.
But his intervention upset Italy, Germany and other proponents of the quotas, who warn they could force the waverers to accept refugees in a majority vote if no compromise is found by June.
""It won't happen,"" Babis told reporters ahead of the summit, highlighting that any attempt to impose ""nonsensical"" quotas in a majority vote would only widen the divisions in the EU.

Slovakia's Robert Fico also said unanimity must prevail in the EU, especially on such thorny issues.

Kurz, who is just 31, led the People's Party (OVP) to victory in a parliamentary election on Oct. 15, taking a hard line on immigration that often overlapped with that of the anti-Islam Freedom Party (FPO), which came third.
The FPO has backed away from calling for Austria to follow Britain in holding a referendum on leaving the European Union. It now says it is pro-European but critical of the bloc, and wants to prevent further political integration.
""It was important to the president, and to me, that the new government have a pro-European orientation. From my point of view, that has been secured,"" Kurz told reporters after meeting President Alexander Van der Bellen, adding that he was confident of a deal before Christmas.
Points already agreed include moving some Foreign Ministry departments in charge of European affairs to the chancellor's office, which Kurz will head, said a person close to the coalition talks.
Items still being discussed include the extent to which it will be made easier to call referendums. Banning referendums on withdrawing from the EU has been agreed on, two people familiar with the talks said. 

The deal will also ensure support for EU sanctions against Russia, one added, to guard against the FPO's pro-Russian stance. Ministerial appointments have yet to be decided but the Foreign, Defence and Interior Ministries are set to come under the FPO's control, that source said.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - A Kosovo prosecutor withdrew his bid on Thursday to extradite a Turkish citizen accused by Turkey of being part of a group linked to a failed coup there in 2016, saying Ankara had not provided enough evidence to back the case.
Ugur Toksoy was arrested in October at the request of prosecutors in the Turkish region of Hatay, on charges of working for an NGO in Kosovo linked to U.S.-based cleric Fetullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of masterminding a failed coup attempt in 2016. The Hatay prosecutors said Toksoy had participated in the attempted coup.
Gulen has denied any involvement in the attempted coup.
The Kosovo prosecutor told the judge in withdrawing his case that he had asked the Turkish embassy to provide more evidence but had not received any. He said he could start the case again if Turkey sends more evidence.
""Justice in Kosovo has won with this verdict because there was no evidence for extradition,"" Toksoy's lawyer Adem Vokshi said after the session was over. ""If Turkey had proof about him, they would have sent it by now.""
Toksoy is one of two Kosovo-based Turks named on a Turkish wanted list of 11 people issued by the public prosecutor in Hatay province bordering Syria and seen by Reuters. The others are listed as living in Austria, Thailand, Mauritania, Romania and Lithuania.
Gulen-linked schools and foundations have been facing funding problems and closing in the Balkans and elsewhere.
Kosovo has refused to close Gulen schools on its soil, while Turkish government-supported schools are also being opened across the country.
Turkey remains one of the biggest supporters of Kosovo's independence and its companies run the country's sole airport, own electricity distribution and have won the tenders to build two highways worth around $2 billion.

""I found a canoe and I used it to cross over with my kids, not knowing where my husband and my (other) two kids are,"" she told Reuters across the border in Nigeria, where thousands of English-speaking Cameroonians have fled in past weeks.
What began last year as peaceful protests by Anglophone activists against perceived marginalisation by Cameroon's Francophone-dominated elite has become the gravest challenge yet to President Paul Biya, who is expected to seek to renew his 35-years in power in an election next year. 
Government repression - including ordering thousands of villagers in the Anglophone southwest to leave their homes - has driven support for a once-fringe secessionist movement, stoking a lethal cycle of violence.
The secessionists declared an independent state called Ambazonia on Oct. 1. Since then, 7,500 people have fled to Nigeria, including 2,300 who fled in a single day on Dec. 4 fearing government reprisals after raids by separatists militants killed at least six soldiers and police officers.
The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR is preparing for up to 40,000 refugees.
Quinta and her children walked for three days through the dense forests to reach a border crossing at the Agbokim Waterfalls. They remain without news of the rest of the family. 
""There are many pregnant women in the forest,"" Quinta said as she held her sick two-month-old baby whose head was covered by a white wooly hat. ""I have friends in the forest and am not sure if I will get to see them again or their kids."" 
At the end of World War One, Germany's colony of Kamerun was carved up between allied French and British victors, laying down the basis for a language split that still persists.
English speakers make up less than a fifth of the population of Cameroon, concentrated in former British territory near the Nigerian border that was joined to the French-speaking Republic of Cameroon the year after its independence in 1960. French speakers have dominated the country's politics since.
Cameroonian authorities say the English-speaking separatists pose a security threat that justifies their crackdown. 
The new arrivals in Nigeria live mainly with host families who have supported them with food, clothing and shelter. The integration, a UNHCR official said, was made easier by the pidgin English spoken on either side of the border.
Food and medicine are in limited supply. Four people have died of sicknesses since coming to Nigeria and the refugees sometimes sleep as many as 50 to a five-by-seven meter room.
Their anger has grown toward a government they feel no longer represents them, which could provide the separatists with easy recruits. 
""We were walking for peaceful demonstrations ... but it's because of the killing of our innocent people that is why our own people have started reacting,"" said Tiku Michael, a businessman, farmer, father of six and now a refugee. 
""Even ... God himself, he will not allow things to go (on) like that.""

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 07:19AM ET</span>",U.N. chief says arrest of Reuters journalists shows erosion of press freedom in Myanmar,"TOKYO/YANGON (Reuters) - The arrest of two Reuters journalists in Yangon this week was a signal that press freedom is shrinking in Myanmar and the international community must do all it can to get them released, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday.
Guterres said his main concern over Myanmar was the ""dramatic violations of human rights"" during a military crackdown in Rakhine State that forced more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee the country for southern Bangladesh, and the arrest of the journalists was probably related.
""It is clearly a concern in relation to the erosion of press freedom in the country,"" he told a news conference in Tokyo, referring to the detention of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who had been working on stories about the strife in Rakhine State.
""And probably the reason why these journalists were arrested is because they were reporting on what they have seen in relation to this massive human tragedy,"" he added.
Myanmar's Ministry of Information said in a statement on Wednesday that the Reuters journalists and two policemen faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act. The 1923 law carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
The reporters ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"", the ministry said in its statement, which was accompanied by a photo of the two reporters in handcuffs.
Reuters President and Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement on Wednesday: ""We are outraged by this blatant attack on press freedom. We call for authorities to release them immediately.""
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo went missing on Tuesday evening after they had been invited to meet police officials over dinner on the outskirts of Yangon.
The authorities have not confirmed where the journalists are being held and, as of Thursday morning, Reuters had not been formally contacted by officials about their detention.
BRITAIN RAISES CONCERN
The British embassy in Yangon expressed deep concern about the arrests, and said in a statement that journalists ""must be allowed to work freely and without intimidation"".
""We have raised our concerns with the Burmese government, urging them to explain these arrests and allow immediate access to the two journalists,"" it said. 
Myanmar is also known as Burma.
The Foreign Correspondents Club of Myanmar said it was ""appalled"" by the arrests and ""gravely concerned"" about the state of press freedom in the country. In a statement, it called on the authorities to ensure the safety of the reporters and allow their families to see them.
The foreign correspondents' club in neighbouring Thailand said it was ""alarmed by the use of this draconian law with its heavy penalties against journalists simply doing their jobs"".
""Wielding such a blunt legal instrument has an intimidating effect on other journalists, and poses a real threat to media freedom,"" the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand said in a statement, calling for the journalists to be released.
It said journalists should be given access to Rakhine State so that they can report accurately on developments there.
Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh say their exodus from the mainly Buddhist nation was triggered by a military offensive in response to Rohingya militant attacks on security forces at the end of August.
The United Nations has branded the military's campaign ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" of the minority Rohingya.
Guterres said the international community should do everything possible to secure the journalists' release and freedom of the press in Myanmar.

He called for aid to be delivered, violence contained and reconciliation promoted in Rakhine State, and for the Rohingyas' right of return to be fully respected and implemented.

PARIS (Reuters) - A Saudi-backed Islamic military coalition will provide logistical, intelligence and training to a new West African counter-terrorism force that is struggling to get off the ground, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said.
The announcement by Adel al-Jubeir signals the involvement in the Sahel of a Muslim military alliance widely seen as a vehicle for countering the growing influence of Riyadh's rival Iran.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday agreed to provide about $150 million to the G5 Sahel force, which is composed of the armies of Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad, a sign that Gulf Arab states are upping their influence in the region.
The Sunni Muslim kingdom is seeking to check the ambitions of Shi'ite power Iran to expand its clout in West Africa and across the Muslim world.
Speaking in an interview with France 24 television, Adel al-Jubeir said his country's contribution would go much further by using the platform of the recently-established Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition to support the G5 Sahel.
""Because of our commitment to fighting terrorism and extremism we made the commitment to provide 100 million euros to these forces and we made this commitment also to provide logistics, training, intelligence and air support through the Islamic military coalition to this effort,"" Jubeir said.
Some 40 Muslim-majority nations met in Riyadh at the end of November to begin fleshing it out details of the alliance first conceived two years by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but that until now has yet to take any decisive international action in its mandate to fight terrorism.
The crown prince has said he would encourage a more moderate and tolerant version of Islam in the ultra-conservative kingdom and wants the coalition, which will have a permanent base in Riyadh, to help combat terrorist financing and ideology.
GROWING UNREST 
""We will be hosting a meeting of this new group to coordinate this military support to those (G5) countries,"" Jubeir said, referring to a meeting the Islamic Alliance, adding that Riyadh would also provide humanitarian assistance.
The G5 Sahel launched a symbolic military operation to mark its creation in October amid growing unrest in the Sahel, whose porous borders are regularly crossed by jihadists, including affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State.
However, France, which has 4,500 troops in the region, has been dismayed to see the militants score military and symbolic victories in West Africa while the G5 force has struggled to win financing and become operational.
After a meeting in Paris on Wednesday, the French and Malian leaders said they hoped the G5 would secure its first victories by the middle of 2018 to prove its worth and ensure more concrete support from the United Nations.
In Rome, a defense ministry official said Italy will send several hundred troops to Niger, a member of the G5 Sahel, next year to help train local forces battling jihadi militants.
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni signaled the initiative on Wednesday, telling the G5 meeting in France that Italy would divert some of its forces in Iraq to Niger, a country that straddles an expanse of the Sahara desert.
""Niger has requested help with training men involved in border controls and we will certainly be setting up a mission there,"" the defense ministry official said, declining to be named. 
The official declined to confirm a report in la Repubblica newspaper that some 470 men would be sent to Niger to help with both training and surveillance, saying full details of the operation had not yet been finalised.
Despite agreement on principles, members of the Saudi-backed alliance have voiced different priorities slowing its implementation.
Critics say the coalition could become a means for Saudi Arabia to implement an even more assertive foreign policy by winning the backing of poorer African and Asian nations with offers of financial and military aid.

Putin, whom critics have accused of using state TV, the courts and the police to demonize and marginalize the liberal opposition, said earlier this month he would run for re-election in March 2018 - a contest he seems sure to win comfortably and extend his grip on power into a third decade.
But in a sign the former KGB officer is keen to strengthen his role as a father of the nation figure rather than as a party political figure, Putin said he planned to run as an independent candidate and garner support from more than one party. 
The ruling United Russia party has traditionally backed Putin and is likely to do so again this time, but Putin clearly wants to generate a higher turnout by styling himself as someone who is above the often grubby fray of Russian party politics.
Putin said it was too early to set out his electoral program, but named priority issues, aside from helping forge what he called a flexible political system, as nurturing a high-tech economy, improving infrastructure, healthcare, education, productivity and increasing people's real incomes.
Putin, 65, has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000, longer than veteran Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and outstripped only by dictator Josef Stalin.
With an approval rating of around 80 percent if, as expected, he wins what would be a fourth presidential term, he will be eligible to serve another six years until 2024, when he turns 72.
Putin said he was aware he faced no real competition.
""The political environment, like the economic environment, needs to be competitive,"" Putin told an audience of more than 1,600 Russian and foreign reporters gathered in a Moscow conference hall for his annual news conference.
""I will strive for us to have a balanced political system.""
He said he regretted the lack of competition, but accused his political opponents of failing to come up with any positive ideas to tackle Russia's problems. 
""It's important not to just make noise on public squares and speak about the regime,"" said Putin. 
""It's important to propose something to make things better. But when you start to compare what the leaders of the opposition are proposing, especially the leaders of the non-systemic (liberal) opposition, there are a lot of problems.""

Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is unlikely to be allowed to run against Putin due to what he says is a trumped up criminal conviction, posted an instant riposte on social media. He said he had launched his own program this week but accused Putin of doing his best to ignore it.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Several dozen women in Kenya said police officers attacked them during this year's election season and some said they were raped by men in uniform, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Thursday.
More than 70 people were killed in an election in August, later nullified by the Supreme Court, and a repeat presidential poll in October won by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The opposition boycotted the repeat poll and said it would not be fair.
The sexual attacks, mostly on women, occurred over this period in some of Nairobi's slums and in two opposition strongholds, Kisumu and Bungoma, in western Kenya, HRW said in a report. 
Kenyan police dispute rights groups' allegations that officers used excessive force to quell election-related unrest. They did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the report.
One 28-year-old woman in the Nairobi slum of Mathare told Reuters: ""Four men in police uniforms burst into my home and my children were sleeping, they pulled my husband out. One grabbed my neck, the other pulled off my clothes, another beat me with a stick, and the other forced sex on me."" 
The woman who declined to be identified said she was four months pregnant and miscarried shortly after the rape. ""I was bleeding and confused afterwards,"" she said. 
Another woman, aged 26, said: ""Two men dragged me away from my friend, stripped off my clothes and one raped me as another one held me down.""
""Kenyan women who have been raped - they are lonely and abandoned and ashamed,"" said HRW researcher Agnes Odhiambo. ""It's the Kenyan government who should feel shame for failing to protect them and help them get medical treatment."" 
Kenyan rights groups accuse police of brutality and extrajudicial killings. 
A government civilian watchdog tasked to oversee the police exists, but few officers are charged and convictions are extremely rare. 
The sexual violence mirrored widespread violations against women after a disputed 2007 vote, when 1,200 people were killed, HRW said. At the time, the group documented at least 900 cases of sexual violence but said this was likely an underestimate.
""The new cases related to the August and October 2017 elections demonstrate a disturbing continuum,"" Tina Alai, a lawyer with New York-based Physicians for Human Rights.

""Police have continued to perpetrate sexual violence against civilians they are obligated to protect,"" she said.

North Korea says the 12 waitresses were abducted, and a manager who defected with them tricked them into making the journey. It has demanded the return of the women, but officials in Seoul say they traveled voluntarily and were admitted on humanitarian grounds.
Some of the workers are now university students, according to several sources who have met them, but all have kept a low profile and mystery still surrounds their trip.
Relatives in the North had also raised objections, Quintana added.
""I was told the father of one of these women recently passed away without meeting his daughter, adding to a long list of victims who continue to pay the absurd cost of division,"" he said.
The briefing was briefly interrupted by Kim Ryon Hui, a woman who said she had been forcibly held in South Korea for seven years.
Quintana said he had met Kim the previous day, but did not have the authority to comment on human rights issues in South Korea.
North Korean officials have said the 12 waitresses and Kim must be allowed to return before they allow family visits to resume.
In an interview with Reuters in November, Kim said she first arrived in the South to seek a better job, without realizing her return home would be blocked by its laws that the government must approve visits to, or contact with, the North.
Allowing Kim's permanent return would violate the law, says the South's Ministry of Unification, which estimates 881 defectors to have arrived from the North this year.
Quintana urged that international sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear weapons program be tailored to avoid any adverse impact on human rights and economic livelihoods.
Restrictions on international financial transfers, for example, should not affect U.N. programs that provided humanitarian assistance, he said. 
While Pyongyang has condemned the sanctions, Quintana called for the government to ""substantiate its criticism with substantive data"", and provide access for international human rights monitors.
Impoverished North Korea and the rich, democratic South have been in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

A North Korean soldier who defected to the south in November was shot five times by border guards and critically wounded in his desperate dash through the demilitarized zone dividing the two.

The killing last week is the latest to roil India's minority Muslims who have faced attacks from mobs who accuse them of killing cows, which Hindus consider sacred. Hindu fringe groups also campaign against Muslim men marrying Hindus.
The Hindu man, Shambu Lal Regar, has been arrested on suspicion of hacking and burning a Muslim laborer in the western state of Rajasthan, police said.
Regar had posted a video of the attack along with his bank details for donations to finance his anti-Muslim campaign, police officer Anand Shrivastava said.
More than 700 people from across India deposited 300,000 rupees ($4,665) into the account.
""The accused wanted to become a Hindu hero after killing a Muslim man, his main aim was to collect money after committing the hate crime,"" said Shrivastava.
Regar's video went viral on social media before authorities took it down. Police investigators had frozen the bank account and were tracking down donors, Shrivastava said.
Shrivastava said the video had showed Regar claiming to be a proud Hindu trying to stop ""love jihad"" - a term used by Hindu hardliners who accuse Muslim men of entrapping Hindu women and girls on the pretext of love in order to convert them to Islam.
The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who leads the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, has been criticized for failing to do enough to stop attacks on Muslims.
The government rejects that. Modi has condemned violence in the name of protecting cows.
Muslims account for 172 million of India’s 1.32 billion citizens and Modi's critics say Hindu groups linked with his ruling party are trying to marginalize them.
The BJP denies any bias against Muslims

The 93-year-old former leader who ruled the southern African nation for 37 years, resigned after the army and his ruling ZANU-PF party turned against him when it became clear that his 52-year-old wife, Grace, was being groomed as his successor.
Mugabe left Harare with his wife and aides on Monday evening, a Zimbabwe state security official said this week. He was expected to also visit Malaysia where his daughter is expecting a child.
An Air Zimbabwe flight arrived in Singapore on Tuesday.
Mugabe visited a private hospital in central Singapore on Wednesday with an entourage that included his security guards, the sources who were familiar with the visit told Reuters.
They spoke on the condition they were not identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.
A spokesman at the hospital said he would not be able to confirm whether Mugabe had visited its clinics.

Mugabe has a reputation for extensive international travel, including regular medical trips to Singapore - a source of public anger among his impoverished citizens.

The High Court ruled last week that Zuma's appointment of head prosecutor Shaun Abrahams should be set aside immediately and that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should appoint a new public prosecutor within 60 days.
The ruling was among a series of judicial blows to his administration, which has been hit by a series of scandals.
Zuma filed papers saying that people exercise presidential powers at the same time, according to television station eNCA. 
Zuma's spokesman could not immediately comment.
The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has also said it will appeal the ruling.
In October the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld an earlier decision by a lower court that the nearly 800 corruption charges filed against Zuma before he became president be reinstated. 
It then fell to Abrahams, appointed by Zuma, to decide whether or not the NPA would pursue a case against him.

The charges against Zuma relate to a 30 billion rand ($2.22 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s and have amplified calls for Zuma to step down before his term as president ends in 2019.

Israeli aircraft struck three facilities belonging to Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, before dawn on Thursday after the latest rocket attacks, Israel's military said.
It said it targeted training camps and weapons storage compounds. Hamas usually evacuates such facilities when border tensions spike.
Two of the rockets fired by militants were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system and a third exploded in an open area. There were no reports of casualties on either side of the frontier.
The military said in a statement that ""due to the security events and in accordance with security assessments"" Kerem Shalom crossing - the main passage point for goods entering the Gaza Strip, and the Erez pedestrian crossing - would be shut as of Thursday. It did not say how long the closure would last.
Some 15 rockets have been fired into southern Israel since Trump's Dec. 6 announcement, and none of the projectiles has caused serious injury or damage.
The attacks have drawn Israeli air strikes that have killed two Hamas gunmen. Two other Palestinians have been killed in confrontations with Israeli troops during stone-throwing protests along the border.
Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi said on Israel Radio that while Hamas, which last fought a war with Israel in 2014, was not carrying out the rocket strikes, it needed to rein in militants from ""breakaway groups"" or it would ""find itself in a situation where it has to contend"" with the Israeli military.
In Istanbul on Wednesday, a summit of more than 50 Muslim countries condemned Trump's move and called on the world to respond by recognizing East Jerusalem, captured by Israel along with the West Bank in a 1967 war, as the capital of Palestine.

Trump's declaration has been applauded by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a recognition of political reality and Jews's biblical links to Jerusalem, a city that is also holy to Muslims and Christians.

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan.
Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory.
On Monday, Chinese jets carried out ""island encirclement patrols"" around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise.
On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States.
Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the ""One China"" policy and ""constitute an interference in China's internal affairs"". 
""China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,"" Lu told a daily news briefing.
China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added. 
Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months. 
Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China's military deployments as irresponsible.
Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly.
Taiwan ""can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured"", Huang said.
Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.
""Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,"" Huang was quoted as saying.
Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan's independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year.
China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island's formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan's security.
Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.

China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.

The blaze broke out in the middle of the night on June 14 and quickly gutted the 24-storey building, which was home to a close-knit, multi-ethnic community living in a poor area within one of London's richest boroughs, Kensington and Chelsea.
The disaster profoundly shocked Britain, highlighting extreme disparities in living conditions between rich and poor and fuelling a debate over whether disdain for social housing residents had played a part.
""Hosting this service at St Paul's Cathedral, an iconic venue in London, recognizes the significance of this tragedy both for the local community and the wider nation,"" said Graham Tomlin, the bishop of Kensington, ahead of the service.
Prime Minister Theresa May, opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry are all expected to attend the service.
But members of Kensington and Chelsea council, which owns Grenfell Tower and has been widely criticized for its actions before and after the fire, have been asked not to attend because survivors and bereaved families do not want them there.
""I totally respect that,"" council leader Elizabeth Campbell told the BBC earlier this week. ""We will be paying our own respects in the council with a minute's silence.""
Hundreds of people displaced by the fire, both those who lived in the tower itself and others who lived in nearby buildings, are still staying in hotels six months later as the council has so far been unable to permanently rehouse them.
Campbell has defended the council, saying it was doing everything it could to secure quality homes for affected families, but members of the Grenfell community who have spoken to media have complained of a slow, confusing process.
""I am sorry. I'm sorry that they're in hotels,"" said Campbell.

Police are conducting a criminal investigation into the fire and have said that charges may be brought against individuals or organizations. A separate public inquiry is under way on the causes of the fire and the authorities' response.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - China summoned Australia's ambassador to lodge a complaint last week over Canberra's allegation that Beijing had sought to interfere in Australian politics, a source familiar with the diplomatic action told Reuters on Thursday.
Relations between Australia and China became strained in recent weeks after Canberra said it would ban foreign political donations as part of a crackdown aimed at preventing external influence in domestic politics, sharpening the focus on China's soft power.
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull singled out China as he said foreign powers were making ""unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process"" in Australia.
In response, China summoned Ambassador Jan Adams to a meeting at the Chinese Ministry for Foreign Affairs on December 8 to lodge a complaint, the source said.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang confirmed the ministry had an ""important discussion"" with the Australian ambassador.
""The Australian side should be very clear about China's position on the relevant issue,"" Lu told a daily news briefing, without elaborating.
China's Foreign Ministry said last week Turnbull's allegations were full of prejudice against China, were baseless and poisoned the atmosphere of China-Australia relations.
Turnbull's allegations have been criticized by Australia's opposition Labor Party as showing an ""anti-China"" bias that could jeopardize bilateral trade. 
China, which is easily Australia's biggest trading partner, bought A$93 billion ($70 billion) worth of Australian goods and services last year. Australia's unshakeable security relationship with the United States, however, has limited how cosy it gets with China.
Turnbull denied indulging in anti-Chinese rhetoric, insisting Labour was using the issue to win favor with a large voter block ahead of a make-or-break by-election on Saturday that analysts said will determine his political future.
""I am disappointed they have tried to turn Australians against each other,"" Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A suicide bomber disguised as a policeman blew himself up inside a police training camp in Somalia's capital Mogadishu on Thursday and killed at least 15 officers, officials said.
Police spokesman Major Mohamed Hussein said the attacker had explosives strapped to his body and infiltrated the General Kahiye Police Training Academy during an early morning parade.
""So far 15 have died and 17 others were injured,"" Abdullahi Nur, another police official, told Reuters. 
Earlier, the head of a local ambulance service said they had moved the bodies of 13 victims as well as 15 injured people.
The militant Islamist group al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack and gave a higher death toll.
""We killed 27 police (officers) and injured more,"" Abdiasis Abu Musab, the group's military operations spokesman, told Reuters. Al Shabaab carries out frequent bombings in Mogadishu and other towns.
The group, which is allied to al Qaeda, is waging an insurgency against the U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to topple the weak administration and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam.
The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 and have since been steadily losing territory to the combined forces of African Union peacekeepers and Somali security forces.
Al Shabaab's attacks come at a time when the African Union is finalizing plans to trim its peacekeeping mission called AMISOM.
The force of 22,000 deployed a decade ago but is set to lose 1,000 soldiers this month as part of a long-term plan to pull out of the country and hand security to the Somali army.
The peacekeepers were deployed to help secure a government that has struggled to establish central control in a country that plunged into civil war in the early 1990s.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's constitutional court on Thursday narrowly rejected a petition by a conservative group to make extramarital sex illegal, but rights activists braced for a renewal of the battle in parliament and other state institutions. 
Five of nine judges voted for the case to be thrown out, in a slim victory for rights activists who had feared the petition would spur moral policing and further discrimination against the gay community in the world's largest Muslim-majority country. 
Most Indonesians adhere to a moderate form of Islam under an officially secular system, but there has been rise of a hardline, politicized Islam in recent years, which until recently had stayed on the fringe of the nation's politics.
Constitutional court chief justice Arief Hidayat said existing laws on adultery did not conflict with the constitution and it was not the court's authority to create new policies.
The judge said the question could be put to parliament, which is currently deliberating revisions to the national criminal code.
""The plaintiff should submit their petition to lawmakers, and there it should be an important input in the ongoing revision of the national criminal code,"" Hidayat said, as he read a summary of the 600-page ruling.
""Based on that view, the constitutional court is of the opinion that the petition is not legally sound."" 
Rights activists were comforted by the court's decision, while expecting more challenges to come.
""The decision is a relief because it shows it's possible to challenge the creeping conservatism in society,"" said Dede Oetomo, a prominent gay rights activist.
""But it's not over. There's parliament, there are other state institutions, they can turn to education, social organisations,"" he added.
The Family Love Alliance (AILA), a group of conservative academics and activists which put forward the petition, said it would not give up its fight.
""Aside from legal avenues, we can also go through government policy and programs so that sexual deviance is minimised and is an agenda for all of us,"" Euis Sunarti, a member of AILA, told reporters after the ruling.
AILA's petition had called for the definition of adultery to apply not just to married couples but to anyone in a marriage or outside it - effectively making all sex outside of marriage a crime.
In their complaint, AILA said certain articles in the national criminal code ""threaten the resilience of families and therefore of Indonesia itself."" 
Some rights activists said the petition was partly aimed at criminalizing gay sex, which is currently not regulated by the law except in the ultra-conservative province of Aceh and in cases of child abuse.

Activists say such changes to the law would make it vulnerable to abuse, like the country's draconian anti-pornography laws, to target the LGBT community. Islamic parties pushed the anti-pornography laws in parliament soon after Indonesia ushered in its democratic era in 1998 and actively push an anti-LGBT agenda today.

TOKYO (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, warning against the danger of ""sleepwalking"" into war, said on Thursday that Security Council resolutions on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs must be fully implemented by Pyongyang and other countries.
Guterres made the comments to reporters after meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo just days after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered to begin direct talks with North Korea without pre-conditions.
The White House said Wednesday that no negotiations could be held with North Korea until it improves its behavior. The White House has declined to say whether President Donald Trump, who has taken a tougher rhetorical line toward Pyongyang, gave approval to Tillerson's overture.
""It is very clear that the Security Council resolutions must be fully implemented first of all by North Korea but by all other countries whose role is crucial to ... achieve the result we all aim at, which is the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,"" Guterres said.
Guterres added that Security Council unity was also vital ""to allow for the possibility of diplomatic engagement"" that would allow denuclearisation to take place.
""The worst possible thing that could happen is for us all to sleepwalk into a war that might have very dramatic circumstances,"" he said.
Japan says now is the time to keep up maximum pressure on Pyongyang, not start talks on the North's missile and nuclear programs. China and Russia, however, have welcomed Tillerson's overture. 
Abe, who spoke to reporters with Guterres, reiterated that dialogue needed to be meaningful and aimed at denuclearisation.
""We fully agreed that the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula is indispensable for the peace and stability of the region,"" Abe said.
Tillerson's overture came nearly two weeks after North Korea said it had successfully tested a breakthrough intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that put the entire United States mainland within range. In September, North Korea fired a ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, the second to fly over Japan in less than a month.
North Korea appears to have little interest in negotiations with the United States until it has developed the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, something most experts say it has still not proved.
United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman, who visited Pyongyang last week, said on Tuesday senior North Korean officials did not offer any type of commitment to talks, but he believes he left ""the door ajar"".

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's population is expanding at the fastest pace in the developed world as skilled migrants flock to the resource-rich nation, a fillip to economic growth overall but perhaps also a source of puzzling weakness in wages.
Government figures released on Thursday showed the number of people resident in Australia increased 388,100 in the year to June, a rise of 1.6 percent on 2015/16. That was far above the global increase of 1.1 percent, and well ahead of the United States' gain of 0.7 percent and Canada's 0.9 percent.
There's still plenty of room for more, given the giant continent still only has 24.6 million people, putting it at 53rd in United Nations global population rankings.
Much of Australia's growth came in net overseas migration, which surged more than 27 percent in the year to June to 245,500. That was the highest 12-month total since 2009, while the flow into the states of New South Wales and Victoria beat records.
""A strong labor market is attracting interstate and overseas migrants to Melbourne, while better housing affordability and jobs growth is driving population growth in Queensland and Tasmania,"" said Ryan Felsman, a senior economist at CommSec.
""Overall the stronger rate of population growth is boosting spending, demand for infrastructure, demand for homes, and overall economic growth.""
Leading migrant countries include China, India, Britain and New Zealand.
SURGING PROPERTY PRICES
The flood of newcomers, mostly on skilled migrant programs, is one reason property prices have been on a tear in recent years, especially in Sydney and Melbourne.
The extra demand created by all these new Australians was also a major reason the economy grew a brisk 2.8 percent in the year to September. Indeed, strip away population growth and the economy would have expanded by just 1.3 percent.
Yet the influx of able bodies has also expanded the workforce right at the time when employers were ramping up their demand for labor, restraining wages growth.
Separate figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics released on Thursday showed a barnstorming 383,000 net new jobs were created in the year to November. 
But wages still grew at a pedestrian annual pace of 2 percent, a perfect case of expanding supply benefiting employers rather than those already employed.
Policymakers at Australia's central bank have been baffled by the divergence between employment and wages, citing the mystery as an argument against a rise in interest rates anytime soon.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican Senate committees on Wednesday approved a controversial security bill that human rights groups say risks granting excessive power to the armed forces in their already checkered role in combating organized crime in the country.
The bill, which enjoys some cross-party support between conservatives and centrists, will now pass to the floor of the upper house of Congress for discussion and possible approval late on Wednesday or on Thursday morning.
The Law of Internal Security aims to regulate the armed forces' role in combating drug cartels, a conflict which has claimed well over 100,000 lives in the last decade.
Senate committees approved the bill on Wednesday, a senate spokesman said. Lawmakers who support the bill say it will set out clear rules that limit the use of soldiers to fight crime.
Rights groups have strongly attacked the bill, saying it prioritizes the military's role in fighting the gangs over improving the police, and could open the door to greater abuses and impunity by the armed forces.
The military has already been embroiled in multiple human rights scandals including extrajudicial killings of gang members and the disappearance of 43 students near one of its bases in 2014.
The United Nations, Amnesty International and Mexican human rights organizations have all criticized the bill. 
""This law should not be approved quickly, it puts liberties at risk by giving more power to the armed forces without designing controls and counterweights,"" said Santiago Aguirre from the Miguel Agustin Pro Center for Human Rights.

Last week, President Enrique Pena Nieto asked lawmakers to include civil society's views in their discussion of the bill, which sparked attempts by protesters to bar access to the upper house of Congress when it reached the Senate.

LIMA (Reuters) - Brazilian builder Odebrecht transferred $4.8 million to companies linked to Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski between 2004 and 2012, some of which was paid to a company Kuczynski controlled when he held senior government roles, according to a document the company sent to Congress.
In a brief recorded message broadcast on local radio program RPP after lawmakers made the contents of the document public on Wednesday, Kuczynski denied wrongdoing but did not deny the transfers took place.
Kuczynski's office declined further comment. 
Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] declined to comment. A source in the company who spoke on condition of anonymity said the document seen by Reuters was authentic.
The transfers shown in the document contradicted Kuczynski's previous denials about his ties to Odebrecht and prompted some lawmakers in the opposition-controlled Congress to call for his resignation.
Odebrecht is at the center of Latin America's biggest graft scandal and has admitted to paying about $30 million in bribes to officials in Peru over a decade, including during the 2001-2006 term of ex-President Alejandro Toledo, when Kuczynski was finance minister and prime minister. 
After Odebrecht's public acknowledgement a year ago, Kuczynski repeatedly denied ever taking money from Odebrecht or having any professional connections to the company.
But on Saturday Kuczynski announced on a local radio program that he once worked as a financial adviser for an Odebrecht project when he did not hold public office; he did not mention the company that paid him.
""I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE""
According to the document sent to Congress, Odebrecht made seven transfers totaling about $780,000 to Kuczynski's company Westfield Capital Ltd between 2004 and 2007, including about $60,000 when Kuczynski worked in Toledo's Cabinet and the government awarded several contracts to Odebrecht. Later, between 2008 and 2012, Odebrecht paid about $4 million to First Capital Inversiones Y Asesorias.
Kuczynski has previously said that First Capital belongs to his friend and Chilean business partner, Gerardo Sepulveda. Kuczynski was the sole director of Westfield Capital, according to his sworn declaration on the presidency's website. 
Kuczynski has not appeared in public since his radio interview on Saturday. He said on RPP on Wednesday that he had decided to heed Congress' repeated calls to explain any connections he had with Odebrecht to an investigative committee. 
""I've never favored any company. I'm willing to clarify everything that needs to be clarified before Congress and prosecutors because I have nothing to hide,"" Kuczynski said on RPP, without taking any questions from journalists.
A spokesman for Popular Force, the opposition party that holds a majority of seats in Peru's single-chamber Congress, slammed Kuczynski. 
""The country, Mr. Kuczynski, is tired of your lies and doesn't want any more explanations. The country hasn't just lost its trust in you, but in your government as well,"" Daniel Salaverry, the spokesman, told a news conference.
In a televised plenary session late on Wednesday, hardline Popular Force lawmaker Hector Becerril called for Kuczynski to resign, calling the transferred funds ""camouflaged bribes."" An independent lawmaker also called for Kuczynski to step down.
A source in the attorney general's office said prosecutors investigating Odebrecht in Peru were probing Kuczynski's relationship with the company but could not name him as a suspect until his term and presidential immunity end.
Toledo, the former president under whom Kuczynski worked, has been accused of taking a $20 million bribe from Odebrecht in exchange for help in securing lucrative highway contracts. Toledo has denied the charges. Authorities in Peru are seeking his extradition from the United States.

QUITO (Reuters) - An Ecuadorean court on Wednesday sentenced Vice President Jorge Glas to six years in jail after finding him guilty of receiving bribes from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht [ODBCT.UL] in return for handing the scandal-ridden firm state contracts.
A close ally of leftist ex-President Rafael Correa, Glas served as Correa's vice president from 2013 and retained the position under current President Lenin Moreno.
But Moreno, who has largely broken from Correa, suspended Glas in August, accusing him of not being a team player. An Ecuadorean judge in October then ordered pre-trial detention for Glas as part of the investigation into Odebrecht.
The public prosecutor's office accused him of pocketing a roughly $13.5-million bribe from Odebrecht via his uncle.
""Glas constructed, with (former Odebrecht executive) Jose Conceicao Santos, the awarding of public contracts in return for payment,"" Judge Edgar Flores said on Wednesday as he read the decision.
Glas, a 48-year-old electrical engineer, has been accused by senior members of Correa's government of corruption while serving as strategic sectors minister and vice president.
His lawyer slammed the decision as ""unjust"" and vowed to appeal.
Glas' downfall highlights how fallout from the massive Odebrecht corruption scandal has continued to ripple across South America.
The company, which has admitted to paying bribes to win contracts in a number of countries, has paid $3.5 billion in settlements in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland.

Odebrecht allegedly paid $33.5 million in bribes to secure contracts in Ecuador. The opposition says that Correa's government was slow to investigate, although he rejects that.

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 05:32PM ET</span>","Despite Tillerson overture, White House says not right time for North Korea talks","By Matt Spetalnick and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - No negotiations can be held with North Korea until it improves its behavior, a White House official said on Wednesday, raising questions about U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's offer to begin talks with Pyongyang any time and without pre-conditions.
""Given North Korea's most recent missile test, clearly right now is not the time,"" a White House official told Reuters.
Tillerson said on Tuesday the United States was “ready to talk any time North Korea would like to talk,"" appearing to back away from a key U.S. demand that Pyongyang must first accept that any negotiations would have to be about giving up its nuclear arsenal.
The White House has declined to say whether President Donald Trump, who has taken a tougher rhetorical line against North Korea than Tillerson, gave approval for the overture.
A day after Tillerson's comments at Washington's Atlantic Council think tank, the White House official, who declined to be named, laid out a more restrictive formula for any diplomatic engagement with North Korea.
""The administration is united in insisting that any negotiations with North Korea must wait until the regime fundamentally improves its behavior,"" the official said. ""As the secretary of state himself has said, this must include, but is not limited to, no further nuclear or missile tests.""
In his speech, however, Tillerson did not explicitly set a testing freeze as a requirement before talks can begin. He said it would be “tough to talk” if Pyongyang decided to test another device in the middle of discussions and that “a period of quiet” would be needed for productive discussions.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert on Wednesday appeared to walk back part of Tillerson's proposal, saying there would have to be a suspension of North Korean nuclear and missile tests for an undefined length of time before any talks could take place.
""And we certainly haven't seen that right now,"" she told reporters, insisting Tillerson had not unveiled a new policy and was ""on the same page"" as the White House.
Tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over North Korea's weapons advances have grown this year and recent exchanges of bellicose rhetoric have fueled fears over the risk of military conflict.
Tillerson's relationship with Trump has been strained by differences over North Korea and other issues, and he has seen his influence diminished within the administration. Senior administration officials said late last month that Trump was considering a plan to oust Tillerson, though the secretary of state has dismissed that.
Tillerson said in his speech that Trump ""has encouraged our diplomatic efforts."" Trump, however, tweeted in October that Tillerson was ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with North Korea.
CHINA, RUSSIA WELCOME TILLERSON OFFER
Tillerson's overture came nearly two weeks after North Korea said it had successfully tested a breakthrough intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that put the entire United States mainland within range.
North Korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations with the United States until it has developed the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, something most experts say it has still not proved.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said following Tillerson's speech that China welcomed efforts to ease tension and promote dialogue to resolve the North Korea standoff.
Russia also welcomed Tillerson's statement, the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying.
Ahead of Tillerson's speech, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to develop more nuclear weapons while personally decorating scientists and officials who contributed to the development of Pyongyang's most advanced ICBM, state media said on Wednesday.

Despite that, a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tillerson’s remarks followed speculation North Korea might be willing to talk having announced it had completed a major milestone with last month’s missile test and suggested he was trying to take advantage of a potential opening.

The reporters had been working on stories about a military crackdown on the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rahkine State that has caused almost 650,000 people to flee to neighboring Bangladesh.
The Ministry of Information said in a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that the journalists and two policemen face charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act. The 1923 law carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
The reporters ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,"" said the statement, which was accompanied by a photo of the pair in handcuffs. 
It said they were detained at a police station on the outskirts of Yangon, the southeast Asian nation's main city.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo went missing on Tuesday evening after they had been invited to meet police officials over dinner.
Reuters' driver Myothant Tun dropped them off at Battalion 8's compound at around 8 pm and the two reporters and two police officers headed to a nearby restaurant. The journalists did not return to the car.
BLATANT ATTACK
The Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh say their exodus from the mainly Buddhist nation was triggered by a military counter-offensive in Rakhine state that the United Nations has branded ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".
""Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have been reporting on events of global importance in Myanmar, and we learned today that they have been arrested in connection with their work,"" said Stephen J. Adler, president and editor-in-chief of Reuters.
""We are outraged by this blatant attack on press freedom. We call for authorities to release them immediately,"" he said.
A spokesman for Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi confirmed that the two journalists had been arrested.
""Not only your reporters, but also the policemen who were involved in that case,"" spokesman Zaw Htay said. ""We will take action against those policemen and also the reporters.""
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert emphasized that the agency was “following this closely.” She said that U.S. Ambassador Scot Marciel on Wednesday had a conversation with two government officials in Myanmar who seemed “genuinely unaware” of the situation. 
“We care about the safety and security of international reporters who are simply just trying to do their jobs. So we’re going to continue to try to stay on that,” Nauert said. 
The U.S. embassy in Yangon said in a statement posted on its website on Wednesday it was ""deeply concerned by the highly irregular arrests of two Reuters reporters after they were invited to meet with police officials in Yangon last night"".
""For a democracy to succeed, journalists need to be able to do their jobs freely,"" the embassy said. ""We urge the government to explain these arrests and allow immediate access to the journalists."" 
The European Union's mission in Yangon also voiced concern.
""The EU delegation is closely following their case and we call on the Myanmar authorities to ensure the full protection of their rights,"" it said in a statement. ""Media freedom is the foundation of any democracy.""
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists called for the reporters' immediate and unconditional release.
""These arrests come amid a widening crackdown which is having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance,"" said Shawn Crispin, CPJ's senior Southeast Asia representative.
TEXTED FOUR WORDS
Wa Lone, who joined Reuters in July 2016, has covered a range of stories, including the flight of Rohingya refugees from Rakhine in 2016 and, in much larger numbers, this year.
He has written about military land grabs and the killing of ruling party lawyer Ko Ni in January. This year he jointly won an honorable mention from the Society of Publishers in Asia for Reuters coverage of the Rakhine crisis in 2016. 
He previously worked for The Myanmar Times, where he covered Myanmar's historic 2015 elections, and People's Age, a local weekly newspaper, where his editor was Myanmar's current Minister of Information Pe Myint.
Kyaw Soe Oo, an ethnic Rakhine Buddhist from state capital Sittwe, has worked with Reuters since September.
He has covered the impact of the Aug. 25 attacks on police and army posts in the northern Rakhine, and reported from the central part of the state where local Buddhists have been enforcing segregation between Rohingya and Rakhine communities.
He previously worked for Root Investigation Agency, a local news outlet focused on Rakhine issues.
""I have been arrest"" were the four words that Wa Lone texted to Reuters Myanmar Bureau Chief Antoni Slodkowski on Tuesday evening to let him know what was happening. Very soon after that Wa Lone's phone appeared to have been switched off.
Over the next 24 hours, Reuters colleagues in Yangon filed a missing persons report, went to three police stations, and asked a series of government officials what had happened to the two reporters. They got no official information until Wednesday evening.

The Canadian foreign ministry said in a statement it would closely examine every bid and noted that ""exportation of these items is limited."" 
Ukraine, which says it needs the weapons to help counter Russian-backed separatists who have occupied eastern parts of the country, also wants to buy arms from the United States. Washington though has yet to make a decision. 
In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the United States not to supply Ukraine with defensive weapons.
A war in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces has killed more than 10,000 people in three years.
Around 200 Canadian troops are stationed in Ukraine to help train local soldiers. The mission is due to end in March 2019.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is a strong critic of Russia, in particular its decision in 2014 to annex the Ukrainian region of Crimea.

Anadolu said the FBI official was summoned following testimony given by Huseyin Korkmaz in the trial of a former executive at Turkish state-run bank Halkbank, who is charged with taking part in a scheme to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert confirmed that an FBI attache at the U.S. Embassy ""had been brought in to the Turkish ministry"". She provided no details.
The former bank executive, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, has pleaded not guilty. Halkbank has denied involvement with any illegal transactions.
Korkmaz told jurors in a New York court on Monday that he fled Turkey in 2016 out of fear of retaliation from the government after leading a corruption investigation involving high-ranking officials. He said he took his evidence with him.
Korkmaz said he had received $50,000 from the FBI and financial assistance from U.S. prosecutors for his rental payments.
The FBI declined to comment on Wednesday. 
Turkish police said they could not immediately comment on the report that they had summoned an official from the U.S. agency.
A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Ankara said the embassy was aware of the report but had no immediate comment.
Already strained ties between NATO allies Ankara and Washington have deteriorated further over the court case, in which Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors, has detailed a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions.
Korkmaz is testifying for the prosecution at the trial. He told the court this week that he began investigating Zarrab in 2012.
Zarrab has implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said on Thursday that when Erdogan was prime minister he authorised a transaction to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions.
Although he has not yet responded to the courtroom claims, Erdogan has dismissed the case as a politically motivated attempt, led by U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, to bring down the Turkish government.
The government blames Gulen's network for last year's failed military coup in Turkey. Gulen has denied any involvement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Bangladeshi man accused of attempting a suicide bombing in a busy New York City commuter hub will remain in federal custody while he awaits trial on charges that include supporting a foreign terrorist organization, a judge ruled on Wednesday.
Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old supporter of the Islamic State militant group, appeared by video for a brief hearing from his bed in Bellevue Hospital, where he was recovering from injuries he suffered when his homemade bomb ignited but failed to detonate on Monday.
Ullah was covered with a white blanket and remained largely expressionless as Magistrate Judge Katharine Parker told him that he had a right to an attorney and did not have to make any statements.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Shawn Crowley asked that Ullah be detained without bail. Ullah's court-appointed attorney, Amy Gallichio, did not dispute the request, meaning her client that will not be released on bail.
In addition to Ullah, three people suffered minor injuries when he attempted to detonate a pipe bomb secured to his midsection in a pedestrian tunnel under the sprawling Port Authority Bus Terminal transportation complex, where many commuters from New York's suburbs arrive on buses and transfer to local subways.
""I did it for the Islamic State,"" Ullah told police after the blast, according to papers filed by federal prosecutors.
Ullah, who has lived in the United States since 2011, began his self-radicalization in 2014 when he started viewing pro-Islamic State materials online, prosecutors said. He carried out his attack because he was angry over U.S. policies in the Middle East, they said.
Inside Ullah's passport, which was recovered from his home, were handwritten notes, including one that read, ""O AMERICA, DIE IN YOUR RAGE.""
The charges he faces include providing material support to terrorists, use of a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use.
Bangladesh's counterterrorism chief told Reuters on Wednesday that his country had found no evidence linking the suspect to militants in his home country.
""We have collected evidence and information from his family members,"" said Monirul Islam, head of the Bangladesh police's counterterrorism unit. ""In Bangladesh we have not found any connection or have not been able to identify any of his associates who were or are involved with any terrorist groups.""
The attack was the latest inspired by militants to hit the United States' biggest city by population. In October, an Uzbek immigrant killed eight people by racing a rental truck down a bike bath.

Also in October, an Afghan-born U.S. citizen was convicted of planting two bombs in New York's Chelsea neighborhood in 2016, one of which exploded and wounded 30 people.

(Reuters) - A former Rutgers University student and two other men pleaded guilty to computer crimes related to the creation, sale and use of the Mirai botnet, a network of infected electronics equipment used to knock major websites offline in massive 2016 cyber attacks.
Paras Jha, 21, pleaded guilty in federal court on Friday to charges involving writing code that allowed him to infect and control devices with Mirai, the Justice Department said on Tuesday.
He also pleaded guilty on Wednesday in federal court in New Jersey to hacking that repeatedly shut down the Rutgers University computer system between 2014 and 2016, paralyzing the school's networks for days at a time.
Two other individuals, Josiah White, 20, and Dalton Norman, 21, also pleaded guilty to charges related to the development and use of Mirai for criminal gain. Jha and Norman also pleaded guilty to a separate online advertising fraud scheme.
The Mirai botnet was used to infect hundreds of thousands of internet-connected devices including webcams, which its creators then turned into bots that attacked websites and internet infrastructure in ""denial of service"" assaults that knocked them offline. 
Those attacks included one in October 2016 on an internet infrastructure firm known as Dyn that disrupted access to dozens of websites across the United States and Europe including ones run by  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), PayPal Holdings Inc and Spotify. Authorities said Jha and his accomplices did not carry out that specific attack, which took place after an individual believed to be Jha published Mirai's source code online.
U.S. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard Downing declined to comment when asked during a press call about the status of identifying those responsible for the Dyn attack.
Jha began to create the Mirai botnet in August 2016 to launch powerful denial of service attacks targeting business competitors and others against whom the attackers ""held grudges,"" prosecutors said in court documents. He owned a service denial mitigation company called ProTraf Solutions, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page.
Jha and his co-conspirators also sought financial gain, renting the botnet out to other criminals. Jha attempted to destroy or conceal evidence of his crimes by erasing the virtual machine used to run Mirai and posting the code online to create ""plausible deniability,"" prosecutors said.
In August 2016, White created the scanner that was part of the Mirai code, which helped the botnet identify devices that could be accessed and infected, charging documents said.
In September 2016, Norman and accomplices expanded Mirai, allowing it to infect more than 300,000 devices, prosecutors said. Court documents did not accuse Norman of creating Mirai but said he helped monetize its use.
In a separate case unsealed on Tuesday, Jha and Norman were charged with leveraging another botnet for a different scheme to generate online ad revenue through fraudulent clicks, a practice known as clickfraud.
Jha admitted to earning about 200 bitcoin, which was valued at $180,000 on Jan. 29, as a result of the clickfraud, prosecutors said. The amount would be worth about $3.4 million today.
Robert Stahl, Jha's attorney, said his client had been released pending sentencing and has not been a student at New Jersey's Rutgers University since December 2016. 
""Starting when he was just 19 years old, (Jha) made a series of mistakes with significant consequences that he only now fully appreciates,"" Stahl said in a statement. ""He is extremely remorseful and accepts full responsibility for his actions.""
Attorneys for White and Norman did not respond to requests for comment.
Jha's name surfaced in January, when the cyber website Krebs On Security reported he may have been behind the online persona Anna-Senpai, who claimed to be the author of the Mirai worm.
Anna-Senpai released the source code of the Mirai botnet online in September 2016, which gave other hackers the opportunity to use it. A month later the massive assault on infrastructure firm Dyn took place, causing swaths of the internet to be temporarily unavailable.
In court on Wednesday, Jha acknowledged his hacks caused Rutgers to lose $3.5 million to $9.5 million, Acting U.S. Attorney William Fitzpatrick told reporters.

In a statement, Rutgers said no data was compromised and that it had made ""substantial improvements"" to its technology infrastructure.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura urged Russia on Wednesday to convince its ally the Syrian government of the need to clinch a peace deal to end the nearly seven-year-old war.
De Mistura, speaking on Swiss television station RTS, said failure to make peace quickly through United Nations mediation could lead to ""a fragmentation of Syria"".
Russian President Vladimir Putin during a surprise visit on Monday to Russia's Hmeymim air base in Syria, declared that the work of Russian forces was largely done in backing the Assad government against militants, following the defeat of ""the most battle-hardened group of international terrorists.""
De Mistura, asked what signal Putin could give from his position of force, said: ""Convince the (Syrian) government that there is no time to lose.... You can think you win territory militarily but you have to win the peace.
""And to win the peace, you have to have the courage to push the government to accept that there has to be a new constitution and new elections, through the United Nations,"" he said.
The nearly seven-year civil war in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes. All previous diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have ended in failure over the opposition's demand that President Bashar al-Assad leave power and his refusal to go.
The Kremlin first launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015 in its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in Assad's favor. 
Now that it regards that mission complete, Putin wants to help broker a peace deal and is keen to organize a special event in Russia - a Syrian Congress on National Dialogue - that Moscow hopes will bring together the Syrian government and opposition and try to hammer out a new constitution.
But De Mistura made clear that peace negotiations must be through the United Nations in Geneva, as mandated by the U.N. Security Council, adding: ""Otherwise it is not worth it.... This is a complicated war, it is only in Geneva through the U.N.""
The U.N. envoy has conducted shuttle diplomacy between the Syrian government delegation led by chief negotiator Bashar al-Ja'afari and a unified opposition delegation.
""The opposition told me clearly when they arrived here, and again yesterday and this morning too, that they are ready to meet the government right away to have a hard, difficult discussion.
""The government is not ready, it has said it is not ready to meet the opposition. That is regrettable but diplomacy has many means,"" de Mistura said.
A senior Western diplomat said that the government delegation had failed to engage with de Mistura on a new constitution and elections during a round of negotiations due to end on Thursday.

""Clearly they did not have any intention to engage in this political process. And clearly they are not under sufficient pressure to do so,"" the diplomat told Reuters. ""The clear impression is the regime wants to avoid the U.N.-led political process at any cost.""

1497,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 03:03PM ET</span>",Merkel courts Germany's skittish SPD as talks open on government,"By Madeline Chambers
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) held their first formal talks on forming a government with Angela Merkel's conservatives on Wednesday, more than two months after the national election that plunged Europe's largest economy into unaccustomed uncertainty.
Merkel, weakened by heavy election losses to the far-right and then by the collapse last month of talks on a three-way alliance, is pinning her hopes on the SPD for a fourth term as chancellor and to avoid new elections.
Merkel's conservatives have already been ruling in a ""grand coalition"" with the SPD since 2013, but the SPD had planned to go into opposition after being punished by voters with its worst election result since World War Two.
However, after coalition talks with other parties collapsed, Merkel has had no place to turn but back to the SPD. 
Sensing that her lack of alternatives leaves it in a strong position, the SPD said it would agree to share power only if it wins commitments on more generous social policy.
""A decisive point for the SPD is that the social agenda has more prominence in Germany,"" leading Social Democrat Carsten Schneider told German television ahead of the talks, demanding ""fairness for ordinary heroes.""
Merkel made no comment as she arrived at the Berlin parliament building for talks with SPD leader Martin Schulz and the leader of her Bavarian conservative allies. 
But the mood between the two parties is still sour and Merkel herself has been a frequent target of criticism by the Social Democrats.
The secrecy surrounding the talks underlined their sensitivity. With both sides having a lot to lose, the parties plan no public statements when talks conclude on Wednesday evening.
Schulz has made a pitch for EU integration leading to a ""United States of Europe"" by 2025, and the SPD wants a big spending boost on education, more nursery spots and a big healthcare reform. Merkel wants to maintain Germany's solid finances, cut some taxes and expand the digital infrastructure. 
The SPD had vowed to go into opposition after its dismal election result and only softened its approach, agreeing to meet Merkel, due to pressure from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who wants to avoid new elections.
The SPD pulled no punches in attacking Merkel during the election campaign. Schulz has described Merkel, known for pragmatism rather than vision, as a vacuum cleaner of ideas and has also accused her of silencing debate on issues. 
A row last month over a conservative minister breaking protocol to back an extension for an EU license for a weed-killer despite SPD opposition hurt ties at a crucial time. 
One of the SPD's deputies, Ralf Stegner, adopted a combative tone on Wednesday, saying nobody could dictate the terms to the SPD as the conservative bloc needed the party to rule. 
Some in the SPD are prepared to contemplate another grand coalition, albeit with a clear SPD signature, but others prefer the idea of tolerating a minority government under Merkel. 
One other option is a ""KoKo"" (cooperation coalition) agreement under which the SPD would agree to work with Merkel in some areas, such as a budget and European and foreign affairs, but force her to seek ad hoc majorities for other policies.
This idea is unpopular with conservatives who prefer a grand coalition.

""We have to try it - but please, seriously,"" Carsten Linnemann, head of a group representing small and medium-sized businesses in the conservative bloc, told ARD television.

Marcelo Pinheiro Veiga, known as Marcelo Piloto, was arrested in the town of Encarnación after hiding out for years in Paraguay, which neighbors Brazil. From there he sent arms, drugs and ammunition to favelas dominated by Rio's largest gang, Rio state authorities said in a statement on Wednesday.
A police source who declined to be named confirmed that the gang was the CV. 
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration participated in the arrest of Veiga, who is wanted for murder, trafficking, and criminal association, the statement said. 
Rio's authorities are seeking to combat rising crime in the seaside tourist destination. Earlier this month, they arrested Rogerio ""Rogerio 157"" Avelino, a drug trafficker whose turf war with his former gang chief fueled spiraling violence in Rio's Rocinha favela.
Crime has spiked this year, as police have struggled to maintain security gains made in the run-up to the 2016 Olympics. A deep economic crisis has spurred big cutbacks in spending on police and other services.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 01:44PM ET</span>",Irish parliament committee backs referendum on abortion up to 12 weeks,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - An Irish parliamentary committee on Wednesday recommended that an abortion referendum due next year should offer the choice of allowing terminations with no restrictions up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy, a more liberal position than some had anticipated.
The cross-party committee's recommendations are not binding and the final wording of the planned referendum to change some of the world's strictest abortion laws will be down to the government and require the support of parliament. 
Abortion remains an acutely divisive issue in Ireland, where the once all-pervasive political influence of the Roman Catholic church has lessened in the past 20 years.
Legislation was changed only in 2013 to allow terminations in cases where the mother's life was in danger, after a woman who was having a miscarriage died of sepsis in a hospital where her medical team refused her pleas to end the failed pregnancy.
The government last year began a lengthy process to consider further changes and Prime Minister Leo Varadkar reiterated on Wednesday that he would like to call a referendum for next May once parliament has considered the committee's recommendations.
A IPSOS/MRBI poll in October showed that 57 percent of voters would support abortion in cases of rape, fatal foetal abnormality or a real risk to the life of the mother. This was widely seen as a likely option to be offered to voters. 
Just 24 percent in the same poll said they would support a right to abortion in all circumstances up to the 22nd week of pregnancy. 
In supporting a recommendation to legalize the termination of pregnancy ""with no restriction as to reason"" up to 12 weeks, the committee cited the complexities of legislating for the termination of pregnancy for reasons of rape and incest.
The measure was passed by 12 votes to five with four abstentions.
The committee, which has been holding hearings on the matter for the past three months, voted against a recommendation to allow abortion up to the 22nd week of pregnancy. 
The committee's proposals will be included in a report due to be handed to government on Dec. 20.
Some pro-choice activists have campaigned for a more liberal regime, closer to that of England, which allows terminations to be carried out up to 24 weeks after conception, while anti-abortion supporters demand no further changes to the law.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Eleven Congolese militia fighters were jailed for life on Wednesday for raping dozens of girls as young as 18 months during ceremonies meant to give the men supernatural powers, rights groups observing the trial said.
Human rights campaigners hailed the court's verdict as a landmark decision in a country where they say rape by armed groups is commonplace and often unpunished.
The fighters from Djeshi ya Yesu - the Army of Jesus - militia were accused of raping at least 37 girls near the village of Kavumu in Democratic Republic of Congo's South Kivu province between 2013 and 2016, the rights groups said.
According to the prosecution, the group's leader, provincial lawmaker Frederic Batumike, employed a spiritual adviser who told the fighters that raping very young children would give them mystical protection against their enemies.
Militia members, including Batumike, were also convicted of murder, membership in a rebel movement and illegal weapons possession. The court ruled that the rapes and murders amounted to crimes against humanity, the rights groups said.
The crimes triggered an international outcry. Rights groups accused the government of a slow response.
""This was necessary. The victims have been waiting. It's a strong signal to anyone who would contemplate this kind of offense,"" Charles Cubaka Cicura, a lawyer for the victims, told Reuters after the verdict was announced. 
Millions died in eastern Congo in regional wars between 1996 and 2003, most from hunger and disease. Dozens of armed groups continue to prey on local population and fight for control of the area's rich natural resources.
Experts say Congo has made some progress in combating sexual violence and several high-level militia and army commanders have been prosecuted in recent years, but the problem remains pervasive.
""This trial demonstrated that justice can be served in the Congo ... even when the accused wield significant power and are highly organised,"" said Karen Naimer of Physicians for Human Rights, one of the groups supporting the victims.
The mobile court which set up in Kavumu village allocated $5,000 in compensation to each rape victim and $15,000 to the families of men murdered by the militia, the groups said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - An independent U.N. human rights investigator said on Wednesday that he had information about an inmate being tortured at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay detention facility, despite Washington banning ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" almost 10 years ago.
The U.S. Department of Defense denied the allegation, saying there was no credible evidence to support it.
Nils Melzer, the U.N. special rapporteur on torture, said he had information that Ammar al-Baluchi - accused of being a co-conspirator in the 9/11 attacks on the United States - was being subjected to treatment that is banned under international law. 
""His torture and ill-treatment are reported to continue,"" a statement from the U.N. human rights office said, without giving details of the source of Melzer's information. 
""In addition to the long-term effects of past torture, noise and vibrations are reportedly still being used against him, resulting in constant sleep deprivation and related physical and mental disorders, for which he allegedly does not receive adequate medical attention,"" it said.
Major Ben Sakrisson, a Pentagon spokesman, said the allegation was not true.
""These claims have been investigated on multiple occasions in the past and no credible evidence has been found to substantiate his claims,"" he said.
The prison, which was opened by President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects captured overseas after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture.
His successor Barack Obama ended the use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" via executive order in January 2009, and reduced the inmate population to 41, but fell short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail.
President Donald Trump asked Congress earlier this year for funds to upgrade the jail, having said during his electoral campaign that he wanted to ""load it up with some bad dudes"".
Citing a 2014 Senate investigation, the U.N. statement said al-Baluchi was said to have suffered relentless torture for three-and-a-half years in CIA ""black sites"" before being moved to Guantanamo, where he had been in a severely restricted-access facility at Guantanamo Bay for more than a decade.
Al-Baluchi, a Kuwaiti-born Pakistani citizen also known as Abdul Aziz Ali, is the nephew and alleged co-conspirator of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 
IMPUNITY
Melzer said the ban on torture and ill-treatment was one of the most fundamental norms of international law and could not be justified in any circumstances, and called for prosecution of U.S. officials who had carried out torture.
""By failing to prosecute the crime of torture in CIA custody, the U.S. is in clear violation of the Convention against Torture and is sending a dangerous message of complacency and impunity to officials in the U.S. and around the world,"" Melzer said in the statement.
He said he had renewed a long-standing request to visit Guantanamo Bay to interview inmates, but he and his predecessors in the role had consistently been denied access. 
A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said that the U.S. constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment and requires humane conditions of confinement, including that of solitary confinement.

""We support the work of the U.N. special rapporteurs and the United States has a long history of engaging constructively on matters within mandates of the special rapporteurs,"" he said.

Lebanon will get six MD 530G light attack helicopters, six Scan Eagle drones, and communication and night vision equipment under the new programs, Ambassador Elizabeth Richard said after she met Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. 
The United States has given the Lebanese Armed Forces more than $1.5 billion in assistance over the past ten years, the Embassy has said previously. 
The United States hopes to strengthen the Lebanese army to stop the spread of violence over the border from neighboring Syria and help it become the sole military force defending the country.
Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group, which Washington regards as a terrorist organization, is a powerful military force in the country and also fights in Syria for President Bashar al-Assad. 
Lebanon hosts around 1.5 million Syrian refugees.

1504,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 01:00PM ET</span>","Report shows 1,300 unfilled jobs, strain for German defense procurement","BERLIN (Reuters) - The German military's procurement agency has 1,300 unfilled jobs, accounting for about 20 percent of its entire workforce, a report by the Defence Ministry showed on Wednesday, putting further strains on an already troubled acquisition system.
The gaps affect mainly high-level jobs in the technical and military sectors, which means the situation will remain problematic for the medium- to long-term, necessitating continued use of external consulting firms, the report said.
Lack of qualified personnel affects the processing of complex weapons programs, many of which have run into delays in recent years in the wake of reforms instituted by Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen after she took office in 2013.
""Use of external support services should not be understood as the beginning of a long-term solution, but as an efficient tool to bridge the time until personnel changes can fully take effect,"" the report said.
Von der Leyen kicked off reforms to improve the transparency and efficacy of the military acquisition system, but critics say the changes have complicated the process and resulted in delays.
The ministry failed to sign contracts for two of the biggest programs, a new missile defense system and the MKS180 warship, during von der Leyen's first tenure in the job.
The ministry did sign a contract for five new corvettes, but faced criticism for awarding the contract without a competition. Von der Leyen had argued that no competition was needed since the ships were follow-on orders for an existing design.
Separately, a ministry spokesman said at-sea testing of the new F125 frigate built by ThyssenKrupp and privately held Luerssen, would be delayed due to unexpected repairs.
The first new F125 frigate was now expected to enter into service in early 2018 instead of December, the spokesman said.
ThyssenKrupp said delays could happen with any complicated weapons program, but the ship was still expected to be delivered to the German military next year.
The first of the four new F125 warships, slated to cost 650 million euros each, was initially slated to enter service in 2014.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Rivals from the two sides of the European Union's migration dispute will meet in Brussels on Thursday in a goodwill gesture just as the bloc reopens a bitter feud over hosting refugees.
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy, which has at times been overwhelmed with mass arrivals of African refugees and migrants, will talk to the leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia in Brussels before all 28 EU leaders discuss migration over dinner.
The four eastern EU states have persistently refused to accept asylum-seekers to ease the burden on Italy and Greece, the other sea gateway to Europe, even at the height of arrivals in 2015 when more than a million people reached the bloc.
Since then on, Italy, Germany and other wealthy destination countries have called for an obligatory system of moving some of those arriving to other EU states when immigration spikes. 
They see it as a matter of European solidarity, which also manifests itself in the generous handouts the richer west provides.
But the easterners flatly reject any mandatory quotas on accepting people from the mainly-Muslim Middle East and Africa, saying that risks compromising their security after a raft of Islamist attacks in Europe since late 2015.
Instead, on Thursday the four will offer Gentiloni some 35 million euros ($41 mln) for EU-backed projects Rome has been leading in Libya to prevent people from trekking north to Europe. 
""TRENCH WARFARE"" 
But internally, the EU has been unable to agree on relocation, something one senior EU diplomat likened to ""fighting trench warfare"" that has badly undermined member states' trust in each other. 
Right before the EU leaders' summit in Brussels this Thursday and Friday, their chairman, Donald Tusk, reignited the dispute by coming out out strongly against ""divisive"" and ""ineffective"" obligatory quotas.
An EU scheme agreed for two years in 2015 - despite opposition by Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic - to relocate 160,000 people has only seen some 32,000 transfers from Italy and Greece. 
In an unusually public row between the EU's Brussels institutions, the bloc's executive arm, which has been a strong proponent of a mandatory and automated relocation, lashed out at Tusk. 
The executive European Commission's migration chief, Dimitris Avramopoulos, called Tusk's intervention ""unacceptable"" and ""anti-European"". 
The disagreement between Tusk and the Commission translates into divisions between member states, casting doubt on whether they will be able to reach an agreement by their June target date.
Another senior EU diplomat had only ""modest expectations"" of the leaders' migration discussion on Thursday evening, meaning they were not expected to take any decisions but, at best, make a small step towards unlocking a future agreement.

Tuesday's verdict by the Setubal district court sentenced Rui Pedro, the 36-year-old leader of the self-proclaimed Celestial Truth sect, to 23 years after finding him guilty of rape, procuring prostitution, child pornography and other crimes, a court official said on Wednesday. 
His wife and four other men were sentenced to prison terms of between 7 and 19 years. Two women were acquitted. The crimes were committed between 2011 and 2015, mostly on a farm rented by the group in 2014.
Prosecutors told the court that the cult was fake, and its rituals set up as a means to lure and scare the children.
The eight victims, including the leader's son and the son of another of the sentenced men, had been told that the sect's ""Master"" had supernatural powers and could perform ""acts of purification"" on them, which was the term for sexual abuse.
The boys, aged between 5 and 16 at the time of the crimes and mostly from the Setubal area, were kept in fear of his powers so they never disclosed what happened to anyone. 
Their families had been led to believe the children played football or studied and received psychological counselling or religious guidance on the farm.
Police arrested the group in 2015 after one of the members, Andre Marques, reported them to the authorities. He was still sentenced to 19 years, as the court ruled that he had only cooperated ""to save his own skin"", daily newspaper Publico reported.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition received a European Union prize for human rights on Wednesday and urged the world to keep a close eye on an upcoming presidential election where it aspires to end two decades of socialist rule in the OPEC nation.
Foes of President Nicolas Maduro failed to dislodge him during months of street protests this year that turned violent killing more than 125 people, and have been dismayed to see him consolidate his power in recent months.
But they hope a presidential vote due in 2018 will galvanize exhausted and despondent supporters, and want foreign pressure for reforms to an election system they say is at the service of Maduro's ""dictatorship"".
""In the next few months, there should be a presidential election and we ask Europe and the free world to pay full attention,"" Julio Borges, head of the opposition-led National Assembly, said, receiving the Sakharov Prize.
""The regime has kidnapped democracy, and installed hunger and misery,"" he added during the ceremony at the EU parliament in Strasbourg.
The prize, named after Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov, was awarded this year to Venezuela's National Assembly and ""all political prisoners"", according to the citation.
Venezuela's opposition won National Assembly elections in 2015, but the legislature has been sidelined by verdicts from the pro-government Supreme Court and the controversial election this year of a pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly superbody. 
Another opposition leader Antonio Ledezma, who recently escaped house arrest in Venezuela and fled to Spain, said the EU prize ceremony was a painful moment because of the scores of opposition activists still jailed.
""I cannot be happy receiving this prize knowing that in the dungeons of Venezuela there remain, unjustly deprived of liberty, more than 300 political prisoners,"" he said. 
Maduro, the 55-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez who has ruled Venezuela since 2013, denies the existence of political prisoners, saying all activists in detention are there for legitimate charges such as coup-plotting and violence.
Favorite to be the Socialist Party's candidate for the presidential vote, Maduro says he has faced down a U.S.-backed coup attempt by opponents this year. He frequently mocks both Borges and Ledezma in public speeches.
The opposition has a dilemma in choosing its candidate for the 2018 race, given that its most popular figures cannot run: Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest, while Henrique Capriles is prohibited from holding office. 
The European Union last month imposed an arms embargo on Venezuela, adding it to a list that includes North Korea and Syria.

The men were charged with spreading false information harmful to national security, two security sources familiar with the incident said, on condition of anonymity.
Egypt's interior ministry could not be reached for comment after several attempts to contact it on Wednesday.
Shafik announced last month his intention to run against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Egypt's upcoming presidential election early next year. No date has been set for the vote.
The former premier and ex-air force commander is seen by Sisi's critics as the most serious potential challenger to the incumbent. Those arrested were all members of Shafik's Egyptian National Movement party.
One of them, Hany Fouad, was arrested at his family's home on the outskirts of Cairo, his brother Wael Fouad said.
""Hany is very close to (Shafik),"" he said.
Security forces entered the family home around 3 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) and searched the house, confiscating two mobile phones and giving no reason for the arrest, he said.
Sisi has yet to announce that he will seek a second term but is widely expected to do so.
Shafik made his announcement from the United Arab Emirates where he has lived in exile since 2012, when he fled Egypt after a narrow electoral defeat to former president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, who was removed from office in a military takeover led by Sisi in 2013.
Shafik returned to Cairo ten days ago and said he was still deciding whether to run. He has not made any public appearances since.

1509,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 11:50AM ET</span>","Algeria's ruling caste set on orderly succession, when the time comes","By Samia Nakhoul and Lamine Chikhi
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algerians are facing the eventual departure of their long-serving president, the ailing Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in the knowledge that all is being done to ensure little changes when he goes.
The 80-year-old leader, who has ruled the North African country for nearly two decades, was incapacitated by a stroke in 2013 but may decide to run again in the next presidential election due in May 2019.
Should he bow out, though, many Algerians believe the person elected to replace him will be secondary. Just as now, observers say, a powerful ruling caste dominated by the army will run the show from behind the scenes.
That may be good news for an aged and thinning party elite from the Front de Liberation National (FLN), allied business tycoons and generals - collectively known as ""Le Pouvoir"" or ""The Powers That Be"" - that has long managed Algeria's politics.
It is a source of frustration, however, for young Algerians who have known no other leader. They worry less about who is in charge and more about jobs at a time of high unemployment, low oil prices and economic austerity. 
For Samir Abdelaoui, who studies at a private English language school, leaving the country may offer the way out. ""I don't care about politics, all I need is a decent job, if not here, then overseas. I want a visa, not a president,"" said Abdelaoui, who is learning English to increase his chances of getting a work visa abroad.
Speculation is rife abroad over what will happen to Algeria after the departure of Bouteflika, who has visited Europe several times for treatment and remained in hospital in France for months after his stroke. But inside Algeria, an apparent oasis of stability in a chaotic region, the regime's allies regard the problem as settled. 
""After Bouteflika the military command will organize the succession. The political class is weak here,"" said Anis Rahmani, Chairman of Ennahar TV, an insider close to the authorities.
HAUNTED BY WARS
One liberal Algerian analyst also expected continuity. ""The institutions in Algiers are stronger than the men. The men go but the institutions stay,"" the analyst said, requesting anonymity.
""The institutions are functioning well, whether Bouteflika is sick, in Algiers or abroad. As long as his health allows him to he will continue beyond 2018.""
Hopes for the election of a reformist, modernizing president who will bring in a competitive democracy and open society, have all but faded away. The priority, according to observers of Algeria's system, is the stability that its citizens see as incarnated in Bouteflika.
The former French colony, which freed itself in a brutal independence struggle that ended in 1962, is haunted by memories of a 1990s civil war that erupted after the state canceled elections when an Islamist party appeared set to win.
That conflict killed 200,000 people, leaving many Algerians wary later of the unrest that toppled the leaders of Tunisia, Egypt and Libya in the ""Arab Spring"" revolts of 2011.
""Algeria is a country in a very bad neighborhood and because we are in a bad neighborhood the army should remain involved. I don't think the army would want to seize power after Bouteflika but they will be part of the political process,"" said another Algerian political analyst who also requested anonymity.
DISCONNECTED YOUTHS
Young Algerians, who form two thirds of the population of 41 million, nevertheless feel left out and disconnected with a remote political class.
By contrast, French President Emmanuel Macron walked through the streets of Algiers on a visit last week and talked directly with excited young people - something they have not experienced with their own leader for a long time.
One of the analysts described the ruling class as ""totally obsolete in a country of youths"".
""We dream of a young class that has vitality, but the political class is not ready to give them one inch,"" said the analyst
Bouteflika, in power since 1999, is rarely seen and has not spoken in public since his stroke. Yet if he or his circle decides he will run for a fifth term, sources close to ""Le Pouvoir"" say, he would be without doubt elected.
The ruling FLN and the pro-government National Rally for Democracy dominate parliament while the opposition including leftists and Islamists is weak and divided.
MAINTAINING SOCIAL PEACE
If Bouteflika doesn't run, the tight circle of army generals and intelligence officials could produce a ""joker"" candidate from outside the political class. For now, though, the possible alternatives are all members of the old elite such as Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia or former premier Abelmalek Sellal.
Any succession scenario involving Said Bouteflika, the president's younger brother and a close aide, would be controversial as the military men don't favor hereditary rule, observers say.
Foreign diplomats say they expect the generals to arrange a smooth transition. Instead they worry more about how the country, which relies on oil and gas exports, will manage the state-controlled economy in an era of low energy prices.
The government spends about $30 billion a year to subsidize everything from basic foodstuffs and fuel to healthcare, housing and education. This system has helped to keep the social peace, but the government has failed to develop industries beyond the energy sector and is fiscally strapped.
Algeria has done little to encourage foreign investment despite the desperate need for jobs, and even less to ease visa restrictions or build hotels to attract tourists to its beaches, mountains and desert wilderness, all a short flight from Europe.
So far the uncontested success has been security. Even Western diplomats move freely without the convoys that accompany them in many other Arab capitals.
Still, remnants of al Qaeda remain active and have declared allegiance to Islamic State. A twin car bombing killed 67 in Algiers in 2007 and at least 38 hostages died when jihadis seized a gas plant in 2013. 
The security services have also uncovered and infiltrated sleeper cells while Algeria has closed all its border crossings with Libya, Mali, Niger, Morocco and Mauritania, turning them into military zones to prevent jihadis scattered across the Sahel region from connecting with each other.

The next president should be a strongman who will guarantee security because we are in a state of war against terrorism,"" said Rahmani. ""There is an external threat. The borders are all on fire. The next president should have a military background, power and authority to decide.""

ABUJA (Reuters) - A bill proposed by Nigerian lawmakers to regulate non-governmental organizations (NGOs) threatens freedoms by handing the government sweeping powers over civil society, an array of groups said on Wednesday.
In a public hearing in Nigeria's capital of Abuja, representatives from several NGOs called for the bill to be killed, describing it as ""extremely dangerous"", ""crippling"" for civil society and potentially endangering to life.
""For organizations that engage in human rights advocacy, government accountability, and the promotion of democracy, interference in their operations portends grave risks to both their work and on the lives of their personnel,"" said Nigerian NGO Spaces for Change in a statement.
Nigeria's Policy and Legal Advocacy Centre (PLAC) warned that ""there is no doubt that the first victims of the bill would be NGOs that are traditionally active in the area of ensuring accountability and transparency of government to its citizens.""
The sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives, Nigeria's lower parliamentary chamber, has alleged that some NGOs were using donated funds to support the activities of armed militants and insurgents such as Boko Haram in the country's northeast, according to Nigerian media reports. 
The sponsor, Umar Jibril, has not made public any evidence supporting his allegations.
The draft law, which passed a second reading in the lower house of parliament and is being publicly debated ahead of a final reading and vote, would regulate NGOs' funding, activities and foreign affiliation in the name of national security, and have control over NGOs' assets. 
The bill would also create an NGO Regulatory Commission, with which civil society bodies would need to register or be in breach of the law. 
The commission would have discretion over which groups can register, and all must re-register every two years.
At present setting up an NGO is a simpler process, with many groups registering with the corporate affairs commission as a not-for-profit organization.
While the constitution guarantees Nigerians' assembly and association rights, the Freedom House rights watchdog says Nigeria, Africa's most populous democracy, is only partly free.
In a 2017 report, Freedom House said the country had a broad and vibrant civil society but government forces continued ""to commit gross human rights violations with impunity, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary mass arrests, illegal detentions, and torture of civilians"".
NGO representatives at the public hearing described how, by giving the regulatory commission discretion to approve projects, lives could be at stake in emergencies, such as when funds are urgently needed for vaccines during an outbreak of disease.
Others criticized as vague the bill's repeated justification of maintaining national security, saying it was open to broad interpretations that could give the government ample opportunity for misuse of state power without accountability.
An Amnesty International statement said the bill ""will keep Nigerians from freely sharing their opinions, holding open discussion forums or organizing people to protest.""

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Muslim leaders condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Wednesday and called on the world to respond by recognizing East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who hosted the summit of more than 50 Muslim countries in Istanbul, said the U.S. move meant Washington had forfeited its role as broker in efforts to end Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
""From now on, it is out of the question for a biased United States to be a mediator between Israel and Palestine, that period is over,"" Erdogan said at the end of the meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation member states.
""We need to discuss who will be a mediator from now on. This needs to be tackled in the UN too,"" Erdogan said.
A communique posted on the Turkish Foreign Ministry website said the emirs, presidents and ministers gathered in Istanbul regarded Trump's move ""as an announcement of the U.S. Administration's withdrawal from its role as sponsor of peace"".
It described the decision as ""a deliberate undermining of all peace efforts, an impetus (for) extremism and terrorism, and a threat to international peace and security"".
Leaders including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani and Jordan's King Abdullah, a close U.S. ally, all criticized Washington's move.
""Jerusalem is and always will be the capital of Palestine,"" Abbas said, adding Trump's decision was ""the greatest crime"" and a violation of international law.
The Trump administration says it remains committed to reaching peace between Israel and the Palestinians and its decision does not affect Jerusalem's future borders or status.
It says any credible future peace deal will place the Israeli capital in Jerusalem, and ditching old policies is needed to revive a peace process frozen since 2014.
But Abbas told the leaders in Istanbul that Washington had shown it could no longer be an honest broker. 
""It will be unacceptable for it to have a role in the political process any longer since it is biased in favor of Israel,"" he said. ""This is our position and we hope you support us in this.""
""PALESTINIAN CAPITAL""
Jerusalem, revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, is home to Islam's third holiest site and has been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in an action not recognized internationally.
The communique on the Turkish ministry website and a separate ""Istanbul Declaration"" distributed to journalists after the meeting said the leaders called on all countries to recognize East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.
""We invite the Trump Administration to reconsider its unlawful decision that might trigger...chaos in the region, and to rescind its mistaken step,"" the declaration said.
Iran, locked in a regional rivalry with Saudi Arabia, said the Muslim world should overcome internal problems through dialogue so it could unite against Israel. Tehran has repeatedly called for the destruction of the Israeli state and backs several militant groups in their fight against it. 
""America is only seeking to secure the maximum interests of the Zionists and it has no respect for the legitimate rights of Palestinians,"" Rouhani told the summit. 
King Abdullah, whose country signed a peace treaty with Israel more than 20 years ago, said he rejected any attempt to alter the status quo of Jerusalem and its holy sites. 
Abdullah's Hashemite dynasty is custodian of Jerusalem's Muslim sites, making Amman sensitive to any changes in the city.
Not all countries were represented by heads of government. Some sent ministers and Saudi Arabia, another close ally of Washington's, sent a junior foreign minister.
Summit host Turkey has warned that Trump's decision would plunge the world into ""a fire with no end in sight"".
Erdogan described it as reward for Israeli actions including occupation, settlement construction, land seizure and ""disproportionate violence and murder"".
""Israel is an occupying state (and) Israel is a terror state,"" he told the summit. 
""I invite all countries supporting international law to recognize Jerusalem as the occupied capital of Palestine. We cannot be late any more,"" Erdogan told leaders and ministers from more than 50 Muslim countries.
Trump's declaration has been applauded by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Washington had an irreplaceable part to play in the region.

""There is no substitute to the role that the United States plays in leading the peace process,"" he said at a Hanukkah holiday candle lighting ceremony on Tuesday.

LIMA (Reuters) - A public prosecutor in Peru is seeking the pre-trial detention of Luis Figari, founder of an elite Catholic society who is accused of sexually and physically abusing children and former members of the group, the attorney for the victims of the alleged abuse told Reuters on Wednesday.
The prosecutor will ask a judge to order Figari and three other former leaders of Sodalitium Christianae Vitae to spend up to nine months in jail ahead of trial, said Hector Gadea. 
Gadea said he received a copy of the prosecutor's so-called preventive prison request earlier on Wednesday and a hearing on the request has yet to be scheduled. 
The prosecutors' office did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Figari, who lives in Rome, has denied wrongdoing. He could not immediately be reached for comment.
Gadea said prosecutor Maria Leon is charging Figari and other former leaders of the Sodalitium of conspiracy to commit crimes because statute of limitations would prohibit charges for most of the alleged abuse.
The attorney general's office first opened a probe into Figari in 2015 following the publication of a book into the alleged abuse by Peruvian investigative journalists Pedro Salinas and Pao Ugaz.
Salinas was a former member of Sodalitium, whose members include businessmen, writers and politicians from Lima's upper classes, and described Figari as an authoritarian leader who raped and molested vulnerable boys in the group.
The probe had been closed early this year but was later reopened by a new prosecutor.
""Without a doubt this is redemption for the victims. This is no longer a struggle we're fighting alone,"" Gadea said.
Figari is not clergy but Sodalitium has pontifical approval. The accusations against Figari come as Pope Francis has promised to hold all sex abusers in the Church accountable.
Sodalitium was founded in 1971 before expanding in Latin America, Italy and the United States.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Embassy in London moves next month to a new billion-dollar home overlooking the River Thames -- just as U.S. President Donald Trump's actions have placed strains on the ""special relationship"" between Britain and the United States.
Britain's closest ally will leave behind an imposing 1960 stone and concrete embassy in London's upmarket Grosvenor Square (NYSE:SQ) -- an area known as 'Little America' during World War Two, when the square also housed the military headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The old embassy was also a focus for British discontent with U.S. policy. Anti-Vietnam War protests in the 1960s drew thousand of Britons, including celebrities of the day like Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger.
The new 12-storey building on the south bank of the river is at the heart of a huge regeneration project in a former industrial zone known as ""Nine Elms"". Set in what will become an urban park, it will open for business on Jan. 16, hosting 800 staff and about 1,000 visitors each day.
""This embassy, when you look out through the windows, it reflects the global outlook of the U.S. going forward in the 21st century: rather looking out, than looking in,"" said Woody Johnson, Trump's appointed U.S. ambassador to Britain.
The U.S. State Department ran a competition to design the new building in 2008. Its $1 billion construction was wholly funded by the sale of other properties in London. 
The glass structure ""gives form to core democratic values of transparency, openness and equality"" a State Department briefing document said. Inside the cube, visitors will be greeted by an imposing stone facade featuring the bald eagle of the United States' Great Seal.
The embassy is also designed to exacting security specifications, set back at least 100 feet (30 meters) from surrounding buildings - mostly newly-erected high-rise residential blocks - and incorporating living quarters for the U.S. Marines permanently stationed inside. 
""This isn't just a new office, though, it signifies a new era of friendship between out two countries. President Trump wants us to work more closely than ever with the UK,"" Johnson said. 
The British relationship with its former colony is a broad political, cultural and military alliance forged over the last century and exercised on battlefields around the world. But it has been tested in recent months.
Prime Minister Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit the White House after Trump's surprise election in November 2016 and used the trip to invite him for a full state visit. 
While the two leaders have committed to strengthen trade links and have spoken regularly, their governments have disagreed on several issues, such as Trump's decision to decertify Iran's compliance with a multilateral nuclear deal, and his move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
A possible state visit by Trump remains a contentious issue among Britons, with lawmakers and campaign groups calling for the offer to be rescinded and promising to take to the streets in protest if he does come to Britain. 
""The right to protest is a basic right in this country and our country. Expressing one's view is well within the bounds of reasonableness,"" Johnson said.
He said he hoped Trump could attend an as-yet unscheduled opening ceremony for the new building but that there were no firm plans in place.

This month, May publicly criticized Trump for reposting British far-right anti-Islam videos from his Twitter accounts. He responded with a rebuke, telling May to focus on Islamic extremism in Britain.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 10:30AM ET</span>","Presidential hopeful wants Finland out of EU, says nationalists will bounce back","By Jussi Rosendahl and Tuomas Forsell
HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland will leave the European Union and position itself as the Switzerland of the north to protect its independence if Laura Huhtasaari, the presidential candidate of the eurosceptic Finns Party has her way.
She also told Reuters in an interview she wants to tighten immigration rules.
Huhtasaari -- dubbed ""Finland's Marine Le Pen"" after France's National Front leader -- is a long-shot. But she believes she has a real chance in the January election as her party has taken a fresh start following its removal from the coalition government in June.
""The rise in Europe of parties that are critical towards the EU and immigration is due to bad, unjust politics,"" she said. ""The role for Finland in the euro zone is the role of a loser and payer...
""I do not want Finland to become a province of EU, Finns must stand up for Finland's interests.""
The Finns Party, formerly called ""True Finns"", rose from obscurity during the euro zone debt crisis with an anti-EU platform, complicating the bloc's bailout talks with troubled states.
It expanded into the second-biggest parliamentary party in 2015 and joined the government, but then saw its support drop due to compromises in the three-party coalition.
This June, the party picked a new hard-line leadership and got kicked out of the government, while more than half of its lawmakers left the party and formed a new group to keep their government seats.
Huhtasaari, 38, who was picked as deputy party leader in June, said voters were still confused after the split-up but that the party would eventually bounce back.
""The game is really brutal. The biggest parties want us to disappear from the political map. No-one is in politics looking for friends.""
The Finns party ranks fifth in polls with a support of 9 percent, down from 17.7 percent in 2015 parliamentary election, while the new ""Blue Reform"" group, which has five ministers, is backed by only 1-2 percent.
STEP FORWARD, STEP BACK
Incumbent President Sauli Niinisto, who originally represented the centre-right NCP party, is widely expected to be elected for a second six-year term by a wide margin.
A poll by Alma Media last week showed 64 percent of voters supporting Niinisto while 12 percent backed lawmaker Pekka Haavisto from the Greens. Huhtasaari, a first term lawmaker, was backed by 3 percent of those polled.
""Things happen slowly when you're fighting against the hegemony... I still have time before the elections,"" she said.
Huhtasaari, who supports U.S. President Donald Trump and Britain's former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, said the European eurosceptic movement was gradually strengthening despite a series of blows to anti-establishment parties.
France's National Front and Italy's 5-Star Movement failed in attempts to win legislative and civic elections while UKIP won no seats in the British parliament, albeit that its goal of Brexit won a referendum.
""Any change takes time, a step forward and step back... But the movement strengthens all the time,"" she said, noting Austria's Freedom Party's strong performance in October elections.
Markku Jokisipila, the director at the Center for Parliamentary Studies of the University of Turku, said Huhtasaari was unlikely to succeed in the Jan 28 election.
Around 70 percent of Finns support EU membership and the centre-right government is committed to the euro.
""There's no way around it, she is very inexperienced politically for this election,"" Jokisipila said.
He added that the Finns party had become more united after the June split-up, but that it was now too focused on its anti-immigration and anti-EU platforms to be able to increase support.

""They will not disappear from the Finnish politics. The challenge is to broaden their profile... but they have also proved that they do have surprise potential.""

1515,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 10:20AM ET</span>",Jewish groups in Germany urge crackdown on anti-Semitic acts,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - Jewish groups in Germany are pressing the authorities to crack down on anti-Semitic acts following the burning of Jewish symbols and Israeli flags at protests.
The American Jewish Committee Berlin, the JSUD group of Jewish university students, the Central Council of Jews in Germany, and the German-Israeli Society have called for tougher law enforcement and for new laws to make it easier to ban or disband anti-Semitic demonstrations.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top German officials have condemned anti-Semitic acts seen at demonstrations against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and vowed to prosecute illegal acts.
The American Jewish Committee Berlin said a new study by an Indiana University professor showed broader efforts were also needed to fight anti-Semitic attitudes among Muslim migrants from Syria and Iraq.
German has opened its borders to more than 1 million migrants mainly fleeing Middle East wars since 2015, sparking concerns about a further bump in already increasing anti-Semitism.
""Politicians must guarantee that anti-Semitic attitudes will not be tolerated and that infractions to laws and regulations will be prosecuted,"" said the group's director, Deidre Berger.
She reiterated a longstanding call for the German government to appoint an anti-Semitism commissioner to focus attention on the issue.
German Justice Minister Heiko Maas and Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller vowed during a menorah lighting at the Brandenburg Gate on Tuesday to combat all forms of anti-Semitism, while demonstrators continued to voice anger at the U.S. move at a separate event near Berlin's main train station.
The Central Council of Muslims in Germany has also condemned anti-Semitic actions.
Indiana University's Guenther Jikeli, the author of the study, said group interviews of 68 migrants aged 18 to 52 conducted last year revealed widespread anti-Semitic attitudes. They showed rejection of the state of Israel and ignorance about the murder of 6 million Jews in Europe by the Nazis during World War Two, he said.
""There are strong anti-Semitic views among refugees that need to be addressed because otherwise they could become the norm,"" he told Reuters TV.
Kurds and other refugees persecuted as minorities in their home countries had more nuanced views and more clearly rejected anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli perspectives, he said.
Fabian Weissbarth, spokesman for AJC, said the study should spur efforts to tackle anti-Semitism among migrants to ensure the findings were not misused by anti-immigrant far-right groups like the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
""If we don't address it as a society, then the AfD will, and that will lead to hate and incitement,"" he said. ""We need a differentiated view that recognizes that not all refugees are the same, and we need to look at solutions, such as integration measures, what needs to be included in integration courses, and changes in how social workers and politicians react.""

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 08:53AM ET</span>","Exclusive: After Grenfell fire, same builders rehired to replace dangerous cladding, Reuters finds","By Tom Bergin
LONDON (Reuters) - Some building companies that installed dangerous cladding on social housing blocks across Britain are now winning new contracts following the Grenfell Tower blaze to remove their original work and install panels that can pass safety tests, a Reuters review shows.
The safety of high-rise buildings has come under scrutiny since the Grenfell disaster in June which killed 71 people. The British government, which ordered a series of tests to establish which types of cladding panels met fire safety rules, said those on the London tower block did not comply.
A Reuters review identified 65 other towers with cladding of a type that was approved by local building inspectors, but which government tests found did not comply with the statutory regulations. The towers were clad by major builders including French groups Engie (PA:ENGIE) and  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY), and Britain's  Galliford Try  (L:GFRD), Forrest, Wates Group, Rydon Group and Willmott Dixon. 
The Reuters review was based on publicly available building planning permission documents, which detail the work carried out and the materials used, as well as visits to the towers and statements from housing providers and builders. 
For 29 of the buildings, the same builders that installed the cladding have won new contracts to remove or replace the panels, according to the owners of the buildings, who said they were paying millions of pounds for the work. The rehired companies are Willmott Dixon, Wates and Engie. 
Willmott Dixon and Rydon said their cladding work complied with safety regulations, but did not say how. Wates, Bouygues, Galliford Try and Engie declined to answer questions on whether their work complied with regulations.
""Following the Grenfell tragedy, we have been supporting the relevant councils, and removed the cladding where requested. Our primary concern is to ensure all residents in these buildings are secure and safe,"" said an Engie spokesman.
In the wake of Grenfell, the government ordered an independent review into building regulations and fire safety, and the way the rules are complied with and enforced. The review is due to report its findings early next year. 
The 65 towers in question are owned by local governments - known as councils - or housing associations, which are publicly funded, non-profit bodies that provide housing intended for low-income people. 
At the time all the panels were installed, building inspectors - usually council workers but sometimes staff of inspection firms licensed by councils - signed off the work as being compliant with safety regulations, according to the owners of the blocks and the building firms involved. 
Chris Blythe, CEO of trade body the Chartered Institute of Building, said builders hired to carry out high-rise cladding projects used many subcontractors and advisers, and that this could lead to misunderstandings, with one party thinking another had ensured work was compliant. 
""The business model we have is almost geared up for potential failure,"" said Blythe, adding that if fewer parties were involved, there would be less room for confusion over responsibilities.
For all 65 blocks identified by Reuters, the councils or council-licensed firms whose inspectors approved the work as compliant either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment while the independent review was ongoing.
The government has already acknowledged problems with the inspection process, with Fire Service Minister Nick Hurd saying in July there was a ""system failure, built up over many years"" in the area of regulation enforcement. 
However a spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), which ordered the cladding tests and regulations review, said sign-off by inspectors did not absolve contractors of responsibility to meet safety standards. 
FIRE TESTS
Cladding systems are panels put up on the outside of buildings to improve their aesthetics and energy efficiency. 
Since 2006, building regulations have required materials used in cladding on high-rise buildings to be able to pass the ""BS 8414 test"" which measures combustibility.
After Grenfell, the DCLG ordered a series BS 8414 tests to establish which types of cladding met fire safety rules. It said that, of around 600 social housing towers in England that had cladding, 161 had systems of a type that failed the tests. But it did not name the towers.
Reuters identified 60 blocks which, since 2006, had been cladded with aluminum panels with polyethylene cores - a form of cladding that failed the DCLG's test, and which the prime minister and three other ministers have said breaches safety regulations when used in tall buildings. Five other blocks, also cladded since 2006, had combinations of panel and insulation board that failed the test. 
The three companies that were rehired to replace the cladding on 29 of the towers had all originally fitted aluminum panels with polyethylene cores. 
Wates secured contracts with Westminster council in central London and One Manchester housing association to reclad 14 towers it covered in 2007 and 2010. 
Willmott Dixon has received contracts from Oxford council and west London's Octavia housing association to replace panels it installed on three blocks early this year and in 2013.
Engie has been hired by Barnet Homes in north London to replace cladding on three blocks it clad in 2012. It also has a contract to remove cladding from nine blocks in Salford, north England, owned by the local council that it clad around 2016. 
Engie has been hired to remove panels from 12 blocks it clad in 2012 and 2016, and install new cladding on three of them. The contracts are with housing associations Barnet Homes in north London, and Pendleton Together in Salford, north England. 
The three building companies declined to comment on how much the contracts were worth.
However five of the six owners of the buildings told Reuters how much money they were paying for the work.
Oxford council said about 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) for its two blocks; Octavia said about 2 million pounds for one block, Westminster council said about 6 million pounds for six blocks; and Barnet Homes said 8.2 million pounds for three blocks. 
Salford council said it expects to spend up to 25 million pounds in total for the removal and recladding work on nine blocks. Engie has been hired to remove its original panels, but the recladding contractor has not yet been named.
One Manchester declined to comment on how much its recladding work would cost. 
The building companies declined to comment on the figures.
LEGAL ACTION
Jonathan Raynes a partner with law firm Steptoe & Johnson said councils or housing associations who paid contractors for cladding that turned out to be non-compliant could sue the contractor for the cost of replacing the cladding. 
""The contract will almost certainly have a provision that says the contractor must build in accordance with statutory requirements,"" he said, adding that if the contract didn't say this, a requirement to act legally could be deemed implicit.
Raynes and Adam Creasey, a solicitor with Lewis Nedas, said the fact building inspectors signed off on work did not remove the builder's responsibility to adhere to building regulations. Creasey added a builder could conceivably try and reclaim any money awarded against it from the body which provided the inspection sign-off. 
Reuters contacted the owners of all 65 blocks with cladding of a type that failed the government tests - seven local councils and 10 housing associations - and asked if they were considering legal action against contractors to recover the money spent on cladding, or to cover the cost of replacement.
Only Camden council in north London said it was considering legal action. It declined to elaborate on its plans.
Barnet said it was not seeking any money from its contractor, Engie, over the original cladding but declined to say why. Westminster council said it was not seeking any money from its contractor, Wates, because it believed the original work was compliant with the rules in place at the time. 
Oxford council said it had not sought money from Willmott Dixon over the original cladding and would only consider taking legal advice after the independent review was completed. 

One Manchester said it would not talk about seeking recompense while the review was on-going.

PRETORIA (Reuters) - South Africa's High Court ruled on Wednesday that President Jacob Zuma, under fire for alleged corruption, must set up a judicial inquiry into state influence-peddling within 30 days.
In the latest in a series of judicial blows to Zuma's scandal-tinged administration, the court upheld recommendations by South Africa's anti-graft watchdog calling for an inquiry. Zuma had challenged the move.
High Court Judge President Dunstan Mlambo said Zuma's application against the inquiry was ""ill-advised and reckless"" and an abuse of the judicial process.
Zuma had challenged the right of the report's author to call for a judicial inquiry and the appointment by the chief justice of a judge to head it. Zuma said it was his prerogative whether to set up such an inquiry.
It was not immediately clear if Zuma would appeal and a spokesman for Zuma was not immediately available to comment on the ruling.
Zuma has survived several votes of no-confidence in parliament. 
In October the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld an earlier decision by a lower court that the nearly 800 corruption charges relating to an arms deal filed against Zuma before he became president in 2009 be reinstated. 
Political instability, including questions over who will replace Zuma -- his African National Congress will choose its new leader over the weekend -- has been a major driver in South African debt being rated ""junk"".
South Africa's economy has grown lethargically over the last six years and the jobless rate stands near record levels. Analysts say the political crisis is making it hard to reform the economy, improve social services and fight crime.
The influence-peddling inquiry was recommended in a report released a year ago by the Public Protector, the country's anti-graft agency. Zuma also sought to block the report's release.
The report focused on allegations that Zuma's friends, the businessmen and brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers. Zuma and the Guptas have denied all accusations of wrongdoing.
'ABUSE OF PROCESS'
Ordering Zuma to pay the costs of the latest court challenge, Mlambo, the chief justice, said the president's conduct was ""clearly objectionable ... and amounts to clear abuse of the judicial process"".
Mlambo said a judicial commission was best suited to investigate the allegations against Zuma.
""The allegations ... detailed in the report are extremely serious,"" Mlambo said. 
The court ordered that once the inquiry is set up, it should complete its task and present its report to Zuma within 180 days. The president would then have to inform parliament of the action he planned to take based on the inquiry's findings within 14 days of receiving its report, the court said. 
Opposition leader Mmusi Maimane, who was at the court, welcomed the ruling.
""The judgment lays out a timeline ... we hope to get to the bottom of this,"" Maimane said, adding that his party would oppose any appeal in the case should Zuma launch one. 
Thuli Madonsela, the report's author who was also at the court, said: ""An allegation that the state has been captured in the interests of the president and his friends is an allegation that needs to be investigated immediately.""
Her 355-page report, titled ""State of Capture"", stopped short of asserting that crimes had been committed, saying the watchdog lacked the resources to reach such conclusions and recommended that they be investigated by a judicial inquiry.

On Friday, the top court ruled that Zuma's appointment of a state prosecutor was not valid and should be set aside immediately. Zuma is appealing that ruling.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has told at least 10 foreign-funded aid groups to close, an umbrella agency said on Wednesday, including a charity founded by hedge fund billionaire and philanthropist George Soros, the group said.
Pakistan has toughened its stance towards domestic and international non-governmental groups in recent years, accusing some of using their work as a cover for espionage.
In January, it ordered about a dozen groups working on women's issues and human rights to halt their operations.
A representative of the Pakistan Humanitarian Forum (PHF), which represents 63 international aid groups, said the Ministry of Interior had issued 10 of its members ""letters of rejection"", meaning their applications to register had been rejected.
The forum did not identify the 10 groups but two international groups, the Pakistani branch of the Soros’ charity the Open Society Foundations, and ActionAid, said they had been told they had to close.
""We obviously find what has happened both disappointing and surprising, and are urgently seeking clarification,"" the executive director of the Open Society's Pakistani office, Saba Khattak, said in a statement.
The group had spent $37 million on grants and relief assistance in Pakistan since 2005, she said.
The interior ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
However, the ministry, in a letter to one of the 10 groups and seen by Reuters, said its registration application had been denied.
""Wind up operations/activities of above said INGO within 60 days,"" the ministry said in the letter. 
It did give a reason why the group had to stop its work.
The ministry lists 139 international non-governmental organizations (INGO) on its website that have submitted registration applications, of which 72 are still being processed. 
There is no list of those whose applications have been denied.
""During the lengthy INGO registration process we provided all the information and documents required and are confident we comply with all necessary rules and regulations,"" ActionAid country director Iftikhar Nizami said in a statement. 
This year, medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres was ordered to stop work at three facilities in violence-plagued ethnic Pashtun areas bordering Afghanistan, although the interior ministry lists the group as an approved INGO. 
The Save the Children aid group fell afoul of the government in 2011, when it was linked to a Pakistani doctor recruited by the CIA to help in the hunt that led to the killing of al Qaeda militant leader Osama bin Laden in the town of Abbottabad.
Save the Children’s foreign staff were expelled from Pakistan soon after the accusations surfaced, but more than 1,000 local staff continued to operate. 
The charity denied any links with the doctor or the CIA.

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 08:07AM ET</span>",Saudi King Salman says determined to confront corruption,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz said on Wednesday his government was determined to confront corruption with ""justice and decisiveness"", signalling continued support for a crackdown on sleaze involving mass arrests of top Saudis including royals.
In a televised speech to the country's consultative Shura council, Salman also said the world's largest oil exporter will work to enable the private sector to become a partner in the kingdom's economic diversification drive away from petroleum.
Saudi security forces rounded up hundreds of members of the political and business elite, including princes and tycoons, in early November: Riyadh said it was a crackdown on corruption but the move was also widely seen as helping Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman tighten his grip on power.
The purge has caused concern about damage to the economy, especially among foreign investors the kingdom is seeking to attract. But the government has insisted it is respecting due process and that the companies of detained businessmen will continue operating normally.
In a speech focused on economic issues, Salman said the kingdom was pushing ahead with its ""Vision 2030"" economic reform plan to find new sources of revenue for the OPEC powerhouse.
But he said that corruption was one of the main threats to economic development.
""We have decided, with God's help, to confront it (corruption) with justice and decisiveness so that our country can enjoy the renaissance and development that every citizen aspires for,"" he said.
Signaling his support for the campaign of arrests, he said that he had ordered the formation of a higher committee against corruption headed by the crown prince.
""Thanks be to God that those are a few (people),"" he said, referring to the number of arrestees.
The public prosecutor said last week that most of those detained in the anti-corruption campaign have agreed to settlements to avoid prosecution, while the rest could be held for months.
Salman said the restructuring the kingdom was undertaking did not contradict its Islamic values, which he said were based on moderate Islam.
""There is no place among us for an extremist who sees moderation as deviation, or who would exploit our benevolent faith to achieve his goals,"" he added.
Salman also reiterated Saudi Arabia's condemnation of President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the U.S. embassy to the city.

In an apparent reference to arch-foe Iran, Salman also said Saudi Arabia was working with its allies to confront any ""tendency for external interference in the internal affairs and fan the flames of sectarian sedition, and undermine regional security and stability"". He did not elaborate.

The man, John Ausonius, went on a racially motivated spree in Sweden in 1991 and 1992 in which he killed one person and injured 10 others in attacks in the Stockholm area, for which he is currently serving a life sentence in Sweden.
Dubbed the ""laser man"" by Swedish media for his use of a laser sight and rifle for some of the shootings, he is thought to have inspired anti-immigrant attacks such as the 2011 massacre by Norwegian Anders Breivik and shootings by Peter Mangs in Sweden.
Ausonius, now 64, is suspected of having shot dead a woman in broad daylight in Frankfurt in 1992 while on the run from the authorities after the shootings in Sweden.
He had accused the 68-year-old woman of stealing an electronic notebook from his coat pocket in the cloakroom of the Frankfurt hotel in which she worked, a spokeswoman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's office said on Wednesday.
""The prosecution believes that the defendant thought the woman had his electronic notebook in her handbag,"" she told Reuters TV outside the courthouse.
Ausonius has denied killing the woman but has not objected to being transferred to Germany for the trial on condition he serves any possible jail sentence in Sweden.

After the murder trial ends, he is to be returned to Sweden where a court sentenced him to life in 1995 for the Stockholm shootings as well as a string of bank robberies.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's new prime minister faces a difficult balancing act trying to repair bruised relations with the European Union without alienating the eurosceptic government's core voters.
A Western-educated former banker who is fluent in German and English and was sworn in on Monday, Mateusz Morawiecki boasts the credentials needed to negotiate with Brussels.
But any compromises to improve relations with Brussels, which sees the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party as a threat to democracy, would risk upsetting the traditional, Catholic supporters who propelled it into power two years ago.
It is a gamble that could backfire, and it is not yet clear how far Morawiecki, 49, and his party, dominated by former Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, are ready to go to please Brussels. 
""The idea to build up international credibility seems rational,"" said Jaroslaw Flis, a sociologist at the Jagiellonian University. ""But such actions would have to be in complete contrast with what Mateusz Morawiecki would have to do domestically to prevent the PiS from falling apart.""
The PiS government has alienated many people at home and abroad with its nationalist rhetoric and changes to state institutions which the EU says subvert the bloc's laws.
The European Commission, the EU executive, opened an inquiry into the rule of law in Poland in January 2016 and the European Parliament has started a process that could deprive Poland of its voting rights in the 28-nation bloc.
Any hope in Brussels that Morawiecki's appointment signals a change of course by PiS will have been tempered by Polish parliament approving legal changes to the judiciary in defiance of the EU on Friday - the day after his nomination.
The changes give parliament, where PiS has a majority, de facto control over the selection of judges.
LOOKING FOR CLUES
EU leaders looking for clues about Morawiecki's plans will also have taken little comfort from comments he has made since being nominated, making clear he backs a tough line on the EU and believes in PiS's traditional vision of the Polish state. 
""We want to transform Europe, this is my dream, to re-christianise it,"" Morawiecki told the Catholic Radio Maryja broadcaster. ""We want Poland to be strong, but also to contain ... Christian values. We will defend them against the background of laicisation and a deepening consumerism.""
Asked by the radio interviewer about demands by French President Emmanuel Macron for Poland to face sanctions over a subversion of democratic rules, Morawiecki said he would not ""bow down to blackmail.""
In comments to parliament on Tuesday, Morawiecki suggested Poland might relent in a conflict with Brussels over logging in an ancient forest, which an EU court has said contravenes EU laws.
But he said Poland's national interests came first in any debate over the future of the EU and that he ""wholeheartedly"" supported PiS's overhaul of the judiciary.
Like Beata Szydlo, whom he replaced as prime minister, Morawiecki is likely to have to defer to PiS leader and co-founder Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Prime minister from July 2006 to November 2007, Kaczynski is widely seen as the power behind the party and Poland's main decision-maker.
How much scope that will leave Morawiecki to carve out his own path remains to be seen. Former Polish President Lech Walesa, a PiS critic, has suggested that nothing of substance will change.
""The circus has stayed the same, only the clowns have changed their roles,"" Walesa, who led the Solidarity trade union movement that ended communist rule, said on Twitter. 
The appointment of Morawiecki, whose father founded and led a radical offshoot of Solidarity in the 1980s, appears designed in part to present a new face of Poland to the EU.
Szydlo, 54, at times responded angrily to EU criticism and relations with the bloc soured under her government. Underlining PiS opposition to Muslim immigration, she said last month Poland wanted to be sure Christian traditions were not subject to ""ideological censorship"" in the EU.
Along with Hungary, Poland has refused to take in any of its quota of the wave of refugees from Syria and elsewhere who have come to Europe since 2015, on the grounds that Muslim immigrants are a threat to national security and stability. 
Such comments appeal to core PiS voters, and Szydlo's government, which promised generous welfare payouts and a dedication to traditional Catholic values, was one of Poland's most popular since communist rule ended in 1989.
ECONOMIC CREDENTIALS
A relative newcomer to politics, Morawiecki lacks Szydlo's broad appeal. But he has overseen significant economic achievements since becoming finance minister in 2016, a position he has retained in the new government.
Tusk has welcomed what he sees as signs that Morawiecki is a liberal economist who wants better ties with the EU.
""There is no doubt that (Morawiecki's) liberal bias and some pro-western gestures could be a sign that there is a lurking desire to improve relations,"" Tusk said last week.
But an economic stimulus plan Morawiecki unveiled in 2016 has been criticized by economists who say it depends heavily on private investment, which is low in Poland despite fast economic growth.
""What Morawiecki sees as a solution, meaning more political influence in the economy, is actually dangerous,"" said Leszek Balcerowicz, a former finance minister who coordinated the transition to a market economy after decades of communist rule.
Any hint of protectionism is also likely to worry EU leaders, who seek to break down trade barriers. 
Morawiecki has called the privatization of state-owned companies a tragedy and said he will give more power to domestic capital at the expense of foreign investors. In his comments to parliament on Tuesday, he said economic policy should not change.

Dubbed Operation Ápia, the probe centers on alleged bribery of civil servants and politicians in return for rigged bids on road work worth 850 million reais ($258 million) in the state of Tocantins.
Federal police said in a statement they were serving 16 search warrants and delivering subpoenas to eight people in connection with the probe.
Two lawmakers from Tocantins, Dulce Miranda and Carlos Gaguim, are implicated in the investigation, police said.
Reuters could not immediately contact Miranda and Gaguim for comment. 
President Michel Temer has said the lower house of Congress would vote by Tuesday on his proposed pension reform, which many consider crucial to reining in Brazil's surging public debt, or else the debate will have to wait until next year.

Mnangagwa, a Mugabe loyalist for decades, whose sacking as vice-president triggered the 93-year-old's removal by the military after 37 years in power, was sworn in as president last month. He will be confirmed as ZANU-PF party leader at a special one-day congress on Friday.
ZANU-PF party spokesman Simon Khaya Moyo has said Mnangagwa will choose his deputies either this week or later. A second vice-president, Phelekezela Mphoko, who was seen aligned to the G40 party faction allied to Mugabe and his much younger wife, Grace, has already been sacked from the party and his post.
Party and government officials have refused to comment on speculation in privately-owned newspapers and on social media that Mnangagwa is likely to appoint military chief General Constantine Chiwenga one of his deputies as a reward for spearheading the de facto coup that ended Mugabe's rule.
The new president has been criticized by some Zimbabweans and opposition parties for appointing former air force commander Perrance Shiri as agriculture minister and General Sibusiso Moyo as foreign and international trade minister rather than bringing in younger candidates less associated with the Mugabe era.
Mnangagwa made no comments to the media ahead of the closed-door politburo meeting on Wednesday at which Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa and Shiri will report on the party's economic and agricultural plans.

He has vowed to focus on reviving the struggling economy and creating jobs. Once seen among Africa's most promising economies, Zimbabwe has an unemployment rate exceeding 80 percent.

1526,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 07:00AM ET</span>",Indonesia corruption court indicts ex-parliament speaker after delays,"By Agustinus Beo Da Costa
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian prosecutors charged a former parliament speaker on Wednesday in connection with a $170 million graft scandal after he held up proceedings for hours at the opening of his trial, saying he was ill.
Setya Novanto has been brought to trial by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), which suspects extensive pilfering of public funds linked to a national identity card program.
Novanto, who resigned as speaker of parliament this week, has denied wrongdoing. 
He had managed to cling to power through several previous corruption cases and repeatedly missed summonses for questioning by the anti-graft agency in connection with this case in recent months, saying he needed heart surgery.
Novanto, who arrived at court in a white shirt and a bright orange jacket usually worn by the KPK's graft suspects, said he had diarrhea and needed medical attention.
Prosecutors from the KPK said he was lying and that doctors had given him a clean bill of health earlier on Wednesday.
He declined to confirm to the court details like his name or place of birth.
After long delays to allow doctors to examine Novanto, the presiding judge at the Jakarta corruption court let prosecutors read out the charges, which included unlawful intervention in the procurement process of the ID cards.
""We are sure the defendant is healthy and can follow the court proceedings. This is part of the defendant's lies,"" prosecutor Irene Putri said as defense lawyers called for more medical examinations for their client.
The KPK is investigating state losses amounting to about $170 million linked to the national electronic identity card scheme after allegations that sums ranging from $5,000 to $5.5 million - generated by marking up procurement costs - were divided up among politicians in parliament.
KPK investigators last month put Novanto under armed guard in hospital and then took him into custody.
Novanto's case has riveted the media and captured the attention of social media users, many of whom have mocked him in widely shared posts.
The allegations against Novanto have reinforced the perception among Indonesians that their parliament, long regarded as riddled with entrenched corruption, is a failing institution.
Indonesia was ranked last year at 90 out of 176 countries on Transparency International's corruption perception index.
The watchdog has singled out parliament as Indonesia's most corrupt institution, and in July called on President Joko Widodo to protect the KPK against attempts by the legislature to weaken the commission's powers.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday all Muslim nations should work together to defend the rights of Palestinians following Donald Trump's decision last week to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Rouhani, attending an emergency meeting of Muslim leaders, said the U.S. president's move showed the United States lacked any respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian nation. 
""Iran is ready to cooperate with all Muslim countries without any precondition to defend the legitimate rights of Palestinians,"" Rouhani told the gathering in the Turkish city Istanbul.
""Unity among Muslim countries is very important and Quds (Jerusalem) should become our top priority.""
Opposition to Israel and support for the Palestinian cause have been central to Iran's foreign policy since the Islamic revolution of 1979 that toppled the U.S.-backed Shah. 
Iran, the leading Shi'ite Muslim power, and Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia are competing for influence in the Middle East, where they support rival groups in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon.
Tehran and Riyadh see each other as the paramount threat to regional peace and stability. 
Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic relations with Iran in 2016 after Iranian protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions in Tehran and the city of Mashhad following Riyadh’s execution of a prominent Shi'ite cleric.
Rouhani said Muslim countries should resolve their disputes through dialogue and he also accused Israel of planting seeds of tension across the Middle East.
On his Twitter account, Rouhani said Trump's move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital showed that Washington was not ""an honest mediator and never will be"", adding that it only wanted to ""secure the interests of the Zionists"".
Iran does not recognize Israel and regards Palestine as comprising all of the holy land, including Israeli territory.

Iranian leaders have repeatedly called for the destruction of Israel. Tehran backs several militant Islamist groups in their fight against Israel.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Life has stopped in its tracks in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state where an estimated 180,000 Rohingya remain, fearful after violence drove 650,000 to flee to Bangladesh, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Wednesday.
Dominik Stillhart, ICRC director of operations, speaking after a three-day mission to the remote area, said continuing tensions in the Muslim and dominant Buddhist communities were preventing Muslim traders from reopening shops and markets.
The ICRC is one of the only aid agencies to operate in northern Rakhine after Myanmar's military waged a campaign the United Nations has called ""ethnic cleansing"" in response to Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts.
""The situation in the northern Rakhine has definitely stabilized, there are very sporadic incidents, but tensions are huge between the communities,"" Stillhart told reporters.
""You get a sense, especially of the two main communities being deeply scared of each other. What surprised me is the fact that not only the Muslim communities are scared, but that the others are actually scared as well,"" he said.
Stillhart went to Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung in northern Rakhine, where the ICRC is providing food, water and other aid 150,000 people. By year-end, it hopes to reach all of the 180,000 Rohingya it estimates remain in the ""politically-sensitive"" region, among 300,000 throughout Rakhine, he said.
""You travel through the countryside and you really see on both sides of the road, villages that are completely destroyed. 
It just gives you a bit of a sense of the scale of destruction. There is also this pervasive sense of absence. 
""It is as if life has stopped in its tracks, people do not move, markets are closed in Muangdaw town,"" Stillhart said.
Myanmar's army released a report last month denying all allegations of rapes and killings by security forces.
NO SIGNIFICANT RETURNS
""The main problem for the Muslim communities today is not that they are being attacked, or that there are incidents,"" Stillhart said. 
Rather it is fear and uncertainty, and ""the very limited possibilities for them to access their own livelihoods like fields, and especially markets and services"", he said. 
Myanmar and Bangladesh signed an agreement last month for the voluntary repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya within several months.
The returns must be voluntary and safe, Stillhart said.
""But for now we really don't see a significant return movement and I'm also not expecting that we will see massive return anytime soon,"" he said. About 300 Muslims still flee daily, he added, citing U.N. figures.
The ICRC visits detainees held in Rakhine, including Rohingya arrested since Aug 25, he said.
""What I can tell you is there are very few people who have been rounded up, surprisingly few people have been rounded up.
""So it's not as if we met like hundreds or thousands of people rounded up in these detention centres.""

1529,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 06:40AM ET</span>",Rights group criticizes China for mass DNA collection in Xinjiang,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese authorities have collected DNA and other biometric data from the whole population of the volatile western region of Xinjiang, Human Right Watch said on Wednesday, denouncing the campaign as a gross violation of international norms.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in the past few years in violence between Uighurs, a mostly Muslim people, and ethnic majority Han Chinese, which Beijing blames on Islamist militants.
The unrest has fueled a sweeping security crackdown there, including mass rallies by armed police, tough measures that rights advocates say restrict religious and cultural expression, and widespread surveillance.
Police are responsible for collecting pictures, fingerprints, iris scans and household registration information, while health authorities should collect DNA samples and blood type information as part of a ""Physicals for All"" program, the New York-based group said in a statement, citing government a document.
""The mandatory databanking of a whole population's biodata, including DNA, is a gross violation of international human rights norms, and it's even more disturbing if it is done surreptitiously, under the guise of a free health care program,"" Human Rights Watch's China director Sophie Richardson said.
According to the Xinjiang-wide plan posted online by the Aksu city government in July, main goals for the campaign include collecting the biometric data for all people between the age of 12 and 65, and verifying the region's population for a database.
""Blood type information should be sent to the county-level police bureaus, and DNA blood cards should be sent to the county police bureaus for inspection,"" the plan said.
Data for ""priority individuals"" should be collected regardless of age, it said, using a term the government has adopted to refer to people deemed a security risk.
Government workers must ""earnestly safeguard the peoples' legal rights"", plan said, but it made no mention of a need to inform people fully about the campaign or of any option for people to decline to take part.
Xinjiang officials could not be reached for comment. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked about the report by Human Rights Watch, accused the group of making ""untrue"" statements.
He told a regular news briefing in Beijing the general situation in the region was good.
Human Rights Watch cited an unidentified Xinjiang resident saying he feared being labelled with ""political disloyalty"" if he did not participate, and that he had not received any results from the health checks.
State media, reporting on the campaign checks, have said participation was voluntary.
The official Xinhua news agency in November cited health authorities as saying 18.8 million people in the region had received such physicals in 2017 for a 100 percent coverage rate.

South Sudan slid into civil war in late 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan and a third of its 12 million population has fled their homes. 
The conflict was sparked by a feud between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar, who is being held in South Africa, and eventually led to a fight along ethnic lines.
""We are calling for $1.72 billion to continue providing life-saving assistance and protection for 6 million people most in need in South Sudan,” Alain Noudehou, the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, told a news conference.
Humanitarian assistance was needed for people suffering the effects of displacement, food insecurity, malnutrition, violence and economic decline, Noudehou said.
Since the conflict began, about 4 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with nearly 1.9 million people who have internally displaced and about 2.1 million who have fled to neighboring countries, he said.
The conflict has also led to a cut in crude oil production, which is a key foreign exchange earner, and the ensuing insecurity has hampered cultivation of food.
Also at the news conference was South Sudan's Humanitarian Affairs Minister Hussein Mar Nyuot. 
""I believe if we don’t get the amount ($1.72 billion) and the donors don't respond to this more crisis in South Sudan will happen. That means 2018 might be worse than 2017,"" he said.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 04:41AM ET</span>","Backed by Putin, Russian military pushes into foreign policy","By Andrew Osborn and Jack Stubbs
MOSCOW (Reuters) - From Damascus to Doha, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has been showing up in unexpected places, a sign of the military's growing influence under Vladimir Putin.
In the past few months, at times wearing his desert military uniform, Shoigu has held talks with Syria's president in Damascus, met Israel's prime minister in Tel Aviv and been received by the Emir of Qatar in Doha.
The defense ministry's forays into areas long regarded as the preserve of the foreign ministry are raising eyebrows in Russia, where strict protocol means ministers usually hold talks only with their direct foreign counterparts.
The military is reaping political dividends from what the Kremlin saw as its big successes in Crimea, annexed from Ukraine after Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms seized control of the peninsula in 2014, and Syria, where Russian forces helped turn the tide of war in President Bashar al-Assad's favor. 
""That has translated into more top-table influence,"" said a long-serving Russian official who interacts with the defense ministry but declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
The Kremlin and the defense and foreign ministries did not respond to detailed requests for comment for this article.
The growth of the military's influence has caused discontent among some Russian diplomats and unease among Western officials about the harder edge it is giving Russia's foreign policy.
Foreign policy-making has become more bellicose and more opaque, and this makes new Russian military adventures more likely, some Western officials say. 
""If you allow the defense ministry a bigger say in foreign policy it's going to be looking for trouble,"" said one, who declined to be named because of the subject's sensitivity.
Shoigu's high profile has also revived talk of the long-time Putin loyalist as a possible presidential stand-in if Putin, who is seeking a fourth term in an election in March, had to step down suddenly and was unable to serve out a full six-year term.
Shoigu, 62, is not involved in party politics but opinion polls often put him among the top five most popular presidential possibles. His trust rating is also often second only to Putin, with whom he was pictured on a fishing trip this summer. 
SYRIA ROLE 
The military's influence has ebbed and flowed in Russia and, before that, the Soviet Union. 
It had huge clout at the end of World War Two and in the 1950s after the death of Soviet leader Josef Stalin when Georgy Zhukov, a commander credited with a crucial role in defeating Nazi Germany, was defense minister. 
But the ignominious Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, completed in 1989, two wars Russia fought in Chechnya after the Soviet Union's collapse, and the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine with the loss of all 118 people on board in 2000 left the military's prestige in tatters.
Under Putin, a former KGB agent who as president is the armed forces' commander-in-chief, its stock has risen. Defence spending has soared, the military has been deployed in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria and its actions are used to foster patriotism.
The military's growing political and foreign policy muscle is most noticeable when it comes to Syria. 
After going to Damascus twice earlier this year for talks with Assad, Shoigu was at Putin's side this week when the president flew in to meet the Syrian leader. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has not visited Syria at all in 2017.
Unusually for a defence minister, Shoigu has been involved in diplomatic efforts to bring peace to Syria. In this role he has spoken about the importance of a new draft constitution for the country, met the U.N. special envoy on Syria and had talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani.
A Western official who has direct contact with the foreign and defence ministries said the Russian military had real heft in Damascus of a kind the foreign ministry did not.
There was ""strong mutual trust"" between the Russian military and senior people in Damascus, the official said, because ""the Russians saved their asses and the Syrians respect that.""
The foreign ministry retains strong Middle East experts and continues to play an important Syria role, helping run peace talks taking place in Kazakhstan. But Lavrov's own efforts to secure a U.S.-Russia deal on cooperating in Syria have shown how differently the foreign and defence ministries sometimes think.
Lavrov is still seen as a formidable diplomat whom Putin trusts and respects. But Western officials say he is not summoned to all important meetings and is not informed about major military operations in Syria. 
POLICY INTERVENTIONS
The military's other foreign policy interventions include a role in Russia's alleged interference in last year's U.S. presidential election, U.S. intelligence agencies say.
They say the GRU, Russia's military foreign intelligence agency, hacked email accounts belonging to Democratic Party officials and politicians, and organized their leaking to the media to try to sway public opinion against Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump's main rival. 
The Kremlin denies the allegations.
Other policy interventions included a news briefing in December 2015 at which the defence ministry said it had proof that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and his family were benefiting from illegal smuggling of oil from Islamic State-held territory in Syria and Iraq. 
Erdogan said the allegations, made at a briefing held a week after a Turkish air force jet shot down a Russian warplane near the Syrian-Turkish border, amounted to slander. 
The defence ministry's response to the incident was much sharper than that of Russian diplomats, part of a wide-ranging communications policy that has included frequent criticism of the U.S. State Department and Washington's foreign policy.
Other areas of interest for the defence ministry have included Egypt, Sudan and Libya. 
Shoigu was involved in talks between Putin and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in Moscow last month and the ministry hosted Khalifa Haftar, Eastern Libya's dominant military figure, aboard its sole aircraft carrier in January. During the visit, Haftar spoke to Shoigu via video link about fighting terrorism in the Middle East.
One Western official told Reuters such incidents were fuelling fears that Russia plans to expand its footprint beyond Syria, where it has an air base and a naval facility, to centers such as Yemen, Sudan or Afghanistan.
The military's influence in domestic policy-making has expanded too, Russian analysts and Western officials say, with Putin seeking its views on everything from the digital economy to food security.
That is in part because Putin, since the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, has altered the way he takes decisions and widened the scope of what the Security Council, which he chairs, discusses to include many domestic policy questions.
""At a time when there's a feeling that Russia is increasingly surrounded by enemies, Putin is consulting the intelligence services and the military more when he takes all decisions. He's meeting them all the time,"" said Tatyana Stanovaya, head of the analytical department at the Center for Political Technologies think tank.

Stanovaya said that did not mean the military was initiating ideas, but that its opinions were taken into account far more by Putin now than in the past and that it now had an important voice on domestic policy areas.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - The United States has called on Cambodia to reverse steps that ""backtracked on democracy"" before a general election next year, a visiting U.S. official said on Wednesday.
Relations between Cambodia and the United States have hit their lowest in years after the arrest of a rival of long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen, Kem Sokha, and the dissolution of his opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). 
Hun Sen accused Kem Sokha and his party of a U.S.-backed anti-government plot. The opposition leader and the United States denied that.
""We are advising that these steps that have taken place here that have backtracked on democracy could be reversed,"" said Patrick Murphy, deputy assistant secretary of state for Southeast Asia, the most senior U.S. official to visit since the CNRP was dissolved.
Murphy told reporters in Phnom Penh that Cambodia still had time before the general election in July to ""conduct an electoral process that is legitimate"".
Hun Sen looks set to extend his 32-year rule easily next year after eliminating the CNRP, which had made big gains in the last general election in 2013.
On Tuesday, the European Union followed a U.S. lead in suspending funding for the election. 
Kem Sokha has been accused of plotting treason with unidentified Americans and the Cambodian Supreme Court dissolved his party last month at the government's request. Kem Sokha said the charges were a political ploy.
Murphy said allegations of a U.S.-backed plot were a fabrication.
""We want a good relationship,"" he said. ""There is a little bit of friction, a little bit of noise in the official bilateral relationship but we remain optimistic.""
During his visit, Murphy met senior officials but no government ministers. He also met civil society groups.
Ouch Borith, secretary of state at the foreign ministry, who met Murphy on Tuesday, told reporters their talks had been about improving the relationship. 
He defended his government's actions.
""What we’ve done is in the legal framework to defend Cambodia’s independence, peace and stability. We didn’t do anything illegal,"" he said.
Reaction to the dissolution of the CNRP has been largely muted in Cambodia. 
Rights groups have decried what they say is an increasingly repressive atmosphere in the Southeast Asian nation, and have condemned the detention of several reporters and closure of some media outlets.

Hun Sen has shrugged off criticism from the West. China, Cambodia's largest aid donor, has leant its support to Hun Sen saying it respects Cambodia's right to defend its national security.

A postwar Allied tribunal put the death toll in the eastern city of Nanjing at 142,000, but some conservative Japanese politicians and scholars deny a massacre took place at all.
Ties between China and Japan, the world's second- and third-largest economies, have been plagued by a long-running territorial dispute over a cluster of East China Sea islets and suspicion in China about efforts by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to amend Japan's pacifist constitution.
However the two countries have sought to get relations back on track, and Abe and Xi met last month on the sidelines of a regional summit in Vietnam.
Speaking at a memorial in Nanjing, Yu Zhengsheng, who heads a high-profile but largely ceremonial advisory body to China's parliament, said China and Japan were neighbours with deep historic ties.
China would deepen relations with all its neighbours, including Japan, on the basis of amity, sincerity and friendship, Yu said, in comments carried live on state television.
""China and Japan must act on the basis of both their people's basic interests, correctly grasp the broad direction of peaceful and friendly cooperation, take history as a mirror, face the future and pass on friendship down the generations,"" Yu said. 
A sombre Xi, wearing a white flower in his lapel to symbolise mourning, stood in the audience but did not speak.
Doves to signify peace flew overhead after Yu finished speaking.
Xi later met massacre survivors, the official Xinhua news agency said, telling them, ""Lessons learned from the past can guide one in the future"".
South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who arrived in Beijing for a four-day visit, offered condolences to the victims in a speech to businessmen, in what his office called the first such public mention of the massacre by a South Korean leader.
In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga spoke of the importance of looking to the future.
""The leaders of Japan and China have agreed in past meetings to further improve relations and it is important, while cherishing this trend, to together show a future-oriented stance,"" Suga told a regular news conference: 
It was the second time Xi has attended the event since China marked its first national memorial day for the massacre in 2014.

At that time, he called on China and Japan to set aside hatred and not allow the minority who led Japan to war to affect relations now.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 04:11AM ET</span>",Tillerson says U.S. ready to talk to North Korea; Japan wants pressure,"By David Brunnstrom and Christine Kim
WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered to begin direct talks with North Korea without pre-conditions, backing away from a key U.S. demand that Pyongyang must first accept that giving up its nuclear arsenal would be part of any negotiations.
Tillerson's new diplomatic overture comes nearly two weeks after North Korea said it had successfully tested a breakthrough intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that put the entire United States mainland within range of its nuclear weapons.
""Let's just meet,"" Tillerson said in a speech to Washington's Atlantic Council think tank on Tuesday.
The White House later issued an ambiguous statement that left unclear whether President Donald Trump - who has said Tillerson was wasting his time pursuing dialogue with North Korea - had given his approval for the speech.
""The president's views on North Korea have not changed,"" the White House said. ""North Korea is acting in an unsafe way ... North Korea's actions are not good for anyone and certainly not good for North Korea.""
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China welcomed all efforts to ease tension and promote dialogue to resolve the problem.
China hopes the United States and North Korea can meet each other halfway and take meaningful steps on dialogue and contact, he told reporters.
Ahead of Tillerson's speech, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to develop more nuclear weapons while personally decorating scientists and officials who contributed to the development of Pyongyang's most advanced ICBM, state media said on Wednesday.
Kim said on Tuesday the scientists and workers would continue manufacturing ""more latest weapons and equipment"" to ""bolster up the nuclear force in quality and quantity"", the KCNA news agency said.
""PERIOD OF QUIET""
While reiterating Washington's long-standing position that it cannot tolerate a nuclear-armed North Korea, Tillerson said the United States was ""ready to talk any time they're ready to talk"", but there would first have to be a ""period of quiet"" without nuclear and missile tests.
United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman, who visited Pyongyang last week, said senior North Korean officials did not offer any type of commitment to talks, but he believed he left ""the door ajar"".
""Time will tell what was the impact of our discussions, but I think we have left the door ajar and I fervently hope that the door to a negotiated solution will now be opened wide,"" Feltman told reporters after briefing the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.
Not everyone is ready for talks.
Japan has advocated a strategy of pressuring North Korea through sanctions to give up its nuclear weapons. Tokyo and Washington are in ""100 percent"" agreement on that stance, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday, when asked about Tillerson's comments.
A former Japanese diplomat said that, while a diplomatic solution was the ""only acceptable solution"", now was not the time for talks.
""We have to see the effects of sanctions on life in North Korea,"" the former diplomat, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.
""I heard that they are having a serious impact on everyday life. Let's wait and see. If we were to hint anything for dialogue, we'd be losing clout.""
South Korea continued military exercises with the United States to check military readiness, exercises the North describes as preparation for war. The South's army said separately on Wednesday it conducted a successful air-to-air missile firing drill from Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopters.
U.S. TALKS TO CHINA
Tillerson also disclosed the United States had been talking to China about how to secure North Korea's nuclear weapons in the event of a collapse of the government in Pyongyang. He said Beijing had been given assurances that if U.S. forces had to cross into North Korea they would pull back across the border into the South.
Chinese spokesman Lu would not directly answer a question about those comments, but said China had always clearly told all its interlocutors on the issue that ""There can be neither war nor chaos"" on the Korean peninsula.
Tillerson made clear that the United States wants to resolve the North Korea standoff through peaceful diplomacy and, in terms far more tempered than Trump's recent threats against Pyongyang, offered to hold exploratory talks.
""We can talk about the weather if you want,"" he said. ""We can talk about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table. Then we can begin to lay out a map, a road map, of what we might be willing to work towards.""
Tillerson - whose influence has appeared to wane within the administration - said Trump ""has encouraged our diplomatic efforts"".
Trump said on Twitter in October that Tillerson was ""wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man"", using his derisive nickname for Kim.
North Korea, for its part, has made clear it has little interest in negotiations with the United States until it has developed the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, something most experts say it has still not proved.
Tillerson also said the United States was working to tighten enforcement of international sanctions against North Korea, especially further measures that China can apply, and that Washington had a full menu of military options if such a response was needed.
Daryl Kimball, executive director of the non-partisan Arms Control Association, said Tillerson's proposal was overdue but added, ""In order to get to such talks going, the U.S. side as well as North Korea must demonstrate more restraint"".

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Wednesday summoned a police officer investigating the case of a missing peace activist who is believed to have been kidnapped by unidentified men this month.
Four activists critical of the army and its attitude towards militant groups went missing this year but reappeared after about a month. Two later said Pakistani military intelligence agents abducted and tortured them.
The military denied the accusations.
The latest activist to go missing is Raza Mehmood Khan, 40, a member of Aghaz-i-Dosti (Start of Friendship) group that works to build peace between arch-rivals Pakistan and India.
He has not been heard from since Dec. 2 and his family filed a writ of habeas corpus in a court in the eastern city of Lahore in the belief he has been unlawfully detained, a lawyer acting for his family said.
The Lahore High Court took up the case on Wednesday and the presiding judge, Anwar ul Haq, asked for the officer in charge of the police station handling the case to appear at the next hearing on Dec. 19.
The lawyer, Usama Malik, told Reuters a neighbor had called police on the night of Dec. 2 to report that Khan was being kidnapped by unknown men.
Khan's brother and police arrived to find Khan gone, along with his mobile telephones and computer, the lawyer said.
Police were not available for comment on the court summons on Wednesday. Police said earlier they had no suspect in the case and they were investigating.
On the day of his disappearance, Khan had spoken at a forum on militancy.
""Everyone discussed their views and, of course, Raza was very critical,"" said a friend, Rahim-ul-Haq.
Khan had also posted comments on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) critical of the military and its suspected link to some Islamist hardliners who at the time were protesting against the civilian government. 
Liberals in Pakistan have long criticized what they see as the military's use of some militant factions to further its political and security objectives.

The army denies sponsoring militant factions. It regards security policy, especially towards neighbors India and Afghanistan, as its responsibility.

The broadcaster was fined by regulator KRRiT on Monday over its coverage of protests in parliament last year.
""This decision appears to undermine media freedom in Poland, a close ally and fellow democracy. Free and independent media are essential to a strong democracy,"" the U.S. Department of State said in a statement on Tuesday.
It added that it remained confident in the ability of Polish authorities to ensure democratic institutions were fully functioning and respected.
The regulator said it had fined the broadcaster's TVN24 channel for ""promoting illegal activities and encouraging behavior that threatens security,"" without giving details.
TVN24 is the most widely watched independent channel in Poland, and critics on Monday interpreted the fine as an effort to mute its criticism of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party amid speculation the state may take the broadcaster over. 
Since taking office in late 2015, the PiS has been at loggerheads with the European Union over policy, including placing the country's media under increased state control.

1546,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 02:40AM ET</span>",Judges consider HK double murder appeal by convicted former British banker,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Three judges in Hong Kong's Court of Appeal are set to decide the fate of a former British banker who was jailed for life last year for the murder of two Indonesian women he tortured and raped after his appeal hearing closed on Wednesday. 
Rurik Jutting, 32, a former Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) employee, had denied murdering Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, in his luxury apartment in 2014 on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to alcohol and drug abuse and sexual disorders.
The Cambridge-educated Jutting pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in a case that gripped the Asian financial hub.
During the one and a half day appeal hearing in the former British colony, Jutting's lawyers said the judge who presided over the gruesome trial last year had misdirected the jury.
Defence lawyer Gerard McCoy argued that the judge had narrowed down the scope of the defence case by conflating an abnormality of mind with a psychiatric disorder.
Jutting's defence is that while a disorder can cause an abnormal mind, his mental state can be abnormal without a disorder.
McCoy said Jutting showed severe traits of psychiatric disorders, far beyond the normal range and was therefore not in control of his actions, said McCoy.
""Abnormality of mind is absolutely not confined to a disorder or a disease. Here the judge locks it down, reinforcing to the jury it is disorder,"" he said.
Jutting, dressed in a navy blue shirt and thick squared glasses, watched animatedly throughout the hearing and occasionally chuckled, particularly during the presentations by prosecutor John Reading.
Reading stated that the previous judge had ""exercised considerable care in crafting his directions on the law in consultation with both sides"".
Judges Michael Lunn, Andrew Macrae and Kevin Zervos are to return judgement on the appeal which may include granting Jutting the opportunity for a new trial, but they did not give a time frame. 
Deputy High Court Judge Michael Stuart-Moore said in strongly worded closing remarks at the end of the trial last year that the case was one of the most horrifying the Chinese-ruled territory had known.
He described Jutting as the ""archetypal sexual predator"" who represented an extreme danger to women, especially in the sex trade, and cautioned that it was possible he would murder again if freed.
The jury unanimously found Jutting, the grandson of a British policeman in Hong Kong and a Chinese woman, guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison in November 2016.
Jutting's defence team had previously argued that cocaine and alcohol abuse, as well as personality disorders of sexual sadism and narcissism, had impaired his ability to control his behavior.
The prosecution rejected this, stating Jutting was able to form judgments and exercise self-control before and after the killings, filming his torture of Ningsih on his mobile phone as well as hours of footage in which he discussed the murders, bingeing on cocaine and his graphic sexual fantasies.
In previous high profile murder cases such as that of Nancy Kissel, an American woman serving a life sentence for the ""milkshake"" murder of her Merrill Lynch banker husband, retrials have been given. 

Kissel lost her final appeal against her conviction in 2014.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Wednesday his government's future was at risk if it lost a Sydney by-election this weekend and failed to regain its one-seat majority, forcing it to rely on independents to survive in power.
Turnbull's conservative voter base in the harbourside seat of Bennelong, usually a safe blue-ribbon seat, has collapsed, according to an opinion poll on Tuesday.
The Newspoll in The Australian newspaper said Turnbull's Liberal-National coalition and the opposition Labor each have a 50 percent chance of winning on a two-party preferred vote, with Liberal voters deserting to a newly formed conservative party.
""It is a tight race. It is very high cost. If Labor were to win in Bennelong, then (Labor leader) Bill Shorten would be very close to becoming prime minister,"" Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.
If Turnbull loses Bennelong, it would only take the loss of support from key independents in a vote of no confidence to see his minority government topple.
Centre-right Labor has not held power since 2013.
Turnbull has led a minority government since October after his deputy prime minister was forced to quit parliament for holding dual citizenship. Under Australia's constitution, national politicians can only have Australian citizenship.
The deputy prime minister was re-elected on Dec. 2 after renouncing his New Zealand citizenship, but Turnbull failed to regain his one-seat majority because Bennelong's Liberal incumbent, former tennis champion John Alexander, quit parliament because he believed he might hold dual Australian-British citizenship.
Turnbull's future now rests on the voters of the affluent Bennelong electorate, where 13 percent of electors were born in either China or Hong Kong.
But a strain in relations between Australia and China in the past week may cost Turnbull votes.
Turnbull announced last week a ban on foreign political donations aimed at preventing external influence in domestic politics. He singled out China in announcing the ban, prompting a rebuke in China's People's Daily newspaper.
""Australia must recognize China is now leading the world. The government's attitude toward China will cost them votes, said Cao Gui Dong, a candidate for the Christian Democrat Party in Bennelong.
A loss in Bennelong would also see Turnbull's grip on the prime ministership again come under scrutiny, with one Liberal politician already calling for him to quit before Christmas.

Turnbull has fought off leadership speculation for most of 2017, amid a slump in polls as voters flock to far-right parties, but has vowed to lead his government to the next election due in 2019.

PARIS (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are attending a summit in Paris on Wednesday aimed at accelerating efforts to set up a West African force to battle Islamist militants, a sign Gulf Arab states are upping their influence in the region.
The G5 Sahel - composed of the armies of Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad - launched a symbolic military operation to mark its creation in October amid growing unrest in the Sahel, whose porous borders are regularly crossed by jihadists, including affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State.
However, France, which has some 4,000 troops in the region, has bemoaned that the militants have scored military and symbolic victories in West Africa while the G5 force has struggled to win financing and become operational.
To achieve those ends, French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting among others the leaders of the five participating countries, Germany and Italy as well as the Saudi and Emirati foreign ministers.
Thousands of U.N. peacekeepers, French troops and U.S. military trainers and drone operators have failed so far to stem the growing wave of jihadist violence, leading world powers to pin their hopes on the new force.
""For the last few months, the activity of terrorist groups has not decreased and the armies continue to suffer significant losses, which means that there is an operational urgency to regain control of the region and to increase the military effort,"" a French diplomatic source said.
Among efforts to widen support, Macron has pressed Saudi Arabia to take concrete actions to fight Islamist militants and asked Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to contribute to the G5 when he saw him last month.
TARGET DATE OF MARCH 2018
Macron sees the full implementation of the G5 force as a long-term exit strategy for his own forces that intervened in 2013 to beat back an insurgency in northern Mali.
""The objective is increased military, political and financial mobilization,"" the source said, adding that the aim was to get the 5,000-strong force running by March 2018. 
Saudi Arabia has now pledged $100 million, a major boost for the force, bringing commitments to more than half the roughly $500 million the G5 Sahel says it needs for its first year of operations. The UAE is also funding a G5 ""war school"" in Mauritania that is due to open in January.
""Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia are interested in the Sahel. Getting a seat at the table, being seen as security stakeholders, is something that fits in their respective strategy. Both have ambitions in large chunks of Africa,"" said Jalel Harchaoui, a geopolitics researcher at Paris 8 University.
Prince Mohammed is also setting up a separate Islamic military coalition, whose member countries can request or offer assistance to each other to fight militants. This could include military help, financial aid, equipment or security expertise. 
The Sunni Muslim kingdom is also competing with its main rival, Shi'ite power Iran, for influence across West Africa and other parts of the Muslim world.

Duterte argues emergency powers are needed because pro-Islamic State militants were regrouping and preparing for a new wave of attacks in retaliation for the military ending their five-month occupation of Marawi City in October.
That conflict was the biggest security crisis in decades and killed more than 1,100 people, mostly militants, and forced more than 200,000 residents to flee Marawi, the heart of which was flattened by shelling and air strikes.
The government is concerned the mountainous and jungle-clad Mindanao, a region the size of South Korea and home to the country's Muslim minority, could become a magnet for international extremists.
""The reports are they are actively recruiting again,"" Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told a joint session of Congress.
""What we are seeing actually is the rebellion has not stopped, it has moved to another place.""
Though Duterte enjoys massive public support, his plan to extend martial law and frequent threats to expand it elsewhere is contentious in a country that suffered nine years of oppression under the rule of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970s.
Marcos was accused of inventing security threats to justify tightening his grip on power and crushing detractors. Duterte has frequently praised the leadership of Marcos, and his critics say he has a fascination with authoritarianism.
One by one, a succession of minority lawmakers argued a one year extension was unconstitutional because no rebellion was actually taking place in Mindanao, and the government was only citing threats.
The constitution allows martial law to be declared initially for 60 days in the event of rebellion. It does not limit extensions.
Opposition Senator Franklin Drilon suggested Duterte's move was a prelude to declaring martial law nationwide. Senator Risa Hontiveros called it a ""last and drastic resort"".
Duterte's executive secretary, Salvador Medialdea, said the government had no intention to maintain martial law indefinitely.
""We do not ask for an unlimited martial law, what we are seeking is an unlimited peace,"" he said, adding that unrest was ""ready to explode anew at any given time"".
Critics also questioned why a communist insurgency omitted from Duterte's initial request on Monday was two days later cited as a reason for extending martial law. Congress was due to vote on the proposal later on Wednesday.

Duterte's request also said a little-known operative, Abu Turaifie was active in Mindanao and is ""said to be"" the potential point man of for Islamic State in Southeast Asia.

Japan's central government and Okinawa authorities have been at odds for years over the Futenma base. Residents complain about what they see as the unfair burden they carry in supporting the U.S. military presence in Japan.
A 10-year-old boy suffered a minor injury but the exact cause was unclear, an Okinawa prefecture official told Reuters. The boy was among about 50 children on the elementary school grounds when the window fell from a U.S. CH-53E transport helicopter.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: ""This sort of incident creates anxiety not only among those involved with the school but the people of Okinawa and should never happen.""
Suga told a regular news conference that the government would respond appropriately after getting an explanation from U.S. officials.
The U.S. Marines on Okinawa said in a statement the helicopter had immediately returned and reported the incident. 
""We take this report extremely seriously and are investigating the cause of this incident in close coordination with local authorities,"" the statement said.
""This is a regrettable incident and we apologize for any anxiety it has caused the community,"" it said. 
The Futenma base is surrounded by schools, hospitals and shops, and residents worry about air crashes. Crime committed by U.S. servicemen has also occasionally angered residents.
Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga has led the campaign to get the base off the island, while the central government has proposed moving it to a less populated part of the island called Henoko.
A U.S. Marines CH-53E helicopter made an emergency landing and burst into flames in a U.S. military training area in northern Okinawa in October. No one was injured.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Singapore government's laws limiting critical speech and peaceful assembly are overly broad and make the country a repressive place severely restricting what can be said and published, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.
In its first wide-ranging report on Singapore in 12 years, the group called on the government to amend or repeal laws and rules that restrict speech and assembly and drop charges against individuals for peaceful speech and assembly.
Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information did not immediately have a comment on the report. The government has held the position that Singapore's laws and regulations were needed to maintain social order and harmony.
The Singapore's attorney-general's office has started contempt of court proceedings against the prime minister's nephew and authorities are prosecuting a prominent human rights activist for organizing assemblies without permit.
""Beneath the slick surface of gleaming high-rises, however, it is a repressive place, where the government severely restricts what can be said, published, performed, read, or watched,"" the 133-page report said.
""Singapore promotes itself as a modern nation and a good place to do business, but people in a country that calls itself a democracy shouldn't be afraid to criticize their government or speak out about political issues,"" the group's Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson said.
Human Rights Watch called on the Singapore government to amend or repeal in entirety laws that it said were too broadly worded and used to ""arrest, harass, and prosecute critical voices,"" including the Sedition Act and the Public Order Act.
The report is partly based on interviews with civil society activists, journalists, lawyers, academics and opposition politicians, many of whom declined to be identified ""due to fear of possible repercussions,"" the group said.
Late in November, Singapore authorities charged human rights activist Jolovan Wham for organizing public assemblies without a police permit.

In August, the Singapore attorney-general's office began court proceedings against Li Shengwu, the grandson of the country's founder, over a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post in which he said the government is ""very litigious and has a pliant court system.""

China considers Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms.
Beijing regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States. In September, the U.S. Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States.
That prompted a senior U.S.-based Chinese diplomat to say last week that China would attack Taiwan the instant any U.S. navy vessel visited Taiwan.
Asked about the remarks at a regular news briefing, An Fengshan, spokesman for China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwan was an internal matter for China and that China opposed any form of military contacts between Taipei and Washington.
""What I want to stress and point out is that any relying on foreigners to build oneself up or plots to harm national sovereignty and territorial integrity will be opposed by the entire Chinese nation, and cannot succeed,"" An said.
China suspects Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who leads the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, wants to declare the island's formal independence. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan's security.
The Chinese air force has this year carried out a series of drills near to Taiwan, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets to shadow them.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday brought federal charges against the suspect in Monday's attempted suicide bombing in one of New York City's busiest commuter hubs, accusing him of supporting a foreign terrorist organization.
Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi and self-described supporter of the radical group Islamic State, was also charged in a criminal complaint filed in U.S. district court in Manhattan with bombing a public place, destruction of property by means of explosive and use of a destructive device.
Ullah planned to ""murder as many human beings as he could ... in support of a vicious terrorist cause,"" acting U.S. attorney Joon Kim told a news conference after filing the charges.
New York City police have said that Ullah set off a pipe bomb in an underground corridor of the subway system that connects Times Square (NYSE:SQ) to the Port Authority Bus Terminal at rush hour on Monday morning, injuring himself and three others.
He told police interviewers after the blast, ""I did it for the Islamic State,"" according to court papers filed by federal prosecutors.
Ullah began the process of self-radicalization in 2014 when he started viewing pro-Islamic State materials online and carried out his attack because he was angry over U.S. policies in the Middle East, prosecutors said.
New York officials on Tuesday also filed state charges against Ullah, as investigators in his home country questioned his wife. 
Ullah was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, supporting an act of terrorism, and making a terroristic threat under New York state law, the New York City Police Department said.
The federal charges, which are expected to take precedence over the state charges, carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Officials declined to disclose Ullah's condition at Bellevue Hospital late on Tuesday. His first court appearance in the case could come as soon as Wednesday and may be conducted by video conference with a judge, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office said.
On the morning of the attack, Ullah posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, ""Trump you failed to protect your nation."" 
Ullah's passport, which was recovered from his home, had handwritten notes, including one that read, ""O AMERICA, DIE IN YOUR RAGE.""
HOMEMADE BOMB
Investigators at the scene found a nine-volt battery inside Ullah's pants pocket, as well as fragments from a metal pipe and the remnants of what appeared to be a Christmas tree light bulb attached to wires.
Ullah told investigators that he built the bomb at his Brooklyn home one week before the attack, filling the pipe with metal screws to maximize damage. He chose a workday to target as many people as possible.
Investigators in Bangladesh were questioning Ullah's wife, according to two officials who declined to be identified as they were not permitted to publicly discuss the matter. They said the couple have a six-month-old boy.
A police official who took part in that interview, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak publicly, said the wife told investigators that Ullah had never prayed regularly before he moved to the United States.
New York City police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were leading the investigation into Ullah in conjunction with other agencies through the Joint Terrorism Task Force, and were asking the public for any information about the suspect.
Investigators were poring through data on Ullah's electronic devices, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Assistant FBI director in charge William Sweeney said there was so far no indication that Ullah had previously attracted the attention of FBI.
Ullah lived with his mother, sister and two brothers in Brooklyn and was a green card holder, said Shameem Ahsan, consul general of Bangladesh in New York.
U.S. President Donald Trump said again on Tuesday that the attack emphasized the need for U.S. immigration reforms.
Monday's incident occurred less than two months after an Uzbek immigrant killed eight people by speeding a rental truck down a New York City bike path in an attack for which Islamic State claimed responsibility.
“There have now been two terrorist attacks in New York City in recent weeks carried out by foreign nationals here on green cards,"" Trump said. ""The first attacker came through the visa lottery, the second came through chain migration. We’re going to end both of them.""
The U.S. Supreme Court last week allowed Trump's latest travel ban, targeting people from six Muslim-majority countries, to go into full effect even as legal challenges continued in lower courts. 
The ban covers people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen seeking to enter the United States. Trump has said the travel ban was needed to protect the United States from terrorism by Islamist militants.
Bangladesh is not among the countries affected by the ban.
John Miller, the New York City Police Department's deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said on Tuesday that police would review the attempted suicide bombing and adjust security plans for the upcoming New Year's Eve celebrations in Times Square.

""This is the first time I believe that we have seen an individual with a suicide bomb in mass transit and actually have that bomb function. So we're going to take a hard look at it,"" Miller said in an interview.

1557,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 08:12PM ET</span>","North Korea's Kim Jong Un fetes rocket scientists, promises more weapons","SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un vowed to develop more nuclear weapons on Tuesday while personally decorating scientists and officials who contributed to the development of Pyongyang's most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-15.
Hwasong-15, which was test-launched on Nov. 29, has been largely perceived by analysts and government officials to have a range that can reach all of the mainland United States. 
However, experts believe North Korea still has some technical points it needs to improve before fully completing its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the entirety of the United States.
Kim Jong Un said on Tuesday the scientists and workers would continue manufacturing ""more latest weapons and equipment"" to ""bolster up the nuclear force in quality and quantity"", the North's central news agency reported on Wednesday.
The North Korean leader was speaking at the close of a rare two-day munitions conference to celebrate the Hwasong-15. Kim also said North Korea should develop and manufacture more diverse weapons.
Kim personally awarded medals to ""those in the field of defense science who most faithfully and perfectly carried out the Party's plan for building strategic nuclear force, successfully test-fired ICBM Hwasong-15 and thus demonstrated the dignity and might of our powerful state all over the world once again,"" KCNA said without naming the recipients.
They were given several medals, including the Order of Kim Il Sung and Order of Kim Jong Il, the highest orders of the DPRK, an acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
In addition to the medals, KCNA said the scientists and officials were given watches engraved with the names of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader's grandfather and father.
""He solemnly declared that the development of new strategic weapon systems including A-bomb, H-bomb and ICBM Hwasong-15 with indigenous efforts and technology and the realization of the great cause of completing the state nuclear force serve as a great historic victory of our Party and people of the country,"" North Korea's state media added citing Kim.

The isolated state has previously said it has succeeded in developing atom bombs and hydrogen bombs as it carried out six nuclear tests from 2006, with the latest in September this year, although no outside entity has been able to confirm the North's announcements.

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 08:10PM ET</span>",Brazil appeals court schedules early decision on Lula appeal,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian appeals court on Tuesday said it would decide on Jan. 24 on an appeal by former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva against a corruption conviction that could bar him from running in the 2018 presidential race.
Despite the conviction and four other charges of corruption, the leftist icon and former labor union leader remains Brazil's most popular politician and is leading early opinion polls ahead of next year's poll.
Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rallied on the news, first reported on the website of newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, to close 1.4 percent higher. 
Investors had been wary that a delay in the appeals court decision until later next year would give Lula more time to consolidate himself as the front-runner in the campaign, making it harder for judges to bar his candidacy. 
Lula's lawyers criticized the ""record"" speed at which the appeals process was being brought to a decision.
If the TRF-4 regional appeals court in Porto Alegre upholds the conviction, Lula can appeal to higher courts, but he would be blacklisted and unable to run for office.
A Datafolha survey published on Dec. 2 showed Lula gaining at least 34 percent of the votes if the election were held today, double the support for his nearest rival. It also showed him winning a runoff against likely contenders, Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin, far-right Congressman Jair Bolsonaro or environmentalist Marina Silva.
Lula was Brazil's first working-class president and millions of Brazilians were lifted from poverty by social programs introduced during his two terms in office from 2003-2010.
His handpicked successor Dilma Rousseff was impeached last year for breaking budget laws, ending 13 years of rule by Lula's Workers Party. Critics say his legacy was Brazil's worst economic recession and its biggest corruption scandal.
Lula was sentenced in July to nearly 10 years in jail for accepting 3.7 million reais ($1.1 million) in bribes from an engineering firm in return for help winning public contracts. Prosecutors said the money was spent refurbishing a beach resort apartment for him.
In recent months, Lula has toured Brazil as if he were already campaigning, rallying crowds of supporters in rural areas that benefited from his poverty relief programs.

But in an interview in August he told Reuters that the conviction might mean his party will have to field a candidate other than him in the Oct. 7 election.

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 08:08PM ET</span>",U.S. wary of Putin's declaration of military victory in Syria,"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is voicing skepticism about Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a major withdrawal of Russian troops from Syria and is arguing that his declaration of victory against Islamic State was premature.
Putin, during a surprise visit on Monday to Russia's Hmeymim air base in Syria, declared that the work of Russian forces was largely done in backing the Syrian government against militants in the country's war following the defeat of ""the most battle-hardened group of international terrorists."" 
Still, U.S. officials are challenging the Russian and Syrian portrayal of Syria as a country poised for peace once the final enclaves of the Islamic State militant group, known as ISIS, are recaptured. 
Syrian government forces, U.S. officials said, are too few, too poor and too weak to secure the country. Islamic State, and other militants in Syria, have ample opportunity to regroup, especially if the political grievances that drove the conflict remain unresolved, the officials said.
""We think the Russian declarations of ISIS' defeat are premature,"" a White House National Security Council spokeswoman said. ""We have repeatedly seen in recent history that a premature declaration of victory was followed by a failure to consolidate military gains, stabilize the situation, and create the conditions that prevent terrorists from reemerging"". 
The U.S. military in Syria, which unlike the Russians are operating there without the blessing of Damascus, has long been skeptical of Moscow's announced drawdowns.
Marine Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman, said the United States had not observed any significant withdrawal since Putin's announcement. 
Although he did not predict future moves, he said: ""There have been no meaningful reductions in combat troops following Russia's previous announcements planned departures from Syria.""
The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Moscow's past announcements of pullouts led to a recalibration of Russian forces. 
""Russia has previously used claims of partial withdrawals in order to rotate out select units for refit-and-repair, remove redundant capabilities, and reinsert alternative weapons systems better suited for the next phase of pro-regime operations,"" it wrote in a research note on Tuesday.
VICTOR'S PEACE?
The U.S. military still has around 2,000 troops in Syria and has announced that any withdrawal will be conditions-based, arguing a longer-term presence of American forces would be needed to ensure Islamic State's lasting defeat. 
Russia's announcement, however, suggested a different image of Syria in which foreign forces were becoming unnecessary. After turning the tide of the conflict in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's favor, Putin wants to help broker a peace deal.
A senior Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the United States believed Assad would fail if he attempts to impose ""victor's peace.""
The odds of Syria breaking into a civil war again would be high without meaningful political reconciliation, the official said.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday stressed the importance of a roadmap for peace, including elections that would allow voting by Syrians overseas who fled to the conflict. 

""And it is our belief that through that process, the Assad regime will no longer be part of that leadership,"" Tillerson said.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 08:08PM ET</span>",Latest fire in Chinese capital kills five despite safety blitz,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A fire in a southern neighborhood of the Chinese capital Beijing early on Wednesday killed five people, the government said, just weeks after another deadly blaze in the city prompted a crackdown against migrant workers sparking widespread anger.
The Beijing fire service said in a short statement the fire in a house in Baiqiangzi village was caused by an electric bike. It said eight people were injured and taken to hospital.
The statement gave no other details.
Beijing's municipal government launched a 40-day ""special operation"" targeting fire code and building safety violations last month after a Nov. 18 apartment fire in another southern part of the city killed 19, almost all of them migrants.
The city-wide fire safety blitz has forced thousands of migrant workers out of their homes and businesses, igniting unusually direct criticism of city government measures seen by some people as unfairly targeting the vulnerable underclass.
In an apparent effort to address those concerns, Beijing's Communist Party chief Cai Qi has visited migrant workers, telling them the city cannot do without their hard work, the official Beijing Daily said on Wednesday.
""Our city needs sanitation, cleaning, security, logistics, housekeeping, courier, catering and other ordinary workers,"" the paper cited Cai as saying. ""Whether in city operations or normal daily life, we can't do without them.""
Companies in all sectors in Beijing rely on migrant workers and they have used their sweat to contribute to the city's development, Cai added.
""We need to give these workers full respect and show even more care and love for them, work hard to address their hardships and anxieties, to give them a sense of belonging,"" he said.
The government has come under increasing pressure in the wake of the crackdown on migrant workers, including sporadic protests and an open letter from more than 100 prominent academics, lawyers and intellectuals denouncing the steps.
Such open criticism of government is increasingly rare as officials have clamped down on various aspects of civil society under President Xi Jinping.
Some non-profit groups that sought to offer assistance said they have been obstructed by police, with their online advertisements blocked by censors.

Gabriel Garcia Morales, who served under former President Alvaro Uribe, accepted $6.5 million in pay-offs to help Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] win a 2010 road construction contract valued at over $1 billion, the attorney general's press office told Reuters.
Garcia Morales has promised to testify against other public officials who received bribes, the attorney general's office said on Twitter.
The Brazilian firm is at the center of one of the largest corruption scandals in Latin America, and has admitted paying bribes from Peru to Panama. Ecuador jailed its vice president over the scandal and last year the company agreed to pay $3.5 billion in settlements in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland.
Colombia's attorney general said Odebrecht paid more than $27 million in bribes in the Andean country. One former and one current lawmaker, the former director of the national infrastructure agency, and others have also been arrested in connection with the case.
Morales, who was also fined $21,000, was originally sentenced to 10 years but the sentence was reduced because he accepted responsibility.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",UK's May faces parliamentary showdown with Brexit rebels,"By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May's control of the Brexit process will undergo its stiffest parliamentary test yet on Wednesday, when she faces a showdown with rebels in her own party over the laws that will take Britain out of the European Union.
May's government is trying to pass a bill through parliament that will repeal the 1972 legislation binding Britain to the EU and copy existing EU law into domestic law to ensure legal continuity after 'Exit Day' on March 29, 2019.
After six days of debate which has jumped between the legal minutiae of Brexit and the gaping ideological differences between 'Remainers' and 'Leavers', May could face an embarrassing parliamentary defeat as lawmakers demand a greater say over the final exit deal.
In June, she gambled on a snap election to strengthen her party's majority in the 650-seat parliament but instead bungled her campaign and ended up with a minority government propped up by the 10 votes of a small, pro-Brexit Northern Irish party.
Since then she has struggled to assert her authority over a Conservative Party which is deeply divided over the best route out of the EU.
Wednesday's likely flashpoint is an amendment to the bill put forward by a member of May's own party, the government's former attorney general, Dominic Grieve. 
If passed by a simple majority vote, the proposal would require parliament to approve the government's final Brexit deal by passing a separate written law once the terms of the withdrawal agreement are known. That could allow lawmakers to send May back to the negotiating table.
""I don't see any possibility of my backing down on this at all ... One has to stand up for one’s principles,"" Grieve told BBC radio, adding that he thought he had enough fellow rebels to overturns May's slim working majority in parliament.
The government initially proposed giving lawmakers a vote on the Brexit deal which would give them the choice to accept a negotiated settlement or walk away without a deal. 
It has since conceded that a separate piece of legislation, allowing members of parliament (MPs) more say on the deal, would be necessary. The government is planning to pass another bill once the final Brexit deal with Brussels is agreed which will implement the terms of the withdrawal agreement.
However, that has not yet been enough to head off Grieve, who says the current wording of the bill did not give enough assurances on the topic.
The government has been forced to give ground on several issues to ward off other rebellions over the Brexit laws.
On Monday, it accepted a proposal to allow lawmakers greater scrutiny over the passage of EU law into British law.
Still, after striking a deal with Brussels last week to move exit negotiations on to the next phase, covering trade and transition arrangements, May won approval from both the remain and leave factions of her party, suggesting attempts to unseat her were on hold.
The government has not ruled out making last-minute concessions to appease Grieve and the 20 or so Conservative rebels who could join forces with the opposition to inflict defeat.
""I think what the MPs are looking for is clarity ... We're looking at the amendment and will respond in due course,"" May's spokesman said on Tuesday.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 06:30PM ET</span>",U.S. aid chief says no sign Yemen port blockade easing to allow aid in,"By Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There are no signs that a blockade of Yemen's ports by a Saudi-led military coalition has eased to allow aid to reach communities increasingly at risk of starvation, the head of the U.S. government's aid agency said on Tuesday.
USAID administrator Mark Green called on the Saudi-led military coalition to open Yemen's ports and for Yemen's Houthis to cease firing to allow food and medical supplies to flow to tens of thousands of Yemenis caught in the fighting.
Green was speaking after the U.S. announced another $130 million in emergency food aid for Yemen, bringing U.S. assistance to nearly $768 million since October 2016. The new funds includes nearly $84 million in U.S. food aid and $46 million in emergency disaster assistance.
""Unfortunately I can't tell you there has been an easing of the blockade,"" Green told Reuters. ""We're trying to signal with this announcement that we're ready to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe.""
Green said he was ""deeply concerned on so many fronts"" about the crisis in Yemen, but in particular the failure to get fuel into the country so people have access to clean water.
""That means a number of communities are either without clean water or will be very shortly, and in both cases that is a terrible concern from the cholera perspective and the survival perspective,"" he added.
The U.N.'s coordinator for Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick, said on Monday the blockade has been eased but the situation remained dire with some 8.4 million people ""a step away from famine"" in Yemen.
A Saudi-led military coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi movement blockaded ports last month after a missile was fired toward Riyadh.
Washington last week warned Saudi Arabia that concern in Congress over the humanitarian situation in Yemen could affect U.S. assistance to allies in the Saudi-led coalition, including the U.S. refueling of coalition jets and some intelligence sharing.

By Michelle Nichols and David Brunnstrom
UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman arrived in North Korea on Tuesday for a rare visit that some analysts and diplomats hope could spark a U.N.-led effort to defuse rising tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
The former senior U.S. State Department official is the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2011. During a four-day visit he is due to meet Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho to discuss ""issues of mutual interest and concern.""
""This is broadly a policy dialogue with (North Korea). I think we have to wait and see what comes out,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Tuesday. ""All key member states ... were informed and briefed of the visit."" 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told Russia, Japan, the United States, China and North and South Korea in August he was available to help broker talks. So-called six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program stalled in 2008.
A U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described expectations for Feltman's visit as ""modest and high at the same time, meaning that they depend on what our hosts are thinking as well.""
""We need to find a way to scale back tensions,"" the official said. ""I don't think we will have a major breakthrough being announced at the end of this trip. But the visit could serve as a step to build a framework for engagement.""
Suzanne DiMaggio of the New America Foundation think tank, a participant in recent unofficial talks with North Korea, said Feltman could propose during his visit to Pyongyang that Guterres play a mediation role.
""I do think that the Trump administration would like to explore talks about talks at this stage. I think the North Koreans are assessing the timing of when to do that,"" she told a seminar in Washington on North Korea. 
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Feltman was not traveling on behalf of the U.S. government.
""And he's not traveling - I want to make this clear - with any kind of message from the U.S. government ... He's going on behalf of the U.N., not the U.S. government,"" she told a regular news briefing.
Nauert said Washington remained open to talks if North Korea showed it was serious about giving up its nuclear weapons, but added: ""The activities they have been engaged in recently have shown that they are not interested, they are not serious about sitting down and having conversations."" 
North Korea has been working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the United States in defiance of U.N. sanctions. It conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in September and last week tested a missile capable of reaching anywhere in America. 
Feltman told the 15-member Security Council last week that its unity ""creates an opportunity for sustained diplomatic engagement – an opportunity that must be seized in these dangerous times to seek off-ramps and work to create conditions for negotiations.""
In September, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia urged a return to dialogue, including ""by leveraging mediation efforts"" by Guterres. 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said on Tuesday that Pyongyang was seeking dialogue with Washington on its nuclear program, according to RIA news agency. Morgulov, at a conference in Berlin, was quoted as saying Russia had communication channels with North Korea open and was ready to exert its influence on Pyongyang.
Sweden's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Carl Skau told reporters he hoped Guterres could mediate in ""probably the largest threat to international peace and security at the moment.""

Britain's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Jonathan Allen said Feltman had ""our backing and I think he goes to represent the U.N. family as a whole.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A top U.N. official recounted to the Security Council on Tuesday ""heartbreaking and horrific accounts of sexual atrocities"" by Myanmar soldiers against Rohingya Muslim women, urging the body to visit the region and demand an end to attacks on civilians. 
Pramila Patten, special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on sexual violence in conflict, said one woman told her she was held by Myanmar troops for 45 days and raped repeatedly, while another woman could no longer see out of one eye after it was bitten by a soldier during a sexual assault.
""Some witnesses reported women and girls being tied to either a rock or a tree before multiple soldiers raped them to death,"" Patten told the Security Council. 
""Some women recounted how soldiers drowned babies in the village well. A few women told me how their own babies were allegedly thrown in the fire as they were dragged away by soldiers and gang raped,"" she said. 
Patten said the 15-member Security Council should visit Myanmar - also known as Burma - and Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, where more than 626,000 refugees have fled to since violence erupted in Myanmar's northern Rakhine State on Aug. 25. 
She said that a Security Council resolution demanding an immediate end to violations against civilians in Rakhine state and outlining measures to hold the perpetrators accountable ""would send an important signal.""
Myanmar's army released a report last month denying all allegations of rapes and killings by security forces.
""This is unacceptable,"" said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. ""Burma must allow an independent, transparent and credible investigation into what has happened.""
""While we are hearing promises from the government of Burma, we need to see action,"" she said. 
Myanmar has been stung by international criticism for the way its security forces responded to Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants on 30 security posts. Last month the Security Council urged the Myanmar government to ""ensure no further excessive use of military force in Rakhine state.""
China's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Wu Haitao said the crisis had to be solved through an agreement between Myanmar and Bangladesh and warned that any solution ""reached under strong pressure from outside may ease the situation temporarily but will leave negative after effects."" 
The two countries signed an agreement on voluntary repatriation Nov. 23. U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman pushed on Tuesday for the United Nations to be involved in any operation to return Rohingya. 

""Plans alone are not sufficient. We hope Myanmar will draw upon the wealth of expertise the U.N. can offer,"" Feltman told the Security Council.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican front-runner for next year's election, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, formalized his bid for the presidency on Tuesday and promised his government would spend on the young, elderly and farmers. 
Left-winger Lopez Obrador, who had a 12-point lead in one recent poll, wants to significantly change Mexico's approach to the economy, security and education, vowing more support for the poorest but without new taxes or higher debt levels.
He promised cheap fertilizer and fixed produce prices for farmers with a goal of making Mexico self-sufficient in food. He also offered paid apprenticeships for unemployed youth, grants for students and higher pensions for the elderly - expanding on popular welfare programs introduced when he governed Mexico City. 
A win by the 64-year-old self-declared nationalist on July 1 could reverse a Latin American trend toward right-leaning governments and set the stage for friction with U.S. President Donald Trump over his anti-migrant language and policies. 
Lopez Obrador promised friendly ties with the U.S. government but said he would not accept ""racist, hegemonic or arrogant attitudes."" 
He also proposed a shakeup of government, saying he would move more than a dozen ministries and federal bodies including state oil company Pemex from the capital to regional towns.
""The federal government will be decentralized,"" Lopez Obrador said, in a speech in the capital after registering his intention to run for his National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party. He also promised not to increase fuel prices. 
In the clearest language yet, he repeated his intention to consult with victims of drug crime about the possibility of offering amnesty to criminals who commit to rehabilitation.
""The only aim, there is no other, is to explore all the possibilities to curb the violence and guarantee peace for the people of Mexico,"" he said.
A poll this week found that two-thirds of Mexicans rejected the idea of amnesty, in a country on track for its deadliest year in modern history with nearly 21,000 murders through October. 
Lopez Obrador, who has unsuccessfully run for the presidency twice before, will likely face Jose Antonio Meade, running for the ruling party, and Ricardo Anaya, who heads a left-right coalition of opposition parties. 
He did not say how he would finance his spending plans, but in the past has said all new spending would be funded by ending government corruption and waste.

1568,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 03:25PM ET</span>","World is losing the battle against climate change, Macron says","By Richard Lough and Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a bleak assessment on the global fight against climate change to dozens of world leaders and company executives on Tuesday, telling them: ""We are losing the battle"".
""We're not moving quickly enough. We all need to act,"" Macron said, seeking to breathe new life into a collective effort that was weakened this summer when President Donald Trump said he was pulling the United States out of an international accord brokered in the French capital two years ago. 
Macron, who has worked to establish his role as a global leader since his sweeping election win in May, said modern-day science was revealing with each day the danger that global warming posed to the planet, he said. 
""We are losing the battle,"" he said, urging a new phase in the fight against global warming.
France announced a raft of 12 non-binding commitments, from a $300 million pledge to fight desertification to accelerating the transition toward a decarbonized economy. But there was no headline promise likely to reassure poor nations on the sharp end of climate change that they will be better able to cope. 
Public and private financial institutions pledged to channel more funds to spur the transition to a green economy and investors said they would pressure corporate giants to shift toward more ecologically friendly strategies.
Among the commitments, more than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said on Tuesday they would step up pressure on the world's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change.
That, they said, would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in companies, which include  Coal India  (NS:COAL), Gazprom (MM:GAZP),  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (SS:600028).
The European Commission, meanwhile, said it was ""looking positively"" at plans to reduce capital requirements for environmentally-friendly investments by banks in a bid to boost the green economy.
""LITTLE FOR THE VULNERABLE""
Climate change is causing more frequent and severe flooding, droughts, storms and heatwaves as average global temperatures rise to new records, sea ice melts in the Arctic and sea levels rise. 
Developing nations say the rich are lagging with a commitment dating back to 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help them switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change.
On Tuesday, the European Commission announced 9 billion euros worth of investments targeting sustainable cities, sustainable energy and sustainable agriculture for Africa and EU neighborhood countries.
Yet the United Nations Environment Programme says the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries could rise to between $280 billion and $500 billion per year by 2050.
""Despite the hype, the One Planet summit is delivering little for the world’s people who are the most vulnerable to climate change,"" said Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA.
""Rich countries continue to pretend that new schemes for businessmen to increase their profits will be the center of the solution for the poor.""

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 02:31PM ET</span>","Five years after Sandy Hook, U.S. gun-control advocates switch strategy","By Barbara Goldberg
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Five years after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school, advocates who are disappointed with the failure of efforts to limit access to firearms are changing their strategy.
Instead of pressuring lawmakers to push new gun-control measures through the U.S. Congress, volunteers from groups including Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America are now running for office themselves.
Nine of 13 volunteers trained by the group ran for office this year and won seats, ranging from New Hampshire state representative to city council member in West University Place, Texas. Fourteen more have already declared their intentions to run for office in 2018, seeking seats in Congress, state legislatures and local government, all running as Democrats. 
""The reality is that the work doesn't really start in Congress. That's where it ends,"" said Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts, who launched her group the day after the Dec. 14, 2012, massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
The group began training candidates after more than 400 of its 70,000 members said they were interested in running for office.
""This is a marathon, not a sprint,"" Watts said. ""It's going to take several election cycles.""
Even if the next class of candidates, none of whom are running as Republicans, succeed in winning office, they will face an uphill battle against a U.S. Congress controlled by Republicans, who are staunch defenders of the right to bear arms protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Sandy Hook was at the time the second-deadliest mass shooting carried out by a single gunman in U.S. history. It sparked new energy among gun-control advocates who pushed for fresh federal restrictions on assault weapons, which were blocked by Republican lawmakers and the powerful National Rifle Association lobby.
A steady stream of mass shootings have continued across the United States since Sandy Hook, including two deadlier incidents - the slaughter of 58 people at a Las Vegas concert in October and the massacre of 49 people at an Orlando gay nightclub last year.
GRASSROOTS EFFORT
Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was among the 20 first graders killed in Newtown, said he believes grass roots achievements like the new crop of gun-control candidates will lead to more action.
""This is a social change and it takes time,"" Barden said. ""What's happening in Congress notwithstanding, the change is going to come from the ground up.""
In the meantime, Barden is working with Sandy Hook Promise, a volunteer effort to prevent more shooting deaths. The group said that in the past two years it has trained 2.5 million students and families to recognize signs of potential gun violence and report them to authorities.
Social change, whether it is about drunk driving or recycling, comes from the ground up, said Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son Dylan died in the Sandy Hook attack.
""In the gun violence prevention movement, we have not focused on getting behavioral change. It's all been focused on top-down and that is not how you get change,"" she said.
Next year's class of gun-control candidates includes a mother whose son was shot dead and a bystander paralyzed from the middle of her chest down in a drive-by shooting.
Lara Kennedy is running for U.S. House of Representatives in the Texas district that encompasses Austin and north of San Antonio. 
Lucy McBath, whose only child Jordan Davis was shot dead after an argument over music while parked in Florida in 2012, is running for the Georgia House of Representatives.
In Arizona, Jennifer Longdon, who was wounded in a random 2004 shooting, also is seeking to become a state representative. In Arkansas, Adrienne Kvello is challenging incumbent Republican state Representative Charlie Collins, who sponsored bills to put more guns on college campuses, in courthouses and the state capitol.
Amber Gustafson, a gun-owning Moms Demand Action volunteer and life-long Republican who switched her party registration to Democrat last year, said if she wins her race for an Iowa state Senate seat, she will fight for gun safety laws aimed at preventing another Sandy Hook.

""I'm pro people defending their Second Amendment rights. But I also believe and know that good laws can really protect lives,"" Gustafson said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will discuss how to further curb immigration from across the Mediterranean over dinner on Thursday, but are as divided as ever on how to take care of refugees who still make it to Europe.
Their chairman, Donald Tusk, proposed creating a new financing tool in the bloc's next multi-year budget from 2021 to ""stem illegal migration"", replacing the ad hoc calls for money that EU states have seen since arrivals peaked in 2015.
Despite heavy criticism by human rights groups that it is aggravating the suffering of refugees and migrants on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, the EU is sticking to its policy of providing various kinds of assistance to the governments and U.N. agencies in the Middle East and Africa in order to prevent people making the trek north.
While implementing these plans in some places, notably the lawless Libya, is proving difficult, all EU states and institutions in Brussels agree on the approach.
However, the question of how to handle refugees who have made it to the EU is as divisive now as it was two years ago.
Italy, Greece and other frontline states on the Mediterranean, as well as the rich destination countries such as Germany, want all member states to be obliged to take in a set allocation of asylum-seekers.
But several eastern ex-communist EU members reject mandatory quotas, saying accepting Muslim refugees would undermine their sovereignty and security, and the homogeneous makeup of their societies. 
They want to help instead with money, equipment and personnel for controlling the bloc's frontiers.
The Commission is already suing Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for failing to take in their allotment of asylum-seekers from the peak of the EU's migrant crisis in 2015.
DIVISIONS
Recent proposals for future solutions go in opposite directions, giving little hope of a deal by the target date of June.
The bloc's current chair Estonia suggested sticking to the obligatory scheme when immigration is extremely high, but adding some flexibility by legislating that the receiving and sending states must agree on any relocation.
That plan has been quickly dismissed as a non-starter by diplomats from several EU states.
The bloc's executive, the European Commission, proposed that the bloc approve compulsory and automatic relocation for times of mass immigration, but rely on voluntary help in normal circumstances. The European Parliament wants mandatory relocation at all times, regardless of migratory pressures.
But now Tusk himself has also come out against quotas, telling EU leaders in a note that they had proven ""highly divisive"" and ""ineffective"". 
The Commission's migration chief, Dimitris Avramopoulos, told a news conference on Tuesday that Tusk's paper was ""undermining one of the main pillars of the European project - the principle of solidarity"".
For now, immigration figures remain so low compared to the peak of 2015-2016 that the public pressure on EU leaders to come up with a quick fix has eased.
That could yet change, however, with Italy's parliamentary election next spring, coinciding with the start of a new migration season.
Germany, currently consumed with trying to form a new government, has long suggested that if no consensus can be reached, an asylum reform could be passed by majority vote - something that would inevitably deepen the divisions and mistrust between member states.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 12:50PM ET</span>",France's Le Drian says 'no' to Iran Mediterranean axis,"By John Irish
PARIS (Reuters) - France's foreign minister criticized Iran's regional ambitions, saying Paris could not accept Tehran's military expansion to the Mediterranean, and accused Russia of failing to use its influence to push U.N.-led Syrian peace talks and curb violence.
Speaking in an interview with France 2 television to be broadcast later on Tuesday as part of a documentary on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was time for Moscow and Tehran to work with the U.N. Security Council to end the six-year-old conflict in Syria.
""The Iranian presence and the desire to make an axis from the Mediterranean to Tehran, (I say) no!"" Le Drian said in the interview. ""There is a Syria that needs to exist.""
Many Arab leaders argue that by fighting Islamic State and supporting Assad militarily, Iran is projecting its power across Iraq and Syria to Lebanon, creating an arc of regional influence stretching from the Afghan border to the Mediterranean. 
Tensions between Iran and France have increased in recent weeks after French President Emmanuel Macron said that Tehran should be less aggressive in the region and clarify its ballistic missile program.
Le Drian also denounced Tehran's ""hegemonic temptations"" during a visit to Saudi Arabia last month.
Iran's foreign minister on Monday urged European countries not to be influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's confrontational policy towards Tehran.
Under Macron's instruction, Le Drian has sought not take sides in the Middle East and attempted to improve ties with Russia after the previous French administration's relationship with Moscow suffered especially over Syria, where Russia and Iran are staunch allies of Assad. 
In Syria ""Iran brings its militias, supports (heavily-armed Lebanese Shi'ite group) Hezbollah,"" Le Drian said. ""Syria must become a sovereign state again and that means (a country) independent of the pressure and presence of other countries.""
With Assad by his side Russian President Vladimir Putin flew into Syria on Monday and ordered ""a significant part"" of Moscow's military contingent there to start withdrawing. The two met last week in the Russian city of Sochi.
""If you can summon Assad to Sochi, you can also tell him to stop (bombing) and allow aid to everyone,"" he said referring to the besieged rebel-held region of Eastern Ghouta. 
Paris has nuanced its approach to U.N.-led peace talks in Geneva, saying that Assad's departure from power should not be a pre-condition for negotiations. However, Le Drian made it clear that Russia was not doing enough.
""The main actors in this affair are Russia and Iran. They need to use their weight to lead a political solution with the other members of the Security Council,"" Le Drian said, repeating that Assad was not the solution.

""He is barbaric, but he is there, so we have to a start the process that leads to a (new) constitution and elections under the U.N."" he said. ""I struggle to imagine that populations who have suffered so much consider him part of the solution.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO allies extended Jens Stoltenberg's term as secretary-general of the Western military alliance until late 2020 on Tuesday, giving the former Norwegian prime minister a rare six-year mandate in the top job.
Stoltenberg, who took up the post on Oct. 1 2014, will now step down two years later than planned on Sept. 30 2020, after strong support from Germany and the United States, NATO's dominant power, which has welcomed his efforts to increase defense spending in Europe.
French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May both congratulated Stoltenberg on Tuesday.
If he completes his term as the alliance's top civilian, Stoltenberg would be the first NATO chief to serve a six-year term since Germany's Manfred Worner, who died in office in 1994.
The post has always gone to a European and at a time when the Trump administration is at odds with many of its allies on a host of foreign policy issues, Stoltenberg is seen by many as a skilful operator and consensus-builder. 
Stoltenberg, 58, who visited Donald Trump at the White House in April and hosted the U.S. president in Brussels in May, said transatlantic ties would be a priority for the remainder of his term. 
""My main task is to maintain that unity,"" he told reporters, referring to relations between North America and Europe. 
Stoltenberg has also struck a more conciliatory tone towards Moscow than his Danish predecessor Anders Fogh Rasmussen, even as he has overseen NATO's biggest military build-up since the end of the Cold War, prompted by Russia's 2014 seizure of Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.
""I believe in dialogue with Russia but I am also here to ensure security in Europe,"" he said.
NATO, seen by some as a Cold War relic until the Crimea annexation, has gained new relevance as the West confronts a resurgent Russia, state-sponsored computer hackers, security threats on its borders and militant attacks on European cities.

Stoltenberg has also thrown his weight behind diplomatic efforts to contain the North Korea nuclear crisis, visiting U.S. allies Japan and South Korea in October.

Former soccer star George Weah faces Vice-President Joseph Boakai in the poll that was held up for several weeks by a court challenge by the candidate who came third in round one. 
The winner replaces Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as president in what will be, if it goes smoothly, Liberia's first peaceful handover of power in 70 years.
The Supreme Court last week dismissed a complaint from third-place finisher Charles Brumskine's Liberty Party, which had said fraud had undermined the first round in October.
Electoral Commission chairman Jerome Korkoya said campaigning could start immediately but must end by December 24.

Liberians are eager for change after Nobel Peace Prize winning Sirleaf's 12-year rule, which sealed a lasting peace in a country that for decades had only known war, but which has failed to tackle corruption or much improve the lot of the poorest.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Syrian refugees could again seek to reach Europe in droves if aid programs are not sustained in five neighboring countries hosting the bulk of them, the United Nations said on Tuesday.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was giving details of the $4.4 billion appeal to support 5.3 million Syrian refugees in surrounding countries as well as to host communities in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Egypt that have taken them in.
The agency, which has received only 53 percent of its $4.63 billion appeal for 2017, needs international support, Amin Awad, director of UNHCR's Middle East and North Africa bureau, told a news briefing.
He listed ""many reasons"", including: ""The vast number of refugees that we have in the region, the geopolitical status of that region, the risk that a population of 5.3 million people can bring to an area, a small region already volatile as it is, if there is no assistance.
""We had the experience of 2015, we don't want to repeat that,"" he said.
The lack of funding led to an acute shortage of services that year, when one million refugees fled to Europe, he added. About half were Syrians, UNHCR figures show.
An EU-Turkey deal has largely halted the flow, but a UNHCR funding shortfall has led to fresh cutbacks in vital programs providing food, health care, education and shelter to Syrian refugees, Awad said.
""That means we're not able to provide stoves, we are not able to deliver kerosene, we are not able to deliver enough thermal blankets, we are not able to winterise tents, we are not able to drain water and snow from camps, we are not able to do engineering work to insulate some of the buildings. People are sitting in cold, open buildings,"" he said.
Turkey currently hosts 3.3 million Syrian refugees, the largest number, followed by Lebanon with one million.
""These are the biggest donors, these are the real donors. They provided space, international protection,"" Awad said. 
""Now the material assistance is left to the donors and international community... And that's not coming through. So we have to be prepared for consequences,"" he said.
Awad, asked about countries in the region closing their borders to Syrian refugees, replied: ""Borders are managed, in some instance are closed.""
Host countries have cited concerns over security, economic crises, and xenophobia, but Syrians continue to arrive, he said.
""Lebanon is still accepting vulnerable cases, medical cases, so is Turkey,"" Awad said.
There have been cases of ""refoulement"", returning refugees to places where they could face war or persecution, in violation of law, he said. ""We are seeing expulsion, we are seeing people sent back.""

UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards declined to provide specifics on Syrian refugees being expelled.

The Commission for Illegal Assets Forfeiture is preparing to file a claim against Prokopiev and his businesses to seize assets and property worth 199 million levs ($119 million), which it believed were derived from a rogue privatization of a plant 17 years ago, said the commission's chairman, Plamen Georgiev.
Bulgaria, one of the European Union's poorest and, according to Transparency International, its most corrupt country, set up the commission in the 2000s to confiscate the illegally obtained assets of corrupt businessmen and officials and organized crime bosses.
Prokopiev, 46, denied any wrongdoing. He said the commission has been used to intimidate the journalists at the influential financial newspaper Capital and the news website Dnevnik. He is the majority owner of both. 
He also said a Bulgarian court had ruled in 2004 that nothing was wrong with the privatization of mineral maker Kaolin, the basis of the accusations against him. 
""We are witnessing how a state institution with very wide powers is being used as a bat and an instrument for repression,"" Prokopiev told a news conference. ""We do not have any doubt about the ultimate goal of this .... to subdue the editorial position of two of the few independent media in Bulgaria.""
Georgiev told a news conference a regional court in Bulgaria had frozen shares and stakes of Prokopiev in over 40 companies on commission's request, but said the actions would not impede the work of the news organizations.
Five right-wing political parties that are not represented in the parliament protested against the commission's move. Some political analysts also saw it as an attempt to silence the independent newspapers in the country. 
""This act really seems to be directed against people who are representatives of free media in Bulgaria, said Daniel Smilov, an analyst with Sofia-based Center for Liberal Strategies.
Bulgaria ranked 109th out of 180 countries, lower than any EU member, in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index compiled by the Paris-based organization Reporters Without Borders. Bulgaria ranked 51st in 2007, when it joined the EU.

The officer, named only as Franco Hans A., was arrested in April in a case that shocked Germans and stirred a debate about the depth of right-wing radicalism in the Bundeswehr military. 
""Motivated by a nationalist attitude, he planned to carry out an attack at an unknown time on high-ranking politicians and public figures who stood up for what the accused regarded as an especially refugee-friendly policy,"" the federal prosecutor's office said.
""He wanted people to believe that his attacks were related to radical Islamist terrorism committed by somebody who had been granted asylum,"" it added.
The statement did not say whether the soldier had denied the charges or include any statement from his lawyer.
Among the targets were Justice Minister Heiko Maas, a senior Social Democrat, Greens politician Claudia Roth as well as human rights activists and journalists, the prosecutor's office added.
Prosecutors suspect that Franco Hans A., along with two accomplices, wanted to implicate refugees in their planned attack by posing as an asylum seeker.
The case had put pressure on centre-right Chancellor Angela Merkel's government - with her close ally Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen facing criticism for first failing to deal with right-wing extremism in the army and then implying that most soldiers were right-wing radicals.
The federal prosecutor's office said the soldier was accused of committing a serious act of violent subversion and violating the military weapons control law, as well as gun and explosives laws.
Franco Hans A., who served with an army battalion stationed in France, had used a fake identity to register as a Syrian refugee and moved into a shelter for migrants in Bavaria even though he speaks no Arabic, the prosecutors said.
The soldier had previously been detained in late January by Austrian authorities on suspicion of having hidden an illegal gun in a bathroom at Vienna's main airport, they added.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's court of appeal on Tuesday dismissed 15 corruption charges against the Senate president related to an alleged false declaration of assets, but it upheld three other charges against him.
Bukola Saraki's three-year tenure as president of the upper house has been marred by numerous accusations of misconduct and investigations, though none have led to convictions.
The original charges are related to allegations that Saraki falsely declared his assets when he was a state governor from 2003 to 2011, to which he pleaded not guilty.
A Code of Conduct Tribunal cleared the Senate president of the charges in June, saying the case against him lacked substance.
The government mounted a legal challenge which led to Tuesday's ruling by the court of appeal that Saraki should be retried by the tribunal on three of the 18 charges against him. 
The three counts relate to Saraki's acquisition of two houses in Ikoyi, an upmarket district in the southern commercial metropolis of Lagos. 
""The appeal is dismissed in part in respects of the other 15 counts"", said the judge, Tinuade Akomolafe-Wilson, at the appeal court in the capital Abuja.
The Senate president's camp has previously denied any wrongdoing and on Tuesday issued a statement in which it said Saraki had been ""victorious"" due to 15 charges being dropped. 
Saraki ran unopposed for the post of Senate president, mainly with the backing of the opposition. He was not the ruling party's preferred candidate, which led to strains in his relationship with President Muhammadu Buhari.
The Senate president has been dogged by legal cases since taking office. 
In October 2016 Saraki was cleared of altering Senate rules to get himself elected, and in March this year lawmakers cleared him of any wrongdoing over allegations that he attempted to evade payment of customs duties on a car.

Ahmadreza Djalali, a doctor and lecturer at the Karolinska Institute, a Stockholm medical university, was accused of providing information to Israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists.
Djalali was arrested in Iran in April 2016 and later convicted of espionage. He denied the charges, Amnesty said. 
At least four scientists were killed between 2010 and 2012 in what Tehran said was a program of assassinations aimed at sabotaging its efforts to develop nuclear energy. Iran hanged a man in 2012 over the killings, saying he had links to Israel.
Djalali's lawyers were told on Saturday that the Supreme Court had considered his case and upheld his Oct. 24 sentence in a secret process without allowing them to file defense submissions, London-based Amnesty said.
""This is not only a shocking assault on the right to a fair trial but is also in utter disregard for Ahmadreza Djalali’s right to life,"" Magdalena Mughrabi, Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement.
The Iranian judiciary could not be reached for comment. 
Amnesty said in October that the court verdict against Djalali stated he had worked with the Israeli government which then helped him obtain a Swedish residency permit.
Djalali was on a business trip to Iran when he was arrested and sent to Evin prison. He was held in solitary confinement for three months of his detention and tortured, Amnesty said. 
It said Djalali wrote a letter inside Evin last August stating he was being held for refusing to spy for Iran.
Sweden condemned the sentence in October and said it had raised the matter with Iranian envoys in Stockholm and Tehran.
The United Nations and international human rights organizations regularly list Iran as a country with one of the world's highest execution rates. Rights groups have criticized Iran for its regular resort to capital punishment.

Emergency laws were last deployed in parts of Africa's most industrialized economy in 1985 under former president P.W. Botha, the face of white South Africa as president at the height of the anti-apartheid struggle. 
""The Presidency rejects the media reports alleging that The Presidency has started composing draft regulations for a state of emergency and that President Jacob Zuma has appointed a team to draw up such regulations,"" Zuma's office said in a statement.
""The Presidency is not working on regulations for a state of emergency."" 
Emergency powers have not been used in South Africa since the country's 1994 transition to multi-racial democracy after decades of white apartheid rule.
The Rapport newspaper had reported that Zuma had ordered that regulations for a state of emergency be prepared to be part of the State of Emergency Act passed in 1997.
The newspaper said the detailed regulations that would outline what should happen during a state of emergency were never passed into law when the main legislation was enacted. It cited documents showing that Zuma had set up a team to make the draft regulations.

According to Rapport‚ the draft regulations would ban anyone from writing‚ publishing or broadcasting threatening material and give security forces power to use as much force as necessary to restore law and order.

ATCE, which says it is an independent organization, runs schools in several cities including the capital, Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kandahar and Herat and has been in Afghanistan since 1995.
""Around 7 a.m., four of our teachers traveling in two different cars were picked up by (Afghan intelligence),"" said Human Erdogan, the chairman of ATCE.

A conservative southern African nation of 2 million people, Botswana has been reluctant to fully acknowledge the rights of the LGBT community.
Tshepo Ricki Kgositau, the executive director of South African-based Gender Dynamix, an organization that advocates for the human rights of transgender and gender-variant people, had sued Botswana for refusing to change the gender on her identity document from male to female.
On Tuesday, Justice Leatile Dambe ordered that Kgositau's gender be changed to female in the national registry within seven days.
""The director of the National Registration is ordered to issue the applicant with a new Identity Card identifying her as a female within 21 days of this court order,"" Dambe ordered.
In court papers, Kgositau argued that she had since an early age identified as a woman and that the different gender on her identity document was causing her emotional distress and increased her vulnerability to abuse and violence.
The application included supporting evidence from her mother, siblings and relatives, as well as psychological and medical evidence to the effect that her ""innate gender identity is, and has since an early age, always been female and that her family has embraced her and loved her as a woman"".
In 2014, a judge overturned a government ban on a gay rights lobbying group, ruling that Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals of Botswana be allowed to register and campaign for changes to legislation. However, it reiterated that it was still illegal to engage in homosexual acts.

VENTURA, Calif. (Reuters) - Firefighters on Tuesday fought to take further control of a massive California wildfire, the fifth largest in the state's history, as relentless wind gusts and bone-dry weather were expected to persist throughout the week.
The blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, has burned 234,200 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties about 100 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, and grew by about 2,500 acres overnight, according to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) on Tuesday. 
""Severe fire weather will continue to promote significant fire growth further into Santa Barbara County, threatening the communities of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, Montecito and Summerland,"" Cal Fire said in a statement.
Strong wind gusts of up to 40 miles per hour (65 km per hour) and extremely low humidity expected through Thursday will pose a challenge to firefighters, the National Weather Service said Monday evening. 
Gusty offshore winds will continue to threaten structures in Ventura County and surrounding areas as well as the communication infrastructure, which could affect public safety, such as cellular services, according to Cal Fire. 
Nearly 7,000 firefighters were battling the Thomas Fire, which has destroyed almost 900 structures including more than 690 homes, Cal Fire said. The inferno, which threatens about 18,000 structures, was 20 percent contained by Tuesday morning.
Efforts to combat the wildfire, which has displaced more than 94,000 people, have cost more than $48 million to date. 
Dry vegetation that has not burned in 50 years has acted as fuel for the fire in the mountains southeast of Santa Barbara and northwest of Ventura counties, Cal Fire spokesman Ian McDonald said.
""Because the slopes are so steep and the terrain is so rocky, it is actually quite dangerous,"" he said. ""We are not going to put firefighters in harm's way halfway up a steep rocky slope. We are going to wait for the fire to come to us and extinguish it where it is safe."" 
Public schools in Santa Barbara and school districts nearby have canceled classes this week and will not reopen until the annual winter break is completed in January, said Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider.
Some of the other fires burning over the past week in San Diego and Los Angeles counties have been largely brought under control by the thousands of firefighters on the ground. 
The Creek and Rye fires in Los Angeles County were both at least 90 percent contained, officials said, while the Skirball Fire in the exclusive Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles was 85 percent contained.
North of San Diego, the 4,100-acre (1,660 hectare) Lilac Fire was 90 percent contained on Monday after destroying 151 structures.

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 10:40AM ET</span>","Partial power-share can end German political dilemma, some in SPD say","By Holger Hansen
BERLIN (Reuters) - Wary of renewing a coalition with conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany's Social Democrats are instead contemplating a so-called ""cooperation"" arrangement that would see them agree on a minimal program but leave contested matters up for debate.
With talks on a new government starting on Wednesday, the ""cooperation"" suggestion is seen by some in the party as an answer to the dilemma of a centre-left party that fears sharing power with conservatives blurs its identity in voters' minds.
Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz said he would lead the SPD into opposition after a disastrous showing in September's national election, but was forced to reconsider after Merkel's attempts at forming a three-way government collapsed, leaving Europe's economic powerhouse without a new government.
But SPD members and lawmakers are reluctant to sign up for a simple repeat of the four-year Merkel-led grand coalition, after which voters rewarded the junior partner with its worst-ever post-war election result.
In a paper seen by Reuters on Tuesday, lawmaker Matthias Miersch, leader of the SPD's parliamentary left caucus, suggested the two parties agree to cooperate on a minimal program while leaving other matters open.
The idea, under which the SPD would contribute ministers to a Merkel-led cabinet, would allow the party to support Merkel's conservatives in areas where both parties were in agreement but leave other areas subject to ad hoc haggling between parliamentary parties.
""All options were discussed,"" said an SPD spokesman of an SPD parliamentary caucus meeting on Monday. ""No single model was settled on.""
Under Miersch's proposal, the two blocs would agree a common program in areas of broad agreement like house-building, a European investment program and climate policy. They would also agree which party provided which ministry.
In some areas, including passing a budget and European and foreign affairs, the parties would agree always to seek a consensus, while in others they would agree to disagree, potentially seeking ad hoc majorities for their own measures from other parliamentary parties.
The proposal could help win over party faithful, who must give their blessing to any SPD participation in a future government. But it is far from a done deal, with some of the SPD's own leadership believing early elections were better, party officials said.
Merkel's own bloc has been clearer. ""I have no interest in half-agreements with the SPD,"" said Julia Kloeckner, vice-chair of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU). ""Either you want to govern or you don't.""

""Having all the ministerial jobs but no full government responsibilty is cherry picking. You can't be a little bit pregnant,"" she tweeted.

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 10:36AM ET</span>",Russia will keep bases in Syria to strike at insurgents: Kremlin,"By Denis Pinchuk
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will keep a naval and an air base in Syria capable of carrying out strikes against insurgents if required after a partial military pull-out announced by President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.
Putin on Monday ordered ""a significant part"" of Moscow's military contingent to start pulling out of Syria, declaring their work largely done. 
Putin made the announcement during a surprise visit to the Russian Hmeymim air base, where he met President Bashar al-Assad and addressed Russian forces.
""Thanks to the fact that the operation to save Syria and the liberation of Syrian land from terrorists have been completed, there is no longer a need for broad-scale combat strength,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
But he added that Russia would keep the Hmeymim air base in Syria's Latakia Province and its naval facility in the port of Tartous.
""The President stressed that the terrorists might try to 'walk tall' again in Syria. If that happens, crushing blows will be carried out,"" Peskov said.
Russia's military operation in Syria, which began in September 2015, turned the tide of the conflict in favor of Moscow's ally, Assad. It also established Russia as a power broker in the Middle East, regaining a role it had relinquished after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Assad's opponents, Western governments and some human rights organizations alleged that Russian air strikes on Syria had killed large numbers of civilians. Moscow has denied the allegation.
The Kremlin has presented the partial withdrawal of its forces as evidence that its mission in Syria has been largely accomplished. That gives a boost to Putin as he launches his campaign for re-election.
Opinion polls show that he will comfortably win the presidential election, scheduled for March. But the Kremlin fears that, since some voters see the election as a foregone conclusion, they may not turn out, weakening Putin's mandate.
Russia had previously announced a partial drawdown of its forces in Syria, in March last year. However, a powerful Russian contingent remained in place and there was little sign of operations being scaled back.
Back home in Russia, many people consider the Syrian mission a successful operation to restore peace - as well as an opportunity for Moscow to flex its military muscles.
The official death for Russian forces killed in combat is 38, according to a Reuters tally. That is far below the level of losses sustained when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in the 1980s, the last time Moscow waged a major campaign far beyond its borders.
However, many of the losses in Syria were borne by private military contractors working with the Russian military whose deaths have not been officially acknowledged, according to friends, relatives and colleagues of the contractors. 

The Russian defense ministry denies that there are any Russian contractors in Syria.

The ruling party and opposition groups will ask electoral authorities on Wednesday to extend next week's voter registration deadline into February, said Douglas Mwonzora, the secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change.
The army forced former president Robert Mugabe out of office last month, ousting the only leader the country has known since independence.
""The military coup disturbed a lot of things. During that period, many potential voters did not go out to register because there was serious political uncertainty in the country,"" said Mwonzora, who also co-chairs an inter-party group monitoring voter registration.
""So after taking all this into account we realized that we need to extend the registration exercise. If we don't we will see voter apathy next year,"" he added.
Zimbabwe started registering voters in September. But its Electoral Commision said on Tuesday just over 4 million voters out of a target of 7 million had signed up, eight days before the deadline to end the process.
Part of the problem, said Mwonzora, was that thousands of potential voters - who are classified as aliens because their parents are from other countries in southern Africa - have only been able to register since last week, after a court ruling.
Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took over from Mugabe, will be running to keep the job in the presidential and parliamentary elections due to take place by July.

1588,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 10:20AM ET</span>",Tight race as South Africa's ANC prepares to elect Zuma successor,"By James Macharia
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's ruling African National Congress holds an election this weekend to replace Jacob Zuma as party leader in a closely fought contest whose winner is likely to emerge as the nation's next president. 
The front runners are Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a former trade union leader and one of South Africa's richest people, and Zuma's preferred candidate, his ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former minister and chairwoman of the African Union Commission.
In a race seen as too close to call, seven candidates are seeking to succeed Zuma, who has been at the helm of the party for a decade.
The stakes are high because the ANC's electoral dominance means whoever wins the party's top job is likely become the next president of South Africa after a national election in 2019.
The party holds its conference in Johannesburg between Dec. 16-20.
All seven ANC leadership hopefuls pledged to Zuma at a meeting last month that they would accept the outcome of the leadership vote in the interests of keeping the 105-year-old organization intact and avoid splits that could weaken its strength at the national elections in 2019.
Ramaphosa edged Dlamini-Zuma by getting the majority of nominations to become leader of the party, but the complexity of the leadership race means it is far from certain he will become the next party leader and therefore the likely next president.
Adding another level of complexity, delegates are not bound to vote for the candidate their ANC branch nominated.
Zuma said last week he was ""very happy"" to be stepping down as ANC president. He can remain as head of state until 2019.
Political uncertainty over the ANC race is a major threat to the country's credit rating. S&P Global Ratings and Fitch rate South Africa's debt as ""junk"". 
Analysts have said South Africa's business and consumer confidence has been dented in recent years by allegations of corruption in Zuma's government and influence-peddling by the Gupta family - businessmen who are close friends of the president. Zuma and the Guptas have denied the allegations.
Ramaphosa is viewed as more investor friendly and has pledged to fight the corruption that has plagued Zuma's tenure.

Dlamini-Zuma has said she is not tainted by graft and it is fine if the country's white business community will not endorse her. She has said her priority is to improve the prospects for the black majority.
 
"
1589,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 10:20AM ET</span>",'Fierce and formidable' Dlamini-Zuma eyes South Africa's presidency,"By Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is a fierce campaigner against racial inequality whose hostility to big business has rattled investors in South Africa. She is also one of two front runners to be the country's next president.
The 68-year-old is vying to succeed her ex-husband, President Jacob Zuma, as leader of the ruling African National Congress at a party vote this weekend, an outcome that would make her favourite for the presidency after a parliamentary election due in 2019.
A medical doctor and former chair of the Commission of the African Union, a pan-continental grouping, Dlamini-Zuma has pledged during her campaign to ""radically"" tackle the racial inequality that persists in South Africa 23 years after the end of white minority rule.
Backers of her main rival, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, say she is peddling populist rhetoric and would rule in the mould of her former husband, whose decade in power has been plagued by corruption scandals. Dlamini-Zuma declined to be interviewed for this story.
The choice between Dlamini-Zuma and Ramaphosa will influence South Africa's economic policy trajectory, as well the country's role in Africa and beyond.
Investors are worried by Dlamini-Zuma's hostility towards international companies, which she says form part of a ""white monopoly capital"" cabal dominating South Africa's wealth.
""A Dlamini-Zuma victory would signal a sharp rhetorical shift towards more leftist economic policy,"" said John Ashbourne, an Africa-focused economist at Capital Economics. ""A further credit ratings downgrade would be almost inevitable.""
Yet Dlamini-Zuma's supporters point to a commitment to changing the lives of South Africa's black majority. Lynne Jones, a psychiatrist and author who lived with Dlamini-Zuma when they were students together in the English city of Bristol in the 1970s, says her determination to fight injustice is rooted in her own personal story.
Jones remembers a day four decades ago when Dlamini-Zuma lay on her bed and wept after being forced to miss her brother's funeral because the apartheid-era security services had hounded her out of South Africa.
""She was fiercely intelligent and determined,"" said Jones.
""Here was someone who had put their whole life on the line and given up home and family for what they believed. It was eye-opening.""
AFRICAN NATIONALIST
The race between Ramaphosa, a unionist-turned-millionaire businessman, and Dlamini-Zuma is too close to call, political analysts say.
Her campaign team told Reuters in written comments it was confident she would be elected ANC leader.
Ramaphosa, who is popular among swathes of the ANC disillusioned with Zuma, is promising to end corruption, boost a flatlining economy and deliver jobs to the poor in a country where more than a quarter of the population is unemployed.
Dlamini-Zuma, by contrast, is an African nationalist and has the support of the influential ANC youth and women's leagues, which both tend to support socialist policies.
Known for her fierce temper and hostility towards the West, she was described in one 2001 U.S. diplomatic cable on WikiLeaks as a ""truculent and petulant foreign minister"".
Another cable to Washington suggested she could be charming.
""Belying her reputation as fierce and formidable, the Minister was soft spoken and smiling in this meeting - articulate but gentle, candid but warm,"" Donald Gips, then U.S. ambassador to South Africa, wrote in 2010. 
The most common criticism of Dlamini-Zuma is that she is beholden to Zuma and his powerful patronage network. Zuma has publicly endorsed her.
""She is bold and you can't fool her. She is someone you can trust,"" Zuma told a rally recently. 
The couple met in Swaziland in the 1980s, when they were both in the ANC underground. They were married for more than a decade and have four children together.
RELIANCE ON ZUMA
In a rare interview last month, Dlamini-Zuma challenged her opponents to find any evidence of corruption in her long political career.
""I don't loot government coffers. I've never done so, and I will not do so,"" she told ANN7 television.
But for some senior figures in the ANC, she has not done enough to distance herself from the corruption scandals that have dogged President Zuma.
""She has not said anything on 'state capture',"" ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu told Reuters, using a South African term to describe private interests unduly controlling government funds.
Dlamini-Zuma says accusations that she is piggy-backing off Zuma are ""insulting"" given her career, first as a doctor to ANC leaders fighting apartheid and then as a cabinet minister under every South African president since 1994.
As health minister in Nelson Mandela's cabinet, she laid the foundations for free public healthcare for the poor, took a hard line on smoking and made medicines more accessible.
As foreign minister she fostered friendships with African countries and emerging economies like China, even when this angered the West.
But she also made errors of judgment.
In 1996, Dlamini-Zuma awarded a contract for more than $3 million to a friend for a play, Sarafina II, to raise awareness about AIDS and was later found to have ignored tender rules. 
Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said that paled in comparison to recent government malpractice. He said: ""14 million rand in the Sarafina scandal now seems like peanuts when compared with the looting under Zuma.""

VIENNA (Reuters) - An Austrian former finance minister went on trial on Tuesday accused of bribery and embezzlement in one of the biggest corruption cases in the country's recent history.
Karl-Heinz Grasser and 15 former high-ranking politicians, managers and bankers are charged in connection with the privatization of state housing company Buwog in 2004.
Grasser, 48, was one of Austria's most popular politicians and became the country's youngest finance minister in 2000 when he was appointed aged 31 to serve in a coalition between the conservatives and the far right Freedom Party.
He is accused of embezzling part of a commission for the sale of 60,000 federal apartments. He denies the accusations and said in a television interview on Monday he was glad the trial was starting so he could prove his innocence.
Defense lawyers say the case is politically motivated at a time when conservatives and the far-right are working to form a government to replace a coalition led by social democrats.
Investigators spent eight years gathering evidence and working on an indictment that runs for more than 800 pages.
It says he under-priced the biggest ever sale of state-owned flats. The tender came down to two bidders and the contract was awarded to a financial consortium that offered just 1 million euros ($1.2 million) more than its competitor. 
After the sale, millions of euros in commissions flowed to two Grasser associates suggesting insider dealing, according to prosecutors.
Grasser, who is married to socialite Fiona Swarovski, the heir of the Swarovski crystal manufacturers, says he is a victim of prejudice from the media and the judiciary.
The trial is the latest to stem from the tenure of Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel who took power in 2000. Others have concerned the telecoms and real estate sectors.
The court rejected a petition by Grasser's defense lawyer Manfred Ainedter to remove the chief of the four judges, Marion Hohenecker, due to conflict of interest because of tweets critical of Grasser sent by her husband who is also a judge.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba told senior U.S. officials during talks on migration in Havana on Monday that the U.S. decision to suspend visa processing at its embassy on the island was ""seriously hampering"" family relations and other people exchanges.
Relations between the former Cold War foes became strained after Donald Trump became the U.S. President, partially reversing the thaw seen during Barack Obama's presidency. 
In September, after allegations of incidents affecting the health of its diplomats in Havana, the U.S. administration reduced its embassy to a skeleton staff, resulting in the suspension of almost all visa processing.
""The Cuban delegation expressed deep concern over the negative impact that the unilateral, unfounded and politically motivated decisions adopted by the U.S. government ... have on migration relations between both countries,"" the Cuban foreign ministry said in a statement.
The statement was issued after delegations led by Cuba's Foreign Ministry chief for U.S. Affairs Josefina Vidal and U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs John Creamer met to discuss migration issues.
Many Cubans said they were heartbroken because they could not visit, or be with, their loved ones. While Cuba has a population of 11.2 million people, there are an estimated 2 million Cuban Americans in the United States. 
The Trump administration also issued a warning on travel to Cuba and in October expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington. 
The Cuban foreign ministry said this had ""seriously affected the functioning of the diplomatic mission, particularly the Consulate and the services it offers to Cubans residing in the United States"".
The U.S. decision to cancel the visits of official delegations to Cuba was also having a ""counterproductive effect"" on cooperation in fields like migration, the ministry said.
On the positive side, both the U.S. and Cuban delegations commented on the drop in illegal Cuban migration to the United States during the talks as a result of past moves towards normalizing relations.
Obama, who announced the detente with Cuba nearly three years ago, eliminated a policy granting automatic residency to virtually all Cubans who arrived on U.S. turf in January, just before leaving office.
Cuba had asked for the change for years, saying that policy encouraged dangerous journeys and people trafficking.
""Apprehensions of Cuban migrants at U.S. ports of entry decreased by 64 percent from fiscal year 2016 to 2017, and maritime interdictions of Cuban migrants decreased by 71 percent,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement.
Trump said in June he was canceling Obama's “terrible and misguided deal” with Havana, returning to Cold War rhetoric, and his administration has tightened trade and travel restrictions.

He has however in practise left in place many of Obama's changes including restored diplomatic relations and resumed direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights and cruise-ship travel.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Less than an hour after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Palestinians protested by turning off the lights on the Christmas tree outside Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, the traditional birthplace of Jesus.
It was a timely reminder that while headlines focused on Islamist calls for uprisings and Trump's references to Jewish historical ties, the president's words also stirred deep feelings among the Palestinians' small Christian community.
Coming out of the Sunday service in his Assyrian Catholic church in Jerusalem, Fredrick Hazo accused Trump of ""dragging all the world into trouble"", and called on the U.S. leader to reverse his decision.
""We are united - Christians, Muslims, we are one,"" said the 59-year-old Palestinian musician, standing in an alley in the heart of the Old City, surrounded by shops selling religious trinkets.
He was frustrated by the politics, but confident the delicate balance the three faiths kept in the holy city would prevail. ""In this sacred place, God is protecting us all. We are guarded by his angels in Jerusalem,"" Hazo added.
Christians make up around just one percent of the Palestinian population in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem - though they punch above their weight in local and national politics. 
Back in July, Hazo protested alongside Muslims against Israel's installation of security scanners at the nearby al-Aqsa mosque - Islam's third holiest site - after two Arab-Israeli gunmen shot dead two Israeli police officers at the site. 
It removed the metal detectors after days of bloody clashes, scenes that have not been repeated in the city since Trump's declaration.
UNITED IN PRAYER
The appeals to religious unity inside Jerusalem's walls stand in contrast to the more divided voices outside.
In the hours running up to Trump's statement, Pope Francis called for the status quo in the city to be respected. The Episcopal Church of the United States said Trump's announcement ""could have profound ramifications on the peace process and the future of a two-state solution"".
But Trump's decision found strong backing from another corner of the Christian community - many among his own country's politically powerful evangelicals who see God's hand in the modern-day return of Jews to a biblical homeland.
Trump convened a circle of evangelical advisers during his presidential bid, and he was the overwhelming favorite of white evangelical voters in last year’s U.S. election. 
""We are all bible-believers and we believe that this is the bible-land and that Jerusalem is the ancient capital of Israel back to the days of King David,"" said Dallas-based Mike Evans, part of an evangelical group that met Trump on Monday.
""So for our president to stand up and declare it makes us extremely proud and honored.""
For Palestinian supermarket cashier Mohammed al-Hawa, however, Trump's words and the logic behind them ignored the more complex reality on the ground.
People of all faith in Jerusalem were united in prayer, the 33-year-old said, even if they were divided over politics.
""Christians, Jews and Muslims live in this city together. There is no problem between them. Only the politics. The governments want to make wars,"" he said.
""This is my city - my blood, my life,"" added a 70-year-old Palestinian, walking through the pilgrim-packed courtyard of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, revered by Christians as the site of Jesus's tomb.
The church is packed into a small parcel of land that also holds the al-Aqsa compound and Judaism's Western Wall

""I can go to the church, to anywhere in Jerusalem, not Trump nor Netanyahu can stop me,"" added the man who identified himself only as a ""Jerusalemite"".

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 09:20AM ET</span>",France expects slow but massive impact from labor reforms: minister,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron's labor reforms will be slow to bear fruit but eventually have a massive impact on France's stubbornly high unemployment, his labor minister said Tuesday after data showed a slowdown in new job creation.
Though business and consumer confidence has been soaring, France's strengthening economy has so far only translated into limited labor market gains.
Job creation was the slowest in two years in the third quarter, when the economy added 44,500 new jobs, the fewest since the third quarter of 2015 and down from 88,300 in the previous three months, statistics agency INSEE said on Tuesday.
In his first major reform as president, Macron overhauled France's labor rules in September to give companies more freedom to set working conditions, a move aimed at encouraging them to hire more workers.
""We can't expect a massive effect in the very short term. It will only come in the medium term. However it will be robust and more massive,"" Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud told journalists in a quarterly update on the jobs market.
Despite the improving economy, the unemployment rate ticked up to 9.7 percent in the third quarter from 9.5 percent in the previous three months.
Economists say this was probably caused by the end of a hiring premium for small firms and a reduction in the number of government-subsidised job contracts.
Only two percent of 1,000 French employers surveyed by staffing firm ManpowerGroup expect to expand their hiring plans in the first quarter of 2018, down from four percent expected for the final three months of this year.
However, the outlook varies widely by firm size, with 19 percent of companies employing more than 250 people expecting a net increase in hiring in the first quarter, according to ManpowerGroup's survey.
After the labor reform, the government next wants to overhaul the professional training system, which currently receives 32 billion euros annually in public and private funds ($37.67 billion) but has little impact on unemployment.
""Companies cannot find skilled labor even though their order books are full. I hear that every day,"" said Penicaud, who is a former human resources director at Danone.

The government depends on the right-wing DF to pass budget and tax legislation, although it is not a part of the ruling coalition. 
DF is seeking tighter immigration rules in return for tax cuts. It wants to make it easier for authorities to revoke residence permits for refugees who fled from war once there is peace in their home countries.
Such a move, however, could violate international human rights guarantees, posing a problem for the government. 
On Friday DF gave its backing to the 2018 fiscal budget, leaving broader negotiations on tax reforms and stricter immigration policies to be resumed after the New Year. 
However, junior government partner Liberal Alliance said it wants to pass tax reforms along with the budget and would not support the budget in parliament unless a deal to cut taxes was agreed.
If LA does not vote to give the budget final approval, Rasmussen could be forced either to hand power to the Social Democrat-led opposition or to call a snap election. The final vote on the budget is on December 22.
""The government can bring itself down before Christmas if it actively works for it, it is possible,"" DF leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl told reporters on Tuesday.
""Of course it will have consequences if a government can't even vote for its own budget in parliament. The prime minister has to relate to that. It's his responsibility,"" Dahl said.
Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, who was in Paris on Tuesday for a climate conference hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, has expressed confidence that his government will vote in favor of the budget.
DF's proposal would impact the more than 10,000 Syrians that have sought asylum in Denmark since the beginning of 2015 under rules to protect people fleeing from war and not just refugees that are personally persecuted.
The proposed tightening comes on top of already strict policies for people with temporary residence permit that are not allowed to seek family reunification until after three years.
Refugees should be able to work or go to school while in Denmark, but those activities should not be targeted at integrating them into the Danish society or qualify them for permanent citizenship, DF said.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 08:40AM ET</span>",French government dampens Corsican nationalists' autonomy hopes,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's government on Tuesday ruled out major concessions towards autonomy sought by Corsica's nationalists after they won a regional election, but said it was open to talks that took account of the island's distinctive character.
The nationalists on Sunday won two thirds of the seats in the new regional council that takes office on Jan. 1.
Their ambitions are relatively modest among the wave of secessionist movements that have sprung up in parts of Europe as its traditional political forces have lost traction. 
Unlike Catalonia's nationalists, they do not target outright independence, but they do seek official status for the Corsican language and a greater say on fiscal issues. 
Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said there were Corsican ""specifics"" to be taken into account in the discussions that Paris holds with all new regional authorities.
""(But) let's be clear ... this was not a referendum or a vote on autonomy or independence,"" he told France 2 TV.
The Corsican nationalists also want to be able to decide who can buy properties and they seek liberty for those they call political prisoners, who have been condemned for attacks or are awaiting judgment.
The sun-drenched island, the birthplace of Napoleon and known as much over recent decades for its sometimes violent independence movements as for its stunning landscapes, has long been a thorn in the side of French governments.
Clandestine group the National Front for the Liberation of Corsica (FLNC) laid down its weapons in 2014 after a near four-decade long rebellion, in a major shift that helped boost the popularity of the moderate nationalists who won Sunday's election. 
RESPECTING THE LAW
Asked about prisoners, Griveaux said: ""The law must be respected. When there have been crimes and a court ruling, when people have been condemned, the sentence should be carried out.""
Asked about Corsican becoming an official language on the island alongside French, Griveaux said provision had already been made in various regions to allow the use of a local language, for instance in some schools. But ""the language of the Republic is French,"" he added. 
Political analyst Andre Fazi, a lecturer at the University of Corsica, said it would be hard for the nationalists to get what they wanted.
""But with Sunday's election win, it would also be risky for the government to not do anything,"" he said. ""Shutting the door completely could boost calls for outright independence, as was the case in Catalonia.""
In a sign that the government might be taking this into account, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Sunday called nationalist leader Gilles Simeoni to congratulate him on his win and told him he was willing to see him soon in Paris.

ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey criticized what it said was a feeble Arab reaction to the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying on the eve of Wednesday's Muslim summit in Istanbul that some Arab countries were scared of angering Washington.
President Tayyip Erdogan, who has accused the United States of ignoring Palestinian claims to Israeli-occupied east Jerusalem and ""trampling on international law"", has invited leaders from more than 50 Muslim countries to agree a response. 
Jerusalem, revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, is home to Islam's third holiest site and has been at the heart of Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement last week recognizing the city as Israel's capital angered many Muslim countries, but few governments have matched Turkey's warning that it would plunge the world ""into a fire with no end"". 
Several countries had still not said who they would send to Istanbul, a Turkish minister said.
""Some Arab countries have shown very weak responses (on Jerusalem),"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. ""It seems some countries are very timid of the United States.""
He said Egypt and the United Arab Emirates would send foreign ministers while Saudi Arabia had yet to say how it would participate. All three countries have delicate ties with Turkey, seeing links between the policies of Erdogan's Islamist-rooted ruling AK Party and regional Islamist movements they oppose.
Other countries had also not said who they would send, Cavusoglu said, adding that the meeting of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation countries must stand up to what he called Washington's ""I am a super power, I can do anything"" mentality.
""We will make a call for countries that have so far not recognized Palestine to do so now,"" he said. ""...We want the United States to turn back from its mistake.""
PROTESTS AND CLASHES
Trump's announcement triggered days of protests across the Muslim world and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.
Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, an action not recognized internationally. 
On Monday, tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Beirut to protest at a march backed by Hezbollah, the heavily armed Iran-backed Shi'ite group whose leader called last week for a new Palestinian uprising against Israel.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is expected to attend the Istanbul summit, said his country supported a new uprising against Israel to ""safeguard the Palestinian people's rights"".
Rouhani said Muslim countries would ""undoubtedly voice their protest to the world"" at Wednesday's meeting.
Iran supports several anti-Israel militant groups. The mainly Shi'ite country is also competing for power and influence in the Middle East with predominantly Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally.
Iranian Defence Minister Amir Hatami said Trump's decision would strengthen Israel, and accused some Muslim states of cooperating covertly with the Israeli government.
""We strongly believe that this decision is the result of interaction between Israel and some Muslim countries,"" he told his Turkish counterpart in a telephone call on Tuesday, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.
Qassem Soleimani, head of the branch of the Revolutionary Guards that oversees operations outside Iran, pledged ""complete support for Palestinian Islamic resistance movements"" on Monday.
The Trump administration says it remains committed to reaching peace between Israel and the Palestinians and its decision does not affect Jerusalem's future borders or status.

It says any credible future peace deal will place the Israeli capital in Jerusalem, and ditching old policies is needed to revive a peace process frozen since 2014.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 08:00AM ET</span>","Be careful, murdered Iranian activist's daughter tells European exiles","By Stephanie van den Berg
THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The daughter of an Iranian Arab activist killed in the Netherlands last month linked his death to political conflict in the Middle East, and warned other exiles in Europe to be on their guard.
Ahmad Mola Nissi, 52, was gunned down by an unidentified assailant in front of his home in The Hague on Nov. 8 in a suspected political killing.
Hawra Ahmad Nissi said her father's death was reminiscent of a string of murders of Iranian dissidents in Europe in the 1990s.
""Europe seems safe, but be careful,"" she told Reuters in an interview. ""The conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran is not confined to the Middle East. It is spreading into Europe.""
Relations between Shi'ite Muslim Iran and Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia have soured in recent months, with the struggle for influence between the two long-standing regional rivals played out through increasingly bitter proxy confrontations, notably in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.
Mola Nissi established the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA), which seeks a separate state in Iran's oil-rich southwestern Khuzestan province, in 1999.
Since his murder, his family have been under Dutch police protection at a safe house. 
""We came here to be safe but we don’t feel safe. European governments should do more to secure the safety of activists,"" Hawra Nissi, 25, said.
Ahvazi Arabs are a minority in mainly ethnic Persian Iran, and some see themselves as victims of occupation and want independence or autonomy. 
Tehran, which has condemned Mola Nissi's killing and promised to investigate it, accuses Riyadh of funding separatist groups active in Iran, a charge the Saudis deny.
'OPEN TO ALL SCENARIOS'
A source close to Mola Nissi's family, who asked not to be named due to security concerns, said he had accepted Saudi financial support but did not want the Ahvazi cause to be used as a pawn in the proxy war.
This attitude could have made him an obstacle to efforts to bring the ASMLA movement under Saudi influence, the source said.
""The family is open to all scenarios. Iran is a prime suspect, but not the only suspect,"" Hawra Nissi said.
Police are exploring a possible link between Mola Nissi's killing and the unsolved murder of another Iranian near Amsterdam in December 2015, a spokeswoman said.
They are looking for two suspects believed to have gunned down Ali Motamed.
The police declined to comment on the circumstances of Motamed's death or a motive, but Iranian media have linked him to exiled Iranian opposition Shi’ite group the People’s Mujahideen Organisation of Iran (PMOI), which would have made him a potential target.
A man detained in relation to Mola Nissi's death has since been released, the spokeswoman added.
The most prominent among a string of killings and disappearances of Iranian dissidents in the 1980s and 1990s was the shooting of three Iranian Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin in 1992, which a German court ruled had been ordered by the government in Tehran.

The incident occurred on a road that links Bosaso, Puntland's second biggest city, with Galgala Hills which is controlled by al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group.
Colonel Osman Abshir Omar was killed after he started dismantling the bomb on Tuesday, one of his colleagues said.
""We were with the Colonel. He stopped the car, got down and started dismantling a bomb but it suddenly went off and killed him on the spot,"" Major Abdirizak Mohamed, who was among thesoldiers accompanying Omar, told Reuters.
Al Shabaab claimed responsibility.
""We targeted the Colonel. We exploded the bomb,"" Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab's spokesman for military operations, said.
Militant attacks in Puntland are rare compared to the rest of Somalia mainly because its security forces are relatively regularly paid and receive substantial U.S. assistance.
Al Shabaab, which aims to topple Somalia's government and impose its strict version of Islam on the Horn of Africa state, has become more active in Puntland after being pushed out of its stronghold further south by African Union peacekeepers and the Somali army, officials say.
This year there has been rise in violence in Puntland by a splinter group linked to Islamic State have attacked government troops.

Rabbi Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman led a council of sages that controlled the small Degel Hatorah lawmakers' faction, part of the United Torah Judaism party, which has often held the balance of power in Israel.
In particular, Shteinman broke with tradition by giving tacit consent to the enlistment of religious soldiers in the first ultra-Orthodox unit set up by the Israeli military.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government includes ultra-Orthodox political parties, said the Jewish people had ""lost a central beacon of spirit, heritage and morality"".
Special buses and trains ferried mourners to Bnei Brak, a religious town on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Police estimated that several hundred thousand people gathered for the funeral procession, dressed in traditional black ultra-Orthodox garb.

Shteinman, born in what is now Belarus, had led his community of Lithuanian-rooted ultra-Orthodox Jews since 2012.

The self-styled Donetsk and next-door Luhansk ""people's republics"" broke away from central rule in 2014 after months of violent street protests in Kiev toppled Ukraine's Moscow-leaning president and propelled pro-Western nationalists to power.
In this calm suburb of Donetsk, many people stood aloof of politics. But then fierce clashes broke out between Ukrainian government troops and pro-Russian separatists for control over the nearby Donetsk Airport.
A glistening air hub of steel and glass, specially built for the UEFA Euro 2012 of which Donetsk was a venue, the local airport was leveled to the ground, and many of the buildings in Oktyabrsky shared its fate. 
A Reuters photo essay (http://reut.rs/2jONmoo ) captures images of hardship and despair of the dwellers of this district on the frontline of many battles.
Restored water and electricity supplies to local homes, with some households enjoying even gas supplies and heating, give a slight relief to some of the lucky locals as winter cold starts to bite.
""I try to keep away from politics, I only care about my family,"" said Marina, aged 30. The woman, her husband and three children, one of whom is seriously ill, lost their house in 2014 when an artillery shell hit it.
""With no money, we were left in the street, with absolutely nothing. Everything burned, nothing was left ... even spoons and forks were gone,"" she said.
Her family changed several apartments, moving from one friend to another, before deciding that they would restore their house, using the bricks that had remained intact to build new walls. But they fast ran out of cash to buy construction materials.
The fragile ceasefire agreed in 2015 is often shattered by outbursts of gunfire and explosions of shells. 
More than 8,000 private homes and more than 2,000 apartment houses were badly damaged in Donetsk, according to data provided by its administration. Most of these homes are uninhabitable and cannot be rebuilt.
A total of 64 temporary shelters for those who lost their homes in the war have been organized in various parts of Donetsk, a city of around one million residents.
Sometimes, student hostels accommodate the homeless. They include Alexandra Nikolayevna, 68, who survives with her several grandchildren at ""University Hostel No.4"" mainly due to handouts of humanitarian aid.
The fourth year of this ordeal has failed to shatter her political views. ""We must be only with Russia, we only hope for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to take us under his wing,"" she repeats. ""Anyway, everyone says it's Russian land.""
The feeling of relative normalcy which prevails in most parts of Donetsk, dissipates when you realise the city center is just slightly more than 10 km (6.3 miles) from the frontline.
The war is felt in the volatile rates of several currencies circulating in the city, in low wages and poor quality of local food.
And it is felt in the families which lost loved ones in the war that has claimed a total of more than 10,000 lives so far.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 07:37AM ET</span>",The write stuff: Life lessons from author James Patterson,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Most writers dream of publishing a book in their lifetime, and maybe even selling a few copies. Then there is James Patterson, who has sold over 300 million of them.
The author of such runaway hits as the ""Alex Cross"" and ""Women's Murder Club"" series raked in an estimated $95 million in 2016, according to Forbes, placing him among the highest-paid writers on the planet.
For the latest in Reuters' ""Life Lessons"" series, we talked to Patterson about what he has learned from the unbelievable plot of his own life.
Q: Who was your biggest influence as a kid?
A: Probably my grandmother. She was very bright, very tough, and very protective of me. She felt I could do anything I wanted to do, other than play in the NBA. There was absolutely no doubt in her mind. 
Q: Which books shaped your thinking early on?
A: When I got a job at a psychiatric hospital, I used to read a whole lot at night. The books that got me going were ""Mrs. Bridge"" and ""Mr. Bridge"" by Evan Connell, and ""Steps"" by Jerzy Kosinski: Very concise and witty, with tight storytelling. Another book that opened my mind up was ""Tristram Shandy"" by Laurence Sterne. It showed me that anything is possible.
Q: At what point did you realize you could actually make a living at writing?
A: It was when I won an award for best first mystery novel. I was sitting there so nervous, like I was at the Academy Awards. I remember when I got up after the announcement, I said, 'I guess I'm a writer now.' 
Q: Once serious money started coming in, how did you handle that?
A: I have always been pretty practical and frugal. I've been poor. I've been middle class. And I've been rich. On balance, I prefer being rich. But I'm happy I went through all those stages. If you have never been poor, you don't really understand it in a way that people who lived it can understand it. That's a huge life lesson.
I grew up in a small town in upstate New York, and that really was its own world. It was a little bit like the book ""Hillbilly Elegy"". There must have been some people who got out of there, but I wasn't aware of any.
Q: What kind of investor would you say you are?
A: I am fairly conservative in my portfolio. We have some real estate here in Florida and a house in New York state. We have some in hedge funds and some in conservative bonds. But there is no real reason to take any big risks. 
Q: Where do you put your philanthropic dollars?
A: We have a big foundation and give away between $15-$20 million away every year. A lot of the projects have to do with reading. We award a lot of scholarships to teachers, 450 of them to 26 different universities. 
We have also helped with school libraries, and now we are focusing on classroom libraries, with $1.75 million in grants. When we put out the word, we had 82,000 requests for help.
Q: Do you have any role models?
A: I look up to a lot of great writers, like James Joyce, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and Philip Roth. Also authors of thrillers like Michael Connelly and Nelson DeMille. I particularly love it when there is somebody who handles fame really well - like LeBron James. I also think Oprah has done a terrific job of handling her popularity and money and success. I find her to be pretty heroic.
Q: What life lessons do you try to pass along to your own son Jack, who is 19?
A: To be down to earth and not be impressed that his family has done well. We work on that a lot. I encourage people to understand who you are, and get comfortable with it. 
My kid worked at the Clinton Foundation last summer and got to talk to President Clinton for a while. Later the president told me, 'He has a big heart.' 
As a parent, that's an amazing thing to hear.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 07:00AM ET</span>",Japan's Constitutional Democrats: a little party with big ambition,"By Linda Sieg and Ami Miyazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - The leader of the small Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, which out-performed expectations in an October vote, now hopes that by offering clear policy alternatives he can oust Prime Minister Shinto Abe's coalition in the next election.
One key to achieving that ambitious goal, said party founder Yukio Edano, is an economic platform that puts more weight on redistributing wealth, including by raising corporate taxes to push firms to use their cash reserves to raise wages. 
""Unless we have reasonable redistribution to achieve growth, domestic demand will not expand,"" Edano, 53, told Reuters in an interview. 
""That is a clear difference from the LDP,"" he said, referring to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
The CDPJ was formed less than three weeks before the Oct. 22 election, after the then-main opposition Democratic Party's leader decided not to field candidates and encouraged them to run on Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike's novice conservative party's slate.
It grabbed the top opposition spot in the lower house poll, although its 54 seats are dwarfed by the 283 won by Abe's conservative LDP.
""Since we are the biggest opposition party, we must aim at a change in government in the next election, or else democracy is not functioning,"" said Edano, who said he was surprised by his party's success. 
""That is our responsibility.""
The next general election must be held by October 2021.
'CLEAR POSITIONS'
The CDPJ opposes Abe's proposal to revise Article 9 of Japan's post-war constitution, which bans a standing military but has been interpreted to allow armed forces exclusively for self defense, and unlike the more authoritarian LDP, stresses civil rights rather than obligations to the state.
The party appears to have a long way to go, given support at 7.9 percent against 38.1 percent for the LDP in a survey by NHK public broadcaster this week. 
Edano's fighting words, however, mark a contrast from the failed Democratic Party's stance in recent polls, when it aimed only to keep Abe's coalition from winning a two-thirds ""super majority"" rather than ousting it.
Edano said he would not repeat the mistakes of the Democrats, which from the start was an amalgam of conservatives, liberals and ex-socialists and ended up being plagued by infighting during its 2009-2012 term in office.
""Our positions were clear,"" he said, explaining why he thought the CDPJ outperformed opposition rivals. ""We must not make our ideas and policies vague just to broaden (the party).""
Edano said Abe's biggest defect was his apparent belief that a majority entitled him to do whatever he wanted. Abe, whose support was at 49 percent in the NHK poll, saw his ratings sink this year partly due to perceptions he had grown arrogant.
""Democracy doesn't mean you get a blank cheque,"" Edano said.

Wu Yongning plunged to his death from a 62-storey building in central China on Nov. 8, the day he stopped posting videos of his skyscraper exploits on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter.
A month later, his girlfriend confirmed the death of the 26-year old in a Weibo post. 
Wu, who had more than 60,000 followers of his Weibo account, was looking to win a prize of 100,000 yuan ($15,110) for a filmed stunt atop Huayuan Hua Center in Changsha, capital of Hunan province, media said over the weekend. 
His death was a reminder of the need for stronger supervision of livestreaming apps, the official China Daily said on Tuesday.
""Some of them try to hype things up with obscene and dangerous things, and their purpose is to attract more eyeballs and make a profit,"" it said in a commentary. 
Tens of thousands of Chinese post videos of themselves in a bid for stardom on the livestreaming scene, whose popularity has grown rapidly, particularly in the e-commerce, social networking and gaming sectors.
Wu, who used to post videos of himself scaling tall buildings with no safety equipment, hoped to use the prize to pay his mother's medical bills, the Changsha Evening News said. 
It was unclear which livestreaming platform Wu intended to post on. 
""There should be a bottom line for livestreaming platforms, and supervision should leave no loopholes,"" ran a comment in the online edition of the People's Daily. 
Wu's videos on his Weibo microblog had attracted several million views each.

Turkey has been in talks to buy the system for more than a year. Washington and some of its NATO allies see the move as a snub because the weapons cannot be integrated into the alliance's defenses.
Turkish and Russian officials would meet to finalize the deal next week, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Ankara that credit for the defense industry would be signed with Turkey in the near future.
When asked by Interfax whether the Russian financing would cover the full cost of the deal, Russian presidential aide Vladimir Kozhin said: ""Not the whole, partially.""
""Technical questions are being discussed, the interest rate. Everything is in the Finance Ministry,"" he said of the deal.

The clashes in the province's Malek county broke out after a group of young men from the Ruop ethnic group attacked rival youth from the Pakam group on Wednesday and Thursday.
Revenge attacks have since taken place.
Dharuai Mabor Teny, a member of parliament from the region, updated an earlier death toll of 45.
""Right now, from both sides, we have 170 plus people who lost their lives. 342 houses have been burnt and almost 1,800 people displaced,"" Teny told Reuters.
The violence prompted the government to declare a three-month state of emergency in the region and surrounding areas on Monday. The military has also been ordered to deploy troops to quell the unrest.
Shadrack Bol Maachok, the regional government's spokesman, said the widespread availability of arms complicated efforts to control the conflict.
""Those arms in the hands of the civilians are going to be taken away and heavy forces are going to be brought here,"" he told Reuters.
The UN mission in South Sudan UNMISS said its troops were helping remove roadblocks mounted by the clashing groups in a bid to open up routes for movement and trade.
South Sudan was plunged into war in 2013 after a political disagreement between President Salva Kiir and his former vice president Riek Machar escalated into a military confrontation.
The fighting has killed tens of thousands, uprooted about a quarter of the population of 12 million people and left its small, oil-dependent economy moribund.

During the simulated drills, members of a SWAT team shot down a drone with a bomb attached that was flying toward a bus carrying athletes. 
In another part of the mock exercise a terrorist took hostage athletes on a bus, and tried to ram the vehicle into the stadium before being gunned down by police. Officers in gas masks also removed a chemical bomb.
Anxiety on the Korean Peninsula has been rising in recent months due to a series of missile tests by North Korea as it continues its pursuit of nuclear weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions and warnings from the United States.
""Please keep in mind that accidents always happen where no one has expected,"" South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said. 
""Please check until the last minute whether there are any security loopholes.""
Lee did not mention North Korea, but South Korea's Defense Ministry on Friday flagged risks that North Korea could resort to terrorist or cyber attacks to spoil international events.
Some 5,000 armed forces personnel will be deployed at the Winter Games, according to South Korean government officials and documents reviewed by Reuters.
Pyeongchang’s organizing committee for the 2018 Games (POCOG) has also hired a private cyber security company to guard against a hacking attack from the North, tender documents show. 

To minimize the risk of provoking an aggressive North Korean reaction during the games, South Korea has asked Washington to delay regular joint military exercises until after the Olympics, the Financial Times reported.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's former president Robert Mugabe has left the country for medical checks in Singapore, his first foreign travel since the army forced him from office last month, a state security official said on Tuesday.
The 93-year-old, who ruled the southern African nation for 37 years, resigned after the army and his ruling ZANU-PF party turned against him when it became clear that his 52-year-old wife, Grace, was being groomed as his successor.
Until recently the world's oldest head of state, Mugabe had a reputation for extensive and expensive international travel, including regular medical trips to Singapore - a source of public anger among his impoverished citizens.
He left Harare with Grace and aides on Monday evening, the official said. He is expected to make a stop-over in Malaysia, where his daughter, Bona, is expecting a second child.
""He has gone for a routine medical trip to Singapore,"" said the official, who has organized Mugabe's security protection but who is not authorized to speak to the media. ""He was due for a check-up but events of the last few weeks made it impossible for him to travel.""
The trip means Mugabe will not be in Zimbabwe when ZANU-PF endorses President Emmerson Mnangagwa as its leader and presidential candidate for next year's elections during a one-day special congress on Friday.
The security official would not say how Mugabe was traveling although the privately owned NewsDay newspaper said he was on a state-owned Air Zimbabwe plane.
Mugabe was granted immunity from prosecution and assured of his safety under his resignation deal, a source of frustration to many Zimbabweans who accused him of looting state coffers and destroying the economy during his time in power. 
Another government official told Reuters last month Mugabe had been due to travel to Singapore on Nov. 16 but was unable to leave because the military had confined him to his private home the previous day.
George Charamba, a senior information ministry official, declined to comment.
Under Zimbabwe's Presidential Pension and Retirement Benefits Act, a former head of state is entitled to perks including limited foreign travel and medical insurance.

""These are very standard features of a retired president,"" another government official said, trying to head off any controversy. ""You are making a storm out of nothing.""

China considers Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.
Numerous Chinese fighter jets, bombers and surveillance aircraft conducted ""routine"" and ""planned"" distant sea patrols on Monday to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Air Force spokesman Shen Jinke said on the military branch's microblog.
H-6K bombers, Su-30 and J-11 fighter jets, and surveillance, alert and refueling aircraft flew over the Miyako Strait in Japan's south and the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines to ""test real combat capabilities"", Shen said.
Taiwan Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan said in a statement they had dispatched aircraft and ships to monitor the activity of the Chinese military and that the drills were not unusual and people should not be alarmed.
China has conducted numerous similar patrols near Taiwan this year, saying such practices have been normalized as it presses ahead with a military modernization program that includes building aircraft carriers and stealth fighters to give it the ability to project power far from its shores.
Beijing regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States. Taiwan is well armed, mostly with U.S. weaponry, but has been pressing Washington to sell it more high-tech equipment to better deter China.
In September, the U.S. Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States.
That prompted a senior U.S.-based Chinese diplomat to say last week that China would invade Taiwan the instant any U.S. navy vessel visited Taiwan.
China suspects Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who leads the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, wants to declare the island's formal independence. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan's security.

Karime Macias is the wife of former ruling party Veracruz Governor Javier Duarte, who is awaiting trial on charges of embezzlement and organized crime, in a case that public auditors said was the worst they had ever seen in Mexico.
In the letter, which the news site posted online, Macias said she was forced to leave the country and shelter in the UK because of ""persecution"" at home.
Reuters did not obtain the letter and could not verify its authenticity. Macias' lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. Macias has not been charged with any crime.
Neither the attorney general's office nor the Veracruz government responded to requests for comment. 
Macias confirmed in the letter that diaries in which she had reportedly written ""I deserve abundance"" repeatedly were hers, and said that her phrases were of a spiritual nature.
Macias said she wanted back personal items including paintings, luxury pens, golf clubs and books that she said were seized by prosecutors without a warrant, adding that she feared other items found were planted there.
In April, Duarte was arrested in a Guatemala hotel where he had been with his wife after fleeing the country. He has denied any wrongdoing, and Macias was not detained.
Top Mexican auditor ASF said in 2016 that the irregularities in public funds under Duarte were the highest amount it had ever seen.
Prosecutors say Duarte headed an organization consisting of at least nine other people, whose criminal operations were carried out in Veracruz, the eastern Gulf state of Campeche and Mexico City between 2011 and 2016.
At a hearing in July, a judge gave prosecutors six months to proceed with the investigation against Duarte.
He is one of four ex-governors detained this year from President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
Corruption is one of the central issues in Mexico's July 2018 election, with public discontent widespread over a spate of conflict-of-interest rows that have dogged the Cabinet and Pena Nieto himself.

Relations between Australia and China have become strained since Canberra announced last week it would ban foreign political donations as part of a crackdown aimed at preventing external influence in domestic politics.
In announcing the ban, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull specifically singled out China, citing ""disturbing reports about Chinese influence"".
China hit back, with the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily describing media reports about Chinese interference as ""racist"" and ""paranoid"".
Dastyari, widely viewed as a rising star of the center-left Labor opposition party, has been under fire since domestic media reported he had sought to encourage the party's deputy leader not to meet a Chinese pro-democracy activist opposed to Beijing's rule in Hong Kong in 2015.
""Today, after much reflection, I've decided that the best service I can render to the federal parliamentary Labor Party is to not return to the Senate in 2018,"" Dastyari told reporters in Sydney.
The latest allegations came just days after Dastyari was said to have warned Chinese political donor Huang Xiangmo that his phone might be tapped.
Dastyari had already quit some senior Labor positions after a tape surfaced of him appearing to endorse China's contentious expansion in disputed areas of the South China Sea, against his party's platform. The tape showed him standing next to Huang.

Rurik Jutting, who is in his early 30s, a former Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) employee, had denied murdering Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, in 2014 on grounds of diminished responsibility due to alcohol and drug abuse and sexual disorders.
The Cambridge-educated Jutting pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in a case that gripped the financial hub.
The jury unanimously found him guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison in the former British colony in November last year.
Jutting's lawyer, Michael Vidler, said the grounds for appeal would focus on the ""directions given by the deputy judge to the jury"".
Jutting is expected to appear in court.
In strongly worded closing remarks at the end of the trial, Deputy High Court Judge Michael Stuart-Moore said the case was one of the most horrifying the Chinese-ruled territory had known.
He described Jutting as the ""archetypal sexual predator"" who represented an extreme danger to women, especially in the sex trade, and cautioned that the possibility he would murder again if freed would be very likely.
It took the jury, made up of four women and five men, about six hours, including a lunch break, to reach its decision.
Lawyers for Jutting, the grandson of a British policeman in Hong Kong and a Chinese woman, had previously argued that cocaine and alcohol abuse as well as personality disorders of sexual sadism and narcissism had impaired his ability to control his behavior. 

The prosecution rejected this, stating Jutting was able to form judgments and exercise self-control before and after the killings, filming his torture of Ningsih on his mobile phone as well as hours of footage in which he discussed the murders, bingeing on cocaine and his graphic sexual fantasies.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European governments are ""complicit"" in grave human rights violations in Libya through their support for authorities there that often work with people smugglers and torture refugees and migrants, Amnesty International said on Tuesday.
Determined to cut African immigration across the Mediterranean, the governments, via the European Union, have provided support to Libya, trained its coastguard and spent millions of euros through U.N. agencies to improve conditions in detention camps where Libya puts the migrants.
The advocacy group said up to 20,000 people were now held in these centers and subject to ""torture, forced labor, extortion, and unlawful killings"", adding to similar allegations made by other rights organizations over the past months.
""European governments have not just been fully aware of these abuses; by actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and containing people in Libya, they are complicit in these crimes,"" John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's head for Europe, said.
The European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, was not immediately available for comment.
Libya is the main gateway for migrants trying to cross to Europe by sea, though numbers have dropped sharply since July as Libyan factions and authorities have begun to block departures under pressure from Italy, the main landing point. More than 600,000 have made the journey over the past four years. 
Amnesty said the Libyan coastguards - which the EU backs to intercept people heading for Europe - work hand-in-hand with people smugglers, including in torturing people to extort money. 
""By supporting Libyan authorities in trapping people in Libya ... European governments have shown where their true priorities lie: namely the closure of the central Mediterranean route, with scant regard to the suffering caused,"" said Dalhuisen.
With Libya being largely a lawless states since the fall of veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi, some EU officials and diplomats chafe at what they see as being forced to rely on sometimes shady characters in the matrix of alliances between militias. 
However, EU leaders meeting for their final gathering this year in Brussels on Dec. 14-15 will recommit themselves to this strategy, which they see as bearing fruit in the form of fewer sea crossings. 
The presidency of Libya's U.N.-backed government said last month it was a victim of illegal migration, not a source of it, and appealed to foreign powers to help stop flows from migrants' countries of origin.

First Secretary of State Damian Green will be told on Wednesday that the Cabinet Office and the prime minister will inform him that he can keep his job, Peston said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
May's office declined to comment on the report.
Peston said no other women came forward to present evidence against Green and that police testimony does not prove he watched the porn on the parliamentary computer.
Two retired police officers alleged the pornography was discovered on Green's computer by officers during an inquiry into government leaks in 2008.
Earlier on Monday, a spokesman for the prime minister said there are procedures to go through in the investigation and once they are complete the government will publish the findings. 
Green, who is a close ally of May, has denied the allegations.
If Green is cleared it would be a boost to the prime minister after she lost two ministers last month: one was forced to quit in a sexual harassment scandal and another over undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials.

The move comes a day after party members overwhelmingly elected Laurent Wauquiez as a their new boss, following a campaign during which he said President Emmanuel Macron was too weak on security and immigration.
""I don't recognize my political family, so I decided to leave it,"" Bertrand, a former health minister and current head of Hauts-de-France, a region in northern France, said on France 2 TV station. 
Bertrand's move underlines growing concern among moderate members of The Republicans about the party's direction, after a disastrous presidential campaign that saw its candidate eliminated in the first round. 
Some have said Wauquiez was hauling the party too far to the right and running after the National Front, whose leader Marine Le Pen made it to the second round of the presidential election last May. 
""Xavier Bertrand obviously considers that he has no place (in the party). It's his choice. I respect it,"" Wauquiez said on TF1 TV station, in reaction to the news.

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian opposition figure Mikheil Saakashvili was freed from detention on Monday, after a Ukrainian judge turned down the prosecutors' request to place him under house arrest - the latest twist in his dramatic standoff with the authorities. 
President of his native Georgia for nine years until 2013, Saakashvili moved to Ukraine after a popular uprising there and served under Poroshenko as a regional governor from 2015-2016, before falling out with the Ukrainian leader.
The 49-year-old accuses the Ukrainian authorities of widespread corruption. Prosecutors wanted him placed under house arrest while investigators look into accusations he assisted a criminal organization, charges he says were trumped up to undermine his campaign to unseat Poroshenko.
""The prosecutors' petition ... is dismissed,"" Judge Larysa Tsokol told the court.
A crowd of several hundred supporters, who had remained outside the courthouse throughout the eight-hour hearing, cheered the judge's decision.
""The judge is good. She did everything correctly and in accordance with the law,"" Saakashvili said. ""It means not everything is lost in Ukraine.""
The case against him remains open.
Speaking after the ruling, which was attended by several prominent opposition lawmakers, including former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, Saakashvili said he planned to continue his political work.
Together with other opposition politicians he will ""prepare for a peaceful but very important and necessary change in leadership in Ukraine"", he said. 
Saakashvili, who launched a hunger strike to protest against his detention, sang the Ukrainian national anthem at the beginning of the hearing.
The courtroom was so packed with journalists and Saakashvili's supporters that his lawyer asked the judge to move the session to a larger room.
The investigation provoked violent clashes between protesters and riot police last week, while on Sunday several thousand people attended a peaceful rally in central Kiev to support Saakashvili and call for Poroshenko's impeachment.
""While the protest does not represent a significant risk to government stability at the moment, it will likely attract the attention of Ukraine's international supporters and donors,"" London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence said in a note. 
Saakashvili is also facing the threat of possible extradition to Georgia, where he is wanted on criminal charges.
Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko told Reuters the extradition request was being considered but no final decision had yet been made. He denied the case was politically motivated.
""Every person who lives in Ukraine must respect the basic laws,"" he said. 

""Unfortunately so far we only see things that are unworthy behavior of such a person.""

At the start of December, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told supporters in the violence-wracked state of Guerrero he was prepared to analyze all the options, including an amnesty, to bring peace to Mexico after years of violence between gangs.
""You can't fight fire with fire,"" he said.
Asked by a reporter whether his amnesty could include drug cartel bosses, Lopez Obrador his campaign would ""consider it"" in a recording published by newspaper El Universal.
A telephone survey by polling firm Buendia & Laredo for El Universal showed only 23 percent of the respondents agreed somewhat or strongly with the idea of brokering an amnesty with the gangs in exchange for pledges to reduce violence.
Some 66 percent took the opposite view, while eight percent said they had no opinion either way. The rest gave no answer.
Violence between drug cartels and security forces has been blamed for well over 100,000 deaths in the past decade, and Mexico is on track to register its highest murder total this year since it began keeping regular monthly tallies in 1997.
Lopez Obrador, who has led most of the early polls for the July 2018 election, did not provide details about the potential scope of the amnesty, and aides to the 64-year-old consulted by Reuters have so far declined to flesh out how one might work.
A former mayor of Mexico City, Lopez Obrador was runner-up in the last two elections, and his adversaries seized on the amnesty to paint the proposal as a threat to security and an affront to the victims of organized crime.
A gang truce in El Salvador in 2012 initially cut violence, but when it broke down, murders soared to new heights.
The Buendia & Laredo survey, which polled 600 people Dec. 7-8, said that only 16 percent of those polled felt the amnesty would improve the security situation in Mexico, while 62 percent took the opposite view. Some 18 percent believed it would make no difference and the rest gave no answer.
The poll was conducted had a margin of error of 4.0 percentage points, El Universal said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Mateusz Morawiecki was sworn in as Poland's new prime minister on Monday and European Council President Donald Tusk called on the new leader to pursue European unity.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) is at odds with the EU over immigration, logging in an ancient forest and government attempts to control the courts and the media. Critics say the eurosceptic party's policies have subverted democracy and the rule of law.
At the same time, acrimony between Tusk and the PiS dates back years. Poland, acting on orders from the PiS boss and long-time Tusk adversary Jaroslaw Kaczynski, was the sole member of the 28 EU members to vote in March against Tusk's re-election.
Morawiecki, 49, replaced Beata Szydlo, who became a deputy prime minister. PiS sacked the popular Szydlo last week in a bid to improve Poland's image abroad and prepare the conservatives for a series of elections.
Morawiecki will remain finance minister and economy minister. All other ministers have kept their jobs for now, although some ministerial changes are expected in weeks to come.
Morawiecki said his government will continue the work of Szydlo. He is expected to outline his policies on Tuesday.
Tusk, a former Polish prime minister before PiS came to power in 2015, said he counts on good cooperation.
""Acting for Poland's strong position in the European Union and for the unity of all member states is the need of the moment,"" Tusk wrote.
Former Polish President Lech Walesa, who is a critic of the PiS said on Twitter: ""The circus has stayed the same, only the clowns have changed their roles."" Walesa led protests and strikes that shook communist rule in the 1980s.

Szydlo's government was one of the most popular in Poland since the 1989 collapse of communism. It registered around 40 percent approval due to low unemployment, increases in public spending and a focus on traditional Catholic values in public life.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Bangladeshi man with a homemade bomb strapped to his body set off an explosion at a New York commuter hub during rush hour on Monday, wounding himself and three others in what New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called an attempted terrorist attack. 
The suspect in the incident at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, a block from Times Square (NYSE:SQ), was identified as Akayed Ullah, the New York Police Department commissioner said. The suspect had burns and lacerations while three other people, including a police officer, sustained minor injuries.
Ullah is from the Bangladeshi city of Chittagong and is a U.S. resident, said the country's police chief. He had no criminal record there and last visited Bangladesh on Sept. 8, the chief said.
Ullah had a black cab/limousine driver's license from 2012 to 2015, after which it expired, the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission said.
The weapon was based on a pipe bomb and attached to the suspect, police said. New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo, speaking at a news conference near the site, described the device as ""amateur-level.""
De Blasio told the same news conference that the incident, which happened at the start of the city's rush hour, was ""an attempted terrorist attack.""
""As New Yorkers our lives revolve around the subways. When we hear of an attack in the subways, it is incredibly unsettling,"" de Blasio said.
New York City was a target, said John Miller, deputy police commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. 
Miller cited the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, that killed more than 2,750 people in New York and nearly 3,000 people total; and the World Trade Center bombing of February 26, 1993, which killed six people.
""When you hear about a bomb in the subway station, which is in many ways one of our worst nightmares, the reality turns out better than the initial expectation and fear,"" Cuomo told reporters. Later on CNN, he said the attacker apparently used the internet to obtain information on how to make a bomb.
The incident was captured on security video, police said. Video posted on NYPost.com showed smoke and a man lying in the tunnel that connects sections of the Times Square subway station and the bus station. A photograph showed a man lying facedown, with tattered clothes and burns on his torso. 
""There was a stampede up the stairs to get out,"" said one commuter, Diego Fernandez. ""Everybody was scared and running and shouting.”
Alicja Wlodkowski, a Pennsylvania resident in New York for the day, was sitting in a restaurant in the bus terminal.
“Suddenly, I saw a group of people, like six people, running like nuts. A woman fell. No one even went to stop and help her because the panic was so scary."" 
The bus terminal was temporarily shut down and a large swath of midtown Manhattan was closed to traffic. Subway train service returned to normal after earlier disruptions.
WABC reported the suspect was in his 20s and that he has been in the United States for seven years and has an address in New York's Brooklyn borough. Police shut down the entire block and there was a heavy police presence outside the home.
First reports of the incident began soon after 7 a.m. (1200 GMT). New York in December sees a surge of visitors who come to see elaborate store displays, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and Broadway shows.
The bus terminal is the busiest in the United States, according to the Port Authority. On a typical weekday, about 220,000 passengers arrive or depart on more than 7,000 buses. 
More than 200,000 people use the Times Square station, the city's busiest, each weekday, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The bus terminal is connected to different sections of the sprawling Times Square subway station - which serves 10 train lines - through a long, narrow below-ground tunnel that carries thousands of commuters during rush hour. Buskers and other entertainers at entrances to the tunnel often draw crowds.
The incident rippled through American financial markets, briefly weakening stock markets as they were starting trading for the week and giving a modest lift to safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries.
S&P 500 index emini futures dipped in the moments after the initial reports of an explosion, but major stock indexes later opened slightly higher.
On the West Coast, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation authority asked law enforcement for heightened security along bus and rail lines as a precaution.
The incident occurred less than two months after an Uzbek immigrant killed eight people by speeding a rental truck down a New York City bike path, in an attack for which Islamic State claimed responsibility.

In September 2016, a man injured 31 people when he set off a homemade bomb in New York's Chelsea district.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson discussed Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case with Iranian officials after flying to Tehran over the weekend to try to seek her release.
""One of the issues that Johnson brought up in Tehran was the issue of Ms. Zaghari,"" Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi was quoted by state media as saying.
""With regard to her dual nationality, from our point of view of course she is Iranian and she has been sentenced by the judiciary and she will serve the period of her sentence.""
Britain says Zaghari-Ratcliffe was visiting family on holiday in April 2016 when she was jailed by Iran for attempting to overthrow the government.
Johnson said he urged the release of dual nationals.
""I urged their release, on humanitarian grounds, where there is cause to do so,"" Johnson told the British parliament. 
""These are complex cases involving individuals considered by Iran to be their own citizens, and I do not wish to raise false hopes. But my meetings in Tehran were worthwhile,"" he said. ""It is too early to be confident about the outcome.""
Zaghari-Ratcliffe is not the only dual national being held in Iran, but her case has taken on political significance in Britain after Johnson said last month that she had been teaching journalists in Iran, which her employer denies. Johnson later apologized.
Opponents have called for him to resign if his comments lead to her serving longer in prison.
Qassemi said the Iranian foreign ministry would follow up on Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case but said that it was ultimately a matter for the judiciary.
A project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges.
The Thomson Reuters Foundation is a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. It says Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran.

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2017 01:11PM ET</span>",EU tells Netanyahu it rejects Trump's Jerusalem move,"By Robin Emmott and John Davison
BRUSSELS/CAIRO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took his case to Europe to ask allies to join the United States in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but met a firm rebuff from EU foreign ministers who saw the move as a blow against the peace process.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, took his own case to Egypt on Monday and was expected to fly to Turkey for a meeting of Muslim countries this week, cementing support from leaders who say the U.S. move was a dire error.
President Donald Trump announced last Wednesday the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, breaking with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that the city's status must be left to Israeli-Palestinian talks.
Netanyahu, on his first visit to EU headquarters in Brussels, said Trump's move helped peace, ""because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace"".
Israel, which annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in a 1967 war, considers the entire city to be its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.
The Trump administration says it remains committed to the peace process and its decision does not affect Jerusalem's future borders or status. It says any credible future peace deal will place the Israeli capital in Jerusalem, and ditching old policies is needed to revive a peace process frozen since 2014.
But even Israel's closest European allies have rejected that logic and say recognizing Israel's capital unilaterally risks inflaming violence and further wrecking the chance for peace.
After a breakfast meeting between Netanyahu and EU foreign ministers, Sweden's top diplomat said no European at the closed-door meeting had voiced support for Trump's decision, and no country was likely to follow the United States in announcing plans to move its embassy.
""I have a hard time seeing that any other country would do that and I don't think any other EU country will do it,"" Margot Wallstrom told reporters.
Israel's position does appear to have more support from some EU states than others. Last week, the Czech foreign ministry said it would begin considering moving the Czech Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, while Hungary blocked a planned EU statement condemning the U.S. move.
But Prague later said it accepted Israel's sovereignty only over West Jerusalem, and Budapest said its long-term position seeking a two-state solution in the Middle East had not changed.
On Monday, Czech Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek said of Trump's decision: ""I'm afraid it can't help us.""
""I'm convinced that it is impossible to ease tension with a unilateral solution,"" Zaoralek said. ""We are talking about an Israeli state but at the same time we have to speak about a Palestinian state.""
The Palestinian president, Abbas, met the head of the Arab League in Cairo on Monday and was due to meet President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Egypt is a U.S. ally that has a peace treaty with Israel and has brokered Israeli-Palestinian deals in the past.
""DUNGEON FOR MUSLIMS""
Moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem would have ""dangerous effects on peace and security in the region"", Sisi said on Monday at an earlier meeting with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Abbas was also due to fly to Turkey. Trump's announcement has triggered a war of words between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Netanyahu, straining ties between the two U.S. allies which were restored only last year after a six-year breach that followed the Israeli storming of a Turkish aid ship.
On Sunday, Erdogan called Israel a ""terror state"". Netanyahu responded by saying he would accept no moral lectures from Erdogan who he accused of bombing Kurdish villages, jailing opponents and supporting terrorists.
On Monday Erdogan took aim directly at Washington over Trump's move: ""The ones who made Jerusalem a dungeon for Muslims and members of other religions will never be able to clean the blood from their hands,"" he said in a speech in Ankara. ""With their decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, the United States has become a partner in this bloodshed.""
Trump's announcement triggered days of protests across the Muslim world and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in which scores of Palestinians were wounded and several killed. By Monday morning, violence appeared to have subsided.
In Beirut, tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest at a march backed by Hezbollah, the heavily-armed Iran-backed Shi'ite group whose leader called last week for a new Palestinian uprising against Israel. An announcer led the crowd in chants of ""Death to America! Death to Israel!""
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah told the crowd by video link the group was turning its focus back toward the fight against Israel: ""Today the axis of resistance, including Hezbollah, will return as its most important priority ... Jerusalem and Palestine and the Palestinian people and the Palestinian resistance in all its factions.""
""STOP PAMPERING""
Netanyahu, who has been angered by the EU's search for closer business ties with Iran, said Europeans should emulate Trump's move and press the Palestinians to do so, too.
""It's time that the Palestinians recognize the Jewish state and also recognize the fact that it has a capital. It's called Jerusalem,"" he said. In comments filmed later on his plane, he said he had told the Europeans to ""stop pampering the Palestinians"", who ""need a reality check"".
The decision to recognize Jerusalem could also strain Washington's ties with another of its major Muslim allies, Saudi Arabia, which has sought closer relations with Washington under Trump than under his predecessor, Barack Obama.
Saudi Arabia shares U.S. and Israeli concerns about the increasing regional influence of Iran, and was seen as a potential broker for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace deal. But Saudis have suggested that unilateral decisions over Jerusalem make any such rapprochement more difficult.
Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former Saudi ambassador to the United States and veteran ex-security chief, published a strongly-worded open letter to Trump on Monday.
""Bloodshed and mayhem will definitely follow your opportunistic attempt to make electoral gain,"" the prince wrote in the letter, published in the Saudi newspaper al-Jazeera.

""Your action has emboldened the most extreme elements in the Israeli society ... because they take your action as a license to evict the Palestinians from their lands and subject them to an apartheid state,"" he added. ""Your action has equally emboldened Iran and its terrorist minions to claim that they are the legitimate defenders of Palestinian rights.""

Saudi Arabia, which wants to reduce oil consumption at home, is considering building 17.6 gigawatts of nuclear-powered electricity generating capacity by 2032 and has sent a request for information to international suppliers to build two reactors. 
Sources familiar with the situation said last month EDF has already held talks with Saudi Arabia about selling Areva-designed European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) and that it wants to participate in a possible Saudi nuclear tender.
Levy said that EDF wants to take part in the country's move away from relying on fossil fuels for its energy supplies. 
""We will respond to this opportunity in all the energy technologies in which we have competencies, that is in solar, wind and nuclear,"" Levy said.
Russian and South Korean companies have already said they plan to bid for the Saudi work on nuclear power while sources have said Toshiba-owned U.S. firm Westinghouse (T:6502) is in talks with U.S. peers to form a bidding consortium. 
In 2009 EDF and Areva lost out to South Korea's KEPCO (KS:052690) in the bidding to build nuclear reactors in the United Arab Emirates, the first such project in the Middle East. 

EDF is set to buy French nuclear group Areva's reactor engineering division Areva NP in a deal expected to be finalised before the end of this year. Levy said EDF is on track to finalize the deal before the end of this month.

1633,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2017 01:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Detained Saudi billionaire al-Sanea seeks to end debt dispute,"By Davide Barbuscia and Tom Arnold
DUBAI (Reuters) - A detained Saudi billionaire who led the collapsed Saad Group is seeking to repay part of a multi-billion dollar debt to creditors under a deal that could allow his release, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The businessman, Maan al-Sanea, was detained in October in the kingdom's Eastern Province for unpaid debts, and has since been in a civil detention center in the city of Khobar, according to several sources. 
Reemas Group, a financial consultancy hired by Saad Group, has outlined a proposed settlement covering $4 billion in debt. In an email sent by Reemas to creditors, of copy of which Reuters has obtained, it suggests that they would get more of their money back than under a court-enforced liquidation of the company, albeit over a longer period.
At the height of his success, al-Sanea held investments in a number of large companies, including a 3.1 percent stake in British-based bank HSBC bought in 2007. That year, when his net worth was estimated at over $10 billion, he was ranked by Forbes as one of the world's 100 richest men.
But al-Sanea's fortunes turned in 2009, when his business collapsed under heavy debts, unleashing a series of long-running legal disputes.
Al-Sanea was detained a few weeks before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched a crackdown on corruption in which dozens of Saudi princes and businessmen are being held. 
However, there is no indication that al-Sanea's case is linked with this campaign, as he was detained by the Saudi authorities for unpaid debts rather than alleged graft.
Sources told Reuters that al-Sanea has access to a telephone to speak to his legal team and advisers, and has been trying to organize the debt settlement with the help of some members of his family.
A source at the Ministry of Justice in Riyadh said al-Sanea could be released if his debts with creditors are settled. 
Khobar General Court could not immediately be reached for comment.
Reemas Group, which has branches in Khobar and Bahrain, said in the email that 34 financial institutions had obtained court judgments in the case worth 15.7 billion riyals ($4.19 billion). 
""We have contacted 90 percent either directly or via their local representative over the past few days. They have welcomed the idea, and we are yet to receive their preliminary consent in order to proceed with the next step,"" said the email, which was sent to other creditors last month.
Reemas said in the email that rather than auctioning off Saad Group's assets under the liquidation process, they would be moved into a special purpose vehicle, with creditors owning the new company. ""The initiative would protect the (assets) from substantial reduction in value and enhance the debt coverage ratio to reach at least 20-25 percent,"" it said.
Reemas Group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
WEIGHT OF DEBT
Saad Group, once one of the largest business conglomerates in the Gulf, collapsed under the weight of its debts in 2009 along with the family-owned Saudi conglomerate Ahmad Algosaibi and Brothers (AHAB). Since then, the two groups have been battling each other in the courts, with creditors seeking to recover billions of dollars.
AHAB said it had yet to approached about the proposed debt settlement. ""We are happy to engage in the dialogue and feel we should be included and if we're not included we will pursue all avenues available to us,"" said Simon Charlton, AHAB's chief restructuring officer and acting chief executive.
The debt settlement efforts, sources said, came after an entity established by the Supreme Judicial Council in Saudi Arabia, called the Joint Directorate of Enforcement at the General Court in Al-Khobar (JDEK), took over al-Sanea's personal assets and began a liquidation process for Saad Group.
The proposed settlement suggests creditors would recover the funds over a five-year period. Two sources said that according to the debt recovery path indicated by JDEK, they would get only 6 to 8 cents in the dollar but more quickly, over a period of one to three years.
According to the terms of the settlement, the special purpose vehicle would be supervised by a steering committee headed by Saudi Arabia's Arab National Bank.
Arab National Bank did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Two of the sources familiar with the matter confirmed that a consensual and speedy settlement would show al-Sanea is serious about repaying creditors and could potentially accelerate his release.

A Saudi-led military coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen's civil war blockaded ports last month after a missile was fired toward Riyadh.
Jamie McGoldrick, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, said the blockade has since been eased, but the situation remained dire.
""The continuing blockade of ports is limiting supplies of fuel, food and medicines; dramatically increasing the number of vulnerable people who need help,"" McGoldrick said in a statement.
""The lives of millions of people, including 8.4 million Yemenis who are a step away from famine, hinge on our ability to continue our operations and to provide health, safe water, food, shelter and nutrition support,"" he added.
That marked an increase from past U.N. estimates of around 8 million people on the brink of famine.
The coalition accuses Iran of sending weapons to its Houthi allies, including missile parts, through Yemen's main Hodeidah port, were most food supplies enter.
Saudi state television said on Monday a U.N delegation of experts has arrived in Riyadh to meet the coalition and the Yemeni government the coalition supports ""to prevent the transfer of weapons and rockets to Houthis"".
Iran has denied supplying the Houthis with weapons, saying the U.S. and Saudi allegations are ""baseless and unfounded"".
The United Nations says food shortages caused by the warring parties blocking supplies has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis. 
The Saudis intervened in neighboring Yemen in 2015 after the Houthis advanced on the southern port city of Aden and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government into exile.
The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than two million and triggered a cholera epidemic that has infected about one million people.

The 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of trespass on Sunday evening, three minutes after he stepped over a low outer perimeter fence near the palace, the Metropolitan Police said.
""The man was not found in possession of any offensive weapons and the incident is not being treated as terrorist related,"" police said in a statement.
He has been released on conditional bail and has undergone a mental health assessment. 
British police are on high alert after five attacks blamed on terrorism this year. In August, a man wielding a sword outside the palace was charged under terrorism laws. Three police officers suffered minor injuries detaining him.
A number of people have tried to get into the palace grounds in recent years. A woman was arrested in October for attempting to scale the gates of the palace.
In May 2016, a man with a conviction for murder climbed over the wall and walked for about 10 minutes around the grounds of the palace before being arrested. He was jailed for four months.
Four years ago, a man armed with a knife tried to enter through a gate and was later jailed for 16 months. A month earlier, two men were arrested following a break-in at the palace.
One of the biggest security breaches at Buckingham Palace happened in 1982 when an intruder, Michael Fagan, climbed a wall and wandered into a room where the queen was in bed.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2017 12:10PM ET</span>",Burundi will raise funds from citizens to pay for 2020 election,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Burundi plans to raise money for an election in 2020 by deducting part of civil servants' salaries and taking contributions directly from citizens, a government minister said on Monday, as it seeks to replace dwindling external funding.
Until 2015, Burundi used external aid to pay for elections, but donors have suspended their assistance since a political crisis erupted when President Pierre Nkurunziza sought and won a third term.
Pascal Barandagiye, the minister for interior, said the government will also be seek contributions from every household, which will pay up to 2000 francs ($1.14) a year. Gross national income per capita stood at $280 in 2016, and close to 65 percent of the population live below the poverty line, according to World Bank data.
""The total amount of the election cost is not yet known ... But as soon as the needed fund is got the fundraising campaign will be halted,"" Barandagiye told a news conference. ""That contribution should be given voluntarily, it shouldn’t be seen as a head tax.""
Students of voting age will contribute 1000 francs annually. Civil servants will contribute at least a tenth of their monthly salaries, Barandagiye said. Foreign help would also be accepted, he said. 
Burundi has been gripped by a political crisis since April 2015, when Nkurunziza announced he would stand for a third term, which the opposition said violated the constitution as well as a 2005 peace deal that ended a 12-year civil war.
He won a vote largely boycotted by the opposition, but protests sparked a government crackdown. More than 700 people have been killed and 400,000 displaced to neighbouring countries. The economy has stagnated.
The aid-dependent nation now has to rely on domestic tax collection and modest revenue from coffee and tea exports. Key donors, such as the European Union, cut direct financial support to the government over accusations of human rights violations and the crackdown on opponents, which Burundi rejects.
At the end of October, Burundi's cabinet adopted draft legislation seeking to change the current constitution to allow Nkurunziza to run for a fourth term in the 2020 election.
The proposed amendments, which are likely to go to a referendum by next year, seek to abolish the two-term limit and lengthen the presidential terms to seven years.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's lower house of parliament, which is dominated by the ruling Social Democrats, approved a bill on Monday that will change the way magistrates are supervised and which critics say threatens judicial independence and efforts to fight corruption. 
Thousands of Romanians have rallied in the capital Bucharest and other cities over the past weeks protesting against government plans to overhaul the judicial system in one of European Union's most graft-prone member states.
Lawmakers approved the bill by 179 votes to 90 vote. Parliament has been debating the legislation, which the European Commission and thousands of magistrates have said would put the judicial system under political control, since mid-November.
The parliamentary commission which has debated the changes is headed former justice minister Florin Iordache, who quit in February after a decree on graft that he drafted triggered the biggest rallies since the 1989 anti-communist revolution.
Contested elements of the bill include changes to a judicial inspection unit which oversees the conduct of magistrates. It will also change the way in which chief prosecutors are appointed and strip the president of the right to vet candidates, as well as amending the definition of prosecutors' activity to exclude the word ""independent"".
""Prosecutors carry out their work according to the principles of legality, impartiality, hierarchical control, under the authority of justice minister,"" reads the bill. 
The bill also refers to the finance ministry's obligation to recoup any losses triggered by a judicial error from the judge who issued the sentence, instead of from state funds. Experts have said this would could potentially distort court judgments.
The bill will be sent to the upper house, the senate, for debates. A vote in the senate, which has the final say on the bill, could be scheduled for later this month.
Transparency International ranks Romania among the European Union's most corrupt states and Brussels keeps Romania's justice system under special monitoring.
In a Nov. 15 report the European Commission said justice reform has stagnated this year and challenges to judicial independence remain a persistent source of concern.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2017 11:10AM ET</span>",Corsica's nationalists dream bigger after election win,"By Paul Ortoli
AJACCIO, France (Reuters) - Corsican nationalists said on Monday it was time for talks with Paris on greater autonomy for the French Mediterranean island, after they won nearly two thirds of seats in local elections.
Support for their cause in Sunday's vote was boosted by dissatisfaction with France's mainstream parties, a trend that has fueled secessionist ambitions in other parts of Europe.
Nationalist leader Gilles Simeoni hailed the start of a new era after the two-party Pe a Corsica (For Corsica) alliance that he heads took over 56 percent of Sunday's vote and 41 of 63 seats. 
Unlike in Catalonia, nationalists in Corsica have downplayed any ambitions for secession, saying the island - where Napoleon was born in 1769 - lacked the Spanish region's demographic and economic clout. 
But Simeoni said he was seeking a greater say for local authorities on fiscal issues, official status for the Corsican language, and limiting the right to buy property in some areas to people who had lived on the island for at least five years. 
""This is a time many of us thought we would never witness,"" he told applauding supporters after the win, referring to the fact that nationalists only started to make headway in Corsican elections two years ago. ""Our dream is becoming reality.""
Calling for discussions to find a ""political solution,"" Simeoni told Reuters: ""It's the start of a new era, the ball is in the government's court.""
The nationalist vote also benefited from the island's most active clandestine group, the National Front for the Liberation of Corsica (FLNC), having laid down its weapons in 2014 after a near four-decade long rebellion.
Turnout for the run-off election, in which the top parties from an initial Dec. 3 ballot participated, was barely above 50 percent.
But in a sign that the government may be heeding the call for dialogue, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Sunday called Simeoni to congratulate him on his win and told him he was willing to see him soon in Paris, Philippe's office said. 
Corsica has a population of just 320,000 people and a tiny 8.6 billion euro ($10.13 billion) economy.

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2017 11:05AM ET</span>","Putin, in Syria, says mission accomplished, orders partial Russian pull-out","By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin flew into Syria and ordered ""a significant part"" of Moscow's military contingent there to start withdrawing on Monday, declaring their work largely done.
Putin, who polls show will be re-elected comfortably in March, made the announcement during a surprise visit to Russia's Hmeymim air base in Syria - his first since Russia intervened in the conflict. He held talks with President Bashar al-Assad and addressed Russian forces.
The first leg in a three-country one-day whirlwind diplomatic visit which sees Putin also meeting his Egyptian and Turkish counterparts, Putin is keen to leverage the heightened Middle East influence that Syria has given him to cast himself as a leader who can do diplomacy as well as military force.
The Kremlin first launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015 in its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in Assad's favor. Now that it regards that mission complete, Putin wants to help broker a peace deal. 
""In just over two years, Russia's armed forces and the Syrian army have defeated the most battle-hardened group of international terrorists,"" Putin told Russian servicemen. 
A ""significant part"" of the Russian force could now return home. ""The conditions for a political solution under the auspices of the United Nations have been created,"" said Putin. ""The Motherland awaits you.""
Washington was skeptical about Putin's statement.
""Russian comments about removal of their forces do not often correspond with actual troop reductions, and do not affect U.S. priorities in Syria,"" said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon.
Putin made clear in any case that Russia would retain enough firepower to destroy any possible Islamic State comeback.
Syrian state television quoted Assad as thanking Putin for Russia's help, saying the blood of Moscow's ""martyrs"" had been mixed with the blood of the Syrian army. It also showed the two men watching what it called a victory parade with Russian troops dressed in desert uniforms marching past.
Russia's main contribution has been air strikes, and with Iran-backed Shi’ite militias doing much of the fighting on the ground, the partial Russian withdrawal may not make a huge difference when it comes to the military situation.
Russia's campaign, which has been extensively covered on state TV at home, has not caught the imagination of most Russians. But nor has it stirred unease of the kind the Soviet Union faced with its calamitous 1980s Afghanistan intervention. 
The use of private military contractors, something which has been documented by Reuters but denied by the defense ministry, has allowed Moscow to keep the public casualty toll fairly low. 
Officially, less than 50 Russian service personnel have been killed in the campaign, but the real number, including private contractors, is estimated to be much higher. 
ELECTORAL BOOST?
Russia's ""mission accomplished"" moment in Syria may help Putin increase the turnout at the March presidential election by appealing to the patriotism of voters. 
Though polls show he will easily win, they also show that some Russians are increasingly apathetic about politics, and Putin's supporters are keen to get him re-elected on a big turnout, which in their eyes confers legitimacy.
Putin, who with the help of state TV has dominated Russia's political landscape for the last 17 years, told Russian servicemen they would return home as victors. 
Speaking in front of a row of servicemen holding Russian flags, Putin said his military had proved its might and that Moscow had succeeded in keeping Syria intact as a ""sovereign independent state.""
""I congratulate you!"" Putin told the servicemen.
Putin is keen to organize a special event in Russia - the Syrian Congress on National Dialogue - that Moscow hopes will bring together the Syrian government and opposition and try to hammer out a new constitution.
When asked about Putin's announcement, Yahya Aridi, spokesman for the Syrian opposition in Geneva, said it welcomed any step that brought Syria closer to real peace. 
Putin made clear however that while Russia might be drawing down much of its forces, its military presence in Syria was a permanent one and that it would retain enough firepower to destroy any Islamic State comeback.
Russia will keep its Hmeymim air base in Syria's Latakia Province and its naval facility in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartous ""on a permanent basis,"" said Putin.
Both bases are protected by sophisticated air defense missile systems.
Putin was told by the military that it had begun withdrawing 25 aircraft, a detachment of Russian military police, a detachment of Russian special forces, a military field hospital and a de-mining center. 
However, Russia has announced partial force draw-downs before only to later bring in different capabilities.
""We've seen such announcements before, which turn about to be less significant than they might have initially appeared,"" said one European diplomat who declined to be named.

""The most significant contribution Russia can make to advancing peace in Syria is to pressure the Assad regime to engage seriously in Geneva (peace talks). Absent that, the suspicion will be that this announcement may have more to do with Russian politics than the Syrian situation.""

CAIRO (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Monday, agreeing to resume civilian flights which Moscow halted more than two years ago after militants bombed a Russian tourist jet over the Sinai.
Putin's latest visit to Cairo reflects the deepening ties between Russia and Egypt, the second largest recipient of U.S. military aid after Israel and a strategic U.S. partner in the Middle East because of its control of the Suez Canal.
Putin, who flew on to Turkey, briefly visited a Russian base in Syria before arriving in Egypt and ordered Russian forces to start withdrawing from Syria after a two-year military campaign there.
In Cairo, Egyptian and Russian ministers signed a $21 billion deal to start work on Egypt's Dabaa nuclear power plant and Putin said Moscow was ready to resume Russian civilian flights to Egypt.
Moscow halted civilian air traffic to Egypt in 2015 after militants detonated a bomb on a Russian Metrojet flight, downing the jet leaving from the tourist resort of Sharm el-Sheikh and killing 224 people on board.
The attack and Moscow's decision damaged Egypt's already struggling tourism industry. Egyptian airport inspections and talks to resume flights have been going on for months.
""The Russian security services have reported to me that, on the whole, we are ready for opening the direct air link between Moscow and Cairo,"" Putin said. ""This would require signing a corresponding intergovernmental protocol.""
Russia's transport minister told reporters flights could resume in early February, and Russia was prepared to sign a protocol with Egypt this week.
Earlier, Russian state nuclear company Rosatom said the Dabaa nuclear station it will build in Egypt will have four reactors and cost up to $21 billion. Construction is expected to finish in 2028-2029.
Moscow and Cairo signed an initial agreement in 2015 for Russia to build the plant, with Russia extending a loan to Egypt to cover the cost of construction.
Sisi said the two leaders had also discussed industrial projects, trade and Russian investments in Egypt, including in the Suez Canal Economic Zone.
MILITARY COOPERATION
Sisi and Putin also discussed Syria and mutual rejection of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a move that has triggered protests across the region and from European capitals.
""We had a detailed exchange of views on key international issues. Our approaches either coincide completely or are really quite close,"" Putin said. 
The high-level Russian visit comes after the U.S. government in August decided to deny Egypt $95.7 million in aid and to delay another $195 million because of its failure to make progress on human rights and democratic norms.
Russia launched a military operation to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in September 2015, and there are signs Moscow is keen to expand its military presence in the region.
Neither leader on Monday mentioned an announcement from November when Russia's government published a draft agreement between Russia and Egypt allowing both countries to use each other's air space and air bases for their military planes.
But Putin has been steadily building relations with Egypt. On his first visit to Cairo in 2015, he was the first leader of a major power to meet with Sisi after the former Egyptian army commander ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013.
That prompted Washington to cool relations with Egypt, and the U.S. government suspended some military aid.
Since then the two leaders have increased cooperation, reviving the historical alliance between Egypt and Soviet Union of the 1970s.

For the fourth time, China unsuccessfully tried to stop the public meeting by calling a procedural vote. A minimum of nine votes are needed to win such a vote and China, Russia, the United States, Britain and France cannot wield their vetoes.
Ten members voted in favor of holding the meeting, China, Russia and Bolivia voted against and Egypt and Ethiopia abstained. 
""Council members and relevant parties should engage themselves with finding ways to ease tensions on the Peninsula. They should avoid mutual provocation and words or actions that might further escalate the situation,"" China's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Wu Haitao told the council before the vote. 
""(The) council's discussion of the human rights issue in the DPRK (North Korea) runs counter to the above objective and is counter productive,"" he said. 
A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim Jong Un himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities.
Last year, the United States angered North Korea by blacklisting its leader Kim for human rights abuses.
""We continue to think there's a separation between peace and security and human rights and there's not,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the Security Council. ""Prevention also includes human rights and being able to call out countries when they do abuses like this."" 
North Korea has repeatedly rejected accusations of human rights abuses and blames sanctions for a dire humanitarian situation. Pyongyang has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs. 
The Security Council is due to hold a ministerial meeting on North Korea's nuclear and missiles programs on Friday.

The move comes after Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha announced in October that a general election would take place in November 2018 - the most precise date the junta has given after many delays since the 2014 coup. 
The government, however, has yet to end a political ban that would allow political parties to campaign ahead of the vote.
The EU is Thailand's third trade partner after China and Japan. Thailand is the EU's third-largest trading partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
Thailand exported goods worth €19.6 billion ($23.11 billion) to the EU in 2015, according to the European Commission.
""The Council decided to resume political contacts at all levels with Thailand in order to facilitate meaningful dialogue on issues of mutual importance, including on human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the road towards democracy,"" the EU's Foreign Affairs Council said in a statement. 
In June 2014, the EU said it would keep its relations with Thailand under review and put on hold the signing of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), which was aimed at closer economic and political ties with Thailand.
It has expressed concerns over freedom of expression in the country and has called for a swift return to democracy. 
The signing of PCA and talks on EU-Thailand Free Trade Agreement (FTA) could resume with a democratically elected civilian government under the new Constitution, the statement said. 
The United States also downgraded ties with Thailand following the coup, scaling back joint military exercises, among other things.
According to the European Commission, the EU exported goods worth €13.4 billion ($15.80 billion) to Thailand in 2015, including machinery and transport equipment.

Several airlines stopped flying over Iraq in 2014 on safety concerns because of the conflict and after a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet was shot down over Ukraine the same year.
Airlines have instead been flying longer routes over Iran and other countries, increasing congestion in the region, with many airlines also avoiding Syrian airspace. 
The use of Iraqi airspace is likely to help Emirates and flydubai to save on fuel costs by shortening flying hours and also reduce regional airspace congestion.
Emirates has ""resumed utilizing Iraqi airspace and a very small number of our flights overfly Iraqi airspace each day"", an airline spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. 
The spokeswoman said that Emirates reviews its flight operations regularly, in line with advice from regulators and authorities.
""Safety, security and operational efficiency will always be the top considerations when planning flight paths,"" the spokeswoman said.
Emirates did not say when it started flying over Iraq again or which routes were affected.
Airlines flying through the region have in the past used Iraqi airspace for flights to Europe and the United States. 
Flydubai started using eastern Iraqi airspace again on Nov. 28, mostly affecting flights to and from Eastern Europe and Turkey, a spokeswoman said in an email.
""All the necessary risk and security assessments were conducted prior to the start of overflying,"" the spokeswoman said.
Iraqi forces recaptured the last areas still under Islamic State control along the border with Syria on Saturday and secured the western desert, marking the end of the war against the militants three years after they had captured about a third of Iraq’s territory.
Emirates and flydubai have continued flying to and from Iraq since 2014 but with temporary suspensions on some flights from time to time.

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2017 09:21AM ET</span>",Venezuelan migrants pose humanitarian problem in Brazil,"By Anthony Boadle
BOA VISTA, Brazil (Reuters) - Last August, Victor Rivera, a 36-year-old unemployed baker, left his hometown in northern Venezuela and made the two-day journey by road to the remote Amazonian city of Boa Vista, Brazil.
Although work is scarce in the city of 300,000 people, slim prospects in Boa Vista appeal more to Rivera than life back home, where his six children often go hungry and the shelves of grocery stores and hospitals are increasingly bare.
""I see no future in Venezuela,"" said Rivera, who seeks odd jobs at traffic lights in the small state capital just over 200 km (124 miles) from Brazil's border with the Andean country.
Countries across Latin America and beyond have received a growing number of Venezuelans fleeing economic hardship, crime and what critics call an increasingly authoritarian government.
The once-prosperous country, home to the world's largest proven oil reserves, is struggling with a profound recession, widespread unemployment, chronic shortages and inflation that the opposition-led Congress said could soon top 2,000 percent.
At least 125 people died this year amid clashes among government opponents, supporters and police.
As conditions there worsen, nearby cities like Boa Vista are struggling with one of the biggest migrations in recent Latin American history. With limited infrastructure, social services and jobs to offer migrants, Brazilian authorities fear a full-fledged humanitarian crisis.
In Roraima, the rural state of which Boa Vista is the capital, the governor last week decreed a ""social emergency,"" putting local services on alert for mounting health and security demands.  
""Shelters are already crowded to their limit,"" said George Okoth-Obbo, operations chief for the United Nations High Commission on Refugees, after a visit there. ""It is a very tough situation."" 
He noted the crush of migrants also hitting Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean country to Venezuela's north, and Colombia, the Andean neighbor to the west, where hundreds of thousands have fled.
Not even Venezuela's government knows for certain how many of its 30 million people have fled in recent years. Some sociologists have estimated the number to be as high as 2 million, although President Nicolas Maduro's leftist government disputes that figure.
BRAZIL ""NOT READY""
Unlike earlier migration, when many Venezuelan professionals left for markets where their services found strong demand, many of those leaving now have few skills or resources. By migrating, then, they export some of the social ills that Venezuela has struggled to cope with. 
""They're leaving because of economic, health and public safety problems, but putting a lot of pressure on countries that have their own difficulties,"" said Mauricio Santoro, a political scientist at Rio de Janeiro State University.
International authorities are likening Venezuela's exodus to other mass departures in Latin America's past, like that of refugees who fled Haiti after a 2010 earthquake or, worse, the 1980 flight of 125,000 Cubans by boat for the United States.   
In Brazil, Okoth-Obbo said, as many as 40,000 Venezuelans have arrived. Just over half of them have applied for asylum, a bureaucratic process that can take two years. 
The request grants them the right to stay in Brazil while their application is reviewed. It also gives them access to health, education and other social services.
Some migrants in Boa Vista are finding ways to get by, finding cheap accommodation or lodging in the few shelters, like a local gym, that authorities have provided. Others wander homeless, some turning to crime, like prostitution, adding law enforcement woes to the social challenges.
""We have a very serious problem that will only get worse."" said Boa Vista Mayor Teresa Surita, adding that the city's once quiet streets are increasingly filled with poor Venezuelans. 
Most migrants in Boa Vista arrive by land, traveling the southward route that is the only road crossing along more than 2,100 kms of border with Brazil.
Arriving by public transport in the Venezuelan border town of Santa Elena, they enter Brazil on foot and then take buses or hitch rides further south to Boa Vista.
Staffed only during the day, the border post in essence is open, allowing as many as 400 migrants to enter daily, according to authorities. For a state with the lowest population and smallest economy of any in Brazil, that is no small influx. 
""Brazil's government is not ready for what is coming,"" said Jesús López de Bobadilla, a Catholic priest who runs a refugee center on the border. He serves breakfast of fruit, coffee and bread to hundreds of Venezuelans.
Despite a long history of immigration, Latin America's biggest country has struggled this decade to accommodate asylum seekers from countries including Haiti and Syria. Although Brazil has granted asylum for more than 2,700 Syrians, the refugees have received scant government support even in Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest state.
A senior official in Brazil's foreign ministry, who asked to remain anonymous, said the country will not close its borders. Okoth-Obbo said his U.N. agency and Brazil's government are discussing ways to move refugees to larger cities.
""NOW I CAN SLEEP"" 
Boa Vista schools have admitted about 1,000 Venezuelan children. The local hospital has no beds because of increased demand for care, including many Venezuelan pregnancies. 
In July, a 10-year-old Venezuelan boy died of diphtheria, a disease absent from Roraima for years. Giuliana Castro, the state secretary for public security, said treating ill migrants is difficult because they lack stability, like a fixed address.  
""There is a risk of humanitarian crisis here,"" she said. 
Most migrants in Boa Vista said they do not intend to return to Venezuela unless conditions there improve.
Carolina Coronada, who worked as an accountant in the northern Venezuelan city of Maracay, arrived in Brazil a year ago with her 7-year-old daughter. She has applied for residency and works at a fast-food restaurant.
While she earns less than before, and said she makes lower wages than Brazilians at the restaurant, she is happier.      
""There was no milk or vaccines,"" she said. ""Now I can sleep at night, not worried about getting mugged.""
Others are faring worse, struggling to find work as Brazil recovers from a two-year recession, its worst in over a century.
One recent evening, dozens of young Venezuelan women walked the streets of Caimbé, a neighborhood on Boa Vista's west side. 
Camila, a 23-year-old transsexual, left Venezuela nine months ago. She said she turns tricks for about $100 a night - enough to send food, medicine and even car parts to her family.
""Things are so bad in Venezuela I could barely feed myself,"" said Camila, who declined to give her last name. 
Rivera, the unemployed baker, one afternoon sheltered from the equatorial sun under a mango tree. He has applied for asylum and said he is willing to miss his family as long as he can wire his earnings from gardening, painting and bricklaying home. 

""It's not enough to live on, but the little money I can send home feeds my family,"" he said.

1647,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2017 09:00AM ET</span>","Emboldened by change, some Uzbek imams turn on loudspeakers for call to prayer","By Mukhammadsharif Mamatkulov
TASHKENT (Reuters) - Some mosques in Uzbekistan are starting to broadcast the Muslim call to prayer from loudspeakers for the first time in a decade as they take advantage of a more tolerant official attitude toward Islam since President Islam Karimov died last year.
The imams are amplifying the Adhan call to prayer without asking for government permission. Under Karimov, an imam who took such a liberty would have faced losing his job or possible imprisonment.
The new boldness is a response to decisions by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to liberalize the ex-Soviet nation of 32 million people whose main religion is Islam.
Mirziyoyev has overseen the release of several prominent political prisoners, relaxed some security measures and this week he pardoned 2,700 convicts, saying that in the past many sentences had been unjust.
Western countries and human rights groups accused the government of repression under Karimov who ruled the Central Asian nation from 1989 until his death in September 2016.
The leader cracked down on public displays of Islamic practice including hijabs and beards because he feared the country was vulnerable to Islamist militancy.
His government blamed militants for bombings in the capital in 1999 and unrest in the city of Andijan in 2005. Around 200 people died in all, according to official figures, and the incidents were the bloodiest since Uzbekistan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
After government troops clashed with armed protesters in Andijan, Uzbek mosques stopped using loudspeakers for the call to prayer though the practice was never formally banned.
TAKING THE INITIATIVE
Over the last few months, however, some imams have begun to broadcast the Adhan from mosques again. A Reuters reporter heard it at three mosques in Tashkent, though it was only audible to people near the buildings.
The call is part of the soundscape in many Muslim cities, blasting from speakers on minarets five times each day and extra loud on Friday, which is the day of prayer. Worshippers in Tashkent welcomed the change.
""People should hear that it's prayer time. That's what Muslim life is about,"" said a young man outside one of the mosques. He declined to give his identity.
A cleric at one of Tashkent's main mosques said the matter was being discussed within the Muslim Board of Uzbekistan, which is close to the government. No ruling has been made. 
""Some imams took the initiative"" and turned on their loudspeakers at their own risk once the talks with the Board had started, said the cleric who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to comment publicly.
Another source close to the clergy said some imams had argued that without a formal ban there was no need for formal permission to restart. There have been no reports of clerics being prosecuted for breaking the informal ban.
The government declined to comment on the matter.
RETURN FROM EXILE
Nurulloh Muhammad Raufkhon, an Uzbek writer who recently returned to Tashkent after living in exile for more than a year, said he saw the cautious return of Adhan as a sign of a broader change in the state's attitude to religion under Mirziyoyev.
""(Mirziyoyev's) decree on developing and introducing Halal standards was another important step,"" he said.
Mirziyoyev ordered the government last month to develop standards for food products that adhere to Islamic dietary laws, which prohibit the consumption of pork and alcohol among other things.
The move could boost Uzbek sales of halal food both domestically and overseas.
""Previously, we were banned from using the word 'halal'. I know because I used to work at ... a religious magazine .... Halal restaurants were closed down. The word 'halal' was removed from product labels,' he said.
In another break with Karimov-era policy, Mirziyoyev said in September Uzbekistan had removed about 16,000 people from a 17,000-strong security blacklist of potential Muslim religious extremists and dissidents.
He said he wanted ""to bring them (back) into our society and educate them.""
The issue of Islamist militancy in Uzbekistan has spread beyond the country's borders. This year, at least 60 people have died in attacks abroad carried out by Uzbek nationals or ethnic Uzbeks. The most deadly was a shooting in an Istanbul nightclub in which 39 people died.
In the late 1990s, the government fought the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a militant group that sought to make Uzbekistan an Islamic state. It later moved to Afghanistan to join forces with the Taliban.
Hundreds of Uzbeks have also joined Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Authorities fear radicalized youths may return home.
""Nowadays they are talking about driving the terrorists out of Syria,"" Mirziyoyev said in a public speech this month. ""But the question is, where will they go now? We should think about it.""
At the same time, he said many of Uzbekistan's convicted prisoners had been sentenced unjustly and he vowed to crack down on abuses such as torture and fabricated evidence.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2017 08:40AM ET</span>","Iran foreign minister defends missile program, asks European support","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran's foreign minister on Monday defended its ballistic missile program and urged European countries not to be influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's confrontational policy towards Tehran.
In an op-ed article in the New York Times, Zarif also urged European powers to help preserve the landmark 2015 deal under which Iran curbed its disputed nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of a number of international sanctions. 
In October Trump struck a blow against the deal, approved by his predecessor Barack Obama, by refusing to certify that Iran is complying with the terms of the deal despite findings to the contrary by U.N. nuclear inspectors. Trump has also called Iran an ""economically depleted rogue state"" that exports violence.
“Europe should not pander to Washington’s determination to shift focus to yet another unnecessary crisis - whether it be Iran’s defensive missile program or our influence in the Middle East,” Zarif wrote. 
His remarks seemed to be at least partly aimed at France which has been critical of the Islamic Republic's missile tests and regional policy, including involvement in Syria's war, in recent weeks. 
Last month French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “very concerned” by the missile program and called for talks about it, an appeal rejected by Iranian officials. 
Iran’s missiles are for defensive purposes only, Zarif wrote in the op-ed.
“We have honed missiles as an effective means of deterrence. And our conscious decision to focus on precision rather than range has afforded us the capability to strike back with pinpoint accuracy,” he wrote. “Nuclear weapons do not need to be precise. Conventional warheads, however, do.”
While criticizing the missile program, European powers that were party to the nuclear deal - France, Britain and Germany - have reaffirmed their commitment to the nuclear deal and voiced concern at Trump calling it into question.
Zarif also criticized rival Saudi Arabia’s regional policy and military campaign in Yemen but also called for dialogue.
“As Iran and its partners our to put out fires, the arsonists in our region grow more unhinged. They’re oblivious to the necessity of inclusive engagement,” Zarif wrote.

A monastery in neighboring Aragon region says over 44 of its artefacts were sold illegally to Catalonia in the 1980s and the issue has become a symbol of broader disagreement between opponents and supporters of Catalan independence.
Culture Minister Inigo Mendez de Vigo angered Catalan nationalists in November by using special temporary powers to accept a petition by a judge from Aragon calling for the artefacts to be returned to their previous home, the Monastery of Sijena.
The previous month, Madrid took control of Catalonia to quell the crisis over secession and called a snap regional election.
Hundreds of demonstrators on Monday massed at the museum of Lleida in western Catalonia where the artefacts were kept and pro-independence groups called supporters to stop the police from removing them.
There were minor scuffles, though no injuries were reported and the artefacts were eventually taken away at around noon.
Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, currently in self-imposed exile in Brussels, criticised the move on Twitter and blamed the three principal unionist parties running in upcoming elections, the ruling People's party (PP), the socialist party and Ciudadanos.
""Carried out at night and using a militarised police force, as always, and taking advantage of a coup d'etat to plunder Catalonia with complete impunity: This is the model that Ciudadanos, PSC and PP defend,"" Puigdemont said.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said his government could not oppose court rulings because it would mean stepping outside the rule of law.

1652,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2017 07:30AM ET</span>",What's behind Vietnam's corruption crackdown?,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's crackdown on high level corruption has led to the arrest of dozens of officials from state oil firm PetroVietnam and the banking sector.
As well as shedding light on graft, mismanagement and nepotism within state firms at a time privatization is accelerating, the arrests show the ascendancy of a more conservative faction within the ruling Communist Party.
How many people are involved?
At least 51 have been arrested across PetroVietnam and the banking sector. Some have been tried and sentenced already. The most senior figure arrested is former PetroVietnam Chairman Dinh La Thang. He is the first former politburo member to face prosecution in decades. Neither he nor his lawyer was available for comment. Germany has accused Vietnam of kidnapping one PetroVietnam suspect, Trinh Xuan Thanh. More than 100 other officials are also under threat of prosecution or have been demoted or fired.
What is PetroVietnam?
PetroVietnam is a tangled enterprise of 15 direct units, 18 subsidiaries and 46 affiliates in which it owns smaller stakes. Hundreds of millions of dollars in losses have been racked up at units ranging from banks to construction firms and power plants to textile mills.
The scandals at PetroVietnam are connected to the banking sector through a deal in which the oil firm lost $35 million in an investment in Ocean Bank. The lender's former chief executive - a previous PetroVietnam chairman - was sentenced to death.
What does the crackdown mean politically?
It shows a concerted effort to rein in large-scale corruption through which some officials had secured massive personal wealth and tarnished the ruling party's image.
But it has also allowed the current Communist Party leadership to strengthen its hand under General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong after winning out in a power struggle with former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung last year.
Whether or not the arrests go even higher, Trong's supremacy is assured through a term that lasts until 2021 and the faction is better placed to maintain its dominance even beyond.
What divides the different groups in the ruling party?
Although the party presents a public image of unity, there are diverse views on everything from the pace and openness of reforms to Vietnam's delicate diplomatic balancing between China, the United States and other powers.
What best characterizes the current leadership is conservatism in preserving the party's absolute authority in close alignment with the security establishment.
It marks a change of style from the leadership under Dung and his allies, some of whom emerged as personalities in their own right and showed signs of readiness for greater political openness.
Alongside the corruption arrests, Vietnam has also arrested more bloggers, activists and other critics this year than in any other since a 2011 crackdown on youth activists.
How popular is the corruption crackdown?
Few tears are shed in Vietnam over the arrests of former officials, but there is also scepticism over the real motives. The day-to-day corruption of low-level officials and police is still a factor of Vietnamese life.
What impact has this had on PetroVietnam?
PetroVietnam's net profit margin in 2016 was its lowest in at least seven years at just over 7 percent from over 15 percent in 2009. The company told Reuters the oil price was the biggest factor, but it has also said failed projects, wrongdoing by officials and the investigations themselves had an impact. 
PetroVietnam's shares are not listed on a stock exchange, but some of its units have underperformed its Thai peer PTT since 2009.
What does this mean for reform and privatization?
Although the crackdown points to the political strengthening of the party, the leadership has shown less sign of delaying economic reform than the previous administration.
Facing pressure because of its budget deficit, the government has accelerated plans to sell major stakes in the most attractive assets - brewery Sabeco and Vinamilk.
It is also selling stakes in three units of PetroVietnam.
Some economic and business analysts believe the fear among officials of being branded corrupt could further hold up bureaucratic decision making in state-run firms and ministries.

Concealing spending by holding lavish dinners in private homes, passing off pampering at a spa as ""recuperation"" from work and going sightseeing while on business trips are all in the sights of the graft busters.
President Xi Jinping has waged a five-year war on graft at all levels of the ruling Communist Party, from high-level ""tigers"" to lowly ""flies"" and has pledged to keep up the fight until officials dare not, cannot and do not want to be corrupt.
A crackdown on hedonism and extravagance in a drive to improve professionalism is to go on in Xi's second term, an unidentified official from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection told the official Xinhua news agency.
""Efforts to address such misconduct should not be stopped and the work to improve the party's conduct and work styles should never end,"" Xinhua cited Xi as saying in a personal stamp of approval.
Petty corruption such as trying to hide extravagance in ""concealed locations"" will be targeted, as will the use of public funds to organize holidays in the name of recuperation, the official said.
Officials have been trying to get big spending through by organizing things such as weddings and funerals ""bit by bit"", staggering gift giving and accepting electronic gift cards or ""red packets"" of money via online payment platforms, the official said.
Although the anti-graft drive had improved the atmosphere in society, there could be ""no intermission and no rests"", the official said.
The CCDI official also warned that officials still suffer from excess ""formalism"" and ""bureaucratism"", Communist Party terms for failing to carry out central party orders.
When hosting visiting officials, some local-level cadres just take them on the same tourist trail where they speak to the same people as if watching a ""fashion show"", said the official.
Some attempt to cook the books, or ""beautify"" their data, to claim success and secure a quick promotion without actually getting the job done, while others simply take a laissez-faire attitude to improving work style.
""Cadres fond of formalism and bureaucratism who create a negative influence or grave results will be strictly punished, without tolerance,"" the official said.

Gruevski, 47, led the ex-Yugoslav republic for almost a decade, and his party bloc since 2003, until January 2016 when a wiretapping scandal brought down the ruling VMRO-DPMNE bloc.
A snap election in December 2016 ended inconclusively and a long parliamentary stalemate ensued, ending in May when Social Democrat Zoran Zaev formed a coalition with ethnic Albanian parties that represent a third of the 2 million population.
VMRO-DPMNE said its Central Committee had scheduled a leadership congress for Dec. 22-23 after Gruevski's ""irrevocable resignation.
""Gruevski said that ... his resignation was a moral act, as it is natural that the person in whom everyone had confidence should take the responsibility for the (electoral) defeat,"" a party statement said.
In April, protesters including VMRO-DPMNE supporters stormed parliament and assaulted Zaev as Social Democrats and its ethnic Albanian allies elected an ethnic Albanian as parliament speaker. Dozens were injured in riots.
The VMRO-DPMNE suffered a further setback last month when police arrested Mitko Cavkov, a former interior minister, and a number of its lawmakers and activists on charges related to the disturbances in April.
The April unrest marked the worst crisis in Macedonia since 2001 when Western diplomats narrowly averted a full-scale civil war arising from an ethnic Albanian insurgency, promising Skopje a pathway to membership of the European Union and NATO.

Macedonia, which won independence in 1991 from then-federal Yugoslavia in 1991, has made little progress towards EU and NATO membership due to a name dispute with Greece.

Niger has agreed to temporarily host the most vulnerable being evacuated, including unaccompanied children and single mothers, pending their processing and departure for resettlement, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement.
""In order to address the immediate protection needs and extreme vulnerabilities of the persons of concern who will be evacuated to Niger, UNHCR urgently requests 1,300 places for resettlement for this situation,"" the agency said.
The UNHCR intends to evacuate between 700 and 1,300 people from Libya to Niger by the end of January 2018, it said, calling for the resettlement places to be made available by the end of March.
A first group of 25 refugees from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan were evacuated from Libya to Niger last month, it added.
""This is a desperate call for solidarity and humanity. We need to get extremely vulnerable refugees out of Libya as soon as possible,” said Volker Turk, UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner for Protection.

Numbers of detainees swelled after boat departures for Italy from the smuggling hub of Sabratha were largely blocked this year.
On Friday, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), called on social media giants to make it harder for people smugglers to use their platforms to lure West African migrants to Libya where they can face detention, torture, slavery or death.

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (Reuters) - Crews battling a massive wind-driven California wildfire that has torched nearly 800 buildings and charred 230,000 acres are bracing on Monday to protect communities menaced by flames along the state's scenic coastline.
The Thomas Fire ignited last week and is burning in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, about 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
""Fire will continue to threaten the communities of Carpenteria, Summerland, Montecito and surrounding areas,"" the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire)said in a Sunday night update.
Santa Ana winds and the rugged mountainous terrain have hindered firefighters as they battle the blaze, which has destroyed 790 houses, outbuildings and other structures and left 90,000 homes and businesses without power.
""A lot of these guys (firefighters) have fought a lot of fires in the past few months and are fatigued,"" said Fire Captain Steve Concialdi, spokesman for the Thomas Fire.
Concialdi said firefighters from 11 Western states are aiding firefighting efforts.
The fire is 10 percent contained, down from 15 percent on Saturday after it blew up on Sunday, growing by 56,000 acres in one day and making a run of 7 miles, Concialdi said.
Nearly 5,800 firefighting personnel are working on the blaze, Cal Fire said. The cost of fighting as of Sunday was nearly $34 million, the agency added. It is already the fifth-largest wildfire on record in California.
At the University of California, Santa Barbara, final exams set for this week have been postponed, Chancellor Henry Yang said in a letter to the campus community. Air quality and transportation issues, along with power outages that have affected the school's information technology department, forced the delay of exams until January.
Some of the other fires burning over the past week in San Diego and Los Angeles counties have been largely controlled by the thousands of firefighters on the ground this week. 
Both the Creek and Rye fires in Los Angeles County were 90 percent contained by Sunday morning, officials said, while the Skirball Fire in the posh Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles was 75 percent contained.

North of San Diego, the 4,100-acre (1,660 hectare) Lilac Fire was 75 percent contained by Sunday and most evacuation orders had been lifted.

In a long-awaited move, Gandhi, the great-grandson of India's founding prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, was elected unopposed to head the party. He will take the reins from his mother Sonia, the party's longest-serving president, since 1998.
""The entire Indian National Congress family would like to convey our best wishes to incoming President Rahul Gandhi, and wish him a successful tenure as he continues to lead from the front,"" the party said on its official Twitter handle.
Television broadcast images of party supporters celebrating the news outside Congress offices in the capital, New Delhi, and the financial hub of Mumbai.
Ever since Congress was defeated heavily in the 2014 national election by Modi's party, Gandhi has struggled to convince voters, as well as many within his party, of his leadership skills.
But Gandhi was now geared up for the next challenge, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said on Monday.
""The entire country has lots of expectations from Rahul Gandhi,"" Azad told reporters. ""Much before he was elected he has shown his mettle. He knows his responsibility.""
Modi's depiction of the 47-year-old as an undeserving ""prince"" has helped sideline Gandhi since the last national election, during which time Congress has suffered some of its worst results in local elections.
The news coincides with state polls in Modi's western home state of Gujarat that are shaping as a test for the prime minister, who has been facing criticism for slowing economic growth and poor implementation of a nationwide sales tax.
The Congress hopes a round of state elections offers the party, and Gandhi, a shot at revival ahead of the next national elections, due in 2019.
Still, Modi remains immensely popular.
Nearly nine of 10 Indians have a favourable opinion of him and more than two-thirds are satisfied with the direction in which he is taking the country, a Pew survey found in November. 

Modi's favourable rating was 30 points more than Gandhi's, the poll showed.

Its call seeks to defuse support for the ""No Billag"" initiative that comes to a binding vote on March 4 and which opinion polls show has around 57 percent support.
Proponents want to scrap the ""Billag"" fee that last year raised 1.37 billion Swiss francs ($1.38 billion) as the financial lifeblood for public broadcasters at the federal, regional and local levels.
National broadcaster SRG, which operates in the four national languages, gets 75 percent of its budget from the fee.
""A varied media offering is important for a small, polyglot country like Switzerland with its direct democracy,"" President Doris Leuthard said in a statement.
Switzerland says it would be the first country in Europe to abolish fees for public broadcasting should the measure be adopted. This would push advertising revenue to mostly foreign-controlled commercial media.
The government is cutting the fee -- levied on homes with a radio or TV set -- to 365 francs per private household from 2019 from around 450 now. Businesses will pay up to 35,590 francs a year based on a sliding scale of annual sales.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast will pay thousands of soldiers 15 million CFA francs ($25,782) each as part of buy-outs aimed at reducing the size of its unruly and mutiny-prone military, documents showed on Monday.
Africa's fastest growing economy in 2016, Ivory Coast was hit earlier this year by successive uprisings by low-ranking troops. The costly bonuses paid to end the unrest helped balloon the budget deficit this year, and the episode tarnished its image as one of the continent's rising economic stars.
The government said last week that it would retire around 1,000 soldiers by the end of the year as part of efforts to bring the force - estimated at about 25,000 troops - in line with ""accepted standards"".
A spokesman did not say last week how much the soldiers would receive under the voluntary scheme. However, a document obtained by Reuters outlining the plan stated that each retired soldier would receive a payment of 15 million CFA francs.
Neither the spokesman nor Ivory Coast's defense minister were available to comment on Monday.
Diplomats said the move signaled that the government was beginning to implement a military reform law. According to a copy of the law seen by Reuters, 4,400 troops are to leave the army over four years. 
It was not immediately clear if that figure includes soldiers already scheduled to retire during the period.
Ivory Coast's army was thrown together from rival loyalist and rebel factions at the end of a 2011 civil war that brought President Alassane Ouattara to power after his predecessor Laurent Gbagbo rejected his defeat in a 2010 run-off election.
It remains plagued by internal divisions. Diplomats and analysts say the force is bloated with unqualified personnel and vulnerable to political manipulation.
An adviser to Parliament Speaker Guillaume Soro, considered a leading candidate to replace term-limited President Ouattara in 2020, was arrested in October after a secret arms cache at his home helped mutinying soldiers halt a loyalist advance.
Soro and his supporters say the charges were politically motivated.

The Lista Marjana Sarca (LMS) under Marjan Sarec, mayor of the city of Kamnik, drew the support of 15.7 percent with a junior governing coalition party, the Social Democrats, in second place with 12.6 percent and the leading opposition party, the centre-left Slovenian Democratic Party, with 12.2 percent.
The Party of Modern Centre led by Prime Minister Miro Cerar came in sixth with 5.5 percent. Last month, the Social Democrats led the same poll with 19.8 percent while the LMS was not yet included in the survey.
Sarec surprised many last month when he was narrowly beaten in a presidential run-off election, gathering about 47 percent to incumbent Borut Pahor's 53 percent.
Analysts said Sarec's party, which has so far been active only at local level, could win a parliamentary vote amid general dissatisfaction with the centre-left government, above all its inability to improve the inefficient national health system.
The government of the southeast European country is also under heavy pressure from various public sector unions demanding wage hikes at a time of strong economic growth, expected to be 4.4 percent this year, up from 3.1 percent in 2016.
Pahor will call a general election in the coming months and it is expected to be held in the first half of June.

Russian Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces General Valery Gerasimov, issued his warning in Tokyo as the United States, Japan and South Korea began a two-day exercise to practice tracking missiles amid rising tension over North Korea's weapons programs.
""Carrying out military training in regions surrounding North Korea will only heighten hysteria and make the situation unstable,"" Gerasimov said at the beginning of a meeting with Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera.
This week's exercise by the United States and its two Asian allies, in which they will share information on tracking ballistic missiles, comes just days after large-scale drills by U.S. and South Korean forces that North Korea said made the outbreak of war ""an established fact"".
North Korea says its weapons programs are necessary to counter U.S. aggression.
On Nov. 29, North Korea test-fired its latest ballistic missile, which it said was its most advanced yet, capable of reaching the mainland United States.
China has also repeatedly called for the United States and South Korea to stop their exercises, which North Korea sees as preparation for an invasion. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked in Beijing about the latest U.S., South Korean and Japanese drills, said the situation was in a vicious cycle that if followed to a conclusion would not be in anyone's interests. 
""All relevant parties should do is still to completely, precisely and fully implement the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions toward North Korea, and do more for regional peace and stability and to get all parties back to the negotiating table. Not the opposite, mutual provocation,"" Lu said.
'IMPORTANT MEANING'
Gerasimov's visit to Japan is the first by a senior Russian military official in seven years and follows the resumption of ""two-plus-two"" defense and foreign minister talks in March after Russia annexed Crimea.
Relations between Russia and Japan have been hampered for decades over the ownership of four islands north of Japan's Hokkaido, captured by Soviet forces at the end of World War Two. Japan has declined to sign a formal peace treaty with Russia until the dispute is resolved.
Gerasimov also met Katsutoshi Kawano, the chief of staff of Japan's Self Defence Forces.
China's Defence Ministry said on Monday it had begun a planned joint simulated anti-missile drill with Russia in Beijing, which had ""important meaning"" for both countries in facing the threat from missiles. It said the exercise was not aimed at any third party.
China and Russia both oppose the development of global anti-missile systems, the ministry added in a statement.
China and Russia both oppose the deployment in South Korea of the advanced U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system.
China in particular fears the system's powerful radar could look deep into its territory, threatening its security. 
The United States and South Korea say the system is needed to defend against the threat of North Korean missiles.

It is not clear if this week's exercise by U.S., South Korean and Japanese forces will involve the THAAD system.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday asked Congress to extend martial law on the southern island of Mindanao for a year, arguing that Islamist militants have been regrouping since a five-month urban conflict ended there in October.
He said fighters who survived the battle for Marawi City were determined to establish a Southeast Asian 'wilayat' – or governorate - for Islamic State and named militant Abu Turaifie as potentially the radical group's next regional ""emir"".
The previous ""emir"", Isnilon Hapilon, and another rebel commander loyal to Islamic State were killed in October as the military closed in on fighters who had occupied the heart of Marawi since May 23.
More than 1,100 people - mostly militants - were killed and 350,000 displaced by the Marawi unrest.
In his letter to the Senate and House of Representatives, Duterte said militants were radicalizing and recruiting local people, reorganizing themselves and building their finances.
""These activities are geared towards the conduct of intensified atrocities and armed public uprisings,"" he said, adding that they were aimed at establishing a global Islamic caliphate and a 'wilayat', not only in the Philippines but the whole of Southeast Asia. 
A group led by Turaifie - who heads a splinter group of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters and, according to Duterte, is ""said to be Hapilon's potential successor"" - was planning bombings in the Cotabato province south of Marawi.
Intelligence reports indicate that militants are plotting to attack another city, Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said on Monday.
Duterte placed restive Mindanao, which has a population of 22 million, under military rule after the attack on Marawi, and martial law was due to be lifted there on Dec. 31. 
Lawmakers will vote on his request for a one-year extension at a joint session on Wednesday, Congress majority leader Rodolfo Farinas told reporters.
Continuing martial law beyond the initial 60-day limit requires lawmakers' approval, but the constitution does not limit any extensions.
Martial law allows for tougher surveillance and arrests without warrant, giving security forces greater rein to go after suspected extremist financiers and facilitators.
Duterte has long warned that Mindanao faced contamination by Islamic State, and experts say Muslim parts of the predominantly Catholic southern Philippines are fertile ground for expansion, due to their history of marginalization and neglect.
Critics of Duterte, who has held open the possibility of extending military rule to the whole country, have slammed the imposition of martial law in Mindanao as a misuse of power and evidence of the president's authoritarian tendencies.
Martial law is a sensitive issue in the Philippines, bringing back memories of the 1970s rule of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who was accused of exaggerating security threats to justify harsh measures to suppress dissent.
Human rights group Karapatan questioned why martial law should be extended in Mindanao nearly two months after the military's victory in Marawi City.

""This is a dangerous precedent that inches the entire country closer to a nationwide declaration of martial rule,"" it said in a statement.

The conservatives, meeting on Monday to map out their negotiating positions, believe compromises can be reached to renew the ""grand coalition"" that governed for the past four years.
The two blocs must overcome differences over the future of Europe, pensions, health care and education.
Merkel, whose CDU/CSU alliance last month failed to cut a coalition deal with two smaller parties after an inconclusive national election in September, is due to brief the media at 1 pm (1200 GMT).
Senior conservatives on Saturday rejected the vision for a ""United States of Europe"" put forward by SPD leader Martin Schulz, weakened after his party posted its worst post-war election result in September.
But Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the conservative premier of the Saarland region, told broadcaster ARD that she hoped some progress could emerge from this week's talks with the SPD. ""Maybe we can take a first big step in this direction this week,"" she said.
SPD Secretary General Lars Klingbeil told ARD his party was open to all possibilities, including a renewed coalition with conservatives or a minority government.
""The ball is now in Mrs. Merkel's court,"" Klingbeil said, adding that the pace of negotiations depended to a large extent on the core demands of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).
""The SPD made its positions clear at its party conference. Now we'll listen to what the CDU leader wants, what the CSU wants, and it will be clear very quickly if further discussions are worth it,"" he said.
A poll published on Monday by broadcaster RTL and n-tv showed 71 percent of SPD members welcomed the party's decision to talk with conservatives about forming a new ruling coalition, while 81 percent wanted the party to conduct tough negotiations.
Klingbeil said his party would seek clear commitments from the CDU to spend more on education and combat childhood poverty before entering coalition talks.
Julia Kloeckner, deputy leader of the CDU, warned the SPD against making exaggerated demands and criticised comments Klingbeil made over the weekend suggesting that talks could stretch as long as May.
""If the SPD thinks we have time forever, that is not our view,"" she said.
Monday's poll showed that 71 percent of German voters favored rapid negotiations on forming a new government.
Kloeckner said it was clear that the two political blocs would have to revisit issues such as integration, digitalization and development of rural areas before agreeing to a new coalition.

""A continuation of the previous grand coalition cannot happen,"" she said.

Cinemas were banned in the early 1980s under pressure from Islamists as Saudi society turned towards a restrictive form of the religion that discouraged public entertainment and many forms of mixing between men and women.
Under reforms led by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the government is easing many of those restrictions, and also plans to lift a ban on women driving next year. It says the economy, hit hard by low oil prices, will benefit from the growth of an entertainment industry.
""Opening cinemas will act as a catalyst for economic growth and diversification,"" said Minister of Culture and Information Awwad bin Saleh Alawwad. ""By developing the broader cultural sector we will create new employment and training opportunities, as well as enriching the Kingdom’s entertainment options.""
By 2030, Saudi Arabia is expected to open over 300 cinemas with more than 2,000 screens, a government statement said, predicting the cinema industry would contribute over 90 billion riyals ($24 billion) to the economy and create 30,000 permanent jobs by 2030.
Regional cinema chain operators are already believed to be studying entry into Saudi Arabia, industry sources said.

A commission chaired by Alawwad will announce details of licensing and regulations over the next few weeks, the government said.

They ""discussed protecting the Syrian-Iraqi border in the region adjacent to Deir al-Zor province, and how to finally eradicate Daesh mercenaries there,"" the SDF said in a statement.
""The two sides decided to form a joint coordination center to guarantee the security of the border,"" it said.
Last week, the SDF declared victory in its assault against Islamic State militants in Syria's Deir al-Zor, which borders Iraq. The offensive focused on seizing territory east of the Euphrates river that bisects the oil-rich province.
The Kurdish-led SDF has been battling for months with the help of jets and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition.
On the other side, Iraqi forces recaptured the last swathes of territory still under Islamic State control along the border with Syria on Saturday and secured the western desert. It marked the end of the war against the militants, three years after they had captured about a third of Iraq's territory.
Those who fought Islamic State came from the army, air force, federal and local police, elite counter-terrorism forces, as well as Shi'ite and Sunni paramilitaries and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. They received key air support from the U.S.-led global coalition.
Forces battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria expect a new phase of guerrilla warfare.

The Kerobokan prison, about 10 km (six miles) from the main tourist beaches in the Kuta area, often holds foreigners facing drug-related charges.
Cristian Beasley, who was a suspect in crimes related to narcotics but had not been sentenced, escaped at 4.10 a.m. (2010 GMT Sunday), said Badung Police chief Yudith Satria Hananta.
""It is thought that the prisoner escaped ... by cutting through the steel bars above the ceiling,"" he said in a statement, without giving details of how Beasley escaped without being detected.
Beasley, 32, from California, is believed to have then used a rope to climb down a wall before getting over a perimeter wall in an area being refurbished.
Police had questioned witnesses and guards and were hunting for Beasley, Hananta said.
Another American, Paul Anthony Hoffman, 57, was captured while also trying to escape, Hananta said.
Representatives of Beasley and Hoffman could not immediately be reached for comment.
In June, an Australian, a Bulgarian, an Indian and a Malaysian tunneled to freedom about 12 meters (13 yards) under the prison's walls.
The Indian and the Bulgarian were caught soon after in neighboring East Timor, but Australian Shaun Edward Davidson and Malaysian Tee Kok King remain at large.
Davidson has taunted authorities by saying he was enjoying life in various parts of the world, in purported posts on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Kerobokan has housed a number of well-known foreign drug convicts, including Australian Schappelle Corby, whose 12-1/2-year sentence for marijuana smuggling got huge media attention.
Indonesia has executed several foreign drug convicts in recent years.
Indonesian prisons are often overcrowded, partly because a war on drugs led by the government of President Joko Widodo has led to a surge in the number of people locked up.
As of June, Kerobokan housed 1,378 inmates, more than four times its planned capacity of 323, government data show.

Prison escapes are fairly common in Indonesia, which launched an investigation this year after about 350 inmates broke out of a prison on the island of Sumatra.

Near-simultaneous attacks on churches in the capital, Jakarta, and elsewhere on Christmas Eve in 2000, killed nearly 20 people. Ever since, authorities have stepped up security at churches and tourist spots for the holiday.
Police Chief Tito Karnavian said while there was no evidence of a specific plot, the detentions were made in a bid to head off trouble.
""We're doing a pre-emptive strike,"" Karnavian told reporters.  
""The majority of them have links to previous incidents (and people) who we had arrested earlier,"" he said.
Police said that 12 people had been detained in South Sumatra, four in West Kalimantan, one in Malang in East Java and one in Surabaya in the same province.
Under Indonesia's anti-terrorism laws, investigators can hold people for seven days before determining whether they will be designated suspects or released, said police spokesman Setyo Wasisto.
Indonesia has seen its share of militant attacks over the years aimed at foreign, Christian and government targets including blasts on the tourist island of Bali in 2002 that killed 202 people.
Since then, police have managed to stamp out or weaken many militant networks although there has been a resurgence in radicalism in recent years, inspired largely by Islamic State.
A series of small-scale attacks since early 2016 has been linked to Islamic State, which is believed to have thousands of sympathizers in Indonesia.

Edward holds an Indian business visa valid until next December, but the visa does not permit him to make a documentary on political or security related issues, the officer said.
A case has been registered under the Passport Act and the French embassy has been informed about the arrest, Parray said.
Edward was shooting a documentary on Kashmir and had met separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, pellet gun victims and captured stone pelting incidents in Srinagar, said a senior police official, who did not wish to be named.
More than 3,800 people have been wounded and one killed by shotgun pellets since protests against Indian rule erupted in the disputed territory last year, with more than 100 left partially or fully blinded, official figures show.
""We called him to ask him about his activities, but he refused to present himself before the police. He was not authorized to film here because he was on a business visa. He was finally arrested,"" the senior official said.

Police have registered a case against a man identified as Vikas Sachdeva, under Section 354 -- for assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty -- and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, a Mumbai police control room official said. 
“We are investigating fully and will support Zaira in every way required,” said Vistara chief strategy and commercial officer Sanjiv Kapoor.
“We have zero tolerance for this kind of thing.”
Neither Sachdeva or his lawyers could be reached for comment. 
Local media reported his wife, Divya Sachdeva, saying her husband was innocent and that ahe was returning from a funeral and had been asleep on the flight. She accused Wasim of having made the allegations for publicity.
A spokeswoman for the airline said it had provided details to the police and aviation authorities and its senior management had flown to Mumbai to assist Wasim in the investigation. “We are deeply concerned and regret the unfortunate experience Ms. Zaira Wasim had onboard our flight last night.”
India’s National Commission for Women, a government-appointed body fighting for women's rights, has asked the airline to explain why the crew did not step in to help the actress, according to local media reports.
“This is not done at all,” Wasim, who hails from the northern Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir, was seen saying in the video while wiping off tears. “This is not…this is not how people should be made to feel.”
Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti tweeted she was “appalled” by the incident and hoped authorities would take swift action.

The visit came amid high emotions in the Arab world over U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv, a move that was widely condemned across the Arab world.
The visit by 24 delegates from the group called 'This is Bahrain' has prompted a hashtag #Bahrain_resists_normalisation, in which twitter users declaring their opposition to what some called an ""act of treason"" against Palestinians and Bahrainis.
In a statement carried by state news agency BNA late on Sunday, the group said the visit was a private initiative to ""Israel and occupied Jerusalem"" comprising Bahrainis and expatriates of various faiths.
""The initiative by 'This is Bahrain' is based on the principle of tolerance and coexistence, an approach embraced by the Kingdom of Bahrain and a feature of its society, and aims to visit Islamic, Christian, Jewish and other holy sites across the world,"" the group said.
Most Arab countries see Israel as an occupier of Arab lands, and say any normalization of ties with the Jewish state must be in line with an Arab peace plan that calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.

CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro set his sights on Venezuela's 2018 presidential election after the ruling Socialist Party predictably dominated mayoral polls with the help of a partial boycott by a demoralized opposition.
The 55-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez, enjoying a political breather after a year of ferocious domestic protests and damaging foreign sanctions, said the government had won at least 90 percent of the 335 mayorships in Sunday's election.
Latest official results gave him 41 of 42 mayorships counted. No one doubted the socialists' big win given three of the biggest opposition parties were abstaining.
The elections left Maduro favorite to be the socialists' candidate in next year's presidential race, despite the ambitions of rivals within government and an economic crisis that has pummeled the OPEC nation since his 2013 election.
""We're ready to compete!"" he told cheering supporters in a Caracas square shortly before midnight on Sunday, next to a statue of Venezuela's independence hero Simon Bolivar. 
""2018 belongs to the 'Chavistas',"" Maduro said, using the ruling movement's name after his popular mentor and predecessor.
He also declared fixing Venezuela's broken economy a priority. But opponents and even some government dissenters say it is his stubborn adherence to Chavez-era economic policies - such as currency controls - that is to blame for the mess.
Venezuela's 30 million people are enduring one of the worst economic meltdowns in Latin American history. Millions are skipping meals, missing medicines, and lining up for hours at shops during acute shortages and crippling inflation.
Venezuela's opposition coalition scoffed at Sunday's vote as a Pyrrhic victory for Maduro. ""Irregularities and low turnout characterized the vote,"" said the coalition, which is demanding reforms to the electoral system for the 2018 vote. 
Participation was 47 percent, the election board said.
""I HOPE FOR BETTER""
Three of the coalition's main parties - Popular Will, Justice First and Democratic Action - boycotted Sunday's polls, saying the election board was at the service of Maduro's ""dictatorship"" and turning a blind eye to abuses by the state. 
But other opposition parties did put up candidates, adding to confusion and acrimony within opposition ranks. 
Maduro said the three abstaining parties should be banned from participating in future elections. 
The presidential election has traditionally been held in December, but there is speculation it will be brought forward to the first half of 2018 so the socialists can take advantage of the opposition's disarray.
With its most popular leaders barred - Leopoldo Lopez is under arrest and Henrique Capriles is prohibited from office - the opposition may struggle to find a popular flagbearer. Uniting the coalition's disparate parties and re-enthusing despondent grassroots supporters will also be huge challenges.
Street protests earlier in 2017 put enormous pressure on Maduro and left 125 people dead. Foreign pressure hardened too, with U.S. President Donald Trump imposing sanctions on Venezuela for alleged government rights abuses and corruption.
Yet having faced down demonstrators, pushed through a controversial legislative superbody in a July vote also boycotted by the opposition, and notched a majority in October gubernatorial polls, Maduro has ridden out the storm for now. 
""I think the current government can fix things, if they are allowed to get on with it,"" said mechanic Melix Jordan, 56, voting for the government in the Paraguana peninsula.
Social discontent is running deep, however, and political analysts say Venezuela is fertile territory for a third-way candidate in 2018. But there is no sign so far of an alternative presidential candidate despite calls in some quarters for popular billionaire businessman Lorenzo Mendoza to run.

""My vote maybe doesn't change anything,"" said gardener Hector Machado, 64, who voted for the opposition in Tachira state. ""But I still have hope for something better next year. The government has to understand how bad things are.""

Sun was abruptly removed from his post as party chief of the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing - one of China's most important cities - in July and replaced by Chen Miner, who is close to President Xi Jinping. 
Later that month, he was put under investigation and in September, the party announced he would be prosecuted for corruption. Sun was accused of leaking secrets, bribery and abusing his power.
In a brief statement, the prosecutor said that it had begun proceedings against Sun for suspected bribery and had approved the taking of ""coercive measures"" against him, a Chinese legal term that generally refers to detention.
The case is proceeding, it added, without giving any other details. Sun was expelled from parliament last month, removing his immunity from prosecution that he had enjoyed as a member of that body.
Chongqing is perhaps best known outside China for its association with Bo Xilai, another disgraced former party boss of the city. He, too, was once a contender for top leadership. He was jailed for life in 2013 after a dramatic corruption scandal.
It has not been possible to reach Sun or a representative for comment since he was put under investigation. It's unclear if he has been allowed to retain a lawyer.

The next likely step against Sun will be to put him on trial, where he is certain to be found guilty as the legal system is controlled by the ruling Communist Party which will not challenge the party's accusations against him.

1678,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2017 10:32PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Philippines defied experts' advice in pursuing dengue immunization program,"By Tom Allard and Karen Lema
MANILA (Reuters) - As she announced in January 2016 that the Philippines would immunize one million children with a new dengue vaccine, the nation's then health secretary Janette Garin boasted it was a world-first and a tribute to her country's ""expertise"" in research.
At the time, it seemed the Philippines could be on the cusp of a breakthrough to combat a potentially lethal tropical virus that had been endemic in large parts of the Southeast Asian nation for decades.
Almost two years later, the program lies in tatters and has been suspended after Sanofi (PA:SASY) Pasteur, a division of French drug firm Sanofi, said at the end of last month the vaccine itself may in some cases increase the risk of severe dengue in recipients not previously infected by the virus.
Documents reviewed by Reuters that have not been disclosed until now, as well as interviews with local experts, show that key recommendations made by a Philippines Department of Health (DOH) advisory body of doctors and pharmacologists were not heeded before the program was rolled out to 830,000 children.
After Garin's announcement, the Formulary Executive Council (FEC) of advisers urged caution over the vaccine because it said its safety and cost-effectiveness had not been established.
After twice meeting in January, the panel approved the state's purchase of the vaccine on Feb 1, 2016 but recommended stringent conditions, minutes of all three meetings show.
""Based on the available scientific evidence presented to the Council, there is still a need to establish long-term safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness,"" the FEC told Garin in a letter on that day. The letter was reviewed by Reuters.
The FEC said Dengvaxia should be introduced through small-scale pilot tests and phased implementation rather than across three regions in the country at the same time, and only after a detailed ""baseline"" study of the prevalence and strains of dengue in the targeted area, the FEC letter and minutes of the meetings said.
The experts also recommended that Dengvaxia be bought in small batches so the price could be negotiated down. An economic evaluation report commissioned by Garin's own department had found the proposed cost of 1,000 pesos ($21.29) per dose was ""not cost-effective"" from a public payer perspective, the minutes from the meetings reveal. 
For reasons that Reuters was unable to determine, these recommendations were ignored.
""VERY ANGRY""
The DOH purchased 3 million doses of Dengvaxia in one lot, enough for the required three vaccinations for each child in the proposed immunization program and paid 1,000 pesos per dose, a copy of the purchase order reviewed by Reuters shows.
It did conduct a ""limited baseline study"" in late February and March 2016, but the survey looked at ""common illnesses"" rather than the prevalence of dengue, according to guidelines issued by Garin's office at the time and reviewed by Reuters.
Garin, who was part of the government of former president Benigno Aquino and replaced when President Rodrigo Duterte took power in June, 2016, did not respond to requests for comment on why she ignored the local experts' recommendations.
A physician, Garin has defended her conduct and a program that she said was ""implemented in accordance with WHO guidance and recommendations"".
""I understand the concern,"" she told Philippine TV station ABS-CBN on Friday. ""Even us, we're also very angry when we learned about Sanofi's announcement about severe dengue. I'm also a mother. My child was also vaccinated. I was also vaccinated.""
DOH spokesman Lyndon Lee Suy also did not respond to text messages or questions emailed to him.
Sanofi Philippines declined comment on the Philippines government decision. However, Dr. Su-Peing Ng, Global Medical Head of Sanofi Pasteur, told Reuters: ""We communicated all known benefits and risks of the vaccine to the Philippines government."" 
Rontgene Solante, former president of the Philippines Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, said health officials were motivated to end the debilitating impact of dengue on the Philippines, where there are about 200,000 reported cases each year and many more unreported.
Over 1,000 people died of the disease in the country last year.
Two months after the FEC wrote to the health secretary, the DOH began immunizing one million students around the age of 10 in all three target areas in April 2016, in accordance with its original plan but at odds with the FEC's recommendations to conduct a slow roll-out of the vaccine. 
""The usual process for the DOH that has protected our children for so many decades was not followed. That's a fact,"" said Susan Mercado, a former Philippines health department undersecretary and former senior official at the World Health Organization (WHO).
WHO said in April 2016 that the Philippines' campaign appeared to meet its criteria for using Dengvaxia because the targeted regions had high levels of dengue exposure; the vaccine would be provided to children 9 years and older; and they would each receive three doses.
WHO was not involved in the deliberations of the FEC, according to the minutes. It said in a statement last week that a position paper on the dengue vaccine it published in July 2016 did not include a recommendation for countries to introduce it. 
Now, after Sanofi's warnings, WHO has said it agrees with the government's decision to suspend the immunization program.
SHOULDN'T IGNORE EXPERTISE
The current secretary of health in the Duterte administration, Francisco Duque, said he would carry out a ""thorough analysis"" of the FEC's recommendations and the program before passing judgment. He said the Council's recommendations were not legally enforceable.
""At the end of the day, the final decision is made by (the)secretary of health,"" he told Reuters. ""But because of the expertise that the members of the FEC have, it is something that you don't want to ignore.""
Underpinning the concerns in 2016 about Dengvaxia, since confirmed by Sanofi, were fears that the vaccine would act like a primary infection for those who had never had dengue.
If they were bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus after the vaccination, it could be akin to getting dengue a second time, which often leads to far more severe symptoms and potentially death if bad cases are not treated quickly.
The concerns were first raised by noted U.S.-based tropical disease expert, Dr. Scott Halstead, who urged both Sanofi and the WHO to proceed with caution.
In the Philippines, Dr. Antonio Dans, an epidemiologist from the University of the Philippines, led a delegation of physicians to the DOH in March 2016 where, citing Halstead's research, they pressed for the campaign to be aborted.
""The data was not definitive but it was clear there were uncertainties and risks. Why not wait for the complete studies to be finished before endangering so many children?"" Dans told Reuters.
In a Senate hearing late last year, Garin said she was aware of Halstead's assessment but dismissed it. ""This is a theory ... it has not been proven,"" she said at the time.
FEAR AND CONFUSION
Two sources involved in the program said no antibody testing was undertaken, as recommended by the FEC. 
Antibody testing, while not 100 percent accurate, indicates whether an individual has had dengue before.
Duque, the current health secretary, is demanding the company refund the 3 billion pesos ($60 million) paid for the vaccinations and has threatened legal action against Sanofi if it is proven to have withheld information.
A criminal probe is underway into how a danger to public health came about and two Congressional inquiries have been convened in the Philippines.
Duque told Reuters he was concerned that the program was paid from an ""off-budget"" allocation, meaning it bypassed Congressional scrutiny. Reuters was unable to confirm this.

Until now, one child out of the 830,000 vaccinated, a girl who was hospitalized with severe dengue, has been linked definitively by the DOH to the campaign. But the department of health says it still does not have complete data on those who fell ill after taking Dengvaxia.

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2017 10:00PM ET</span>","China, Taiwan spar over Chinese diplomat's invasion threat","BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - A threat by a senior Chinese diplomat to invade Taiwan the instant any U.S. warship visits the self-ruled island has sparked a war of words, with Taipei accusing Beijing of failing to understand what democracy means.
China considers Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms.
Beijing regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States. In September, the U.S. Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States.
Diplomat Li Kexin said at a Chinese embassy event in Washington on Friday he had told U.S. officials that China would activate its Anti-Secession Law, which allows it to use force on Taiwan if deemed necessary to prevent the island from seceding, if the United States sent navy ships to Taiwan. 
""The day that a U.S. Navy vessel arrives in Kaohsiung is the day that our People's Liberation Army unifies Taiwan with military force,"" Chinese media quoted Li as saying at the weekend, referring to Taiwan's main port. 
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said late on Saturday that, while Chinese officials seemed to want to try and win over hearts and minds in Taiwan, they also had been repeatedly using threats that hurt the feelings of Taiwan's people.
""These methods show a lack of knowledge about the real meaning of the democratic system and how a democratic society works,"" the ministry said.
China suspects Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who leads the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, wants to declare the island's formal independence. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan's security.
Influential Chinese tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said on Monday China would never back down over Taiwan.
""The Chinese mainland has never given up the option of Taiwan reunification by force, which is clear to people across the Taiwan Strait,"" it said in an editorial.

""Li's words have sent a warning to Taiwan and drew a clear red line. If Taiwan attempts to hold an independence referendum or other activities in pursuit of de jure 'Taiwan independence', the PLA will undoubtedly take action,"" it said.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said last week he took reports very seriously that China's Communist Party had sought to interfere in his country.
Turnbull said that foreign powers were making ""unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process"" in Australia and the world. He cited ""disturbing reports about Chinese influence"".
The Chinese government has already protested the remarks, and on Monday the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily stepped up the attacks.
The reports in Australian media have been full of imagination, making baseless attacks on the Chinese government and have maliciously slandered Chinese students and people living in Australia, the paper said in a commentary.
""This type of hysterical paranoia had racist undertones, and is a stain on Australia's image as a multicultural society,"" the People's Daily said.
The commentary was published under the pen name ""Zhong Sheng,"" meaning ""Voice of China,"" which is often used to give the paper's view on foreign policy issues.
China's soft power has come under renewed focus last week after a politician from Australia's opposition Labor party was demoted from government having been found to have warned a prominent Chinese business leader and Communist Party member that his phone was being tapped by intelligence authorities.
In June, Fairfax Media and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported on a concerted campaign by China to ""infiltrate"" Australian politics to promote Chinese interests.
Turnbull has vowed to ban foreign political donations to curb external influence in domestic politics.
The People's Daily said that China had no intention of interfering in Australian politics or using financial contributions to curry influence. China is Australia's largest trading partner.
The two countries have no historical enmity or conflicts over each others' basic interests and can absolutely forge good relations, it added.

China ""urges the Australian government and media to cast aside political prejudice and bigotry and stick to the principle of using the facts in handling issues of relations with China"", the paper wrote.

AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army and Iranian-backed militias backed by Russian air power stepped up a military campaign against rebels in eastern Hama province in a push towards the rebel stronghold of Idlib province in northwestern Syria, rebels and witnesses said. 
They said dozens of aerial strikes believed to be conducted mainly by Russian jets in the last 48 hours hit opposition held villages and towns in the northeastern Hama countryside and the southern part of Idlib province. 
The Islamist Hayat Tahrir al Sham and some Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel faction in control of these areas said they were sending reinforcements to seize back a string of villages in the northeastern Hama countryside, near the town of Rihjan, that the army had earlier announced were captured in heavy fighting.
The army said the villages of Um Turayka, Bilil, and Rujum al Ahmar were seized, forcing the rebels to flee to areas close to the administrative boundaries of Idlib province. 
The Syrian army had lost the strategically located Idlib province to insurgents when the provincial capital fell to rebels in 2015. It has since become the only province that is fully under opposition control.
The Syrian army's first goal was to retake strategic Abu al Dhour military airport, one of the largest airports in the north of the country that fell to rebels in 2015. It was heavily bombed on Sunday, a rebel source said.
""The regime movements seek to besiege Idlib province with the help of Shi'ite militias fighting with them,"" said Colonel Mustafa Bakour, a commander in the Jaish al Izza rebel faction. 
Tahrir al Sham, which is spearheaded by the former al Qaeda branch in Syria, is the main rebel force in the province, raising fears among civilians and rebels alike that Moscow and the Syrian army and its allies would soon turn it into a major battlefield.
The strategically located province that borders Turkey is part of the Russian-led de-escalation zones that seek to shore up ceasefires in western Syria.
Idlib has been a haven for tens of thousands of rebels and civilians who were forced to abandon their homes in other parts of western Syria that the government and its foreign military allies have recaptured from rebels.
It has already been the target of intensive strikes by the Russia and Syrian air forces in the past year that have killed thousands of civilians and destroyed hospitals and civil defense centers.
Tahrir al Sham also repelled simultaneously an offensive by Islamic State militants who have been for the last few weeks pushing into the opposition-controlled territory to extend a small enclave they have in that area, among the few they retain across Syria. 
The ultra hardline militants also seized a string of villages that brought them within kilometers of Idlib province. 
The Russian and Syrian army advance towards Idlib is also piling pressure on Turkey which had since October begun a major military deployment in the province it considers within its sphere of influence. 
Ankara's intervention seeks to rein in Russian strikes and prevent Idlib from facing a similar fate to Mosul or Aleppo, according to a senior rebel commander briefed on Turkish policy.

In the partial recount of 4,753 ballot boxes, the conservative Hernandez won 50.1 percent of the votes, against some 31.5 percent for his rival Salvador Nasralla from the center-left coalition Opposition Alliance against the Dictatorship. 
The tribunal did not specify exactly how many votes from the Nov. 26 election were recounted. There are some 18,000 ballot boxes overall.
Including all votes, Nasralla trails conservative Orlando Hernandez by 1.6 percentage points according to the official count, which has been questioned by the two main opposition parties and a wide swathe of the diplomatic corps.
Observers from the Organization of American States (OAS) issued a series of recommendations this week to authorities including a recount of disputed ballots.
""What we can say is that the results of the recount are extremely consistent with what we had originally,"" David Matamoros, president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) said.
The election has been plagued with problems since voting stations closed, sparking concerns of deepening political instability in the poor, violent Central American nation. 
The tribunal declared Nasralla the leader in an announcement on the morning after the vote, with just over half of the ballot boxes counted. However, it gave no further updates for about 36 hours. Once results then started flowing again, Nasralla's lead quickly started narrowing, sparking a major outcry.
Since early December, the government imposed a curfew which is still in place in 5 of the country's 18 departments.
Opposition parties on Friday presented formal requests to annul the election. 

On Sunday afternoon, opposition groups were expected to take to the streets to protest the results. The electoral tribunal has until December 26 to declare a winner.

Anaya resigned as leader of the PAN on Saturday, a day after his party officially joined forces with the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and the Citizens Movement party in the ""For Mexico in Front"" coalition.
If selected, Anaya will likely take on leftist former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and former Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade, who is seeking the nomination for the ruling centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
Meade, who has served in both PRI and PAN administrations, resigned as finance minister in November and PRI officials hope he will help the party recover from a spate of corruption scandals.
""This corrupt and inefficient PRI government has been an absolute national disaster,"" Anaya said on Sunday, adding that his own party did not make fundamental structural changes during its two presidential terms from 2000 to 2012.
Anaya saw a split in his party in October when former first lady Margarita Zavala left to launch a bid for the presidency as an independent candidate. Zavala, the wife of former President Felipe Calderon, said she quit the PAN because the party base had been subordinated to the interests of its leadership.
The left-right coalition on Friday presented its official request with the electoral institute to compete in the July 2018 vote. The group must still pick its leader, with Anaya, who had been leader of the PAN since 2015, considered the front-runner.
Anaya, 38, has faced criticism in the Mexican press for his family's ""inexplicable"" level of wealth, although he denies any wrongdoing.
In a voter poll published on Wednesday, Anaya came in second behind Lopez Obrador, who leads the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party, but ahead of Meade.
Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera, who was seen as a contender for the coalition, said on Saturday he would not run and criticized what he said was an undemocratic selection process.

The PSD-led coalition, which holds a strong majority in parliament, is debating proposed new legislation which the European Commission and thousands of magistrates have said would put the judicial system under political control.
Sunday's protests mark three weeks since a special parliamentary commission began debates on the bill, which the ruling party aims to approve by the end of this year.
The commission is headed by PSD veteran, former justice minister Florin Iordache who had to quit in February after a decree on corruption that he drafted, triggered the biggest rallies since the 1989 anti-communist Romanian revolution.
""Thieves and mobsters' nest,"", ""United we save Romania,"" shouted thousands of protesters braving gusting winds, in front of the government's headquarters. 
About 10,000 are estimated to have rallied in Bucharest and overall, 20,000 across the country overall.
Bucharest's Victory Square (NYSE:SQ) witnessed large street protests at the start of the year following attempts by the ruling Social Democrats to decriminalize some graft offences and has been a gathering place for largely peaceful protests ever since.
Contested elements of the bill include changes to a judicial inspection unit which oversees the conduct of magistrates, the way in which chief prosecutors are appointed and giving the president the right to vet prosecutor candidates.
Transparency International ranks Romania among the European Union's most corrupt states and Brussels keeps Romania's justice system under special monitoring.
In a Nov. 15 report the European Commission said reform of the justice system has halted this year and challenges to judicial independence remain a persistent source of concern.

Opposition coalition NASA had planned to publicly ""inaugurate"" Odinga at a rally on Tuesday, Kenyan independence day, in what the attorney general said this week would be an act of treason. 
Kenyatta was re-elected as Kenya's president with 98 percent of the vote in a repeat election held on Oct. 26 which Odinga boycotted. He had beaten Odinga in the original poll, held in August, which was nullified by the Supreme Court on procedural grounds following opposition allegations of vote-rigging and other malpractices. 
NASA said in a statement it would postpone the swearing-in after ""consultations and engagement with a wide range of national and international interlocutors"". It did not specifically name any mediators involved in the talks.
The coalition said it would be announcing a new date for the swearing in ceremony and the launch of its People's Assembly ""as well as a more vigorous and prolonged resistance"".
The plan to install Odinga as an alternative president had threatened to exacerbate rifts opened by an acrimonious election season that left more than 70 people dead in political violence. 
The United States had also urged opposition leaders to work within the law and avoid actions like the proposed ""inauguration ceremony.""

In September Qatar's defense minister was reported to have signed a letter of intent to buy the 24 Typhoon jets from BAE in a move that could anger other Gulf countries boycotting Doha.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2017 11:01AM ET</span>",Thousands of Saakashvili supporters stage protest against Ukraine president,"KIEV (Reuters) - Several thousand people marched through central Kiev on Sunday to protest against the detention of Ukrainian opposition figure Mikheil Saakashvili and call for the impeachment of President Petro Poroshenko.
Saakashvili, president of his native Georgia for nine years until 2013, moved to Ukraine after a popular uprising there and served under Poroshenko as a regional governor from 2015-2016, before falling out with the Ukrainian leader.
He was detained in Kiev on Friday, following a dramatic standoff earlier in the week where he clambered on a roof to avoid law enforcement and was freed from a police van by his supporters.
He accuses the Ukrainian authorities of widespread corruption. Prosecutors accuse him of assisting a criminal organization, charges he says were trumped up to undermine his political campaign against Poroshenko.
A large number of police in riot gear guarded Sunday's rally, which was peaceful in contrast with protests last week that resulted in clashes between Saakashvili's supporters and law enforcement.
""A lot of people are looking for the changes. It is more difficult when Mikheil is not with us,"" his wife, Sandra Roelofs, said in a speech at the rally. 
""We remember his words: 'When they catch me, you continue despite anything, because Ukraine wants changes, Ukraine has to become a better country',"" she said.
Protesters shouted 'Shame' and 'Impeachment' as they marched to Maidan square, the scene of the 2013-14 pro-European protests that ousted a Moscow-backed president and installed a new leadership that promised to eliminate entrenched corruption.
A few snowballs were thrown at the windows of a branch of Roshen, the confectionary business owned by Poroshenko, who was a wealthy chocolatier before he went into politics.
Saakashvili has launched a hunger strike to protest against his detention, which will last until a court rules on whether to release him under house arrest.
The saga has attracted international attention to Ukraine at a time when the authorities face a chorus of criticism from reformers and foreign donors over perceived backtracking on reforms and attacks on anti-corruption institutions.

While Saakashvili has a core base of supporters, he enjoys limited support across Ukraine. Only 1.7 percent of voters would support his party, the Movement of New Forces, in elections, according to an October survey by the Kiev-based Razumkov Centre think-tank.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is aiming to secure a comprehensive free trade deal with the European Union and wants it to be signed shortly after it leaves the bloc in 2019, Brexit minister David Davis said on Sunday.
After securing an initial agreement on Friday to move Brexit talks to a second phase, Prime Minister Theresa May is keen to start discussing future ties with the EU, and especially the type of trading agreement to try to offer greater certainty for businesses.
But despite Davis striking a confident tone, EU officials say they will only launch negotiations on a legally binding treaty after Britain leaves and becomes a ""third country"", according to draft negotiating guidelines.
""It's not that complicated, it comes right back to the alignment point ... We start in full alignment, we start in complete convergence so we can work it out from there,"" Davis told the BBC's Andrew Marr show.
""The thing is how we manage divergence so it doesn't undercut the access to the market,"" he said, describing his preferred deal as ""Canada plus plus plus"".
The EU has been considering a post-Brexit free trade deal with Britain along the lines of one agreed last year with Canada.
But the UK economy is nearly twice the size of Canada's and British officials have said that their current alignment with EU standards and much closer trading links with the continent give them scope for an even deeper relationship.
LIMITED RESPITE
May has been hailed by many in her deeply divided Conservative party for rescuing the agreement to unlock the Brexit talks by offering EU member Ireland and her allies in Northern Ireland a pledge to avoid any return of a hard border.
By playing with the wording, May agreed that if the two sides failed to agree an overall Brexit deal, the United Kingdom would keep ""full alignment"" with those rules of the EU's single market that help cooperation between Ireland's north and south.
Davis described the commitment as more of a ""statement of intent"" than a legally binding measure -- something that might reassure hardline Brexit campaigners who fear that it could imply that Britain was leaving the EU in name only.
Despite last week's progress, May will enjoy little respite. The second phase of talks is expected to expose the rifts in her top team of ministers over what Britain should look like once it leaves the EU.
On Saturday, environment minister Michael Gove, a Brexit campaigner, opened up the possibility of changing the terms of any agreement with the EU after Brexit if Britons felt that the deal had not reflected their demands to ""take back control"".

""If the British people dislike the arrangement that we have negotiated with the EU, the agreement will allow a future government to diverge,"" Gove wrote in a column in the Daily Telegraph.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - More than 300 Baloch separatist militants have surrendered over the past few months, Pakistani government officials said, after a ceremony to mark the downing of guns and militants' return to civilian life.
The surrenders are part of government efforts to end a decade-long insurgency in the southwestern Baluchistan province by offering amnesties and financial rewards to soldiers and commanders to help them re-integrate into the society.
In a high-profile ceremony on the lawn of the Baluchistan provincial assembly in the western city of Quetta, the regional capital, some 313 militants from three separatist movements handed over weapons to Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, the Chief Minister of the province.
""I will hug all that who believe in integrity and sovereignty of Pakistan but will not tolerate (those) who will challenge the writ of the State,"" Zehri said at the ceremony on Saturday.
Pakistani government officials say about 2,000 militants have surrendered over the past 18 months. In April, the government held a similar ceremony where about 400 militants handed over their guns.
The latest ceremony saw surrenders by 143 militants from the Baloch Republican Army (BRA), 125 fighters from the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and 17 from Baloch Liberation Front (BLF), according to officials.
Under the agreement, foot soldiers are given 500,000 rupees ($4,700) and the top-level commanders receive about 1 million rupees ($9,500) to help them and their families build a life after militancy. 
Baluchistan's government and the powerful army, which has a huge say in the running of Pakistan's poorest province, tout the amnesties as an effective way to reduce the power of separatists who accuse Islamabad of exploiting Baluchistan.
While security has improved in Baluchistan over the past few years, critics and human rights groups say the army has crushed dissent and free speech, while separatists accuse security officials of extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearances. The military denies abuse claims.
Pakistan's desire to dismantle the insurgencies has grown in urgency amid vast Chinese investment from Beijing's Belt and Road infrastructure splurge. China has frequently urged Pakistan to improve security, especially in Baluchistan.
A new transport corridor (CPEC) through Baluchistan, linking Western China with Pakistan's Arabian Sea port of Gwadar, is due to become operational in late 2018. 
Separatists have vowed to disrupt CPEC, and earlier this week China warned its citizens of a security threat inside Pakistan.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A Palestinian stabbed an Israeli security guard at Jerusalem's main bus station on Sunday, police said, and violence flared near the U.S. Embassy in Beirut over U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Four days of street protests in the Palestinian territories over Trump's announcement on Wednesday have largely died down, but his overturning of long-standing U.S. policy on Jerusalem -- a city holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians -- drew more Arab warnings of potential damage to prospects for Middle East peace.
""Our hope is that everything is calming down and that we are returning to a path of normal life without riots and without violence,"" Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Army Radio.
But in Jerusalem, a security guard was in critical condition after a 24-year-old Palestinian man from the occupied West Bank stabbed him after approaching a metal detector at an entrance to the city's central bus station, police said. The alleged assailant was taken into custody after a passer-by tackled him.
In Beirut, meanwhile, Lebanese security forces fired tear gas and water canons at protesters, some of them waving Palestinian flags, near the U.S. Embassy.
Demonstrators set fires in the street, torched U.S. and Israeli flags and threw projectiles towards security forces that had barricaded the main road to the complex.
Arab foreign ministers who met in Cairo on Saturday urged the United States to abandon its decision on Jerusalem and said the move would spur violence throughout the region.
Echoing that view, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan, the de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates, said the U.S. move ""could throw a lifebuoy to terrorist and armed groups, which have begun to lose ground"" in the Middle East.
Most countries consider East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it in a 1967 war, to be occupied territory and say the status of the city should be decided at future Israeli-Palestinian talks.
Israel says that all of Jerusalem is its capital, while Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.
GAZA TUNNEL
Along Israel's tense frontier with the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military on Sunday destroyed what it described as a ""significant"" cross-border attack tunnel dug by the enclave's dominant Islamist group, Hamas.
There was no immediate comment on the demolition, which came as Palestinian factions tried to meet Sunday's deadline for an Egyptian-mediated handover of the Gaza Strip by Hamas to Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas after a decade's schism.
Pre-dawn Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed two Palestinian gunmen after militants fired rockets from the area into Israel on Friday.
In the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Sunday, thousands protested outside the U.S. embassy, many waving banners saying ""Palestine is in our hearts"".
Leaders in Indonesia, home to the world's largest Muslim population, have joined a global chorus of condemnation of Trump's announcement, including from Western allies. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, meanwhile, said that an approaching meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) will complicate Trump's plans.
""With the roadmap we will create during the OIC meeting, we will show that the decision will not be easy to implement,"" he said on Sunday, adding that Turkey considers Trump's Jerusalem announcement as void.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted to critics in a statement before talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Sunday, to be followed by a meeting with European foreign ministers in Brussels.
""I hear (from Europe) voices of condemnation over President Trump's historic announcement, but I have not heard any condemnation for the rocket firing against Israel that has come (after the announcement) and the awful incitement against us,"" Netanyahu said.
The Trump administration has said it is still committed to reviving Palestinian-Israeli talks that collapsed in 2014.
It said Israel's capital would be in Jerusalem under any serious peace plan, adding that it has not taken a position with regard to the city's borders.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki has said the Palestinians will be looking for a new peace talks broker instead of the United States and would seek a United Nations Security Council resolution over Trump's decision.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Former Nepali prime minister K.P. Oli on Sunday looked set for a return to power after winning his seat in parliament and his Communist UML party and Maoist allies on course to win a majority.
Counting is still under way following an election on Thursday that capped a near-decade long transition to democracy from monarchy and a civil war in which more than 17,000 people died.
Oli, 65, has vowed to form a government that lasts its full five-year term, something no prime minister has achieved since parliamentary democracy was established in 1990.
His campaign has called for the extension of the Chinese railway network into Nepal and implement of hydroelectric, airport and other infrastructure projects to create jobs.
“We can expect Oli to lead a stable government with the Maoists as strong allies,” said Bipin Adhikari, a constitutional expert. “Once there is political stability he can implement a development agenda and attract foreign investment.""
Instability has spooked investors, curbed growth, spurred corruption and slowed reconstruction after a 2015 earthquake that killed 9,000 people.
Nepal is a natural buffer between China and India, with the ruling Nepali Congress party considered pro-India and the left alliance seen closer to China.
“If Oli leads the new government, he will be forced to be pragmatic in maintaining a geo-political balance with both,” said Kunda Dixit, editor of the weekly Nepali Times.
Final election results are expected to take about a week, election officials said.

Home to Mount Everest, Nepal is one of the world’s poorest countries.

The three parties which supported Catalonia's frustrated push to split from Spain in October are seen as returning a total of 66 or 67 seats in the Dec. 21 election, just shy of the 68 seats they would need to control the regional parliament, according to the poll in Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia.
Unionist parties combined are also seen as falling short of an absolute majority, the poll finds, opening the door to a possible hung parliament with CatComu-Podem, the Catalan arm of the anti-austerity Podemos party, as a potential kingmaker.
Market friendly unionist party Ciudadanos and two pro-independence parties, ERC and Junts per Catalunya, the party of former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, are in a dead heat to be the largest parliamentary force, according to the poll based on interviews between Dec. 4 and Dec. 7.

Turnout for the election, which was forced by the central government in an effort to break the political crisis that seized the region in recent months, is predicted to reach a record 82 percent.

Duterte placed the restive region of 22 million people under military rule on May 23 after Islamist militants took over parts of the southern Marawi City in what was the Philippines' biggest security crisis in years. Martial law is due to expire on Dec. 31.
The Philippine leader will formally request on Monday a one-year extension of martial law, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea told reporters.
The 23-member Senate and the 296-member House of Representatives will vote once they convene in joint session. Lawmakers are due to go on recess on from Dec. 16 to Jan. 14, 2018.
Military rule should be extended in Mindanao given threats from Maoist guerrillas, Islamist militants and separatist groups, Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said.
Militants linked to Islamic State, which tried to gain a foothold in Southeast Asia by capturing parts of Marawi City, are strengthening their recruitment programs, Andanar said.
""There were intelligence reports saying they are planning to attack another city,"" Andanar told a radio interview.
The request comes nearly two months after Duterte declared the liberation of Marawi City. More than 1,100 people - mostly militants - were killed and 350,000 displaced by the Marawi unrest.

Continuing martial law beyond the initial 60-day limit requires lawmakers' approval, but the constitution does not restrict how long it can be extended.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2017 07:51AM ET</span>","Yazidis caught in 'political football' between Baghdad, Iraqi Kurds","By Raya Jalabi
SINJAR, Iraq (Reuters) - Since Iraqi forces pushed the Kurds out of the Yazidis' mountainous heartland of Sinjar in northern Iraq in October, residents are wondering what could happen to them next.
Food and money are in short supply since aid organizations stopped delivery after Iraq's advance. Buildings collapsed in the fighting and of those still standing, many are marked with bullets and littered with IEDs. Water and electricity barely work.
The Yazidis, whose beliefs combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions, have long been viewed with suspicion and repeatedly persecuted by other groups in Iraq.
In 2014, more than 3,000 were killed by Islamic State militants in a campaign described by the United Nations as genocidal.
Now the land they have lived on for centuries is caught up in a tug of war between Baghdad and Iraq's Kurds, who had controlled it since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.
""We're trapped in this game of political football, between Iraq and the Kurds,"" said a Yazidi resident of Sinjar, Kamal Ali. ""But neither of them cares about our future.""
The militias have hoisted Iraq's tricolor flag over government buildings and any remaining Kurdish flags have been scrawled over with the words ""Iraq"" and ""Allahu Akbar"", the blazing sun at its center scribbled over in black marker.
Sinjar is politically important because it's in the disputed territories, ethnically mixed areas across northern Iraq, long the subject of a constitutional dispute between Baghdad and the Kurds, who both claim them.
Sinjar fell under the Kurds' control, despite lying outside Iraqi Kurdistan's recognized borders.
Baghdad did little to challenge the arrangement until its October offensive, launched to punish the Kurds for their Sept. 25 independence referendum. Iraqi forces have seized the disputed areas the Kurds had expanded into including Sinjar.
The referendum reignited long-simmering tensions over geographic dominance in the oil-rich north, between Baghdad and the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), who fought side by side to defeat Islamic State. 
DIVIDED
The Yazidis are divided about what should happen now.
Some are glad the Kurds have gone and see an opportunity for increased autonomy now that they are under federal control following the offensive by Iraq’s security forces last October. Kurdish forces handed over Sinjar without a fight to the Lalesh Brigades, a Yazidi militia backed by Baghdad’s Shiite paramilitary forces (PMF).
Most Yazidis speak a Kurdish dialect, but many don't see themselves as ethnically Kurdish.
""We're happy the Kurds have left,"" said Abu Sardar, a 47-year-old Yazidi man. ""We're Yazidis we're not Kurds, we do not want to be part of Kurdistan."" 
Like others, Abu Sardar complained that the Kurds forced him to vote in the Kurdish referendum, accusations the KRG denies. 
He returned two months ago to the ruins of his home in the Sinuni district of Sinjar and expressed bitter disappointment that little had changed since he left in 2014: hospitals and schools remain shuttered while the city is still mostly rubble. 
He hopes that Baghdad and its militias will rebuild Sinjar.
Others lament the Kurds' departure.
The KRG and allied Yazidi groups hold former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki responsible for the campaign by Islamic State. They say his troops' desertion of Mosul allowed militants to capture billions of dollars in weapons later used to attack the minority. 
Yazidi commander Qassem Shesho says Iraq's government is too sectarian and dislikes the Yazidis as much as Islamic State.
Like many others, he blames the Kurds for the attack by Islamic State.
""But they're all we've got,"" he said. 
Shesho is allied to Iraqi Kurdistan's ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party, even though the Kurds cut his fighters' salaries after the Lalesh Brigades took over Sinjar.
'CITY OF GHOSTS'
Some days, residents say, there are only bones in Sinjar. Nearly 50 mass graves have been uncovered outside the town since 2014.
""Sinjar is a city of ghosts,"" said the Lalesh Brigades' leader Ali Serhan Eissa, also known as Khal Ali.
Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled the militant onslaught and headed for Mount Sinjar. Of those who didn't reach the mountain, about 3,100 were killed – with more than half shot, beheaded, burned alive and disposed of in mass graves.
Others were sold into sexual slavery or forced to fight, according to a report by the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Medicine.
Some are still on the mountain, about to spend a third freezing winter in tents. 
Before the attack, Sinjar was home to about 400,000 people – mainly Yazidis and Arab Sunnis. Only 15 percent of Yazidis have returned home, according to humanitarian estimates. 
Most Yazidis remain in IDP camps in the Kurdistan region, along with most of the area's displace Sunnis. Aid workers worry the camps will be closed if tensions between Baghdad and the Kurds flare up. 
The presence of fighters from Turkey's separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) further complicates the picture. Many Yazidis credit them with opening up a land route to allow those stranded on Mount Sinjar to escape the militants in 2014.
The PKK entrenched itself in the community, even creating a local unit, the Sinjar Resistance Units (YBS) which controls multiple checkpoints around Sinjar.
Turkey and neighboring Iran are closely watching the power shift in Sinjar.

Tehran wants to secure this north-western region of Iraq as it sits on the border with Syria, while Turkey wants the region free of the outlawed PKK.

The pontiff said that there was a need to ""work with determination to build a world without nuclear weapons"", speaking from the window of the papal apartment overlooking St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) and citing his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato Si (Praised Be).
His remarks came on the day that the group which won this year's Nobel Peace Prize urged nuclear nations to adopt a U.N. treaty banning atomic weapons.
With rising tensions between the United States and North Korea, the pope has repeatedly warned against the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental effects of nuclear devices and has called for a third country to mediate the dispute.
At his weekly Angelus prayer, Pope Francis added that men and women in the world had ""the liberty, the intelligence and the capacity to guide technology, limit their power, at the service of peace and true progress"".
Speaking aboard the plane back from his trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh, the pope suggested that some world leaders had an ""irrational"" attitude toward nuclear weapons.
Last month he appeared to harden the Catholic Church's teaching against nuclear weapons, saying countries should not stockpile them, even for the purpose of deterrence.

Pope Francis, a strong defender of environmental protection, also hoped that an upcoming Paris summit would adopt ""efficient decisions"" to contrast climate change.

The announcement, cleared by Israeli censors who had previously barred reports of detection work around the central Gaza frontier, followed a surge of Palestinian unrest in response to last week's U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
It also came as Palestinian factions tried to meet Sunday's deadline for an Egyptian-mediated handover of Gaza by Hamas to Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas after a decade's schism.
A network of Gaza tunnels allowed Hamas gunmen to blindside Israel's superior forces during the 2014 war and the Israelis, with U.S. help, have since stepped up work on counter-measures.
The tunnel destroyed on Sunday ran hundreds of meters into Israeli territory and, though unfinished, was a new project that showed ""a significant effort by Hamas"", military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus told reporters.
He did not elaborate on how Israel knew Hamas was responsible for the tunnel, which he said reached to within 1km (0.6 miles) of the nearest Israeli civilian community.
Hamas did not respond immediately to a request for comment. 
The previous such announcement was on Oct. 30, when Israel blew up a tunnel dug by Islamic Jihad. In the process of that demolition, 10 gunmen from the group and another two from Hamas were killed - deaths that Israeli sources described as an unintended result of the passage's collapse within Gazan turf.
Conricus said that ""to the best of our knowledge"" there were no such casualties on Sunday, though he added that the tunnels could be ""death traps"" for Gaza gunmen.
""The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) will continue to discover, expose and demolish these terror tunnels,"" he said.

OSLO (Reuters) - The leader of the group that won this year's Nobel Peace Prize on Sunday urged nuclear nations to adopt a United Nations treaty banning atomic weapons in order to prevent ""the end of us"".
The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) was awarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize by a Nobel committee that cited the spread of nuclear weapons and the growing risk of an atomic war. 
ICAN is a coalition of 468 grassroots non-governmental groups that campaigned for a U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, adopted by 122 nations in July.
The treaty is not signed by - and would not apply to - any of the states that already have nuclear arms. Beatrice Fihn, ICAN's Executive Director, urged them to sign the agreement. 
Graphic of Nobel laureates: http://tmsnrt.rs/2y6ATVW
""It provides a choice. A choice between the two endings: the end of nuclear weapons or the end of us,"" she said in her speech at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
""The United States, choose freedom over fear. Russia, choose disarmament over destruction. Britain, choose the rule of law over oppression,"" she added, before urging France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel to do the same.
Israel is widely assumed to have nuclear weapons, although it neither confirms nor denies it.
""A moment of panic or carelessness, a misconstrued comment or bruised ego, could easily lead us unavoidably to the destruction of entire cities,"" she added. 
""A calculated military escalation could lead to the indiscriminate mass murder of civilians."" 
Fihn delivered the Nobel lecture together with Setsuko Thurlow, an 85-year-old survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bombing and now an ICAN campaigner.
Thurlow recalled on stage on Sunday some of her memories of the attack on Aug. 6, 1945. 
She was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building about 1.8 kilometers (1.1 mile) from Ground Zero, she said. Most of her classmates, who were in the same room, were burned alive. 
""Processions of ghostly figures shuffled by. Grotesquely wounded people, they were bleeding, burnt, blackened and swollen,"" she said. 
""Parts of their bodies were missing. Flesh and skin hung from their bones. Some with their eyeballs hanging in their hands. Some with their bellies burst open, their intestines hanging out. The foul stench of burnt human flesh filled the air."" 
The United States, Britain and France sent second-rank diplomats to the Nobel ceremony, which Fihn earlier told Reuters was ""some kind of protest"".
