MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities will meet with Central American officials to prepare for the arrival of a planned new caravan of migrants headed to the United States next week.
The head of Mexico's immigration office, Tonatiuh Guillen, left on Wednesday on a trip to El Salvador and Honduras to meet with his counterparts and other authorities, said Interior Ministry spokesman Hector Gandini.
Mexico hopes to discourage a mass exodus from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, and wants Central Americans who decide to migrate north to do so in an orderly way and through legal ports of entry.
""The doors to Mexico are open to anyone who wants to enter in an orderly fashion,"" Gandini told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""But whoever wants to come in illegally will be deported.""
Previous Central American caravans became a flashpoint in the debate over U.S. immigration policy.
That was intensified by the recent deaths of two migrant children in American custody and a partial U.S. government shutdown over U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the border with Mexico.
There are 12 legal ports of entry for Central Americans on Mexico's southern border, but Mexican authorities have identified an additional 370 illegal points of entry on that frontier, Interior Minister Olga Sanchez said this week.
Mexico borders in the south with Guatemala and Belize.
The illegal entry points will be ""monitored and controlled to avoid undocumented access of people to our territory,"" Sanchez said.
Guatemala's deputy foreign minister, Pablo Cesar Garcia, met with Mexican authorities on Tuesday to discuss the caravan and to ""provide all the necessary support to the migrants,"" said Guatemalan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marta Larra.
""In Honduras, they kill us,"" read an appeal circulating on social media for people to assemble in the violent Honduran city of San Pedro Sula next Tuesday to start the long trek north to the United States.
While other social media posts invite people to leave from nearby Santa Barbara on Jan. 20, U.S. authorities hoped to dissuade Central Americans from making the journey.

""The risks of illegal immigration are serious. Don't waste your time and money on a trip destined to fail. The road is long and very dangerous. Thousands of Hondurans who participated in the caravan came back sorry,"" Heide Fulton, the U.S chargé d'affaires to Honduras, said on Twitter on Wednesday.

The result could lead to Congo's first democratic transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960, though election observers reported a number of irregularities during the polls and the opposition said it was marred by fraud. 

Losing candidates, who include businessman Martin Fayulu and ruling party candidate Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, can contest the results before Congo's constitutional court, which has 10 days to hear and rule on any challenges.

    The commission declared opposition leader, Felix Tshisekedi, the official winner early on Thursday in what could lead to Congo's first democratic transfer of power. But an observer mission from the Church's bishops conference (CENCO) told diplomats that its own tallies showed another opposition leader, Martin Fayulu, winning. 
    The discrepancy sets the stage for a possible standoff between the Congolese government and the Church, which deployed 40,000 election observers and is considered one of Congo's most influential and trusted institutions.

With less than three months before Britain is due to leave the EU, Britain's parliament on Wednesday began a five-day debate over Minister Theresa May's deal with the rest of the bloc ahead of a vote in the lower house next Tuesday.
May has refused to retreat from her unpopular deal, which envisages close trading ties with the EU after leaving in March, pressing ahead with a vote she is expected to lose.
""I firmly believe that my job is to look after the welfare and interests of the British people and I conclude that it would not be in their interests to leave without a deal,"" Hammond told an annual reception hosted by European planemaker Airbus.
British lawmakers earlier on Wednesday demanded the government come up with a plan B within days if she loses the vote on her deal to leave the European Union. 
Asked how in that situation the government would prevent a 'no-deal' Brexit, Hammond told Reuters: ""We are very determined that we need a deal. We need a deal that allows us to continue to co-operate and to have a smooth and orderly exit and we'll make sure that we do.""
May's allies have said there is no 'plan B' that would break the parliamentary deadlock.
Hammond was speaking after Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders stepped up pressure on decision-makers to end months of uncertainty over the terms for Britain's departure.
The company, which employs 14,000 people in Britain and builds most of its commercial airplane wings there, has spent tens of millions of euros on contingency plans including extra stockpiling of parts in anticipation of border delays.
""What we and many other British businesses need most urgently, is for politicians from all sides to come together and pass a pragmatic agreement that allows an orderly Brexit,"" Enders said, with Hammond and other politicians in the audience.
""We don't see any specific benefits in the current deal. It's just a lot less bad than a 'no deal',"" he added.
A so-called 'hard Brexit' with no deal could have consequences for future Airbus investment in Britain, Enders said, reiterating previous warnings.
Responding to Enders' comments in a speech, Hammond said the government's job was to ensure ""that it will be business logic that keeps you here in the years ahead.""

Airbus is planning for a no-deal Brexit as its ""baseline"" scenario, according to a November staff memo.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 08:17PM ET</span>",Congressional Democrats zero in on latest Manafort-Russia revelation,"By Mark Hosenball and Nathan Layne
(Reuters) - Senior Democratic lawmakers called on Wednesday for further investigation into a revelation that in 2016 Donald Trump's then-presidential election campaign chairman gave polling data to a man U.S. prosecutors have linked to Russian intelligence.
On Tuesday, portions of a court filing by lawyers for convicted former Trump campaign head Paul Manafort were inadvertently made public. They showed he shared the data with a business partner and Russian-Ukrainian political operative Konstantin Kilimnik.
Patrick Boland, a spokesman for Representative Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee's new Democratic chairman, noted that Schiff had described the revelation as ""stunning"" to the Washington Post. He referred Reuters to Schiff's statement that lawmakers on the committee ""need to find out"" about Manafort's interaction with Kilimnik on polling data.
The office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller has charged Manafort and Kilimnik in its investigation of Russian interference in the election and whether Trump campaign members coordinated with Moscow officials. President Trump denies any campaign collusion with Russia.
Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been conducting a bi-partisan investigation into Russian election meddling, also called for further probing of the matter.
""If accurate, this is damning evidence of a senior Trump campaign official providing information to individuals tied to Russian intelligence at the height of the Kremlin's effort to undermine our election,"" Warner said. 
There is no evidence that Trump was aware that Manafort was sharing the data with Kilimnik, who was described by Mueller in court documents last year as having ""ties to a Russian intelligence service."" 
    Jackie Speier, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the revelations raised new questions about possible ""collusion"" between Trump's election team and Russia.
""It's a significant revelation that further makes the case for cooperation between the President's team and Russia on steering the outcome of the 2016 election,"" Speier told Reuters.
Tuesday's court filing was submitted by Manafort's lawyers in response to allegations that their client had lied repeatedly to Mueller, breaching a plea deal under which Manafort agreed to assist Mueller's probe.
Due to a formatting error the redacted portions of the filing as initially submitted could be electronically reversed, and an uncensored version was circulated by journalists and others on the Internet. It was later replaced with a properly redacted version.
In addition to the polling data revelation, the filing also showed that Mueller believes Manafort lied to prosecutors about his discussions with Kilimnik about a ""Ukrainian peace plan"" and a previously undisclosed meeting between Manafort and Kilimnik in Madrid. Manafort's lawyers said any incorrect statements by him were unintentional.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a former Trump campaign aide told Reuters that he was unaware Manafort had shared data with Kilimnik and found the news ""disturbing"" and especially problematic because the data was provided to a foreign national.
Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Trump who has repeatedly criticized the Mueller probe as a fruitless ""witch hunt"", dismissed the sharing of data with Kilimnik as inconsequential.
""It's not a crime to talk to a Russian,"" Giuliani said. ""They are searching for what doesn't exist. The president did not conspire with the Russians.""
Giuliani also said on Wednesday that Trump's legal team told Mueller that the president will not answer any more questions in the investigation.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 06:37PM ET</span>",President Trump will not answer any more questions from Mueller: Giuliani,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - Lawyers for U.S. President Donald Trump have told special counsel Robert Mueller that he will not answer any more questions in the probe of Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Reuters on Wednesday.
Trump submitted written answers to questions from Mueller in late November. In an interview with Reuters, Giuliani said Mueller raised the possibility of follow-up questions but that the president's outside legal team told the special counsel before Christmas that Trump would not respond.
Trump's lawyers and Mueller's team have had no contact since then, Giuliani said.
""As far as we're concerned, everything is over,"" Giuliani told Reuters. ""We weren't convinced they had any questions they don't know the answer to."" 
Giuliani said the ball was now in the special counsel's court. ""They could try to subpoena him if they want,"" he said. ""But they know we could fight that like hell.""
Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to try to help Trump win.
Trump has denied any collusion with Moscow and Russia has said it did not meddle in the election.
Mueller was appointed in May 2017 to investigate the Russian interference and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. It is unclear when the probe, which has clouded Trump's first two years in office, will end. 
Trump answered Mueller's campaign-related questions focused on Russia in November. However, Giuliani told Reuters at the time, he would not answer questions on whether he tried to obstruct the investigation once he won office, such as by firing former FBI Director James Comey. 
In his latest interview, the president's lawyer said it was time for the special counsel to issue his report. ""Put up or shut up,"" Giuliani said. ""We challenge you to do it."" 
When Mueller ends his investigation, he will send a report on his findings to the Justice Department. It is unclear if the report will be made public. 
Since at least last summer, Trump's legal team has been drafting a rebuttal in preparation for Mueller's report. Giuliani said the team also was ready to respond to legal issues raised by the hush money paid to an adult film star and a former Playboy playmate before the 2016 election.
Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen was sentenced last month to three years in prison for crimes including orchestrating the payments in violation of campaign finance laws. When he pleaded guilty, Cohen said he was directed by Trump.
""We have a memo from a number of campaign finance experts that paying what they call hush money, since it has a personal purpose, is not considered a campaign contribution,"" Giuliani said. ""Therefore it's not a violation of the campaign finance law.""
Giuliani said it is unclear to the legal team whether acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is now in charge of the investigation. 

Rosenstein, who is preparing to leave his job soon after attorney general nominee William Barr takes office, has overseen the Mueller probe since former Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself in 2017.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Venezuela's defense minister asked Maduro to resign: Washington Post,"(Reuters) - Venezuela's defense minister told socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down last month, and said he would offer his own resignation if he did not, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday, citing an anonymous U.S. intelligence official.
Both Maduro and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez are still in office. Maduro is set to be sworn in for a second six-year term on Thursday, though several countries in the region have warned him not to take office, calling his May 2018 re-election vote a sham.
Discontent within the military's ranks has grown as Venezuela's economic collapse has deepened, prompting millions to migrate. Security forces tortured dozens of military personnel accused of subversion last year, according to human rights groups, and detentions for desertion have increased.
A U.S. government source told Reuters the government believes reports that Padrino threatened to resign if Maduro did not depart are credible. 
""Nobody (in the U.S. government) would be surprised if (Padrino) stepped back,"" the source added.

Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

""We are all concerned about theft of intellectual property and Chinese telecoms companies that are being used by China for intelligence-gathering purposes,"" said a senior administration official who was briefed on the talks.
The Trump administration has taken a series of steps aimed at curbing market penetration by Huawei Technologies Cos Ltd [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp (HK:0763), two of China's biggest network equipment makers. Both companies have denied that their products are used to spy.
The administration does not want any obstacles to being able to share sensitive information with the Israelis, the senior official told reporters ahead of the meeting, referring to the concerns about Chinese technology and investment at the port of Haifa.
""We specifically put it on the agenda,"" the official said.
The Netanyahu government, frustrated by labor disputes that had disrupted Israel's trade arteries, gave the green light in 2013 for China’s Shanghai International Port Group to operate a private port in Haifa - a major berth for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.
In a possible sign of U.S. displeasure at the Chinese involvement in Haifa, one of the Sixth Fleet's warships in October docked in Israel's second-tier Mediterranean port of Ashdod, the fleet’s first such visit in almost 20 years. 
In December 2016 Huawei acquired Israel's HexaTier, whose technology secures databases in the cloud, for $42 million. This followed a visit to Israel by the Chinese technology giant's CEO. That same month it also acquired IT research firm Toga Networks for an undisclosed amount.
According to Israeli media, ZTE has shown interest in Israel's tech sector since sending a senior delegation to the country in 2013. 

Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported in 2016 that Israel has an undeclared policy of not using Huwaei or ZTE technologies, out of concern about possible security breaches.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 04:38PM ET</span>","New Brazil government riven by divisions, policy confusion","By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has stumbled out of the gate with infighting, policy flip-flops and confusion in his one-week-old government, raising concern among investors about his ability to carry out pressing fiscal reforms.
Divisions have quickly emerged between his political and economic teams over plans to overhaul a messy tax code and costly pension system to bring a high budget deficit under control.
Bolsonaro's comments in interviews and Twitter posts have also been at odds with senior aides, a red flag for investors who expected the government to arrive focused on a swift pension reform to shore up its finances before tackling an array of hot-button social issues and foreign policy proposals.
On Friday, for example, Bolsonaro told reporters he was increasing the tax on financial operations and cutting the highest income tax rate. That prompted a quick denial from an undersecretary to Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, with Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzoni later saying the president was mistaken.
The back-and-forth unsettled investors who had been pleased at the team of orthodox economists assembled by Guedes, many of whom are fellow alumni of the University of Chicago's free-market school of economics.
It put many in a wait-and-see mode, especially in debt markets, said Fabio Knijnik, head of Sao Paulo-based wealth fund K2 Capital. 
While many domestic investors remain bullish, foreigners with other options have been more cautious about Brazil.
""They are less likely to put money into a country where you have a finance secretary saying that what the president just said makes no sense,"" he said. ""We are not seeing this government's members marching to the same tune.""
Brazil's stock market has been one of the best performing in the world over the past six months, with the benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP) climbing 25 percent as Bolsonaro won election in October and appointed his market-friendly cabinet.
Brazil's currency (BRBY) and stocks extended a rally into the new year, but gains have slowed as questions mount.
On Wednesday, Bolsonaro celebrated a record high for the Bovespa. ""Optimism about the new Brazilian government is adding to the global scenario,"" he said on Twitter. 
POLITICS VS ECONOMICS
However, confusion about pension reform, which Knijnik called the keystone of the president's economic agenda, has some worried that the party might not last.
Bolsonaro proposed in an interview with the SBT television network that the new minimum retirement age would be 62 for men and 57 for women, higher than now but lower than ages proposed by the previous government.
Investors read that as a sign that he could water down the bill written by the prior government to limit the political costs, easing passage through Congress but requiring further legislation down the road.
Guedes has said he favors a tougher proposal that may be politically difficult but would make a larger and more lasting impact on public debt, which has soared to 77 percent of gross domestic product.
""The political and economic teams are at odds. There is a lack of cohesion and even coordination between President Bolsonaro's closest aides,"" said Leonardo Barreto, head of Brasilia-based political consultancy Factual.
Guedes is taking an all-or-nothing approach to fiscal reforms, while Lorenzoni has signaled he would make concessions to lawmakers to shore up political support, said Barreto.
The contradictions highlight broader tensions in Bolsonaro's government, which brings together statist former military officers, right-wing nationalists, the Chicago-trained economists and Christian evangelicals — all with different priorities.
Bolsonaro has already faced disagreement from the armed forces over his suggestion that Brazil could host a U.S. military base.
Investors fear the government will turn first to the social issues dear to Bolsonaro's conservative electoral base, burning political capital needed for the unpopular pension reform.
The farm and gun lobbies want Bolsonaro to move quickly to ease laws restricting the possession of firearms. Evangelical supporters want sex education, gender diversity and leftist political thinkers removed from the public school curriculum. 

""After they pass pension reform, then they can deal with all the ideological stuff they talk about, like girls wearing pink and boys blue,"" Knijnik said.

BAGHDAD/CAIRO (Reuters) - The U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria will not be scuppered despite Turkish threats against Washington's Kurdish allies there, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday, promising to ensure that the Kurds would still be protected.
Pompeo met leaders in Iraq's capital and its semi-autonomous Kurdistan region on Wednesday, aiming to reassure them about Washington's plans following President Donald Trump's surprise announcement last month of an abrupt withdrawal from Syria.
The unannounced visits to Baghdad and the Kurdish regional capital Erbil came on the second day of a Middle East tour also taking in Jordan, Egypt, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman.
Pompeo has the task of explaining U.S. policy in the region after Trump's announcement of the withdrawal of all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, which rattled allies and came as a shock to top U.S. officials. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis quit over it.
The U.S. forces have been working with a Kurdish militia to fight against Islamic State. The Kurds control a swath of northeastern Syria, Washington's foothold in a conflict that has drawn in Russia, Iran, Turkey and other regional powers.
Washington has repeatedly said its Kurdish allies will remain safe despite the withdrawal. But Turkey, which considers the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG militia an enemy, has repeatedly vowed to crush the group and repudiated any suggestion of protecting it once U.S. troops leave.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan denounced visiting U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton on Tuesday for suggesting that protecting the Kurds would be a pre-condition of the U.S. withdrawal, a suggestion Erdogan called ""a serious mistake"".
Asked in Erbil if Erdogan's pushback on the protection of the Kurds puts the withdrawal at risk, Pompeo told reporters: “No. We’re having conversations with them even as we speak about how we will effectuate this in a way that protects our forces...
""It's important that we do everything we can to make sure that those folks that fought with us are protected and Erdogan has made commitments, he understands that,"" Pompeo added.
SMOOTH OVER RELATIONS
The withdrawal of U.S. forces in Syria strengthens the hand both of Turkey and of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, which is backed by Russia and Iran. Pompeo has stressed throughout his trip to the region that Washington still aims to counter Iranian influence.
In Iraq, Pompeo also sought to smooth over relations after political leaders were angered when Trump visited U.S. troops on the day after Christmas at a remote desert air base without stopping in Baghdad or meeting any Iraqi officials.
Many politicians from the ruling coalition of mainly Shi'ite parties called Trump's visit a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and demanded the United States withdraw troops.
In Baghdad, Pompeo met Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Hakim, Speaker of Parliament Mohammed al-Halbousi and President Barham Salih.
President Salih, answering a reporter's question on whether he wants the United States to keep troops, said Iraq ""will need the support of the U.S."" and expressed his ""gratitude to the U.S. for support over the years"".
""ISIS is defeated militarily but the mission is not accomplished,"" Salih said, using an acronym for Islamic State.
The United States withdrew its troops from Iraq in 2011 eight years after an invasion to topple Saddam Hussein, but sent thousands back after Islamic State fighters swept into the north of the country in 2014. It now has around 5,200 there, and Trump has not announced plans to pull them out.
Islamic State militants are still waging insurgent attacks in the north of the country and trying to make a comeback, although they were driven from all towns and cities last year.
Asked on Tuesday about what would be discussed during a possible meeting with Pompeo, Abdul Mahdi said deepening Iraq's relationship with the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.

""He's an ally, he represents a friendly country,"" Abdul Mahdi said of Pompeo on Tuesday. ""We will raise those issues, and how to deal with regional issues altogether and deepen our economic and educational relations with the United States.""

Members of the so-called Group of Lima, which includes Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, said Maduro's new term would be illegitimate because the 2018 election that gave him a second term was not free or fair and that they would not recognize his leadership.
Venezuela ""has alerted very clearly to the governments of the Cartel of Lima that, if they do not rectify their position (...) we will take the most crude and energetic measures that can be taken in diplomacy,"" Maduro, using a pejorative name for the group widely used by ruling Socialist Party leaders.
He did not provide details what measures he could take.
Maduro called Peru's government ""ridiculous"" for announcing that it plans to prohibit Maduro and other high-ranking Venezuelan officials from entering its territory.
The May 2018 election was widely boycotted by the opposition, which described it as a farce that was rigged in his favor. Governments around the world also described it as illegitimate.

Maduro insists the election was fair and that the opposition did not participate because it knew it would lose. He accuses foreign governments including Latin American nations of seeking to overthrow him.

The New York Times reported on Monday that Michael White, a 46-year-old U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested while visiting Iran and had been held since July on unspecified charges.
Iran had not confirmed the arrest before the state news agency IRNA carried a statement by foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Wednesday, which did not specify when it had happened or what crime he was accused of.
Qassemi said Iran had informed the U.S. government about White's arrest within days of when he was taken into custody and denied that White had been poorly treated.
""These sorts of reports are lies and improper and are seriously rejected,"" IRNA quoted Qassemi as saying.
White's case is going through the legal process and officials will make a statement at the appropriate time, he added.
The case is likely to further worsen relations with the United States. President Donald Trump withdrew from an international agreement Iran's nuclear program and re-imposed sanctions last year that hit the Iranian economy hard.
Several Americans have been detained in Iran in recent years and Trump warned in 2017 that Tehran would face ""new and serious consequences"" unless all unjustly held U.S. citizens were freed.
White's mother, Joanne, told the New York Times her son had visited Iran ""five or six times"" to meet his Iranian girlfriend
She reported her son's disappearance after he failed to return in July but learned from the State Department only three weeks ago that he was being held in Iran.
London-based news website IranWire, which first reported White's arrest, quoted a former detainee, Ivar Farhadi, as saying he had been held at the same prison, Vakilabad, in Mashhad, northeastern Iran.
Farhadi told IranWire White's life was in danger because he was being kept in a prison with dangerous criminals.

Joanne White told the New York Times her son, a California resident, suffers acute asthma and had had chemotherapy and radiation treatment for a neck tumor.

(Reuters) - DNA evidence has cleared a former policeman accused of being the ""Golden State Killer,"" who terrified a swath of California with dozens of rapes and murders in the 1970s and 1980s, in one murder case from 1975 in which he was a suspect, prosecutors said.
More than three decades after the spate of killings and home invasions ended, investigators last year tracked down and arrested former police officer Joseph DeAngelo, 73, after comparing DNA found at crime scenes to data on commercial genealogy websites. So far they have charged him with 13 counts of murder and kidnapping from 1975 through 1986.
Investigators have ruled out DeAngelo as a suspect in the 1975 murder of 14-year-old Donna Jo Richmond based on DNA evidence, according to a press statement from the Tulare County District Attorney's office. Investigators are still seeking to determine whether he can be linked to other crimes from that time. 
Prosecutors are standing by the conviction of Oscar Clifton for murdering Richmond while she was riding her bike near Exeter, California, on Dec. 26, 1975. 
Clifton, who always maintained his innocence, was sentenced to life in prison and died in 2013. 
""We feel that Mr. Clifton received a fair trial and that the evidence more than sufficiently points to his guilt,"" Ward said in a televised statement on Tuesday.
DeAngelo has not yet entered a plea related to the charges he faces.
The District Attorney's conviction review report, reviewed by Reuters, said a DNA profile developed in 2011 from a sample found on Richmond's body does not match DeAngelo's genetic profile, clearing him of suspicion.
Neither Ward nor Tony Reid, a former lawyer for Clifton, immediately responded to a request for comment on Wednesday. 
DeAngelo was arrested in April and charged with 13 counts of murder and 13 counts of kidnapping, with ""special circumstance"" allegations making him eligible for capital punishment.

Detectives followed the family trees of close matches on the genealogy websites, seeking people who might be the killer. The process produced a promising lead in April, when the DNA of a relative pointed to DeAngelo based on his age and the fact that he lived near where the attacks occurred, the chief deputy district attorney for Sacramento County said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Italy and Poland should join forces to reshape Europe, Italy's far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Wednesday during a visit to Warsaw to drum up support for a eurosceptic alliance to contest May elections to the European Parliament.
The eurosceptic governments in Rome and Warsaw are both keen to repatriate some EU powers from Brussels to national capitals and hope like-minded parties will do well in the May elections, which will follow Britain's planned exit from the bloc in March.
""Poland and Italy will be part of the new spring of Europe, the renaissance of European values,"" he told a press conference with Poland's Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski.
Salvini's visit to Warsaw was initiated by Brudzinski, who said the two had discussed migration and EU border security.
Salvini has repeatedly railed against the EU and says the May elections are vital for creating a ""reformist"" bloc that can overhaul Brussels institutions from within.
Salvini, whose anti-immigrant League is the most popular party in Italy, said his talks on Wednesday with Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS), had gone well.
PiS has echoed the League's calls for Brussels to interfere less in the affairs of EU member states, though the parties are not currently allied in the European Parliament.
""At a party level, we have started a journey, a sharing of ideas, visions and projects for the future of the European Parliament that will, at long last, be profoundly different to what went before,"" Salvini said.
""We started a dialogue. To close a deal in half an hour seems overly optimistic,"" he added.
Salvini said he wanted to put together an alliance of like-minded EU parties that would campaign on a shared, 10-point program that has yet to be fully defined.
""We proposed a common program to be offered to other parties and peoples in Europe founded on certain themes, like (economic) growth, security, the family, Europe's Christian roots that some have denied,"" Salvini said.
At present, Salvini is allied to a small group of far-right parties such as Marine Le Pen's National Rally in France and the anti-Islam Freedom Party in the Netherlands. But he wants to extend its reach and draw in conservative groups like PiS.
Previous attempts by populist right-wing parties to form a eurosceptic alliance in the European Parliament have not been very successful as they often have different priorities or interests and show little appetite for compromise.
Despite its euroscepticism, PiS has recently been trying to mend fences with Brussels, agreeing to reverse a law criticized by the EU that had forced Polish Supreme Court judges into early retirement.

Salvini has also called for an end to EU sanctions against Russia, while Kaczynski and other Polish conservatives support them and are deeply distrustful of Moscow.

João Teixeira de Faria, known as ""John of God,"" was arrested in December, and faces accusations from dozens of women, who allege he sexually abused them while they were seeking spiritual guidance and treatment.
On Wednesday, Rosângela Rodrigues dos Santos, a judge in Abadiânia, the small town in central Brazil where Faria's spiritual center is located, accepted the charges brought against him by four women, and said he must face trial.
Prosecutors allege that Faria raped two of the women, and used fraudulent means to sexually abuse the other two. 
Faria, who became internationally famous when Winfrey broadcast a report on his psychic healing methods in 2013, has said he is innocent, and denied the accusations.
The first accusation was made on a TV Globo program in December by Dutch choreographer Zahira Maus, who said Faria sexually assaulted her. Globo TV spent three months investigating the story and interviewed a dozen other women who said they had been abused by the healer.
Faria's fame has been boosted by supposedly miraculous surgeries he claims to have performed with his hands and without anesthesia.
Winfrey said in a statement that she visited Faria's center in 2012 to explore his controversial healing methods for an episode of ""Oprah’s Next Chapter"" that aired the following year, she said.
""I empathize with the women now coming forward and hope justice is served,"" she said.
Prosecutors are still investigating other allegations against Faria, which could see the list of accusers grow. His lawyer, Alberto Zacharias Toron, said his client had not yet been notified of the court's decision.

""We're calm and believe justice will be served,"" he said.

Local media reported that at least 2,300 kilograms (5,070 pounds) of cocaine had been found. In an interview with local radio station ABC, Prosecutor General Roy Baidjnath Panday declined to confirm the exact amount, but said it was likely ""well above a thousand to at least two thousand"" kilograms.
""As far as the prosecutor's office remembers, the largest seizure ever had a weight of around 1,600 to just over 1,600 kilograms (3,527 lbs) of cocaine. So this is more than that,"" Baidjnath Panday said.
Local media also reported that a rice exporter in Suriname's western Nickerie district and a worker at a private company that helps companies deal with customs were arrested in connection with the case.
Suriname, a former Dutch colony with a population of less than 600,000, has long struggled with drug trafficking. Current President Desi Bouterse was convicted in absentia by a court in the Netherlands of drug trafficking in 1999. He denies the charges. 
In 2013, his son Dino was arrested in Panama on U.S. charges of importing more than five kgs (11 lbs) of cocaine into the United States. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison after admitting to drug trafficking and firearms charges, as well as trying to offer a home base to Lebanese paramilitary group Hezbollah.
Baidjnath Panday declined to say whether the record seizure was made with foreign cooperation.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The guns have mostly fallen silent around the Yemeni port of Hodeidah and the skies are clear of warplanes, but a U.N.-sponsored deal for the warring armies to quit the city has stalled, risking efforts to end a conflict that has pushed the country to the brink of famine.
The Iranian-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government agreed to a ceasefire in Hodeidah and to withdraw forces at peace talks in Sweden in December following months of diplomacy and Western pressure to end the nearly four-year-old war that has killed tens of thousands of people.
But the agreement did not spell out who would control Hodeidah city, which is now held by the Houthis while thousands of Saudi-led coalition troops are massed on the outskirts. Both sides were to withdraw their troops by Jan. 7 under the deal.
Sporadic skirmishes have taken place but the truce has put on hold an anticipated assault by the Saudi-led coalition that aid agencies feared would have terrible consequences for civilians.
The air strikes that had rained death and destruction on Hodeidah have also paused, although they have continued in other regions.
In New York on Wednesday, U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths told the United Nations Security Council that both sides had largely stuck to the ceasefire but substantial progress would be needed before more peace talks could be held.
""There has been a significant decrease in hostilities,"" he said.
Griffiths had met the rival leaders in recent days and he said both had expressed determination to find a way forward but all shared the view that ""substantial progress, particularly on Hodeidah, is something we would like to see before we reconvene the next consultations"".
The Stockholm pact had stipulated that Houthi forces leave Hodeidah port and two other ports and that international monitors be deployed. The monitors would then oversee a complete withdrawal of troops of both sides from the city, which would be run by ""local authorities"" under U.N. supervision.
""I am afraid that agreement did not spell out how to build that authority nor who will control what,"" a Western diplomat involved in the peace talks told Reuters.
The Houthis said late last month their fighters quit Hodeidah port and handed control to local coast guards units in place before the war. The Saudi-led coalition disputed the move, believing those units were loyal to the Houthis.
The Houthi withdrawal from the ports of Hodeidah, Saleef and Ras Isa would have been met with a retreat by coalition forces from the eastern outskirts of the city, where battles had raged before the ceasefire went into effect on Dec. 18.
Retired Dutch general Patrick Cammaert, head of the Redeployment Coordination Committee tasked with overseeing implementation of the deal, told U.N. chief Antonio Guterres and his envoy Griffiths it was not possible to verify the neutrality of the coast guards in position since the withdrawal of Houthi fighters, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Allegiances among Yemen's many factions have shifted several times during the conflict that pits the Houthis against the internationally recognized government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which was ousted from the capital Sanaa in 2014.
The Houthis control most urban centers in the Arabian Peninsula country. Hadi's government is based in the southern port of Aden and controls some western coastal towns.
AVERTING FAMINE
Disagreements over control of Hodeidah, the main entry point for the bulk of commercial imports and vital aid supplies to Yemen, have delayed the opening of humanitarian corridors needed to reach millions of Yemenis facing starvation.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are leading the Sunni Muslim Arab coalition that intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 to restore Hadi's government.
""Houthi manipulations threaten the Sweden agreement and the next steps in the political process,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs AnwarGargash tweeted on Wednesday.
Houthi spokesman Yahya Sarea said the United Nations must play a stronger role to avoid ""the other side taking advantage"".
Guterres has asked the U.N. Security Council to approve the deployment of up to 75 observers to Hodeidah for six months. The council will need to decide by about Jan. 20, when a 30-day authorization for an advance monitoring team expires.
""I don't think any country will send monitors before a full withdrawal of forces,"" one diplomat said.
Yemen descended into war after pro-democracy unrest forced late former president Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down. Hadi was elected to a two-year term to head a transitional government but the Houthis drove him into Saudi exile. The Houthis say they are waging a revolution against corruption.
The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Muslim Iran.

The Saudi-led coalition receives weapons and logistical support from the United States, Britain and other Western countries, but their involvement has come under increased scrutiny following the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul in October, and over the civilian toll from the air campaign.

The British government failed to win over its Northern Irish allies on Wednesday with the concession to give the province's assembly ""a strong role"" in any decision between triggering the backstop or extending a transition period if a future EU/UK relationship is not in place by December 2020.

""I don't think we can have a situation whereby the Northern Ireland executive or assembly has a veto power because that would essentially give one of the two communities veto power over the other,"" Varadkar told reporters on a visit to Ethiopia, adding that he had not yet had a chance to read the proposal.

Craig Mackinlay, 52, defeated Farage, the former head of the UKIP party, to win the parliamentary seat of South Thanet in southeastern England by 2,812 votes but was later accused of falsifying his expense returns.
Prosecutors said thousands of pounds of overspending was omitted from the returns which were ""woefully inaccurate, and deliberately so"".
Mackinlay was cleared of the charges by a jury at Southwark Crown Court but Conservative Party official Marion Little, 63, who the judge said described herself as a friend to May and other senior political figures, was found guilty of two counts of encouraging or assisting an offense.
""No one can know whether her misconduct had any effect on the outcome of that election, but she plainly intended that it would,"" Judge Andrew Edis said. 
She was sentenced to nine months in prison but this was suspended because her husband is seriously ill. 
In May 2017, prosecutors ruled out bringing more widespread criminal charges over allegations of expenses fraud by the Conservatives during the 2015 campaign which saw the party win power.

Mackinlay retained his seat in another national election in June 2017 with an increased majority of more than 6,000 votes as support for UKIP collapsed with Farage - who played a key role in securing Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in 2016 - no longer the party’s candidate.

VALLETTA (Reuters) - Forty-nine migrants disembarked in Malta on Wednesday after spending more than two weeks stranded on board rescue ships, ending a standoff in which European Union countries had refused to offer them a safe port. 
The agreement that ended the stalemate was brokered by the European Commission, and it calls for a total of some 300 migrants who have reached Malta in recent weeks to be redistributed between eight EU countries, including Italy. 
But Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, during a visit to Poland, has demanded a ""clarification"" within the government since the agreement was announced, a League source said, and he will meet with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and other ministers upon his return later on Wednesday.
""I am and remain absolutely against any new arrivals in Italy,"" Salvini said on Twitter. ""Caving to the pressures and threats of Europe and the non-governmental organizations is a sign of weakness that Italians don't deserve.""
The Sea-Watch 3, a vessel run by a German humanitarian group, plucked 32 people from an unsafe boat off the coast of Libya on Dec. 22. Another German charity, Sea-Eye, rescued 17 others on Dec. 29. 
They had both been sailing back in forth in Maltese waters for days after Italy, Malta and all other EU countries refused to offer them a port of safety.
Italy allowed rescue ships to dock regularly until June of last year when the new populist government took over and Salvini, who is also leader of the anti-immigration League party, closed the country's ports to humanitarian vessels.
Since then, the EU executive often has had to conduct lengthy negotiations with member states in order to share out new arrivals before the rescue ships are allowed to dock.
But on Wednesday Salvini said the deals made in the past are not being respected. EU partners said they would welcome 270 migrants after Italy agreed to allow them to disembark in Sicily in July, but only 129 had actually been taken in, he said. 
Malta, which had agreed to take 50, has so far accepted none, Salvini said.
The majority of the nearly 300 migrants now in Malta will be shared among Germany, France, Portugal, Ireland, Romania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Italy and Malta, Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said. The remainder, including 44 Bangladeshis, will be sent home, he added.

Over the last week, humanitarian groups had warned of growing physical and psychological distress among the migrants on the stranded boats, many of whom also suffered seasickness due to the rough seas.

""We have no fuel at all. People are tearing up clothes, burning plastic, whatever they can find to get warm,"" Abdallah Mokdeh said in the border town. 
""This is the worst we've seen in years."" 
Since 2011, more than a million Syrians have fled the war at home to Lebanon, where aid agencies say most live in severe poverty. Tens of thousands are in Arsal near the hills at the border with Syria.
""The roads are blocked. We called an ambulance and it did not come,"" said Mokdeh, a refugee who acts as a caretaker for the rows of tents pitched closely together on a patch of earth. 
Floods ruined mattresses and destroyed tents, forcing some people to move in with their neighbors. Many were sick or elderly. Some tents already housed three families, he said. 
""The snow, the cold have no mercy.""
Mahmoud Hakouk, a 60-year-old Syrian man at the same site, has struggled to stay dry. ""I need a blanket,"" he said, shivering. ""I swear to God I don't have enough to buy bread."" 
The U.N. refugee agency said high winds, rain and snow had ""heavily impacted"" more than 150 informal settlements, including some that were fully flooded or collapsed. A child was reported missing, it said on Wednesday. 
The heavy storm inundated hundreds of tented settlements across Lebanon and left youngsters stranded in freezing temperatures, charity Save the Children said. 
""It's miserable here, we have tents that collapsed because of the intense wind,"" said Radwan Raad, standing in the snow at another ramshackle camp in Arsal. 
Many of the camp's residents did not receive U.N. aid and could not afford food every day, he added. 

Helem Amer, 85, wrapped herself in a blanket in her flimsy shelter at that camp. ""I can't get up on my own, there's no fuel, nothing, nobody to help.""

There was no immediate reply from authorities in Bahrain contacted by Reuters.
It was the second time in less than a week that the United Nations has censured the kingdom after calling last Friday for the release of another activist and denouncing ""continued suppression of government critics"".
The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said three people were being held because of their kinship to Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, a human rights activist and government critic who now lives in Britain.
His brother-in-law Sayed Nazar Alwadaei, cousin Mahmood Marzooq Mansoor and mother-in-law Hajar Mansoor Hassan were ""deprived of their liberty, interrogated and prosecuted for their family ties with Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei and that these were acts of reprisals"".
The panel, composed of five independent experts, also found that there were grave ""violations of their right to a fair trial and due process"". It voiced concern at allegations of torture and mistreatment in custody.
""The Working Group considers that, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, the appropriate remedy would be to release Sayed Nazar Alwadaei, Mr. Mansoor and Ms. Hassan immediately and accord them an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law,"" it said.
Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, in a statement, said: ""It’s difficult for me to live freely when I know that others are imprisoned because of my actions. I just hope that this important decision influences the Bahraini authorities to end the torment of my family and grant their release."" 
He called for ""Bahrain’s powerful allies in the West"" including the United States, to apply the full weight of their authority behind the U.N. decision and cease their support.
The Sunni Muslim ruling Al Khalifa family has kept a lid on dissent in the Shi'ite-majority country since a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2011.

The ruling is part of what rights groups term the worst crackdown on activists since the military ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi five years ago.
Thousands of Islamist opponents, plus scores of liberal activists and journalists, have been jailed since his toppling. 
Douma, a leading figure in the pro-democracy revolt that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011, had previously been sentenced to three years' jail over separate charges of taking part in a 2013 demonstration in downtown Cairo.
The Cairo court on Wednesday also ordered Douma to pay six million Egyptian pounds ($336,0005) for damages he was accused of during the protest outside the prime minister's office in 2011. The sentence is subject to appeal within 60 days.
In delivering his verdict, the judge said Douma was part of a crowd that broke into parliament and damaged part of it, describing them as doing the work of the ""devil"", according to a text received by Reuters.
Like several other prominent activists in Egypt, Douma has been jailed under Mubarak, the subsequent ruling military council, Mursi and current President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

""The court announced a verdict against Ieng Cholsa which sentenced him to 3 years in prison and ordered him to pay five million riels ($1,250),"" Phnom Penh Municipal Court spokesman Y Rin said.
The Facebook posts, which the court found had insulted King Norodom Sihamoni, were uploaded in June last year, Y Rin said.
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The defendant could not be reached for comment and the court did not say whether he had a lawyer.
Cambodia's lese majeste law was unanimously adopted by parliament in February last year. Rights groups expressed concerns at the time that the law, which is similar to legislation in neighboring Thailand, could be used to silence government critics.
Last October, a court in the northern province of Siem Reap jailed a member of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) under the law.
The Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP in 2017 at the government's request after it was found guilty of plotting to take power with the help of the United States – an accusation the party and Washington have denied.

Prime Minister Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) won a general election in July last year which critics said was flawed because of a lack of a credible opposition, among other factors.

Javid Noori's body was turned over to his family on Tuesday and a Taliban statement said he was killed on Saturday.
Taliban and other Islamist insurgents have repeatedly targeted Afghan journalists, killing 15 in 2018, the deadliest year yet for the Afghan media, according to the media freedom group Reporters Without Borders. 
Farah provincial governor Shoaib Sabet said Noori was abducted from a bus along with 30 other passengers in a remote part of the province. ""(He) was a government employee but was working part-time as a journalist for local radio,"" Sabet said.

A defiant Bashir challenged his opponents to beat him at the ballot box and blamed unnamed foreign powers for provoking weeks of almost daily protests prompted by bread and currency shortages.
""(To) those who are seeking power, there is one way which is in the ballot box, through free and fair elections,"" said Bashir, who opened and closed his address dancing to patriotic music and waving his cane in the air.
Across the River Nile in Omdurman, witnesses said security forces used tear gas to break up a demonstration of more than 200 people, some of whom chanted: ""Freedom, freedom, peaceful against the thieves"". 
Witnesses said policemen chased demonstrators into side roads, from where they regrouped to resume their protest. Hundreds also blocked a main road, witnesses said.
Protests over rising bread prices and currency shortages began on Dec. 19 in the northern city of Atbara and soon spread and turned into demonstrations against Bashir.
A former army general who overthrew the elected government in 1989, Bashir has since repeatedly won elections which his opponents have challenged as neither fair nor free.
""MUTINY AND WAR""
On Wednesday, Bashir stood on an open-air stage in central Khartoum's Green Square (NYSE:SQ) and told his supporters that foreign enemies were trying to break Sudan.
""There was the war, mutiny and war ... They besieged us economically to make Sudan kneel down and they are trying to humiliate us with a small amount of wheat, petrol and dollars,"" Bashir said during the rally organized by his ruling party.
""But our pride is more valuable than the dollar,"" he told the crowd of flag-waving supporters.
Sudanese authorities say at least 19 people, including two security officers, have died in the protests. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say the toll is twice as high.
Sudan has slid deeper into economic crisis since the southern part of the country seceded after a referendum in 2011, taking away much of the country's oil resources.
The crisis has deepened further since last year, when the country saw some brief protests over bread shortages.

The United States lifted 20-year-old trade sanctions on Sudan in October 2017. But many investors have continued to shun a country still listed by Washington as a state sponsor of terrorism, whose president is wanted by the International Criminal Court over charges of masterminding genocide in Darfur - charges he dismisses.

Kurdish-led groups who control swathes of northern Syria have revived contacts with Damascus in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw troops from their region. These groups are keen to stave off any Turkish attack.
Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad's comments to journalists were the first on the talks with the Kurds, who are calling on Damascus to deploy troops at the border with Turkey. 
Asked whether progress had been made, Mekdad said: ""I feel that we must always be optimistic. The past experiences were not encouraging. But now matters are reaching their conclusion.""
He signaled approval of recent statements by Kurdish groups affirming they are part of the Syrian state and nation, saying ""the conditions"" were favorable for them return to the state.
""Therefore I am always optimistic ... we encourage these political groups to be sincere in dialogue that is happening now between the Syrian state and these groups, taking into account that there is no alternative to that,"" he told a small group of journalists including Reuters.
A top Syrian Kurdish politician told Reuters last week that the Kurdish groups had presented a ""road map"" for a deal with Damascus during recent meetings at the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow.
If such a deal could be agreed, it would piece back together the two biggest chunks of a country splintered by eight years of war and leave one corner of the northwest in the hands of anti-Assad rebels backed by Turkey.
The immediate priority for the Kurdish-led authorities of northern Syria is to find a way to shield the region from Turkey, which views the Kurdish YPG militia as a national security threat.
Turkey has already sent its army into Syria twice to push back the YPG. But it has held off attacking the large Kurdish-controlled area of the northeast where U.S. forces operate.

Mekdad said he was certain all ""foreign forces"" would withdraw from Syria.

The move underscores the challenge faced by Les Republicains (LR) as the party tries to recover from President Emmanuel Macron's huge 2017 election win in the National Assembly and carve out its turf on a fragmented right. 
Macron took votes from the center-right, forcing the now LR leader Laurent Wauquiez further right as he seeks to regain momentum ahead of May's European elections. 
""Marine Le Pen represents the only true alternative to Macron,"" Thierry Mariani, who served as transport minister between 2010 and 2012, told Le Parisien newspaper.
Les Republicains have become more closely aligned to the far-right Rassemblement National (RN), formerly Le Front National, on issues such as immigration and law and order. That has bolstered the appeal of Le Pen to some on the fringe of the mainstream party while also alienating more moderate figures. 
Former prime minister Alain Juppe distanced himself from the party last week by not renewing his membership. He said he believed it was Macron who was going in the right direction. 
Defecting alongside Mariani was former conservative lawmaker Jean-Paul Garraud. The far-right presented both on Wednesday as candidates to run on its ticket in May's European election. 
Opinion polls place Le Pen's party at about 21 percent, ahead of Macron's Republique En Marche (LREM) party in voting intentions for the European Parliament elections. LR, led by Laurent Wauquiez, are further back at about 13 percent.

""Those who are pro-sovereignty, those opposed to the excesses of immigration, are today choosing the nationalists amid the current division between the nationalists and the globalists,"" le Pen told Radio Classique.

Zarif, who is in New Delhi on a bilateral visit, also told Reuters that leaving a 2015 nuclear deal agreed with world powers is an option available with Tehran but is not the only option on the table. 
The United States earlier this month issued a pre-emptive warning to Iran against pursuing three planned space rocket launches that it said would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution because they use ballistic missile technology.
Under the U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which enshrined the nuclear deal in 2015, Iran is ""called upon"" to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years.
Iran has ruled out negotiations with Washington over its military capabilities, particularly the missile program run by the Revolutionary Guards. It says the program is purely defensive and denies missiles are capable of being tipped with nuclear warheads.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement on Iran's nuclear program in May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. He said the deal was flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran's development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.

They said the man had attended a probation meeting on Thursday in the same building as the prosecutors.
He is charged with having entered the office of the prosecutors' medical expert and taken the hard disc backing up the expert's computer, along with various other items. The back-up included information on the autopsies of the victims of the Brussels bombings in March 2016, which killed 32 people.

33,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 08:35AM ET</span>","France, Germany approve extension of reconciliation treaty to shore up EU","BERLIN (Reuters) - France and Germany have agreed to deepen a 1963 treaty of post-war reconciliation in a bid to show that the European Union's main axis remains strong and counter growing euroskeptic nationalism among some other members.
The extension to the Elysee Treaty approved by the German and French cabinets will be signed by Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in the German border city of Aachen, an ancient symbol of European concord, on Jan. 22. 
""Both states will deepen their cooperation in foreign affairs, defence, external and internal security and development and at the same time work on strengthening the ability of Europe to act independently,"" states the treaty text, seen by Reuters.
In Paris, Macron's office said the Elysee Treaty extension would help both European powers tackle ""the challenges they will be confronted with in the 21st century"".
""(We) envisage deepening our engagement in favour of security and prosperity of our peoples in the framework of a more sovereign, united and democratic Europe,"" it said.
The document, negotiated over the past year though short on details, stipulates that it will be a priority of German-French diplomacy for Germany to be accepted as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. 
Germany has for years sought greater influence within the international body, to which its closest allies the United States, Britain and France belong.
While making clear that Germany and France remain committed to the EU and NATO defense alliance, the agreement also signals that Berlin and Paris will combat efforts by some nationalist politicians in Europe to erode the 28-nation EU. 
On Wednesday, Italian far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said he wanted his country and Poland to join forces to reshape Europe in his quest for a euroskeptic alliance ahead of the European Parliament elections in May.
""Germany and France are making clear that to solve future questions, we need more, not less cooperation,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said.
Facing new challenges from U.S. President Donald Trump in the United States as well as EU governments in Italy, Poland and Hungary, Merkel and Macron are keen to head off any breakthrough for euroskeptic parties in the European Parliament vote.
The treaty further outlines closer cooperation between national intelligence services and police in fighting terrorism and organized crime, and a commitment to moving toward economic convergence. 
""Both states will deepen the integration of their economies towards a German-French economic area with common rules,"" said the treaty text, referring also to calls for the harmonization of economic law. In addition, they will set up a panel of experts to give economic recommendations to each government.
Other areas of cooperation include culture, health, innovation and transport.

35,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 08:05AM ET</span>","Dutch teachers, lecturers to hold first ever all-out strike in March","AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch teachers and lecturers at all levels will hold their first ever joint strike on March 15 to press demands for wage hikes and better working conditions, labor unions said on Wednesday.
The looming walkout reflects growing frustration across the workforce in the Netherlands, with employees in many sectors feeling left behind by strong economic growth that has not been matched by wage increases.
The March 15 stoppage is expected to shut schools and universities, and follows similar walkouts by primary school teachers in October and December 2017.
""Basically every teacher, at every level, says the workload is too high,"" spokeswoman Simone van Geest of teachers union AOB said. ""There is a huge shortage of teachers at both primary and secondary level and wages are simply too low.""
The teachers are calling for an increase of 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion) to the government's annual 30-billion-euro education budget, with over half of the extra money going to primary and secondary schools.
For wage rises, the unions are seeking 1.1 billion euros this year, increasing to almost 2 billion in 2022.
Primary and secondary school teachers currently earn 2,500-4,000 euros per month before taxes.
""We have announced this strike early to give teachers, schools and pupils ample time to organize,"" Van Geest said. ""We don't expect the government to come up with a last-minute effort to prevent it.""
In response, Michiel Hendrikx, spokesman for the Education Ministry in the centre-right governing coalition, said the education sector was ""already the recipient of the largest part of this government's extra investments"".He declined specific comment on the strike warning. 
In 2017, the Dutch government promised primary schools 700 million euros in extra funds through 2021, though teachers at the time already said they needed double that amount to cover wage increases and pay for extra classroom assistance.
Primary school teachers continued a series of smaller work stoppages last year, joined by university staff in September, who demand more than 1 billion euros in extra investment to improve their working conditions.

The Netherlands has been one of Europe's top economic performers, with growth hitting decade-highs of around 3 percent in the last two years, but real disposable incomes have hardly budged since the turn of the century.

Under the gag order described as a security precaution, media in Israel were barred from naming the country that Shin Bet chief Nadav Argaman, addressing a by-invitation audience at Tel Aviv University on Monday, said was trying to interfere. 
Israeli newspaper commentators speculated that he had pointed the finger at Russia, which Netanyahu's own intelligence minister, Israel Katz, told local media last month could potentially want to replicate in Israel an alleged online influence campaign and email hacking to help Donald Trump win the U.S. ballot in 2016.
Russia has denied any such interference. Netanyahu, asked by reporters about the Argaman flap, offered a general reassurance.
""Israel is braced to foil cyber interference. We are ready for any scenario. There is no country better prepared than us,"" he said.
The censor's edict, newspaper commentators said, appeared to be an attempt to avoid friction with Russia, the main backer of Syria, where Israel has carried out dozens of air strikes on suspected Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla targets.
In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""Russia has not interfered, does not interfere and doesn't intend to interfere in any election in any country in the world.""

The fourth-term Netanyahu, who enjoys a rapport with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, leads the polls.

37,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Bollywood film on former PM stirs controversy before Indian election,"By Shilpa Jamkhandikar
MUMBAI (Reuters) - A film that casts opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and his family in an unflattering light ahead of a national election later this year has kicked up a controversy ahead of its release on Friday.
Commentators on social media and television news programs have taken swipes at the makers of ""The Accidental Prime Minister"" for pursuing a political agenda, while a spokesman for the Gandhi's Congress Party has derided it as ""propaganda"".
Based on a 2014 book of the same name, the Bollywood movie is billed as a chronicle of Manmohan Singh's ten-year premiership, as narrated by his former media advisor Sanjaya Baru.
Singh, a distinguished economist often credited for the country’s liberalization push in the 1990’s, became prime minister in 2004, after Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Rahul's mother, led her party to a surprise election victory, but then stunned the country by nominating Singh for the premiership.
Trailers for the movie include scenes showing the Gandhis telling the mild-mannered Singh what to do, providing political ammunition for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party as it girds for a harder than expected battle to win a second term at an election that must be called by May.
The BJP's official Twitter handle tweeted a link to the trailer, calling the film ""a riveting tale of how a family held the country to ransom for 10 long years.""
Rahul Gandhi's father, grandmother and great-grandfather were all prime ministers of India, and the BJP habitually targets the dynasty.
The trailer has garnered more than 63 million views on YouTube. In one scene, Singh's wife is shown asking her forlorn husband: ""How much more will the party insult you? Why can’t you say something? 
Singh, now 86 years old, could not be reached immediately by Reuters for comment.
Anupam Kher, the actor who plays Singh, has been an ardent Modi supporter and his wife is a national lawmaker for the BJP. Akshaye Khanna, who plays Baru's character in the film, is the son of Vinod Khanna, a film actor who was also a BJP lawmaker.
Kher told Reuters that he didn't want to discuss political views ""because whatever I say will not satisfy those who raise objections.""
But the coming elections left suspicions over the timing of the film's release. 
Fellow Bollywood actor Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub tweeted ""why don’t you just postpone the release till July, if it is just a pure piece of cinema and nothing more?”

The warning came as Chinese and U.S. trade teams ended talks in Beijing that have raised hopes an all-out trade war could be avoided, but fears remain that strategic tension between two countries are growing.
""Both countries warships definitely have to come into close proximity and it's easy for there to be a misunderstanding or an error of judgment, even a collision,"" Zhang Junshe, a researcher at China's PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute, told reporters.
""If there is a collision, the root cause is the United States.""
On Monday a U.S. guided-missile destroyer sailed near disputed islands the South China Sea in what China called a ""provocation"", just as the trade talks began. 
Zhang said whenever U.S. warships entered waters that China claimed, China had no option but to send warships to deal with them.
Since Trump took office, there have been 14 incidents of U.S. Navy vessel entering waters that China claims to carry out what the U.S. military calls freedom of navigation operations, Zhang said.
China claims almost all of the South China Sea and denounces the United States and its allies over naval operations near Chinese-occupied islands.
Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan have competing claims in the region.
He Lei, former vice president of China's Academy of Military Sciences, said ""foreign forces"" that attempted to prevent the unification of China and Taiwan could compel Beijing to use force to bring the self-ruled island under its control.
""Foreign forces that pose as world police to interfere in China's affairs, to obstruct and damage China's unification, are the main culprits that could force the mainland to use force to resolve the Taiwan issue,"" he told reporters.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which reaffirms the U.S. commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales.
Chinese President Xi Jinping on Jan. 2 said nobody could change the fact Taiwan was part of China.

Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun arrived in Bangkok on Saturday appealing for asylum. Australia said on Tuesday it would consider resettling her if the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) deemed her a refugee.
""The UNHCR has referred Ms Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun to Australia for consideration for refugee resettlement,"" Australia's Department of Homeland Security said in an email on Wednesday.
The department said it would consider the referral ""in the usual way, as it does with all UNHCR referrals"". It declined to comment further.
The UNHCR office in Thailand also declined to comment.
Qunun has refused to meet her father and brother who flew to Bangkok this week, Thai immigration chief Surachate Hakparn said.
""He wanted to make sure that his daughter was safe... he told me that he wanted to take her home,"" he said, adding that her father denied Qunun's allegation that her family was abusing her physically and emotionally.
Surachate added that Qunan's father would remain in Thailand, under the care of the Saudi Arabian embassy, until it is clear where Qunun will receive asylum.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne is due in Bangkok on Thursday for a visit arranged earlier, during which she will discuss the case of Bahrain footballer Hakeem AlAraibi, who has refugee status in Australia but is in jail in Thailand.
Qunun was initially denied entry to Thailand when she arrived on Saturday. She soon started posting messages on Twitter from the transit area of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport saying she had ""escaped Kuwait"" and her life would be in danger if forced to return to Saudi Arabia.
Within hours, a campaign sprang up on Twitter, spread by a loose network of activists around the world, prompting the Thai government to reverse a decision to force the young woman onto a plane that would return her to her family.
Qunun's case has drawn global attention to Saudi Arabia's strict social rules, including a requirement that women have the permission of a male ""guardian"" to travel, which rights groups say can trap women and girls as prisoners of abusive families.
It comes at a time when Riyadh is facing unusually intense scrutiny from its Western allies over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October and over the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen.
Thai authorities arrested and charged AlAraibi, a Bahraini footballer who has a refugee status in Australia, late last year.
Bahrain made a request to have him extradited and he is in jail, waiting for a hearing to decide his case.
""AlAraibi was granted permanent residency by the Australian government in recognition of his status as a refugee,"" Payne said in a statement, saying that she would seek his safe return to Australia.
Rights group Amnesty International said Thai authorities should ""show humanity"" to AlAraibi the same way they had to Qunun.
""We welcome the leadership shown by the Thai authorities in Rahaf’s case,"" the group's Middle East director of campaigns, Samah Hadid, said in a statement.
""No person should be deported to a country where they are at risk of serious human rights violations ... the humanity shown to Rahaf must not be a one-off.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's parliament will pass a landmark bill on Wednesday reserving 10 percent of government jobs for the less well-off, a move criticized by some political analysts as a pre-election ""gimmick"" amid high unemployment rates in the country.
Joblessness in the world's second most populous country shot up to a 15-month high last month, data from independent think-tank the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) showed, underlining the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's bid to retain power in a general election due by May.
The data also showed that India lost as many as 11 million jobs last year with around 83 percent in rural areas, as operational costs surged for small businesses since the launch of a national sales tax in 2017 and an earlier ban on high value currency notes.
Under the bill to amend the constitution, floated by Modi's party days after losing power in three heartland states and ahead of a national election, recipients must be classed as ""economically weak"". Only people with an annual income below 800,000 rupees ($11,354) and owning fewer than five acres of land will be eligible.
The lower house of parliament has already passed the bill while almost all political parties have voiced their support for it in the upper house, meaning its approval was a formality.
India already has job and education quotas for socially backward classes but this is the first time upper caste Hindus and people from other religions will benefit from any affirmative action.
""There is no food but every hungry man is handed an empty plate, that's what Modi government is doing with the youth of India,"" Shahid Siddiqui, a political analyst and a former lawmaker, said on Twitter. ""There are no jobs, but 10 percent reservation in the line of unemployed.""
Derek O'Brien, a lawmaker from the opposition All India Trinamool Congress, said the bill was ""an acknowledgement of guilt, that we haven't created any jobs in last four and a half years"".
But Modi said the bill ""sets into motion the process to achieve an effective measure that ensures justice for all sections of society"".

Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the government would consider toughening laws that ban the use of drones near airports but that operators could also invest more in protection systems.
Departures from Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, were halted for an hour on Tuesday evening after a drone was sighted, raising fears that operations could face the serious levels of disruption that hit London's Gatwick last month.
""Clearly, the government is looking at the law to see whether there are ways in which it could be strengthened,"" Lidington told  ITV  (LON:ITV). 
""What I think the airports themselves have to do is step up and do more of is investment in technology to both detect and then stop drones from flying.""
Gatwick Airport said it had upgraded its systems after it was targeted for three days in the run-up to Christmas.
""Several million pounds has been invested by Gatwick with the aim of ensuring the airport is equipped to the level provided by the Armed Forces during the recent illegal and unprecedented drone activity,"" a spokesman said. 
""Safety remains our number one priority, and we have extensive measures and equipment in place at Gatwick now which provide the same level of reassurance going forward.""
Heathrow said it was working with authorities to keep the airport secure. 
""The use of drones around airports is illegal and dangerous and we continue to work closely with the Met Police on their ongoing investigations,"" a spokeswoman said. 
""We apologise to those passengers whose journeys were unfairly affected yesterday and together with authorities, will continue to monitor our airspace.""
She declined to comment further on Lidington's assertion that airport operators should invest more.
London's Metropolitan Police said military assistance had been provided to help it deal with the incident at Heathrow. 
""We are deploying significant resources - both in terms of officers and equipment - to monitor the airspace around Heathrow and to quickly detect and disrupt any illegal drone activity; some of which are as a result of learning from the incidents at Gatwick,"" Commander Stuart Cundy said.

U.S. President Donald Trump last year pulled out of an international pact on Iran's nuclear program and re-imposed sanctions intended to scupper Tehran's oil exports, curb its missile program and clip its regional influence. 
The measures have hit Iran's economy hard.

Iran's economy has faced instability in recent months with the rial fluctuating in value, making it difficult for ordinary people to make ends meet. 
Sporadic protests linked to the tough economic situation have been led by truck drivers, farmers, workers, merchants and teachers, occasionally resulting in violent confrontations with security forces.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah said on Wednesday that the Taliban's refusal to involve the government in peace talks means the end to a conflict that has lasted 17 years can only remain a dream.
Abdullah's remarks came a day after the Taliban called off a fourth round of talks with U.S. officials in Qatar, due to start this week, over disagreements about the involvement of Afghan officials, a possible ceasefire and prisoner exchange.
Efforts for a negotiated settlement have gathered pace in recent weeks, even as reports that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to withdraw thousands of U.S. troops triggered uncertainty.
The United States is pressing Taliban leaders to sit down with Afghan government officials but the Taliban see the United States as the main power and dismiss the Kabul administration as a puppet.
""In any peace deal in which the rights of our citizens, that have been gained with a lot of sacrifices, are not respected, the deal is a dream and will never happen,"" Abdullah told gathering in Kabul, commemorating the 15th anniversary of the constitution.
""Today the talk about the withdrawal of foreign forces is an excuse for continuation of war and gaining more opportunities.""
A Taliban leader told Reuters that the talks, which would have been the fourth round with U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, would have focused on a U.S. withdrawal, prisoner exchange and the lifting of a ban on movement of Taliban leaders.
Taliban sources said that they had demanded that U.S. authorities release 25,000 prisoners and that they would free 3,000, but that U.S. officials were not keen to discuss the exchange.
The war in Afghanistan is America's longest overseas military intervention. It has cost Washington nearly $1 trillion and killed tens of thousands of people.
""NO CHANGE IN TALIBAN""
Abdullah, who shares power with President Ashraf Ghani after a U.S.-brokered political deal in 2014 that led to formation of a coalition government, said the Taliban have not changed since their austere regime was toppled by U.S.-led forces in 2001.
""We haven't seen any change in the Taliban so far and that country that supports them, has not unfortunately changed its policies toward us either,"" said Abdullah, referring to neighbouring Pakistan which Kabul accuses of harbouring Taliban leaders.
Pakistan denies the charge and says it is encouraging the Taliban to talk directly with the Afghan government. 
A senior Afghan government official said the talks also would have involved discussion about the formation of an interim administration known as the ""peace government"" after U.S. forces announce a withdrawal and the Taliban accept a ceasefire.
The peace government would bring all warring parties under one administration until the Taliban are fully integrated and election are held.
But Ghani has strongly opposed any interim government. 
Abdullah called on Afghans to support the current administration instead. 
""They say they are not the Taliban of the past and they have learnt lessons and are in favour of an inclusive government, but they instead go and talk to some individuals and call them elders which is against our national interest,"" Abdullah said, referring to political figures.
""They do this to show that the government is either weak or does not exist,"" he added. 
The impasse over the talks comes as Afghanistan prepares to hold presidential elections in July with many Afghans believing the vote may be cancelled if a peace deal is reached with the Taliban. 
Presidential candidates, including Ghani who seeks a second five-year term, have not officially announced they are running as coalition-building among leaders of various ethnic groups debated whom to support. 
The United States sent troops to Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. At its peak the U.S. deployment involved more than 100,000 troops, but Washington withdrew most in 2014 and now has around 14,000 troops in the country as part of a NATO-led mission aiding Afghan security forces and hunting militants.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on a visit to India on Wednesday that the Taliban must have a role in Afghanistan in future, but not a dominant role.

Soldiers raided the Daily Trust's offices in the capital Abuja on Sunday in an operation that the Committee to Protect Journalists said showed ""a dearth of respect for press freedom"" a month before elections.
Soldiers also shut down the newspaper's bureau in the northeastern city of Maiduguri where they detained regional editor Uthman Abubakar. The military later said the article had ""divulged classified military information"" and the action was meant to show the seriousness of the breach.
Islamist militants have stepped up attacks in the northeast in recent months, piling pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari, who came to power in 2015 promising to crush the insurgency and faces fresh elections on Feb. 16. 
The military has complained in the past about critical coverage of its fight against the militants from the Boko Haram separatist group, and their more lethal offshoot Islamic State West Africa. But it had stopped short of arresting reporters. 
Abubakar was brought back to the paper's Maiduguri office and released without charge on Tuesday, the Daily Trust said in an article. The bureau was reopened a day earlier.
The regional editor said he was ""courteously treated"" but ""his mobile phones and laptop were still with the military as the authorities said they needed time to finish the forensic checks being carried out on the equipment,"" the paper said.
Its chief operating officer, Mannir Dan Ali, called the arrests ""totally uncalled for and condemnable,"" in interviews on local media. 
The military did not immediately comment on the release.
The government's chief spokesman, Lai Mohammed, said on Tuesday that while authorities ""are not about to gag the press,"" the media ""must exercise greater restraint"" reporting on the northeast insurgency.
Some publications were ""demoralising the military and strengthening the insurgents,"" he said, without providing details.

A second Daily Trust journalist detained in Maiduguri was released eight hours after the raid.

Lawmakers from the governing Conservative Party and opposition Labour Party have put forward a so-called amendment in parliament which would force it to offer alternatives to her deal in three days rather than the planned 21 days.
Some local media and lawmakers quoted sources as saying the speaker of parliament had accepted the amendment, meaning it would be voted on. The office of speaker John Bercow declined to confirm that he had accepted the amendment.
By reducing the timeframe for the government to come up with alternatives to the proposed deal, it puts additional pressure on May, who looks set to lose the vote on Tuesday in a move that would cast her Brexit plans into deeper uncertainty.
Parliament restarts a debate on her deal later on Wednesday after May pulled an earlier vote in December after acknowledging she looked set to be defeated. 
First, lawmakers have to approve the so-called business motion, which sets out the procedure for the debate and vote on May's deal. It is this motion that the lawmakers are seeking to amend.

Labour's Brexit policy chief, Keir Starmer, said: ""If the prime minister's Brexit deal is rejected, parliament must decide what happens next. This amendment has Labour's full support.""

Operations were headed by a Tunisian man who used his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account to spread Islamic State (IS) propaganda, they said. He remains at large and is wanted for inciting terrorism. 
The paramilitary Carabinieri's early morning sweep netted two Italians, with the rest mainly Tunisian.
As well as the IS promoter, six others, again mainly Tunisian, are sought for arrest on suspicion of people smuggling and trafficking in illegal cigarettes.
The group was ""a real and concrete threat to national security because it was able to offer many irregular migrants a secret sea passage that was safe and fast,"" the arrest warrant said.
The route to Sicily ""was particularly attractive to subjects sought by Tunisian law enforcement for past crimes or because suspected to be connected to religiously motivated terrorist groups,"" it added.
The investigation began in 2016 after a Tunisian man held in an Italian prison offered information saying he wanted to protect Italy from ""an army of kamikazes"", the warrant said.
Using speed boats, the smugglers reached the southwest coast of Sicily within three-and-a-half hours carrying a handful of migrants and often other contraband, like cigarettes or hashish, according to testimony from the turncoat.
Police documented five smuggling trips, but many others are suspected to have taken place, one investigator said, because they were discussed in intercepted telephone conversations.

U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad has held three rounds of talks with the Taliban, but on Tuesday, the militants canceled a fourth round, which had been due in Qatar this week.
The militants said they called off the talks because of an ""agenda disagreement"", especially over the involvement of officials from the Western-backed Afghan government as well as a possible ceasefire.
Largely Shi'ite Muslim Iran has long been wary of the Sunni Muslim Taliban.
But Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on a visit to India that Iran has had intelligence contacts with the Taliban because it needed to secure border areas controlled by the Taliban on the Afghan side.
""I think it would be impossible to have a future Afghanistan without any role for the Taliban,"" Zarif, who is in New Delhi for talks with Indian leaders, told NDTV in an interview. 
""But we also believe that the Taliban should not have a dominant role in Afghanistan.""
The Taliban, who are fighting to oust all foreign forces and defeat the government, want to re-impose strict Islamic law in Afghanistan after their 2001 ouster by U.S.-led troops.
Zarif said it was up to Afghans to decide what role the Taliban should have but Afghanistan's neighbors would not want them to be in overall control.
""Nobody in the region believes that a Taliban dominated Afghanistan is in the security interests of the region. I believe that is almost a consensus.""
A Taliban source speaking about the canceled talks told Reuters that U.S. officials had insisted that the Taliban should meet Afghan officials in Qatar and said ""both sides were in disagreement over declaring a ceasefire in 2019"".

The Taliban have rejected repeated requests from regional powers to allow Afghan officials to take part in the talks, insisting that the United States is their main adversary.

Gonen Segev, energy minister from 1995 to 1996, was indicted in June. The Shin Bet internal security service said at the time had been recruited by Iranian intelligence while living in Nigeria and had ""served as an agent"".
Investigators found that Segev made contact with officials at the Iranian embassy in Nigeria in 2012 and that he visited Iran twice for meetings with his handlers, the Shin Bet said.
Segev, it said, received an encrypted communications system from Iranian agents and supplied Iran with ""information related to the energy sector, security sites in Israel and officials in political and security institutions"".
Israel has long been locked in a shadow war with Iran, which supports Islamist guerrillas in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Iran has accused Israel of being behind acts of sabotage and assassinations of scientists involved in its nuclear program. 
The court has yet to formally approve the prison sentence agreed with Segev, a physician, who had been jailed in 2004 for attempting to smuggle ""Ecstasy"" pills into Israel and left the country in 2007 after his release from prison.
He was arrested in May during a visit to Equatorial Guinea and extradited to Israel, Shin Bet said.

There was no immediate response from Iran to the Justice Ministry statement.

Since Ibrahim Mohamed Solih beat Abdulla Yameen in a surprise election result last year his administration has been trying to determine the extent of Chinese loans used to fund a construction boom in the Maldives.
In a statement late on Tuesday, Solih's office asked the public to submit written complaints about ""cases of corruption and abuse of power within state institutions"", over a period of nearly six years from Jan. 1, 2012.
Critics have said contracts were given to Chinese companies at inflated prices, for example one relating to as a bridge linking the capital Male to the main airport of the palm-fringed islands famous for their luxury diving resorts.
Yameen has denied any wrongdoing, saying he took on loans to accelerate economic development. The investigation also covers the final two years of the term of his predecessor, Mohammed Waheed, when the government took a $500-million Chinese loan for infrastructure and housing.
""Corruption was institutionalized under Yameen's tenure,"" Hamid Abdul Gaffoor, a spokesman for Solih's Maldivian Democratic Party, told Reuters. ""Some state institutions were totally looted."" 
China has been building ports, highways and power stations as part of its giant Belt and Road Initiative to boost trade and transport links across Asia and beyond. 

But some of its projects are being criticized for high costs, lack of transparency and expensive loans, stoking fears the arrangement could push small countries, such as the Maldives and Sri Lanka, into a debt trap.

The new image of Morrison with his wife and two children was meant to be his new official photograph for his personal website. However, his staff, keen to remove the prime minister's scruffy shoes, Photoshopped him with two left feet.
The mistake was widely mocked on social media.
A spokesman for the prime minister said the picture was changed by staff without Morrison's knowledge or authorization.
Morrison took to Twitter in a bid to limit the damage, joking that staff could instead have improved his thinning hairline.
Analysts said the incident was a blow to the government's re-election campaign, with Morrison's Liberal-National coalition badly trailing the Labor opposition in opinion polls and on course for a heavy defeat in polls due by May.
""To be re-elected, Morrison needs everything to go right and ridicule is the absolute last thing he needs,"" said Haydon Manning, professor of politics at Flinders University in South Australia.
Morrison has yet to confirm the date of the election. He 
became Australia's sixth different leader in less than 10 years late last year and has seen his standing with voters hampered by a series of missteps.
Desperate to focus national attention on the healthy state of Australia's economy, Morrison has moved to clear his legislative agenda of any more potential pitfalls.

He will accelerate his re-election campaign in April when his government delivers its annual budget, which many expect to include tax cuts.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Police in Australia are investigating suspicious packages sent to a wide range of embassies and consulates on Wednesday, which officials said included the U.S. and British missions in Melbourne, but there were no reports of harm to staff.
Domestic media reported more than a dozen foreign offices received the packages and that some staff said they contained asbestos, a material used in building that can cause cancers and other health problems. 
There were no details of any possible motive and some of the targeted sites that Reuters reporters visited were open later on Wednesday afternoon.
""The packages are being examined by attending emergency services,"" the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said in a short statement. 
It said the packages were sent to consulates in Melbourne and embassies in Canberra but did not provide a total number of affected sites or identify any of them.
""The circumstances surrounding the incidents are being investigated,"" the AFP statement said.
Officials at the U.S. and British consulates in Melbourne separately confirmed suspicious packages had been received.
""We handled the package according to our standard procedures and in close coordination with local authorities ... who are investigating the incident,"" a spokesman for the U.S. Consulate said. 
A New Zealand official told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the consulate received an envelope with small plastic bags that appeared to contain concrete and asbestos, with ""asbestos"" written on one of the bags.
The Age newspaper reported that one firefighter was seen outside the South Korean consulate carrying a large plastic bag with the word ""asbestos"" written on it.

Other consulates in Melbourne reported by media to have received suspicious packages included those representing Greece, Italy, Spain, Thailand, India, Japan, Pakistan, Egypt, Denmark and Switzerland. Reuters could not confirm the reports.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh, the world's second biggest garment exporter behind China, will consider demands for an increase in the minimum wage, a minister said, after a third day of clashes with police that killed one worker and wounded dozens.
Protests resumed on Wednesday with workers blocking roads and burning tyres near the capital, Dhaka, but no violence was reported.
The government formed a panel of factory owners, union leaders and government officials to investigate the pay demands, Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said on Tuesday.
""The committee will be able to sort out the problems and hopefully in one month this will be resolved,"" Munshi said.
Thousands of workers blocked roads just north of Dhaka on Tuesday, police and union leaders said. One worker was shot dead and dozens of workers, and some police, were wounded.
The garment industry generates around $30 billion of exports a year, accounting for 80 percent of Bangladesh's merchandise export earnings and serving some of the biggest brands in the world. 
""We urge the government to sit with us and settle the issue, otherwise the movement will continue,"" Ruhul Amin, executive president of Garments Trade Union Center, told Reuters.
The government said in September that the minimum wage for garment workers would increase by up to 51 percent this year to 8,000 taka ($95) a month, the first such increase since 2013.
But workers say that increase will benefit only a small percentage of workers.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand on Wednesday welcomed a decision by the European Commission to drop the Southeast Asian nation from a list of countries it had warned over illegal and unregulated fishing.
In 2015, the world's third largest exporter of seafood received a so-called ""yellow card"", or warning from the European Union over unsustainable fishing practices, carrying the threat of a European ban on the exports.
That move prompted a major crackdown by Thailand's military government on illegal fishing and an overhaul of the industry.
""There have been sacrifices and adjustment to the way fishing was conducted,"" the deputy spokesman of the military government, Lieutenant General Werachon Sukhondhapatipak, told Reuters.
""Thailand's fishing industry at all levels has a responsibility to the environment and the world through more sustainable fishing practices in line with international standards.""
The measures Thailand adopted ranged from new rules to vessel monitoring systems, as well as a satellite-based system of tracking the movements of fishing boats, enforced by the Royal Thai Navy.
It also toughened labor regulations to combat human trafficking and ill-treatment of migrant workers, improving the situation of more than 300,000 citizens of neighboring countries employed in the Thai fishing industry.
""Since the yellow card was issued, the Commission and Thailand have engaged in a constructive process of cooperation and dialogue,"" the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said in a statement on Tuesday announcing its decision.
""This has resulted in a major upgrade of the Thai fisheries governance, in accordance with the international commitments of the country."" 
The European Commission now sees Thailand as ""a new committed partner"" in the fight against fishing practices that deplete global fish stocks and harm people who make their living from the sea, it added.
Thai seafood exports stood at $2.1 billion in 2017, Commerce Ministry data show, recovering to their 2014 level after a drop in 2015 to $1.8 billion following the European Union warning.
About 9.9 percent of Thai seafood exports went to the European Union last year, versus 10.3 percent in 2014, ministry data show.
Thailand's private sector also welcomed the EU decision, saying the reforms would benefit the fishing industry.
""This will boost investment and confidence in Thai seafood exports in the international market,"" Poj Aramwattananont, the vice chairman of the Board of Trade of Thailand, said in a statement.

Myanmar government leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday discussed insurgent attacks on police in a rare meeting with the military chief, and her administration called for the armed forces to ""crush"" the rebels.
Knut Ostby, who acts as the resident coordinator for the United Nations, said in a statement he was ""deeply concerned about the situation"" and urged ""all sides to ensure the protection of all civilians"" and to respect human rights.
""Mr Ostby further appeals to all sides to intensify efforts to find a peaceful solution to the situation and to ensure humanitarian access to all people affected by the violence,"" the United Nations said in a statement.
The Arakan Army wants greater autonomy for Rakhine State, where the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine people make up the majority of the population.
Rakhine State saw a military-led crackdown in 2017, following attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents that prompted hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to flee westwards into neighboring Bangladesh.
At a meeting on Monday between government and military leaders, the office of President Win Myint said it had instructed the military to ""crush the terrorists"", the government spokesman later told a news conference.
While Suu Kyi is barred from being president by a military-drafted constitution, the president is a loyalist. Suu Kyi is seen as de facto leader of the civilian government, while the military remains in charge of security.
Arakan Army insurgents killed 13 policemen and wounded nine in attacks on four police posts on Friday, as Myanmar celebrated Independence Day, state media reported.
An Arakan Army spokesman outside Myanmar told Reuters last week the group attacked the security forces in response to a broad military offensive in the north of Rakhine State that also targeted civilians.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Monday that 4,500 people were sheltering in monasteries and communal areas after being displaced by the fighting in the past month.

Myanmar governments have battled various autonomy-seeking ethnic minority insurgent groups since shortly after independence from Britain in 1948, though some have struck ceasefire agreements.

The report by New York-based Human Rights Watch and Venezuela's Penal Forum, which also says forces tortured civilians, comes as countries in the region are pushing the International Criminal Court to probe the government for alleged crimes against humanity.
The report, which documents several incidents that took place in 2018, suggests the government is concerned about the armed forces' loyalty as an economic collapse prompts widespread migration and several countries warn they will not recognize President Nicolas Maduro after he is sworn in to a new term on Thursday. 
The groups found 32 cases in which accused plotters detained by the intelligence service Sebin and military intelligence group DGCIM were subjected to beatings, asphyxiation and electric shocks to obtain details of alleged plots. 
When authorities could not find the accused, they in some cases detained and abused family members to determine their whereabouts, the report says.
""The Venezuelan government has brutally cracked down on members of the military accused of plotting against it,"" Human Rights Watch Americas director Jose Miguel Vivanco said in a statement. ""Not only are intelligence agents detaining and torturing members of the military, in some cases they are also going after their families or other civilians.""
In one case, the day before Maduro won re-election in a May 20, 2018 vote widely derided as a sham, armed officers without identification arrested Jose Marulanda, the partner of an army sergeant accused of conspiring against the government. 
Marulanda said he was beaten so severely on the head in DGCIM headquarters that he lost hearing in his right ear, the groups said. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry, which handles media inquiries for the government, did not respond to a request for comment on the report. Maduro frequently accuses the United States and the right-wing government in neighboring Colombia of plotting to overthrow him.
Officials also say rights groups play down violence committed by the opposition, including incidents such as setting a man on fire during a demonstration and police being targeted with explosives.
The two rights groups have previously accused Venezuela of torturing government opponents during protests in 2017, in which more than 120 people were killed.
More than 170 soldiers were detained for treason, rebellion and desertion in early 2018, compared with a total of 196 for all of 2017, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.

The devotees, mostly walking barefoot, surrounded the carriage bearing the life-sized image of the ""Black Nazarene"" shouldering a heavy cross as it paraded through the city.
Many of them, in yellow and maroon shirts, threw white towels to people on the carriage to wipe on the statue, while others jostled to touch the thick ropes used to pull the carriage, believing the slightest touch would bless and heal their illnesses.
About 80 percent of the more than 100 million people of the Philippines are Roman Catholic. The Philippines is renowned for its colorful religious rituals, and the celebration of the ""Black Nazarene"" is a tradition in the former Spanish colony that goes back more than two centuries. 
The increasing number of devotees showed the growing strength of the Catholic faith, Manila auxiliary bishop Broderick Pabillo said in response to criticism that the procession borders on idolatry.
""Let's deepen our understanding of spirituality,"" Pabillo was quoted by DZMM radio station as saying.
Wednesday's procession, which is expected to last around 20 hours, is expected to draw 5 million people, police said.
It is not known why the statue, which was carved in Mexico, turned black. There are myths that the original statue donated by Spanish priests was burned as a fire erupted on the ship that carried it to the Philippines in the early 17th century.
Close to 300,000 were in the Manila procession, based on an early morning estimate by police, excluding those waiting elsewhere along its more than six-kilometer route.
Thousands of police and soldiers deployed were deployed in the city to provide security, and coast guard boats were also on standby as the huge crowd was expected to cross a narrow bridge later in the afternoon.

Brazil's Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo said last month before he was sworn in that it was his intention to exit the agreement. 
A diplomat, speaking on condition they not be named as they were not authorized to speak with the press, confirmed to Reuters that Brazil had officially left the pact.
The Foreign Ministry declined to comment. 
Araújo said last month that the international accord was ""an inappropriate instrument"" to deal with the issue and nations should set their own policies.
With a record 21.3 million refugees globally, the United Nations began work on the non-binding agreement after more than 1 million people arrived in Europe in 2015, many fleeing civil war in Syria and poverty in Africa.
The accord, which addresses issues such as how to protect migrants, integrate them and send them home, has been criticized by mostly right-wing European politicians who say it could increase immigration.
All 193 U.N. members except the United States agreed to its wording in July, but only 164 - including Brazil - formally ratified it. 

Araújo has said that Brazil would continue to take in refugees from neighboring Venezuela, but that the fundamental point is restoring democracy in that nation.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Italy's far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini and the leader of Poland's ruling party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, will discuss on Wednesday the possibility of forming a eurosceptic alliance to contest the European Parliament elections in May.
The visit to Warsaw, initiated by Polish Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski, comes amid broader efforts by eurosceptics across the continent to unite that could fundamentally shift the direction of the European Union after the elections.
""(The election) will show whether the eurosceptic voices within Europe are on the rise or if the rise has been curtailed for the moment,"" said Michal Baranowski, the head of the German Marshall Fund's Warsaw office. 
Salvini, who heads Italy's anti-immigrant League Party, has repeatedly criticized the EU and says the May elections are vital for creating a ""reformist"" bloc that can overhaul the Brussels institutions from within. 
He has even hinted he might be a candidate to head the EU executive, the European Commission.
""Someone has betrayed the European dream,"" Salvini told a League rally in Rome last month. ""We will provide the blood for a new European community based on respect, work, growth and equality.""
Kaczynski says Poland, the biggest beneficiary of EU infrastructure funds, should remain a member of the bloc it joined in 2004 but wants reforms to bring more power back from Brussels to national capitals.
CLASHING WITH EU
His ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has clashed with Brussels on a range of issues, including the rule of law in Poland, environmental protection and migration. Kaczynski says the EU should stop meddling in Poland's affairs.
In turn, the PiS government has been accused by opponents at home and abroad of tilting towards authoritarianism and is the subject of an unprecedented rule-of-law investigation by the EU.
""Both politicians (Kaczynski and Salvini) would like to see a Europe that is more focused on sovereign European nations - a Europe of nations rather than a closer united Europe,"" said Baranowski.
Salvini met other potential allies last year, including Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, in an effort to form a cohesive eurosceptic grouping at the EU level. 
Salvini could try to unite the Europe of Nations and Freedom bloc, to which his League belongs, with the European Conservatives and Reformists group which includes PiS to create a single, powerful eurosceptic force in the EU Parliament. 
A tie-up with Salvini's grouping could ensure a powerful voice for PiS in the next European Parliament, especially as Britain's Conservatives will leave the European Conservatives and Reformists grouping after Brexit. 
But PiS has also been trying to dilute its eurosceptic reputation ahead of Poland's own parliamentary election due in the autumn, recently agreeing to reverse a law criticized by the EU that had forced Supreme Court judges into early retirement.
Edit Zgut, a political scientist at Warsaw University's Center for Europe, also highlighted the constrasting views of Salvini and Kaczynski towards Russia. Like most Polish conservatives, Kaczynski is deeply distrustful of Moscow.
""Salvini is one of the most openly pro-Kremlin leaders in Europe... (while) Kaczynski has been trying to show PiS's pro-EU face recently,"" she said. 
The differences over Russia, which are likely to come up at the meeting, could be the main obstacle to future cooperation.

""Some of the views in Italy regarding Russia are met with concern in Poland across the political spectrum,"" Baranowski said.

Before sending the document to a public database for federal court filings, lawyers for Manafort had tried to black out the portion on polling data and other information about Manafort's interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, a former business partner of Manafort's who Mueller has claimed in court filings has ties to Russian intelligence.
But some journalists, including at Vox and the Guardian, realized the redacted portions could be electronically reversed and posted uncensored versions on Twitter. Reuters did not independently review the filing, which was soon replaced in the public database with a properly redacted version. 
Manafort's lawyers did not respond to a request for comment on the matter. A spokesman for Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose office is prosecuting Manafort, declined to comment. Kilimnik could not be reached for comment.
According to the unredacted versions posted online, the blacked-out sections showed that Manafort has been accused by Mueller of lying about his sharing of polling data on the 2016 campaign with Kilimnik.
The sections posted online also stated that Mueller's office believes that Manafort lied to prosecutors about his discussions with Kilimnik about a ""Ukrainian peace plan"" and a meeting that Manafort had with Kilimnik when they both were in Madrid.
The filing did not provide further details on the Madrid meeting or the peace plan, although Mueller has scrutinized a proposal by a Ukrainian lawmaker that involved, among other outcomes, the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Russia, according to people familiar with the matter.
In the document Manafort's lawyers referenced a December court filing in which Mueller alleged that Manafort had ""conceded"" to discussing the peace plan, which they argued was an indication that their client was forthcoming when his memory was refreshed of past events.
The inadvertent disclosures offered a rare glimpse into details that were meant to remain private while Manafort's lawyers and Mueller's office battle over whether Manafort has breached a plea agreement struck in September by lying.
In December Mueller accused Manafort in a court filing of telling ""multiple discernible lies"" related to five subjects, including his interactions with Kilimnik and his contacts with Trump administration officials in 2018.
At the time Manafort's lawyers said their client never intentionally provided incorrect information to prosecutors, but asked the judge for time to consider whether they wanted to contest Mueller's allegations or proceed to sentencing.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson had given Manafort's lawyers until Monday to make a decision. 
""The defense contests the Government’s conclusion and contends that any alleged misstatements, to the extent they occurred at all, were not intentional,"" Manafort's lawyers said in the filing, which was filed on Monday and released by the court on Tuesday.
In the filing Manafort's lawyers said they would not seek an evidentiary hearing to contest Mueller's allegations of lying, arguing that such factual matters could be addressed in a pre-sentencing report. 

Following the filing by Manafort's lawyers, Jackson ordered the government to submit evidence supporting their allegations by Jan. 14, and held out the option of holding a hearing on the matter on Jan. 25.

Gustavo Gonzalez Lopez was replaced as the head of the National Bolivarian Intelligence Service (Sebin) in October after opposition councilman Fernando Alban died while detained at the agency's headquarters in Caracas. The death was officially ruled a suicide, but critics said he was killed.
Gonzalez Lopez was sworn in by Vice President Delcy Rodriguez in a brief ceremony just days before socialist President Nicolas Maduro is set to be inaugurated for a second term. Other countries in the region have called on him not to take office, arguing his May 2018 re-election vote was a sham.
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for further details about the new counsel's responsibilities. Maduro last month accused the United States and neighboring Colombia of plotting to invade Venezuela, without providing evidence.
Gonzalez Lopez, who has not spoken publicly since he left his post at Sebin and did not make comments during the ceremony, is sanctioned by the United States and the European Union, along with several other Venezuelan government officials, for alleged human rights violations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prosecutors in the trial of ""El Chapo"" Joaquin Guzman on Tuesday played excerpts from what they said were incriminating phone calls made by the accused Mexican drug lord and intercepted by the FBI after they infiltrated his encrypted messaging system.
Nearly two months into the trial of Guzman on charges of drug trafficking as leader of the Sinaloa cartel, FBI special agent Steven Marston testified the 61-year-old was easily identifiable by his higher-pitched voice, which had ""kind of a sing-songy nature to it"" and a ""nasally undertone.""
The phone call excerpts that wafted through the Brooklyn courtroom on Tuesday included discussions of dealings with local officials, including one where Guzman appears to admonish an associate to be careful dealing with police.
""Well, you taught us to be a wolf, acting like a wolf,"" the associate replied.
Guzman was extradited to the United States in January 2017 to face charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs into the country. Prosecutors have said he also played a central role in a Mexican drug war in which more than 100,000 people have died. 
Guzman's lawyers have portrayed their client as a scapegoat for what they called Sinaloa's real leader, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, who also faces U.S. charges but remains at large.
The trial began Nov. 13 and is expected to last a few more weeks. Guzman faces life in prison if convicted.
Marston said the FBI tapped into more than 800 calls on the encrypted system with the help of a cooperating witness, Cristian Rodriguez.
The agent said the system's servers were moved to the Netherlands, where they ""would not be suspicious"" to Sinaloa, and that calls were intercepted from April 2011 to January 2012.
Jurors had previously heard from former Guzman associates testifying about multi-ton drug shipments, deadly wars between rival drug lords, and corruption by Mexican public officials.
The defendant mostly sat quietly during testimony, but waved enthusiastically to his wife in the courtroom before it started.
Tuesday's proceedings began with testimony from government witness Edgar Galvan, a low-level drug trafficker who the defense said fabricated payments from another trafficker to Guzman with the hope of reducing his own 24-1/3-year prison term.
Galvan denied making up the payments, though he admitted to having previously lied to investigators.
""Would you say you're a pretty good liar?"" defense lawyer William Purpura asked Galvan.
""I used to be,"" Galvan said.

(The story corrects spelling of cooperator's first name provided by the Justice Department to Cristian, not Christian, Rodriguez in eighth paragraph.)

CBS News quoted Zinni as saying he stepped down from his Trump administration assignment after realizing he could not resolve the dispute ""because of the unwillingness of the regional leaders to agree to a viable mediation effort that we offered to conduct or assist in implementing.""
The diplomatic dispute pits Qatar against four Arab nations, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, which cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha in 2017, accusing it of backing terrorism. Qatar denies supporting terrorism and there has been no sign of a resolution to the spat.
Zinni was also the lead negotiator for the creation of the proposed Middle East Strategic Alliance, which would bind Sunni Muslim governments in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Egypt and Jordan in a U.S.-led security, political and economic pact to counter Shi'ite Iran.
Asked about the report of Zinni's resignation, the State Department thanked Zinni for his service and confirmed it would take the lead on Middle East Strategic Alliance, though it said he would remain available to consult if need be.
""General Zinni’s mission was to help introduce the concept of the Middle East Strategic Alliance and start a conversation with leaders in the region. That is happening and well underway thanks to his efforts,"" said State Department spokesman Robert Palladino. ""The Administration, through the interagency process led by the Department of State, will carry the mission forward.""
Zinni is the latest official to leave the administration, joining Jim Mattis, the former defense Secretary; John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff; and Brett McGurk, the former envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 02:56PM ET</span>",A Rohingya girl’s journey from refugee camps to college,"By Zeba Siddiqui
CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh - The first time I met Formin Akter, she wanted to talk about Helen Keller.
Formin was 18. She was sitting on a plastic stool in a bamboo shelter at a refugee camp in Bangladesh. Like the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees around her, she and her family had fled a campaign of mass murder, rapes and arson in Myanmar the previous year.
But Formin wanted to talk about Keller, the deaf and blind American author she considered an inspiration. She wanted to talk about Pakistani activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, another hero. She wanted to talk about her books ravaged in the burning of her house amid deadly violence in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state. She spoke of her dream of becoming a lawyer, and of inspiring other Rohingya girls deprived of education.
By then, I had spent nearly a year making reporting trips to the refugee camps, interviewing girls Formin’s age, many survivors of rape and sexual assault. Women and girls at the Rohingya camps are usually seen fanning cooking pots, cradling babies or tending to their family inside bamboo shelters. Most from the long-persecuted community who live at the camps are illiterate, and the few who did manage to study in Myanmar often only speak Burmese.
I had never met anyone like Formin. Between fits of shy giggles, sometimes burying her face inside her lap, Formin spoke with a burning passion about books and education. She was stateless and single-minded about the value of education. She had witnessed brutality in Myanmar, but she was determined to remain idealistic.
Reuters Myanmar Bureau Chief Antoni Slodkowski and I felt almost immediately upon meeting her that she had an important story to tell. It became a Special Report, published in December. (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-rohingya-malala/)
And her story started to seem more and more remarkable as I learned more about her over the next few months. She came from one of the remotest villages in the poor Rakhine state. She was among a few Rohingya who had taught themselves English, she had counseled rape and sexual assault victims at the refugee camps and was among 25 girls selected to study at a university in Bangladesh.
Piecing together the rest of her story took effort. With help, I tracked down her uncle who had fled to Norway years ago as a refugee. In the sprawling camps, I found Formin’s teachers, including the one who first told her about Malala. 
I learned that of the 150 girls who sat for the high school exam at Formin's school in March 2017, she was among only four who passed. Nearly everyone who knew her growing up spoke of Formin’s determination and her talent for English. Math, they said, had been a challenge.
Friends and family also spoke of her equally bright and determined older sister, Nur Jahan. The girls had made a pact as kids to go to college together. But their family decided that Nur Jahan would be married instead.
When I interviewed Nur Jahan, her husband insisted on sitting next to her and her in-laws watched from behind a partition in the tent. I asked about Formin and their dream of going to college together, and Nur Jahan began to cry. Heavy rain lashed the tarp roof of the shelter as Nur Jahan wiped tears with an end of her scarf.
Over the months we talked, I saw Formin grow in confidence. At college, she wore jeans, lipstick, a scarf neatly secured with pins around her head, and walked toward me while waving around at multiple new friends she had made, among them refugees from Afghanistan who were teaching her Farsi, Formin said. 
She was learning karate, guitar, and spoke of an Indian-American teacher she adored. “Her English is so good! I want to speak like her.”
But some things had not changed. At the library, she showed me her “favorite new book” - Charlotte Bronte’s ""Jane Eyre"" - and spoke about the importance of education in Eyre’s life.
Shortly after the Reuters profile of Formin was published, Malala retweeted it with a link. Formin was thrilled. She remembered sitting in school back in Myanmar listening in rapt attention to her teacher who narrated Malala’s story. She could not imagine that Malala was now reading about her.
“I can’t explain how I feel,” she texted me. “U know I love her!”
Over the break between semesters, Formin said she planned to do some work translating for non-profit groups working in the refugee camps. Much of the money she had saved from a year of work had gone to Nur Jahan’s wedding, she said.

(The story corrects paragraph four to make clear the illiteracy is among refugees in the camps and ninth paragraph to make clear she was one of 150 girls in a single school rather than 500 students in all of Rakhine state.)

81,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 02:32PM ET</span>","UK PM May defeated in parliament, lawmakers create new obstacle to no-deal Brexit","By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May's government suffered a defeat in parliament on Tuesday when lawmakers who oppose leaving the European Union without an accord won a vote on creating a new obstacle to a no-deal Brexit.
The 303 to 296 defeat means that the government needs explicit parliamentary approval to leave the EU without a deal before it can use certain powers relating to taxation law. May's office had earlier played down the technical impact of defeat.
The defeat highlights May's weak position as leader of a minority government, a divided party, and a critical parliament just days before she is due to hold a pivotal vote on whether to approve the Brexit deal she has negotiated with the EU.
""This vote is an important step to prevent a no-deal Brexit. It shows that there is no majority in Parliament, the Cabinet or the country for crashing out of the EU without an agreement,"" opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party said.
Speaking before the vote, Treasury minister Robert Jenrick said the proposal's only impact would be to make the country ""somewhat less prepared"" for a no-deal outcome. 
With less than three months until Britain leaves the EU, May is struggling to win approval for her Brexit deal.
A no-deal exit is the default scenario if May's deal is rejected, and the prospect of possible supply chain disruption, medicine shortage and blocked ports has in recent weeks pushed companies and the government to ramp up contingency planning.
Some Brexit supporters say a no-deal exit is the only way to truly leave the bloc, and that warnings of the economic consequences have been overblown to drum up support for May's deal.
But, a majority of lawmakers from across the political spectrum opposed to a no-deal exit have now established their political significance and promised to keep making it harder for the government to leave without a deal.
Their amendment to legislation implementing last year's budget states that powers to amend tax laws to make them work after Brexit could only be used if a deal was agreed, Brexit was canceled, or, if the government had parliamentary approval to proceed with a no-deal exit.
Effectively this constrains the government's ability to act to keep its taxation system working smoothly if it pursues a no-deal Brexit against the wishes of a majority in parliament.
It is not an absolute block to leaving the EU without a deal because it does not negate the legislation already in place stating that Britain will leave the EU on March 29. 
But it is a politically important victory for those opposed to no-deal, demonstrating that they have the ability to defeat the government. 
With a raft of other legislation still needing to be approved before Brexit day, that signals further difficulties for the government if it pursues a no-deal exit. 

One member of May's party who co-signed the amendment said he hoped similar tactics would be used on other pieces of legislation - a sentiment endorsed by others in the debate.

LONDON (Reuters) - Flights from London's Heathrow airport were halted for about an hour on Tuesday after reports of a drone sighting near Europe's busiest air hub, raising fears that the chaos that affected rival Gatwick last month could be repeated on an even larger scale.
""We are responding to a drone sighting at Heathrow,"" the airport said. ""As a precautionary measure, we have stopped departures while we investigate. We apologize to passengers for any inconvenience this may cause.""
London's Metropolitan Police said they had received reports of a drone near the airport at about 1705 GMT on Tuesday, which they were investigating with airport authorities.
The airport confirmed about an hour later that take-offs had resumed. Flight tracker websites showed flights departing from 1811 GMT. 
A Reuters witness in a plane on the runway at Heathrow said multiple aircraft were waiting for permission to take off before being later told that things were starting to move .
London's second busiest airport, Gatwick, was severely disrupted when drones were sighted on three consecutive days in December, resulting in about 1,000 flights being canceled or diverting and affecting 140,000 passengers.
Gatwick's drone nightmare - the most disruptive yet at a major airport - exposed a new vulnerability that will be scrutinized by security forces, airlines and airport operators across the world.
The British army was forced to deploy military technology to guard the area around Gatwick, reassuring the airport that it was safe enough to fly.
British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said on Tuesday the military was preparing to deploy the same equipment at Heathrow.
""We are in contact with Heathrow Airport concerning the drone sighting,"" he said.
""I have already spoken to both the Home Secretary and Defense Secretary and the military are preparing to deploy the equipment used at Gatwick at Heathrow quickly should it prove necessary.""
Both airports responded to the Gatwick incident by ordering military-grade anti-drone technology. 
Heathrow said it was working closely with authorities including the police and looking at relevant technology to combat the threat of drones.

The airport handled 78 million passengers in 2017 and is the main hub for British Airways (L:ICAG). Its busiest routes in terms of passengers numbers are to Dubai and New York-JFK.

ABOARD SEA-WATCH 3 IN THE MEDITERRANEAN (Reuters) - Germany said on Tuesday it could take in some of the 300 migrants rescued in the Mediterranean in recent weeks, but dozens - including five children - remained stranded at sea with no European country offering a safe port.
The Sea-Watch 3, a vessel run by a German humanitarian group, plucked 32 people from an unsafe boat off the coast of Libya on Dec. 22, and another German charity, Sea-Eye, rescued 17 others on Dec. 29.
The vessels - carrying a combined 49 people - have been sailing back and forth off the coast of Malta for days. The ships' crews have expressed concern about the migrants' mental state, exacerbated by bad weather and seasickness.
""The children, they are sick..., and there's no sleeping because of the waves. We are dying slowly in this place,"" said Diamond, a Nigerian man rescued by the Sea-Watch 3 who declined to give his last name.
Malta, the smallest European Union member state, is asking partners to take in some of the migrants, including another 249 people who were picked up by Maltese navy boats in the final week of 2018.
""The only sustainable outcome is a Europe-wide solution,"" Kim Heaton-Heather, the Sea-Watch 3 head of mission, told Reuters aboard the ship. ""Everyone is trying to get rid of their responsibility."" 
Germany is willing to take in 50 migrants as long as other European countries also do their part, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said on Tuesday. The Netherlands had also indicated it was willing to welcome some.
Italy's government has split on the issue, with the hardline anti-immigrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini refusing to host a single migrant while Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte offers to take in a small portion as long as Malta lets the ships dock.
Talks to divvy up the migrants are ongoing ""and the Maltese government would like to see them concluded in the coming hours,"" Malta's government said in a statement. 
""A long-term European solution for similar issues in the future should be a priority in order to avoid a repeat which puts even more burden on a member state like Malta which always abides by its obligations,"" it said.
Since Salvini shut Italy's ports to migrant-rescue ships last June, the EU's executive commission often has had to conduct lengthy negotiations with member states to share out new arrivals before the rescue ships are allowed to dock. 

Two dozen humanitarian groups, including Save the Children, asked on Tuesday for an urgent meeting with the Italian prime minister to try to end the standoff at sea.

The New York Times reported on Monday that Michael R. White, a 46-year-old U.S. Navy veteran, was seized while visiting Iran and has been held in jail since July on unspecified charges. 
His mother, Joanne White, told the New York Times her son had visited Iran ""five or six times"" to meet his Iranian girlfriend. He had bought a ticket to return from Iran, but never boarded his flight on July 27.
Asked about the reports, a U.S. State Department spokesman said: ""We are aware of reports of the detention of a U.S. citizen in Iran.""
The spokesman declined to provide additional information, citing privacy considerations.
Iranian officials have not reacted to the reports, and were not immediately available for comment.
A former detainee in Iran, Ivar Farhadi, told the London-based IranWire website he had spoken to White when they were both at Vakilabad Prison in the city of Mashhad in northeastern Iran.
The New York Times quoted White's mother as saying her son, a California resident, suffers acute asthma and had undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatment for a neck tumor.
Tension between Iran and the United States has risen significantly since last May, when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from an international nuclear deal with Tehran and reimposed U.S. sanctions that had been lifted after a 2015 accord.
Several Americans have been detained in Iran in recent years and Trump warned in 2017 that Tehran would face “new and serious consequences” unless all unjustly held U.S. citizens were freed.
Former FBI agent Robert Levinson disappeared while visiting Iran’s Kish Island in 2007. U.S. officials believe Levinson, who suffered from diabetes, died in captivity after meeting with an American-born Islamic militant. Iranian officials have repeatedly denied knowledge of his disappearance or whereabouts.
In October 2015, Siamak Namazi, a businessman in his mid-40s with dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship, was detained as he was visiting family in Tehran. His 82-year-old father, Baquer Namazi, was also arrested in February 2016 and later convicted of espionage charges which he denied.
Xiyue Wang, a Chinese-born U.S. citizen and graduate student from Princeton University, was arrested in Iran in 2016. He was sentenced to 10 years in jail on spying charges that he denied.

The Journal, citing minutes of meetings between Chinese and Malaysian officials, reported on Monday that the offers were made in 2016. In return, Malaysia offered China lucrative stakes in railway and pipeline projects for Beijing's ""One Belt, One Road"" infrastructure initiative, the report said.
In a statement in response to the Journal report, the Chinese embassy in Kuala Lumpur said China never attaches political conditions to its cooperation with other countries.
""China has all along adhered to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of any other country. We do not accept any groundless accusations made against China,"" the embassy said.
1MDB, founded by former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, is the subject of corruption and money laundering investigations in at least six countries.
The U.S. Justice Department has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates.
The scandal was a key reason for the shock ouster of Najib in last year's election, which saw the return of Mahathir Mohamad as prime minister.
Najib has since been charged with corruption over 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty and has consistently denied wrongdoing. 
In a statement issued on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page late on Tuesday, Najib denied the allegations made in the Journal report. He said China had never offered to bail out 1MDB, and he defended the cost of infrastructure projects awarded to China.
Since coming to power in May, Mahathir's government has accused the Najib government of inflating the cost of Chinese deals. The new administration has paused more than $20 billion worth of projects awarded to Chinese firms, pending review.
Malaysian finance minister Lim Guan Eng said the government would study the allegations made in the Journal report.

""I have to refer back to any details explicitly said. If it was said in black and white, then it is something we will pursue,"" Lim was quoted as saying in Malaysian media.

ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan rebuked Washington's national security adviser on Tuesday for demanding that Turkey does not harm Kurdish fighters in Syria, accusing him of complicating President Donald Trump's plan to withdraw U.S. troops.
Erdogan said John Bolton, who held talks with Turkish officials in Ankara on Tuesday but left without meeting the president, ""made a serious mistake"" in setting conditions for Turkey's military role after the U.S. pull-out.
The rebuke highlights the difficulties in implementing Trump's goal of bringing home some 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria - a plan that hinges on Turkish cooperation to secure a huge swathe of northeast Syria as the United States departs.
Trump's abrupt announcement last month sparked concern among officials in Washington and some Western allies and prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign. It also alarmed the YPG, Washington's main partner against Islamic State in Syria. 
But the plan was lauded by Ankara. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist organization and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency in its largely Kurdish southeast. Washington's support for the militia has infuriated Turkey.
Before arriving in Turkey, Bolton said Turkey must coordinate military action with the United States and no U.S. withdrawal would take place until Ankara guaranteed the Kurdish fighters would be safe.
But Erdogan, who has long argued that the YPG were no different from the Islamic State militants, said the condition was unacceptable. 
""If they are terrorists, we will do what is necessary no matter where they come from,"" he told members of his AK Party in parliament.
""Bolton has made a serious mistake and whoever thinks like this has also made a mistake. It is not possible for us to make compromises on this point.""
The Turkish president accused members of Trump's administration of trying to muddy a clear understanding between the two countries over the withdrawal.
""Different voices have started emerging from different segments of the administration,"" Erdogan said.
FOCUS ON YPG
A senior Turkish official said Bolton had asked to see Erdogan but his earlier remarks may have been a factor in the meeting not going ahead. Erdogan later told reporters there was no need for him to meet Bolton.
Instead, Bolton met his Turkish counterpart Ibrahim Kalin. A senior U.S. official said Bolton told the Turkish officials the United States opposed any mistreatment of its Kurdish allies. 
He also said the United States would not be withdrawing from its base at al-Tanf near the Iraqi border at this point.
On a visit to Jordan on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the withdrawal would not jeopardize Washington's efforts to counter regional threats from Islamic State and Iran.
ECONOMIC FRICTION
The friction with the United States has had economic consequences for Turkey. A diplomatic rift last year - now partly repaired - was one of the factors that sent Turkey's lira into a tailspin over the summer.
The currency slipped again on Tuesday, weakening some 2 percent against the dollar. 
Ahead of Tuesday's talks, Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper said Ankara would ask U.S. officials either to hand over its military bases in Syria to Ankara or to destroy them. It cited unspecified sources as saying Turkey would not accept the handover of what it said were 22 U.S. military bases to the YPG.
A senior Turkish security official told Reuters last week Washington needed to allow Turkey to use its bases in Syria. Kalin said Turkey wanted the bases emptied and handed over to ""local elements"".
Following the meeting, Kalin said there was no slowdown in the U.S. withdrawal from Syria and that Turkey was focused on what happens to U.S. bases in Syria and the weapons Washington has given the YPG. 

Bolton was joined by U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford and U.S. special Syria envoy James Jeffrey for the talks with Kalin, who is Erdogan's spokesman and deputy head of Turkey's security and foreign policies board.

ANTANANARIVO (Reuters) - Madagascar's top court on Tuesday proclaimed former leader Andry Rajoelina winner of a hard-fought presidential vote, rejecting his rival's accusations of fraud. 
High Constitutional Court chairman Jean Eric Rakotoarisoa ratified results given by the Indian Ocean island's electoral board last month saying Rajoelina won 55.66 percent of votes versus 44.34 percent for Marc Ravalomanana.
Rajoelina, a 44-year-old businessman, had ousted Ravalomanana, a 69-year-old known as ""the milkman"" for his ownership of a dairy conglomerate, in a 2009 coup.
But both men said this time they would accept the outcome of the vote. However, after a Dec. 19 runoff, Ravalomanana's team asked the court to nullify the results and submitted more than 200 complaints about balloting and vote counting. 
European Union observers said the election was calm and they did not witness any fraud. 
Both men were in court for Tuesday's ruling, but left without commenting.
Madagascar is one of Africa's poorest nations, with about 80 percent of its 25 million people living on less than $2 per day.

It is pinning hopes for development on mining and tourism.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwean teachers were divided at the start of an indefinite strike on Tuesday, with those in towns reporting for class while their rural colleagues largely heeded calls by unions to boycott work to press the government to pay U.S. dollar salaries.
The southern African nation is gripped by its worst shortage of dollars since a military coup ended nearly four decades of rule by Robert Mugabe in November 2017, leading to shortages of everything from fuel to medicines to soft drinks.
Teachers, like doctors who stopped work more than a month ago, say their salaries paid in electronic dollars are fast losing value compared to physical cash which they are demanding.
As the dollar crunch worsens and social unrest grows, Mnangagwa could find it harder to convince skeptical Zimbabweans that he is capable of reviving the economy after decades of missteps under his predecessor and mentor Mugabe.
At some schools around central Harare visited by Reuters, teachers were present and conducting classes.
Zimbabwe Teachers Association president Richard Gundane said a survey on Tuesday showed that urban teachers had reported for duty but most in rural areas did not go to work and pupils were turned away.
""We don't want to call it (strike) successful because we are not celebrating,"" Gundane said, adding that teachers hoped promises by government to review salaries could end the impasse. 
Gundane could not say how many of ZIMTA's 44,000 members stayed at home but that more teachers would join the job boycott in the coming days if their demands were not quickly met. 
Zimbabwe employs more than 100,000 teachers.
 The Progressive  (NYSE:PGR) Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) and Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe told a news conference that although teachers attended school, most were not teaching but could not provide statistics. 
Raymond Majongwe, PTUZ secretary general said his members would work twice a week until the government met their demands.
""The issue of the demand to be paid in U.S. dollars is a reality and we are not going to flinch on that,"" said Majongwe. 
After a meeting with public sector unions on Monday, acting Labour Minister July Moyo promised to review their pay and allowances although no money was set aside for this in the 2019 budget presented in November. He did not give a timeline.
This would scupper government's ambitious plan to cut the fiscal deficit by more than half to 5 percent of GDP this year and bring down the wage bill to 70 percent of the budget from more than 90 percent previously.

LONDON (Reuters) - Some protesters wrap themselves in the flag of the European Union and noisily interrupt politicians' television appearances. Others yell ""Nazi"" and ""traitor"".
Britain's lawmakers are split on how to handle Brexit but they agree that the atmosphere in the public spaces outside parliament - often populated with angry demonstrators - has become ugly and intimidatory. 
This increasingly raucous brand of street activism has raised questions about what has happened to British politics in recent years, and where the boundaries of free speech now lie.
On Tuesday, members of parliament called on police to do more to tackle intimidation of politicians and journalists outside parliament after protesters yelled abuse at a prominent Conservative lawmaker.
More than 2-1/2 years since Britain voted by 52 to 48 percent to leave the European Union, the country remains divided. Demonstrators who back Brexit and others who want to stay in the European Union have become a fixture in the gardens opposite parliament.
The area is also used by media for interviews and while protests have generally been peaceful, politicians and journalists say the atmosphere has turned increasingly nasty in recent weeks.
On Monday, Conservative lawmaker Anna Soubry, a pro-European who has called for a second referendum on Brexit, faced chants of ""Soubry is a Nazi"" and ""liar"" as she was interviewed live on television.
""I do object to being called a Nazi,"" Soubry said. ""This is what has happened to our country.""
The abuse continued as she walked back to parliament after the interview, with mobile phone footage on Twitter showing her surrounded by men, some in yellow vests similar to those worn by protesters in Paris, shouting ""liar"", ""fascist"" and ""scum"".
SECURITY PROTECTION
Sky News journalist Kay Burley, one of the broadcasters whose interview with Soubry was overshadowed by the protests, has also faced abuse and says she now has security protection.
She said demonstrators who disliked Soubry monitored TV channels so they could turn up and hurl abuse at her.
In a letter to the London police chief Cressida Dick, a group of more than 60 lawmakers said they were concerned about the ""deteriorating public order and security situation"" around parliament.
""An ugly element of individuals with strong far right and extreme right connections ... have increasingly engaged in intimidatory and potentially criminal acts,"" the lawmakers, both pro-EU and pro-Brexit and from all political parties, wrote.
House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he too had written to police asking for a review of their policy.
Monday's fracas was a symptom of a growing malaise in British politics, according to Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester.
It followed street scuffles during Scotland's independence referendum in 2014 and activists draping a banner from a bridge in Manchester during the Conservative Party's annual conference in 2017 saying ""Hang the Tories"". 
""I think Brexit certainly deepened it ... this trend towards intensifying distrust of politics and politicians, representative institutions, the media,"" Ford said. ""That distrust has now become much more visible because it is now becoming a serious obstacle to addressing complex issues."" 
Politicians on all sides of the Brexit debate had encouraged this kind of thinking, Ford said, adding: ""I fear that the beast that they have unleashed has now turned on all of them.""
Ian Lavery, the Labour Party chairman, said Monday's events outside parliament were an attempt to silence political debate.
""They were incarnations of a campaign of hatred that has been brought from the darkest reaches of the internet to the doors of our democracy.""
""UNLEASHING SUCH UGLINESS""
The Metropolitan Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner for operations Laurence Taylor said police were assessing whether crimes had been committed and promised to ""deal robustly with incidents of harassment and abuse"".
Labour lawmaker Stephen Doughty, who organized the letter, told BBC TV that there could be a repeat of the murder of Labour lawmaker Jo Cox, killed in a frenzied street attack a week before the 2016 Brexit vote by a man obsessed with Nazis and extreme right-wing ideology.
Last year, a man accused of being a member of a far-right group pleaded guilty to plotting to kill another female Labour lawmaker who, like Cox, was targeted because she was perceived as supporting immigration.
Brexit minister Stephen Barclay told BBC Radio the ""appalling scenes"" outside parliament on Monday showed how divisive the Brexit process had become.
Tim Montgomerie, a prominent pro-Brexit Conservative activist and political commentator, said on Twitter that while the abuse of Soubry was unacceptable, ""a parliamentarian who advocates overturning a referendum result she promised to respect should not be surprised at unleashing such ugliness"". 
Abuse has taken place across the political divide, with left-wing author and Labour supporter Owen Jones posting a video on Twitter of protesters shouting ""traitor"" at him as he walked outside parliament.
While many of those facing abuse are supporters of remaining in the EU, pro-Brexit lawmakers have also been targeted.

In September, Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent campaigner for Brexit, was confronted outside his home by activists who told his children ""your daddy is a horrible person"" and ""lots of people hate him"".

Although Ginsburg did not attend the oral arguments, she will participate in the cases and rulings by using the briefs and oral argument transcripts, Chief Justice John Roberts announced from the bench.
Ginsburg, who joined the court in 1993, underwent a surgical procedure called a pulmonary lobectomy on Dec. 21 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to remove two cancerous nodules in her left lung. She was released from the hospital on Christmas Day.
Monday was the first time Ginsburg, the oldest member of the nine-justice court, has missed oral arguments as a result of her various health scares, including two previous cancer diagnoses. Ginsburg also broke three ribs in a fall in November, which led to doctors' discovery of the nodules on her lung.

If Ginsburg, one of the court's four liberal members, were unable to continue serving, Trump could replace her with a conservative, further shifting the court to the right. Trump has added two justices to the court since becoming president in January 2017.

WIESBADEN, Germany (Reuters) - A student confessed to one of Germany's biggest data breaches, police said on Tuesday, ending the mystery over who hacked Angela Merkel and other public figures but doing little to ease the embarrassment of cyber security authorities.
Police did not name the 20-year-old but said he lives with his parents, is not a computer expert and had no previous conviction. Despite that, he managed to access and leak personal data and documents from about 1,000 people, including Chancellor Merkel, other politicians and journalists.
The student was detained after police searched a property in the central state of Hesse on Sunday evening. Investigators recovered a computer that the suspect had removed two days before the search, and a data backup. 
He has been released and is cooperating with investigators.
""The accused admitted to having acted alone in data spying and the unauthorized publication of data,"" the Federal Crime Office (BKA) said in a statement.
""The investigations have so far provided no indication of the participation of a third party."" 
Suspicion had fallen on Russian hackers - blamed for previous German data breaches, though denied by the Kremlin. 
There had also been speculation that the hack may have involved German far-right activists. Prosecutors declined to comment on any political sympathies the suspect may have but said no radical material had been found.
""The accused said his motivation had been irritation over public statements made by the politicians, journalists and public figures affected,"" senior prosecutor Georg Ungefuk said.
Ungefuk told reporters the suspect, who faces a maximum of six years behind bars, was repentant and unaware of the full consequences of his actions. He said the student also helped authorities on other areas of interest of cyber crime.
The breach has prompted calls for tighter data security laws, especially after the BSI cyber defense agency said it was contacted by a lawmaker in early December about suspicious activity on private email and social media.
Shoring up security is considered particularly important by German officials given a threat by Steve Bannon, former chief strategist of U.S. President Donald Trump, to use the May European Parliament elections to undermine the EU.
""I see a danger the European election can be manipulated - with fake news, with false statements. There are many ways you can influence an election,"" Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told Reuters after a news conference in Berlin.
Konstantin von Notz, a Greens lawmaker who was hacked, described the case as a ""final warning shot"" and called for urgent steps to improve IT security.
Seehofer said steps to do so were already under way, including creation of an early warning system. One important lesson was to raise awareness that there are more effective passwords than ""iloveyou"" and ""12345.""
However, Sabine Vogt, who heads the federal police division for serious and organized crime, said it was up to individuals to secure their data. 

""We don't want a surveillance state based on the fact that something like this can happen here,"" she told reporters.

WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on Tuesday that target a Venezuelan currency exchange network scheme that siphoned billions of dollars to corrupt insiders of the Venezuelan government, the U.S. Treasury Department said.
Seven individuals involved include a former Venezuelan treasurer, Claudia Diaz, and television mogul Raul Antonio Gorrin, who bribed the Venezuelan Treasury in order to conduct illegal foreign exchange operations, according to the U.S. Treasury.
""Venezuelan regime insiders have plundered billions of dollars from Venezuela while the Venezuelan people suffer. Treasury is targeting this currency exchange network which was another illicit scheme that the Venezuelan regime had long used to steal from its people,” Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. 
The U.S. Treasury said the former Venezuelan officials and other individuals used favorable foreign exchange transactions through brokerage firms controlled by Gorrin and among very few that were approved by the South American country's treasury. The individuals concealed their profits in U.S. and European bank accounts and investments, it said.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
The sanctions are Washington's latest move against the government of President Nicolas Maduro, which is widely criticized for economic collapse and undermining democracy.
The United States imposed sanctions on Maduro's wife in September as President Donald Trump urged members of the United Nations to support a ""restoration of democracy"" in the once-booming country, a member of OPEC.
The sanctions imposed on Tuesday apply to people involved in the corrupt system within Venezuela's treasury since 2008, the U.S. Treasury said. 
The country's treasurer before Diaz, Alejandro Andrade, was sentenced by a U.S. District Court in Florida in November to 10 years in prison for accepting more than $1 billion in bribes as part of the scheme.
Andrade, who ran the treasury for four years under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, received properties, platinum and gold Rolex watches and Mercedes Benz vehicles thanks to the scheme, according to documents from the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of Florida court.
He was helped by Gorrin, owner of television station Globovision, who has been charged with paying bribes to Andrade and others as well as helping to launder the payments, according to the documents unsealed in November.
The cases are part of a broad effort by U.S. federal prosecutors to crack down on the use of the U.S. financial system to launder proceeds from corruption in the crisis-stricken country that is suffering from hyperinflation.
The U.S. Treasury statement cited 23 groups as being part of the scheme, including Globovision Tele in Caracas and Miami, Magus Holdings in Miami, Tindaya Properties in New York, Planet 2 Reaching Inc and Posh 8 Dynamic Inc, both of Delaware.
Maduro has said little about criminal proceedings against former Venezuelan officials, but says the United States is seeking to undermine his government through financial sanctions.
He is due to be inaugurated for his second term on Thursday.

Pompeo was in Jordan, making his first visit to the Middle East since President Donald Trump's abrupt announcement that he will pull the 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, which caused alarm among U.S. allies in the region and prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
The U.S. troops in Syria have been fighting against Islamic State and also served as a counterweight to the Syrian government, which is backed by Iran and Russia.
Many of Trump's domestic and international critics have said that withdrawing the troops abruptly could expose Washington's Kurdish allies to repression from Turkey, and also allow Iran to solidify its influence in Syria.
But Pompeo said Washington was not stepping down from its efforts to challenge Iran. American policy makers were ""redoubling not only our diplomatic but our commercial efforts to put real pressure on Iran,"" he said. 
""There is enormous agreement on the risk that Iran poses to Jordan and other countries in the region,"" Pompeo added. 
Jordan, which has expressed worries in the past about Iranian influence, particularly near the Jordanian border in southern Syria, said Tehran should refrain from meddling in the affairs of its neighbors Syria and Iraq. 

""We all have problems with Iran's expansionist policies in the region,"" Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said.

COPENHAGEN/BRUSSELS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The European Union on Tuesday froze the assets of an Iranian intelligence unit and two of its staff, as the Netherlands accused Iran of two killings on its soil and joined France and Denmark in alleging Tehran plotted other attacks in Europe.
The move, although in part symbolic since one of the men is in prison in Belgium, marks the first time the EU has enacted sanctions on Iran since lifting a host of curbs on it three years ago following its 2015 nuclear pact with world powers.
The decision, which includes designating the unit and the two Iranians as terrorists, follows last year's disclosure by Denmark and France that they suspected an Iranian government intelligence service of pursuing assassination plots on their soil. Copenhagen sought an EU-wide response. 
""EU just agreed to enact sanctions against an Iranian Intelligence Service for its assassination plots on European soil. Strong signal from the EU that we will not accept such behaviour in Europe,"" Denmark's Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said on Twitter.
France, which has already hit the two men and the ministry unit with sanctions, has said there was no doubt the Iranian intelligence ministry was behind a failed attack near Paris.
On Tuesday the Dutch government publicly accused Iran of the plots, as well as two killings in 2015 and 2017, sending a letter to parliament to warn of further economic sanctions if Tehran did not cooperate with European investigations.
The letter signed by the Dutch foreign and interior ministers said Britain, France, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium met Iranian officials to convey ""their serious concerns regarding Iran's probable involvement in these hostile acts on EU territory.""
""Iran was informed that involvement in such matters is entirely unacceptable and must be stopped immediately ... further sanctions cannot be ruled out,"" the letter said.
Iran has denied any involvement in the alleged plots, saying the accusations were intended to damage EU-Iran relations.
Paris accused Iran of a plot to carry out a bomb attack at a rally near Paris organized by an exiled Iranian opposition group. Denmark says it foiled a Iranian intelligence plan to assassinate an Iranian Arab opposition figure on its soil.
On Tuesday, the Netherlands said it had ""strong indications"" that Iran was behind the assassinations of two Dutch nationals of Iranian origin, in 2015 and in 2017. The latter was dissident Iranian Arab activist Ahmad Mola Nissi who was gunned down by an unidentified assailant in front of his home in The Hague.
Iran denies any involvement in the killings.
SANCTIONS SENSITIVE
The decision to impose the curbs was taken without debate at an unrelated meeting of Europe ministers in Brussels and the asset freeze comes into effect on Wednesday, EU officials said.
The Danish Foreign Ministry named the two employees as the deputy minister and director general of intelligence, Saeid Hashemi Moghadam, and Assadollah Asadi, a Vienna-based diplomat. Their names are set to appear officially in the EU's Official Journal on Wednesday. 
Sanctions on the intelligence ministry, which is under the control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, are unlikely to change what the European Union says are Iran's destabilizing activities in Europe and the Middle East. 
The deputy minister and director general of intelligence is in Iran, while the Iranian diplomat was charged and is being held by Belgian authorities. Neither appear to have assets in France, which first imposed the asset freeze late last year.
But imposing economic sanctions on Iran, once the EU's top oil supplier, remains highly sensitive for the bloc. 
The EU has been straining to uphold the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers that U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of in May. It has been less willing to consider sanctions, instead seeking talks with Tehran.

Iran has warned it could ditch the nuclear deal if EU powers do not protect its trade and financial benefits.

Canadian authorities arrested Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Dec. 1 on a U.S. extradition warrant. Beijing denounced the move and threatened reprisals unless the case against Meng was dropped. 
""The Canadian government remains deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention by Chinese authorities of these two Canadians since last month and continues to call for their immediate release,"" the foreign ministry said in the statement.
The spat is threatening to increase global tensions at a time when Washington and Beijing are already locked in a trade war.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and the two leaders agreed to continue pressing Beijing to free Spavor and Kovrig, Trudeau's office said in a statement.

Although Canada says China has made no specific link between the detentions and Meng's arrest, experts and former diplomats say they have no doubt Beijing is using the cases of the two men to pressure Ottawa.

GAROWE, Somalia (Reuters) - A region of war-ravaged Somalia elected a new president on Tuesday, a peaceful transfer of power in a part of the country notorious for piracy and Islamist militias.
Said Abdullahi Deni, who is likely to continue Puntland's close cooperation with the United States, defeated his closest rival, Asad Osman Abdullahi. He was sworn in for a new five-year term. 
Puntland, on the tip of the Horn of Africa, considers itself a semi-autonomous region that comes under the federal government, although the relationship between the two parties has at times been tense.
Six years ago, it was a hotbed of piracy, and hundreds of attacks cost the shipping industry billions of dollars.
But a combination of maritime patrols, stronger Somali security forces and better security protocols by mariners mean attacks are now rare. 
Deni has taken a hardline against the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab and a rival splinter faction that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State, said Matt Bryden, head of the Nairobi-based think tank Sahan Research.
""He has campaigned as a reformist, promising to strengthen government institutions, fight corruption and stabilize the economy,"" Bryden said.
A former Somali federal minister for planning, Demi won 35 votes out of the 66 lawmakers that voted, the speaker of Puntland’s parliament, Abdihakim Mohamed Ahmed, said. 
He replaces the incumbent Abdiweli Mohamed Ali Gaas, who served a single term and was eliminated in a first round of voting.
The regional elections in Puntland followed the expulsion of the senior United Nations official in Somalia earlier this month. 
The Mogadishu-based federal government expelled Nicholas Haysom, who served as Special Representative of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, after he raised questions over allegations of police abuses by forces loyal to the central government during another regional election last month.
The government accused Haysom of interfering with internal affairs.
Last Friday, the United Nations said it would appoint a new envoy to the country, whose security forces are struggling to contain the Islamist insurgency. The faction loyal to Islamic State is largely based in Puntland.

Skripal was found with his daughter Yulia collapsed on a public bench in the southern English city in March, and Britain has charged two Russians in absentia with their attempted murder. 
Russia has denied involvement in the poisoning of the Skripals, which sparked the biggest East-West diplomatic expulsions since the Cold War.
Investigators believe a nerve agent was left on the front door of Skripal's home. His cat was put down by authorities, while his guinea pigs were found dead.
Britain's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said that work to decontaminate the property had resumed and would take months to complete.
""External scaffolding is being erected in early January to allow access for work on the house roof and garage roof. The roof will be removed during the decontamination process,"" it said in a statement.
""We are working ... to ensure that the house will be fully repaired and returned to a fit state to live in.""
The Skripals visited a pub and an Italian restaurant before they were found collapsed in the cathedral city, 80 miles to the southwest of London, and a large part of the city center was closed off for months to be decontaminated.

The Skripals are in hiding following their release from hospital, although Reuters has spoken to Yulia since the poisoning.

Violence in the area has become more rare since security forces largely flushed out Shi’ite Muslim gunmen in a 2017 campaign that left much of the town’s old quarter flattened.
Qatif, in an oil-producing province and home to a large Shi’ite population, is a flashpoint between the Sunni-dominated government and minority Shi'ites complaining of discrimination and marginalization. Saudi authorities deny those charges.
The people killed on Monday had refused to surrender and then opened fire on security forces, Al-Arabiya reported, citing unnamed security sources. They had been wanted over alleged disruptions to security and development projects in the area, it added.
Unverified photographs shared earlier on social media showed a bloodied body carried in a tarp by men dressed in fatigues, and homes pockmarked with bullet holes. An online video appeared to show a military vehicle firing in a residential area.
Shi’ite protests and deadly militant attacks on security forces have escalated since Nimr al-Nimr, a Shi’ite cleric critical of Saudi Arabia's ruling family, was executed two years ago on charges of inciting violence.

More than a million Syrians fled to neighboring Lebanon since war broke out at home in 2011, and U.N. agencies say most live of them live in poverty. 
""There is almost half a meter of water on the ground and in the tents ... the war in Syria forced us into this situation,"" said Hussein Zeidan who came to Lebanon from Homs in Syria in 2011. 
He lives in a makeshift camp near a river in north Lebanon's Akkar region. He and some of its other residents said the storm had left them and their children with no clothes, furniture or food. 
Families were moving around in search of dryness and warmth. 
""Water flooded us in the camp: me and my children. Our situation is bad ... God bless our neighbors, they welcomed us in yesterday night. Today, water flooded them so we came here, as you can see, to this half-built house with no windows or doors,"" Ghazwan Zeidan, who has three children, said in Akkar. 
The U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday that the storm had completely flooded or collapsed 15 informal settlements out of at least 66 that were ""heavily impacted"".
In the Bekaa valley in east Lebanon, the cold temperatures have also brought snow. 
Abu Shahid, who fled Hasaka in Syria three years ago with his family, stood in flooded water in an informal camp in Bar Elias village. He described how his tent had completely submerged, damaging all his family's belongings. 
""The only solution is to leave our things and move, run away with our lives ... Water is everywhere, where do we go?,"" he said. The previous night, he and his wife and two children had slept in a neighbor's tent that was less damaged by the floods.

RAFAH, Gaza Strip (Reuters) - Egypt blocked Palestinians from entering the country from Gaza on Tuesday after Palestinian Authority (PA) personnel pulled out of the Rafah border crossing and Hamas officers took their place.
The dispute over the border stems from a rift between the Western-backed PA and Hamas Islamists who took control of Gaza more than a decade ago in a brief civil war.
Human rights groups say Rafah has been the sole exit point from Gaza for an estimated 95 percent of its population of 2 million. Citing security concerns, Israel maintains tight restrictions on Palestinian movement at its border crossings.
PA employees were deployed to Gaza's border crossings with Israel and Egypt in 2017, a move that largely opened up Rafah for two-way traffic, after Egyptian mediation led to a Palestinian reconciliation deal, which has since faltered.
On Sunday, the PA announced its pullout from Rafah, accusing Hamas of undermining its operations and detaining some of its workers. Since May, the crossing has been operating daily after sporadic openings for many years.
Upon arriving in Gaza, Hani Abu Sharekh told Reuters he hoped Egypt would soon resume full operation of the facility to allow passengers out of the coastal enclave.
""There is no alternative to Rafah crossing, it is the only window for most of our people to travel and to seek treatment and education,"" Abu Sharekh, 48, said after returning from a trip to Cairo where his wife had received medical treatment.
Hamas said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the PA and has imposed a series of economic sanctions on Gaza to press the group to cede power, was destroying prospects for unity.
PASSAGE 
A Palestinian official who maintains close contacts with Egypt said Cairo had decided to open Rafah crossing only to Palestinians returning to Gaza, after the PA personnel withdrew.
Egypt's restriction, the official said, showed its ""disappointment at the faltering of the 2017 reconciliation agreement"". But an Egyptian official in Cairo said he did not expect Rafah to be shut completely.
""Egypt recognizes the importance of the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the Rafah crossing is an important access point for Palestinians,"" the official said, adding that his country would not abandon its mediation efforts.
Brigadier-General Yehya Hammad, the Hamas-appointed director of the crossing, told Reuters his men completed their deployment and were ready to operate the passage.
After they took up their posts, the body of a Palestinian who had died in Cairo and two women accompanying the coffin were allowed to enter Gaza. The women's passports were stamped by Hamas officers. A first bus with passengers from Egypt then arrived, with more expected later in the day.
""We hope the Egyptian side will open the crossing permanently as it did in the past to allow stranded patients, students, residents of third countries and humanitarian cases to travel,"" said Hammad, standing in the passport hall.

(This has been refiled to add the word 'not' that was dropped in paragraph 12.)

Prosecutors said on Tuesday the suspect, identified only as Alaa S. under Germany's privacy laws, stabbed the man during a quarrel in the eastern city of Chemnitz. 
The killing in August touched off violent clashes between neo-Nazis and police as well as demonstrations by far-right groups opposed to Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2015 decision to welcome almost 1 million asylum seekers.
The violence highlighted the depth of a divide created by Merkel's decision to let in the migrants, mostly Muslims from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
German authorities have also issued an international arrest warrant for an Iraqi suspect, identified as Farhad R.A, who is on the run after going into hiding after the incident in Chemnitz.
He is also suspected of stabbing the Cuban-German victim.
Prosecutors said on Tuesday they would soon make a decision on their case against a third suspect in the killing, an Iraqi who was freed on bail by a court in September, pending further inquiries.

The change in protocol for a close U.S. ally means the bloc's Washington-based diplomats are less likely to be invited to high-profile events and have a lower importance than under former President Barack Obama.
The snub, first reported by German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, was illustrated at the Dec. 5 funeral of another former U.S. president, George H.W. Bush, when Europe's envoy was among the last diplomats to be called to pay respects, one EU official said.
""We understand that there was a recent change in the way the diplomatic precedence list is implemented by the United States' protocol,"" a Commission spokeswoman told a briefing, declining to give more details. 
""We are currently discussing with the relevant services in the administration possible implications for the EU delegation in Washington.""
Two other EU diplomats confirmed the downgrade, with one saying it was unlikely the bloc would retaliate given its desire for good relations.
U.S. diplomats in Brussels were not immediately available for comment. 
Trump has often shown his disdain for the EU and has backed Britain's planned departure from the bloc.
But the United States and EU have the world's biggest bilateral trade ties, and U.S. investment in the bloc is three times higher than in Asia, according to EU data.
While the shift does not stop senior EU officials from meeting U.S. counterparts, it follows a tumultuous year for transatlantic ties. Trump withdrew from several international agreements backed by the EU and vowed to reform ""the liberal international order"" he says the bloc helps underpin. 
In a speech in Brussels in December, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump's ""America First"" policy was reshaping the post-World War Two system on the basis of sovereign states, not multilateral institutions.

He also took aim at ""bureaucrats"" responsible for upholding multilateralism ""as an end in itself"" and cast doubt on the EU's commitment to its citizens, drawing a rare rebuke from the European Commission, the bloc's executive.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Representatives of a leading Congolese presidential candidate, Felix Tshisekedi, have met with outgoing President Joseph Kabila's camp to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, Tshisekedi's campaign said on Tuesday.
Kabila's camp, however, denied that any such meetings had occurred since the Dec. 30 election, for which provisional results are expected to be announced later this week. 
The election is meant to bring about Congo's first democratic transition in 59 years of independence, but tensions are rising as some in the opposition accuse the government of trying to rig the vote.
Another disputed result could trigger the kind of violence that erupted after the 2006 and 2011 elections and destabilize Congo's eastern borderlands with Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, where dozen of militia groups are active. 
Tshisekedi ran against Kabila's hand-picked candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, and another opposition leader, Martin Fayulu, whom pre-election polls showed with a healthy lead.
Media reports of contacts between Tshisekedi and Kabila's camps have drawn the suspicion of some Fayulu supporters. They fear Kabila may be looking to negotiate a power-sharing agreement with Tshisekedi if, as most diplomats believe, Shadary trails in the results. 
At a news conference, the secretary-general of Tshisekedi's political party, the UDPS, said that contacts between the two camps were conducive to national reconciliation and that the UDPS ""is opposed to any policy of score-settling"". 
""The two individuals (Kabila and Tshisekedi) have an interest in meeting to prepare for the peaceful and civilized transfer of power,"" Jean-Marc Kabund said. 
Tshisekedi's spokesman, Vidiye Tshimanga, later said Kabila and Tshisekedi had not met personally since the election but that their representatives had convened several times. 
Kabila is due to step down later this month after 18 years in power. His refusal to go when his mandate officially expired in 2016 sparked protests in which security forces killed dozens of people. 
Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi, one of Kabila's senior advisers and a spokesman for Shadary, denied that there had been any contacts with Tshisekedi or his representatives. 
In its own news conference on Tuesday, the ruling coalition accused Fayulu's campaign and Congo's Catholic bishops of trying to stoke post-election violence in the vast, mineral-rich central African country. 
Last week, the bishops said they knew the winner of the election, a declaration widely seen as a warning to authorities against rigging the vote. [nL8N1Z43N7] 
Kabund referred to Tshisekedi on Tuesday as the ""presumptive winner"", but did not say what he was basing that on. Shadary's camp said it expected to win while Fayulu's campaign also said he was in a strong position to come out on top.

106,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>",Syrian jihadists press attack on Turkish-backed rebels,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A jihadist assault gained ground on Tuesday against Turkish-backed rebels in northwest Syria, edging closer to frontlines with government forces, a rebel official and a war monitor said. 
The advance raises questions about the fate of September's demilitarization deal between Turkey and Russia, which staved off a Syrian army offensive against the Idlib region. 
Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS), spearheaded by al Qaeda's former Syrian affiliate, is expanding its grip over the insurgent enclave, which includes Idlib province and adjacent bits of Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces. 
Idlib lies in Syria's northwest corner, the last opposition stronghold, where Turkish forces are stationed. It borders territory that Turkey-backed rebels control near the Turkish frontier.
The main Turkish-backed rebel force, the National Army, has deployed along fronts close to the jihadists to repel any new militant advance towards them.
National Army spokesman Major Youssef Hamoud said HTS militants seized four villages in al-Ghab plain from rival rebels on Tuesday. 
""We call on (the rebel factions) inside Idlib to launch an operation so that we can try to open a new front and relieve some pressure off them,"" he said. 
He said HTS jihadsists, who launched their offensive last week, were preparing to march towards the key towns of Ariha and Maarat al-Numan in Idlib. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said fierce battles raged in al-Ghab plain. The British-based monitoring group said if HTS did take Ariha, Maarat al-Numan and some villages in between, it would effectively control all Idlib. 
The fighting was taking place inside a buffer zone that the Russian-Turkish deal had established along the front lines, the Observatory and a resident said. 
The resident of Sahl al-Ghab said Turkish-backed factions had ""no option but to fight to the death"". 
""The factions are enclosed in a very small area."" HTS gains had displaced some civilians towards government territory, the resident added.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - On Sunday morning, a new Twitter account was created by an 18-year-old Saudi woman denied entry into Thailand as she fled from what she said was an abusive family. 
The first message from Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, in Arabic, was at 3:20 a.m. Thai time (2020 GMT Saturday) and posted from the transit area of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport. It said: ""I am the girl who escaped Kuwait to Thailand. My life is in real danger if I am forced to return to Saudi Arabia.""
Within hours, a campaign sprung up on Twitter dubbed #SaveRahaf. Spread by a loose network of activists around the world, within 36 hours it prompted Thailand's government to reverse a decision to force the young woman onto a plane that would return her to her family.
Qunun was allowed to enter Thailand and on Tuesday was beginning the process of seeking asylum in a third country through the U.N. refugee agency.
""Everybody was watching. When social media works, this is what happens,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, of the international outcry.
Qunun's family could not be reached to respond to her allegations of abuse. Reuters could not directly contact Qunun, but spoke to several confidants who described how the dramatic campaign unfolded across the world.
After her initial Tweet, Qunun posted nearly non-stop for five hours, saying she had been abused and threatened by her family.
Halfway around the world, retweets by Saudi Twitter users were noticed by Egyptian-American activist Mona Eltahawy in Montreal who began translating and retweeting Qunun's Arabic tweets at 4 a.m. Thailand time, even though she was initially unsure if the account was authentic.
""(I was) doing my best to get attention to her because I could not live with myself if she was real and I ignored it,"" Eltahawy told Reuters in an e-mail.
BANGKOK, MONTREAL, SYDNEY
About two hours later - 6 a.m. Sunday morning in Thailand but mid-afternoon in Australia - a Sydney-based video journalist noticed and retweeted Eltahawy's translated messages.
The journalist, Sophie McNeill of Australia Broadcast Corp., began tweeting back to Qunun, and later the two began privately corresponding by direct message. 
At 11 a.m. on Sunday in Thailand - eight hours after Qunun began tweeting - Human Rights Watch's Robertson, who is based in Bangkok, also began tweeting about the case.
He also contacted Qunun directly and she replied.
""She said very clearly that she has suffered both physical and psychological abuse. She said she has made a decision to renounce Islam. And I knew once she said that, she is in serious trouble,"" Robertson told Reuters.
Renouncing Islam is a crime punishable by death under the Saudi system of sharia, or Islamic law, though the punishment has not been carried out in recent memory.
By early Sunday afternoon, Robertson had notified the U.N. refugee agency in Thailand and several foreign embassies about the unfolding case, and they began to contact Thai authorities.
BARRICADED DOOR
At around the same time, journalist McNeill decided to fly to Thailand and try to meet Qunun.
""I'd never spoken to her before,"" she told Reuters. ""For me, it was so important that this was documented, and I wanted to be there and witness it.""
While McNeill boarded a flight from Sydney to Bangkok, Qunun was holed up in an airport transit hotel and afraid she would be forced onto the next flight back to Kuwait. She continued tweeting and also corresponding with Robertson of Human Rights Watch.
At around 5 p.m. Sunday, she was taken out of her room by Thai officials but later allowed to return. 
""She filmed these two people talking to her,"" said Robertson. ""They said to her very clearly that they will put her on the Kuwait Airways flight KU 412 leaving (Monday) at 11:15 a.m.""
By this time, global media outlets had picked up on the story and Thai immigration officials were confirming that Qunun was to be expelled on Monday morning.
At about 1 a.m. Monday morning, Qunun posted a video of herself pushing a table to barricade her hotel room door.
THREATENING LANGUAGE
McNeill arrived in Thailand early on Monday and managed to join Qunun in her hotel room.
""When it became clear that she wasn't going to leave, I decided it was important to stay and have someone documenting what was going on,"" McNeill said.
Qunun refused to open the door when various officials came to escort her to the Kuwait Airways flight.
""We were inside the room and there were numerous people coming to the door ... There were several Arabic speakers who came and were using threatening language to try and force her back on the plane,"" McNeill recalled.
The flight to Kuwait City left without Qunun.
At 3:30 p.m. on Monday, Thailand's immigration chief Surachate Hakparn held a press conference at the airport for dozens of Thai and international media representatives gathered in the transit area.
After a day of insisting that Qunun must be sent back under Thai law, Surachate said she would not be immediately be expelled since she could be in danger and he would meet U.N. officials to discuss her case.
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) country representative Giuseppe de Vincentiis arrived at the airport at about 5 p.m. on Monday to meet Thai officials and Qunun herself. 
By about 7:30 p.m on Monday, Surachate told reporters Qunun would be allowed to enter Thailand and apply for asylum in a third country.
The UNHCR said on Tuesday that it would take time to process Qunun's application, and its officials continued to interview her at an undisclosed location. 
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday denied on its Twitter account that its embassy in Thailand had asked for Qunun to be extradited, although Surachate had said the previous day the embassy had been in contact with Thai immigration before her arrival from Kuwait.
The Saudi embassy in Bangkok declined to comment on Qunun's case when contacted by Reuters on Monday and could not be reached on Tuesday.
But on Tuesday, the Thai immigration office released a video clip of its officials meeting Saudi diplomats to discuss the case.
""When she first arrived in Thailand, she opened a new site (account) and the followers reached about 45,000 within one day,"" a Saudi official speaking in Arabic through a translator tells Thai officials in the video.

""I wish you had taken her phone, it would have been better than (taking) her passport,"" the official said.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Afghan Taliban said on Tuesday they had called off peace talks with U.S. officials in Qatar this week due to an ""agenda disagreement"", especially over the involvement of Afghan officials as well as a possible ceasefire and prisoner exchange.
Two days of peace talks had been set to start on Wednesday, Taliban officials told Reuters earlier, but the hardline Islamic militant group had refused to allow ""puppet"" Afghan officials to join.
The war in Afghanistan is America's longest overseas military intervention. It has cost Washington nearly a trillion dollars and killed tens of thousands of people.
""The U.S. officials insisted that the Taliban should meet the Afghan authorities in Qatar and both sides were in disagreement over declaring a ceasefire in 2019,"" a Taliban source told Reuters.
""Both sides have agreed to not meet in Qatar.""
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said earlier the two sides were still working on the technical details and were not clear on the agenda for the talks.
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the cancellation.
The talks, which would have been the fourth round with U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, would have involved a U.S. withdrawal, prisoner exchange and the lifting of a ban on movement of Taliban leaders, a Taliban leader had told Reuters.
Taliban sources said that they had demanded U.S. authorities release 25,000 prisoners and they would free 3,000, but that U.S. officials were not keen to discuss the exchange at this stage.
""We would never announce any ceasefire until and unless we achieve major gains on the ground. We have the feeling that Zalmay Khalilzad doesn't have enough power to make important decisions,"" a second Taliban official said.
The Taliban said Khalilzad would visit the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and China to continue the discussion. Khalilzad's office was not available for a comment.
The Taliban have rejected repeated requests from regional powers to allow Afghan officials to take part in the talks, insisting that the United States is their main adversary in the 17-year war.
The insurgents, seeking to reimpose strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster by U.S.-led troops, called off a meeting with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia this week because of Riyadh's insistence on bringing the Western-backed Afghan government to the table.
Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the UAE took part in the last round of talks in December.
Western diplomats based in Kabul said Pakistan's cooperation in the peace process will be crucial to its success. Independent security analysts and diplomats said the neighboring country's powerful military has kept close ties with the Afghan Taliban.
U.S. officials have accused Pakistan of providing safe haven to Taliban militants in its border regions and using them as an arm of its foreign policy. Pakistan denies the claim.
The United States, which sent troops to Afghanistan in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and at the peak of the deployment had more than 100,000 troops in the country, withdrew most of its forces in 2014.
It keeps around 14,000 troops there as part of a NATO-led mission aiding Afghan security forces and hunting militants.
Reports last month about U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan triggered uncertainty in Kabul which depends on the United States and other foreign powers for military support and training. 
As peace talks gained momentum a draft agreement drawn up by the influential U.S. think tank RAND Corporation outlining the clauses for a potential peace deal was circulated among Afghan officials and diplomats in Kabul. 
The document, reviewed by Reuters, suggests that the United States and NATO withdraw their military missions in phases over an expected period of 18 months. It adds that the United States may continue providing civilian assistance.

The U.S. court on Monday declined to hear an appeal by producers that also included a Canadian non-profit organization that represents duck and goose farmers, clearing the ban on a product that French lawmakers recognized in 2006 as part the European country's ""cultural and gastronomic heritage"".
France is by far the world's largest foie gras producer with a market share of about 70 percent. 
""It is unacceptable that such a decision, taken under the influence of the lobbying of some activists orchestrating regular misinformation on our products to advocate dogmatic vegetarianism, could endanger the image of an emblematic dish of the French art of living,"" Michel Fruchet, head of French foie gras producers group Cifog, said in a statement on Tuesday.
French foie gras producers mainly export to Japan, Spain, the Netherlands and the Middle East, but none have been cleared to export to the United States.
Foie gras is made from the livers of geese or ducks that have been fattened with grain by force-feeding. 

Sold whole or as a pate, it is considered a gourmet food in Western and Asian cuisine, but production through force-feeding has often been criticized as cruel by animal rights activists.

LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers called on the police on Tuesday to do more to tackle intimidation of politicians and journalists outside parliament after protesters shouted verbal abuse at a prominent pro-EU Conservative during live television interviews.
More than 2-1/2 years since Britain voted by 52 to 48 percent to leave the European Union, the country remains deeply divided and both pro-Brexit and pro-EU protesters are a regular fixture in the gardens opposite parliament.
Some campaigners wrap themselves in huge EU flags while others hold banners on long poles so they can be seen in the background of temporary broadcast studios on raised platforms. 
The area, a public space, is regularly used by media for interviews and while protests have been largely peaceful, politicians and journalists have complained the atmosphere has turned increasingly nasty in recent weeks.
On Monday, Conservative lawmaker Anna Soubry, who has called for a second referendum on Brexit, faced chants of ""Soubry is a Nazi"" and ""liar"" as she was interviewed.
""I do object to being called a Nazi,"" Soubry interrupted the interview to say. ""I just think this is astonishing. This is what has happened to our country.""
The abuse continued as Soubry walked back across the road to parliament after the interview, with mobile phone footage shared on Twitter showing her surrounded by men, some sporting the yellow vests similar to those worn by protesters in Paris, shouting ""liar"", ""fascist"" and ""scum"" at her.
Sky News journalist Kay Burley, one of the broadcasters whose interview with Soubry was overshadowed by the protests, has also faced abuse and says she now has security protection.
In a letter to the Commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, a group of 60 lawmakers said they were concerned about the ""deteriorating public order and security situation"" around parliament.
""An ugly element of individuals with strong far right and extreme right connections ... have increasingly engaged in intimidatory and potentially criminal acts,"" the lawmakers, both pro-EU and pro-Brexit and from all political parties, wrote.
House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he too has written to police on the issue.
""UNLEASHING SUCH UGLINESS""
Laurence Taylor, Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Met Operations, said there was an ""appropriate policing plan in place"" around parliament and police were assessing whether any crimes had been committed.
""We will deal robustly with incidents of harassment and abuse against anyone where that harassment or abuse constitutes a criminal offence,"" he said in a statement. 
Labour lawmaker Stephen Doughty, who organized the letter, told BBC TV that there could be a repeat of the murder of Labour lawmaker Jo Cox, killed in a frenzied street attack a week before the 2016 Brexit vote by a man obsessed with Nazis and extreme right-wing ideology.
Last year, a man accused of being a member of a far-right group pleaded guilty to plotting to kill another female Labour lawmaker who, like Cox, was targeted because she was perceived as supporting immigration. 
Abuse has taken place across the political divide, with left-wing author and Labour supporter Owen Jones also posting a video on Twitter of protesters shouting insults like ""traitor"" at him as he walked down the street outside parliament.
While many of those facing abuse have been supporters of remaining in the EU, pro-Brexit campaigners have also been targeted.
In September, Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent campaigner for Brexit, was confronted outside his home by activists who told his children ""your daddy is a horrible person"" and ""lots of people hate him"".

114,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>",Austria to loosen ban on dual citizenship for Brexit-hit nationals,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria will create an exception to its ban on dual citizenship for its nationals living in Britain facing the prospect of Brexit, its foreign minister said on Tuesday, leaving open whether it would do the same for Britons in Austria.
Austria is one of just a handful of European Union countries that ordinarily bans dual citizenship. Austrians who acquire citizenship in another country usually lose their Austrian nationality, and foreigners are expected to give up other passports if they become Austrians.
There are exceptions to that long-standing ban, and the conservative and far-right coalition government plans to create a new one for the roughly 25,000 Austrians who have made Britain their home, Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl said.
Kneissl told a news conference she would bring up the issue at a cabinet meeting later this week.
Asked whether such an exception would also be created for Britons in Austria, Kneissl said: ""That is an interesting question"" but there was no such plan. Around 11,000 British citizens live in Austria.
The question of what will happen in the event of Britain crashing out of the bloc without a withdrawal agreement governing everything from flying rights to the status of either side's nationals has come into focus as Britain's parliament appears unwilling to approve a deal negotiated with the EU.
Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that Britain would be in uncharted territory if parliament rejected her Brexit deal in a vote that she has already delayed and now plans to hold around Jan. 15.
Britain has announced a new online system https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families which it says will be up and running by March 30, to let EU citizens apply for ""settled status"" to stay after Brexit.

A German Interior Ministry spokesman said on Monday that British citizens will retain their residence rights in Germany for a three-month period, with further extensions possible, if their country leaves the EU without an exit deal.

Critics have called the proposal, contained in a Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019, blatantly anti-Muslim and an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to boost its Hindu voter base ahead of a general election due by May.
The bill seeks to give citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, who came to India before Dec. 31, 2014.
""They have no place to go except India,"" Home Minister Rajnath Singh told parliament. ""The beneficiaries of the bill can reside in any state of the country."" 
But there is significant opposition to the proposal, in particular from the northeastern state of Assam, where residents have for years complained that immigrants from Bangladesh have put a big strain on resources.
But Singh tried to reassure Assam it would not have to bear any burden alone.
""The burden of those persecuted migrants will be shared by the whole country. Assam alone should not have to bear the entire burden,"" he said.

Members of religious minorities often face discrimination and sometimes violence at the hands of militant members of Muslim majorities, particularly in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

A cheery illustrated banner on a new government website sits atop links to information on how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit that critics have said could cause food and medicine shortages, long border delays and widespread economic disruption.
On Tuesday, the government launched the https://euexit.campaign.gov.uk site with a low-key public information campaign consisting of adverts on commercial radio stations and tweets from some government departments.
A radio advert broadcast on LBC radio at around 0530 GMT featured a range of voice actors asking questions about renewing passports, mobile phone charges, and exporting goods. It directed them to the new website for answers.
The site covers all exit scenarios and includes previously published advice on topics ranging from new restrictions on taking pets on holiday, to extra paperwork when importing goods from the bloc.
With less than three months until Britain leaves the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to win parliamentary approval for her Brexit deal, increasing the chances that the country ends up leaving without a deal.
A no-deal exit is the default scenario if May's deal is rejected, and the prospect of supply chain disruption and blocked ports has in recent weeks pushed companies and the government to ramp up contingency planning.
Some Brexit supporters say a no-deal exit is the only way to truly leave the bloc, and that warnings of the economic consequences have been overblown to drum up support for May's deal. 
The department in charge of no-deal planning did little to herald the launch of the information campaign on Tuesday, but has previously said it would be stepped up in coming weeks to include billboard advertisements and other media.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in replaced his chief of staff, who played a major role in improving ties with North Korea, with a longtime confidant on Tuesday as part of a shake-up aimed at raising approval ratings amid economic woes and a spy scandal.
Moon replaced Im Jong-seok with Noh Young-min, a former politician who has been serving as ambassador to China since October 2017, as the top presidential secretary, the presidential office said. 
Yoon Do-han, a former journalist, was made press secretary, while former lawmaker Kang Gi-jung will be the senior secretary for political affairs, the office, known as the Blue House, said.
Noh and Kang worked on Moon's presidential campaign in the run-up to the 2017 snap election. 
The three posts do not require confirmation hearings.
""The Moon administration may not be good enough to satisfy the people's expectations, but the president's determination has never wavered over the past 20 months,"" Im told reporters.
""There will be even bigger hardships and challenges internally and outside, but please support him so he can win through with the people.""
The reshuffle is seen aimed at revitalizing momentum for an administration facing faltering approval ratings and the spying scandal, which have both eroded Moon's popularity and undermined his reform drive.
The Blue House has been grappling with allegations that it has spied on political foes and officials from previous administrations while interfering in personnel management at private businesses.
The scandal was triggered by a former investigator on an anti-corruption team set up by Moon after a corruption scandal led to the impeachment and ouster of his predecessor.
FALLING RATINGS
Moon's office says the spying accusations are groundless but it sacked all of the anti-corruption team members, citing wrongdoing including being treated by businessmen to rounds of golf in breach of the law.
Moon's dismissal of opposition demands that he sack Im and a senior secretary overseeing the team, had led in November to a parliamentary boycott.
Moon's pick of Noh, who served three terms in parliament, was seen aimed at improving relations with the parliamentary opposition, who are also refusing to ratify an agreement made at a historic inter-Korean summit in April. 
Among Moon's key tasks this year is boosting the economy and a sluggish job market and hosting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on an unprecedented trip to Seoul. 
Kim's visit was planned last year but delayed amid stalled nuclear talks between North Korea and the United States, which South Korea has been trying to encourage.
U.S. President Donald Trump has raised the possibility of a second summit with Kim, some time this year.
Moon's approval ratings have dropped to their lowest since he took office in May 2017 on the back of frustration over economic policies and lackluster progress on North Korea's denuclearization.
North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, but relations have warmed significantly since the North sent a delegation to the Winter Olympics in the South last year.
    Im, a former student democracy activist who served a three-and-a-half year prison term for orchestrating an unauthorized 1989 visit by a fellow campaigner to North Korea, played a pivotal role in the detente between the two Koreas. 

    The Blue House did not announce Im's next posting, but he was widely expected to seek a return to politics through next year's parliamentary election.

131,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2019 05:07AM ET</span>","Father of Saudi teen asylum seeker in Thailand, seeks meeting","By Panu Wongcha-um
BANGKOK (Reuters) - The father of an 18-year-old Saudi woman asylum seeker who fled to Thailand saying she feared her family would kill her, has arrived in Bangkok and wants to meet his daughter, Thailand's immigration chief said on Tuesday.
But Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun's father and brother would have to wait and see whether the UN refugee agency would allow them to see her, immigration chief Surachate Hakpan said.
""The father and brother want to go and talk to Rahaf but the U.N. will need to approve such talk,"" Surachate told reporters.
The U.N. refugee agency on Tuesday said it was investigating Qunun's case after she fled to Thailand saying she feared her family would kill her if she were sent back to Saudi Arabia.
Activists are concerned about what Saudi Arabia will do after Thai authorities reversed a decision to expel her and allowed Qunun to enter the country under the care of the UNHCR. 
""The father is now here in Thailand and that's a source of concern,"" Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch's deputy director for Asia, told Reuters.
""We have no idea what he is going to do ... whether he will try to find out where she is and go harass her. We don't know whether he is going to try to get the embassy to do that.""
Qunun is staying in a Bangkok hotel while the UNHCR processes her application for refugee status, before she can seek asylum in a third country. 
UNHCR staff were interviewing her on Tuesday after meeting her the day before.
""It could take several days to process the case and determine next steps,"" UNHCR's Thailand representative Giuseppe de Vincentiis said in a statement.
""We are very grateful that the Thai authorities did not send back (Qunun) against her will and are extending protection to her,"" he said.
The case has drawn new global attention to Saudi Arabia's strict social rules, including a requirement that women have the permission of a male ""guardian"" to travel, which rights groups say can trap women and girls as prisoners of abusive families.
It comes at a time when Riyadh is facing unusually intense scrutiny from its Western allies over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October and over the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen.
'FAMILY MATTER' 
Qunun told the world of her dramatic plight on social media, drawing widespread support and concern, which convinced Thai authorities to back down from deporting her back to Saudi Arabia.
She was finally allowed to enter Thailand late on Monday after spending 48 hours at Bangkok airport, some of it barricaded in a transit lounge hotel room.
Lawmakers and activists in Australia and Britain have urged their governments to grant asylum to Qunun.
The Australian government said it had asked Thailand and the UNHCR to process Qunun's claim quickly, and it would consider her application for a humanitarian visa once the UNHCR had made its decision 
Saudi Arabia's embassy in Thailand denied reports that Riyadh had requested her extradition.
""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has not asked for her extradition. The embassy considers this issue a family matter,"" the embassy said in a post on Twitter.
The Thai immigration chief said on Monday the embassy had alerted Thai authorities to the case, and said that the woman had run away from her parents and they feared for her safety.
A woman in Britain had launched an online petition calling on Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to grant Qunun asylum and issue her an emergency travel document. 

Within hours of launching the petition it had secured thousands of signatures.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru Attorney General Pedro Chavarry said he would resign on Tuesday amid a mounting public outcry over his handling of the high-profile corruption investigation involving Brazilian builder Odebrecht.
Chavarry´s decision comes little more than a week after he dismissed two lead prosecutors from the inquiry, a move that prompted widespread scorn and a threat from President Martin Vizcarra to suspend him.
Chavarry denied accusations that he was trying to meddle in the investigation and later reinstated the two prosecutors, both admired in Peru as anti-corruption crusaders.
But the reversal was not enough to placate many Peruvians, who have continued to protest Chavarry´s leadership.
Late on Monday night, Chavarry said in a statement he would present his resignation from Peru´s Public Ministry Tuesday at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) out of ""respect for my institution.""
Chavarry´s decision marks a key victory for President Vizcarra, who last week sent Congress legislation to suspend Chavarry from his post. 
Vizcarra, who took office to replace former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski after his resignation due to a graft scandal last year, has made fighting corruption a focus of his government. 
The two prosecutors initially dismissed by Chavarry, Rafael Vela and Jose Domingo Perez, are seen as pivotal figures in the Odebrecht investigation. 
The two had recently drawn up a plea deal that committed the Brazilian construction company to provide evidence on about $30 million in bribes it acknowledges it paid to local politicians.
Odebrecht is at the center of the ""Car Wash"" investigation in Brazil, which has rippled across Latin America and which U.S. prosecutors have said is the biggest political graft scheme ever uncovered. 

In 2016, Odebrecht acknowledged it had paid millions of dollars in bribes to officials in a dozen countries to secure public works contracts dating back over a decade. The company has committed to paying billions of dollars in fines.

BEIJING (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, only days after warning he may take an alternative path if the United States does not ease sanctions and pressure on his country. 
The visit, confirmed by North Korean and Chinese state media, will likely lead to Kim's fourth summit with Xi in the past year and comes amid plans for a second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.
Kim held three summits last year with Xi, his most important ally, before and after summits with Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. ""Kim is eager to remind the Trump administration that he does have diplomatic and economic options besides what Washington and Seoul can offer,"" Harry J. Kazianis, Director of Defense Studies at U.S.-based Center for the National Interest said in an e-mailed statement. 
""In fact, during his New Year's Day speech, Kim's 'new way' that he referred to may well have been a veiled threat to move closer to Beijing. That should make America quite concerned."" 
Kim left for China on a private train on Monday afternoon accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, and senior North Korean officials, including Kim Yong Chol, a key negotiator in talks with the United States, and foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency said. 
China's official Xinhua news agency confirmed that Kim was visiting from Monday to Thursday at Xi's invitation.
A green train with a yellow stripe similar to one Kim took to Beijing last year arrived at a station in the Chinese capital on Tuesday morning amid tight security, though it was not clear if Kim and his party were on board. A motorcade with heavy security later drove through central Beijing.
The visit coincided with what South Korean officials say is Kim's 35th birthday on Tuesday.
Kim's visit to North Korea's most important economic and diplomatic ally, which was first reported by South Korean media, follows reports of advanced negotiations for a second summit between Washington and Pyongyang aimed at resolving the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program. 
Kim said in his New Year speech he was ready to meet Trump any time to achieve their common goal of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. But he warned that he may seek an alternative path if U.S. sanctions and pressure against the country continued.
'GOOD PARTNER' 
In an interview with CNBC on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China's support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the U.S. trade dispute with China would affect this.
Kim's visit comes as a U.S. delegation opened a second day of talks with Chinese counterparts in Beijing aimed at ending the trade war between the world's two largest economies. 
""The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,"" Pompeo said.
""Their behavior has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea's nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so.""
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked during a daily briefing whether there was a connection between the trade talks and the possibility of another meeting between Kim and Trump, said China believed contact between the United States and North Korea was important. 
""China has always supported both sides to continue to hold talks and to reach a positive outcome,"" Lu said. 
When asked if Kim's delegation might have contact with the U.S. trade delegation in Beijing, Lu said the two groups were not on the same level. 
Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said Kim's trip would have no direct influence on the progress of trade talks. 
""From the other prospective, this is something that can indirectly be used to show the United States that China is not playing without any cards in hand,"" Shi said.
He added that Kim would ""certainly call on Xi Jinping to give North Korea more economic assistance"". 
South Korea's presidential Blue House spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said separately on Thursday that South Korea hoped Kim's visit would contribute to efforts to secure permanent peace on the peninsula. 
""We especially hope that the exchange between China and North Korea this time will be a stepping stone for the second North Korea-U.S. summit,"" Kim said. 
While no details were released about an agenda in China, the North Korean leader has been seeking relief from sanctions, a peace declaration to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War and more investment. 
Ties between China and North Korea, which had frayed as Pyongyang stepped up its missile and nuclear tests up to late 2017, warmed over the past year as Kim engaged with China, South Korea and the United States.

HONG KONG/HARBIN, China (Reuters) - At the Siberia Tiger Park in the frigid Chinese city of Harbin, visitors can learn about the facility's successful breeding program and buy chicken carcasses to toss to around 20 tigers pacing the snow flecked ground of their enclosure.
At the park gates, a shop sells liquor soaked with tiger bones for up to $1,000 a bottle.
China has made significant strides in wildlife protection in recent years, including a total ban on ivory and plans to open one of the world’s largest reserves for wild tigers in northeast China in 2020.
But it also has formidable, profit-driven wildlife business interests that risk undermining progress on protecting the endangered big cats, conservationists say.
“The industry occupies a strategic position which concentrates in the country’s less developed regions where poverty reduction remains a top priority of the local authorities,"" said Houston-based Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist at Humane Society International.
Operators of tiger breeding farms have told state media that without the ability to sell bones, skins and meat they are not be able to cover the high costs of running their parks and carry out key conservation plans endorsed by the national government.
After pressure from some breeders, China's State Council said in October it would replace a 1993 ban on the trade of tiger bones and rhino horn, opening up exceptions under ""special circumstances"", including medical research.
But in November, Beijing postponed the move following widespread protests from conservation groups who worry any resumption in the legal trade of tiger parts will be a death knell for the species by enabling the laundering of wild animal parts into farmed supplies.
Conservationists also argue that no captive Chinese bred tigers have been released into the wild and there is no scientific or medical need to use rhino horn and tiger bone in traditional Chinese medicine.
Still, lifting the ban is backed by China's powerful State Forestry and Grassland Administration.
“If rhino horns and tiger bones can be used for medicinal purposes, and their use causes zero harm to the two endangered species in the wild, why should we oppose it?” Tang Xiaoping, an executive at the administration was quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper.
The Forestry and Grasslands administration did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
PROFIT-DRIVEN BUSINESS
At the Siberia Tiger Park, tiger bone wine is sold openly and is recognized by the Forestry Bureau and Commerce Ministry, according to a sales representative in the store. However, the park is not allowed to publicly promote it due to the sensitivity of the situation, the sales rep said. Officials at the park declined to comment on the record.
The wine, which ranges in price from 280 yuan-6,888 yuan, ($40-$1,003) is displayed in large glass cabinets and also sold on China's Twitter-like WeChat.
Park executives, officials and conservation experts say tiger parks have been accumulating stocks of animal skin and bone in freezers, with the aim of selling it for medicinal use in the future.
Conservation groups estimate there are now over 6,500 farmed tigers at some 200 facilities in China and around 40 farmed rhinos. Chinese media say tiger bone can fetch 5,000-9,000 yuan ($727-$1,308) per kg - tens of thousands of dollars per animal.
The World Wildlife Fund believes there are only around 40-50 wild tigers left in China out of around 3,900 globally.
Debate over lifting the ban on tiger trade comes as China seeks to develop its traditional medicine industry, worth some $50 billion annually, and position it as a key pillar of its ‘One Belt One Road’ strategy.
The World Health Organization is set to recognize traditional Chinese medicine for the first time next year in its global medical compendium according to Nature International Journal of Science, citing the governing body.
CASH STRAPPED
The Siberian Tiger Park has more than 1,300 tigers spread across three locations. Selling tiger bone wine is a way to subsidize the daily expenses of the park, said one of the park’s tour guides.
Currently, visitor fees are the parks' main source of income, along with government subsidies. Ticket prices are 100 yuan and visitors can pay extra to feed the tigers. A menu of meat displays prices for a live chicken at 120 yuan while a raw cutlet is 10 yuan.
In a CCTV documentary shown in November, Liu Dan, the chief engineer of the Northeast Tiger Forest park, near China’s border with Russia, says his 1,000-plus tigers each eat around 3,000 yuan ($435) worth of chicken per month.
Liu, who has raised tigers for over 30 years and has repeatedly called for the ban on trading tiger parts to be lifted, told state media that government tax breaks are not enough for the park to be financially viable. Currently, parks make most of their money from visitors.
Liu and the park declined to comment for this article.
Chinese medicine experts say there is no need to use tiger bone and rhino horn in treatments as substitutes are readily available.
Tiger bone, for example, is often used to treat arthritis and joint pain, but there are dozens of other herbs with similar properties, said Eric Karchmer, chief medicine officer at Dao Labs.
Lixin Huang, the president of the American College of Traditional medicine, said a reversal of the ban would create a huge challenge for the Chinese medicine community.
“We stopped using it 25 years ago. We don’t understand. I don’t think the Chinese medicine community and medical professionals would understand.”

LONDON (Reuters) - British and European officials are discussing the possibility of extending the formal exit process from the European Union amid fears a Brexit deal will not be approved by March 29, The Daily Telegraph reported, citing unidentified sources.
The Telegraph cited three unidentified EU sources as saying British officials had been ""putting out feelers"" and ""testing the waters"" on an extension of Article 50, a part of the Lisbon Treaty which sets out the conditions for leaving the EU.
Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out delaying Brexit, though she has also warned lawmakers that if they reject her deal then Brexit could be derailed or that the United Kingdom could leave without a deal.
""We are leaving the European Union on the 29th of March,"" British Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said when asked about the Telegraph report. ""We are not looking to extend.""
When asked directly if he denied the report, Barclay said: ""Yes, because I can be very clear that the government's policy is to leave on March 29.""
He added that extending the Article 50 exit process was not a unilateral decision for the United Kingdom. Extending would require the unanimous agreement of EU heads of state in the European Council.
The future of Brexit remains deeply uncertain as British lawmakers are expected next week to vote down the divorce deal that May struck with the EU in November.
Business chiefs and investors fear leaving the EU without an approved deal would silt up the arteries of trade, spook financial markets and dislocate supply chains for the world's fifth-largest economy.
Besides leaving without a deal or on the terms of May's deal, other options include delaying Brexit, calling a parliamentary election or holding another referendum on EU membership.
EU ASSURANCES
The ultimate Brexit outcome will shape Britain's $2.8 trillion economy, have far-reaching consequences for the unity of the United Kingdom and determine whether London can keep its place as one of the top two global financial centers.
May last month pulled a parliamentary vote on her deal, struck after two years of negotiations and designed to maintain close future ties with the bloc, after admitting it would be heavily defeated.
A new parliamentary vote is due on Jan. 15, though it is unclear what May's next steps would be if the deal is defeated.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said its base case was that May's deal would be defeated at first but a close variant of the deal would eventually be approved by parliament.
May is seeking assurances from the EU on the most controversial part of her deal - an insurance policy to prevent a hard border between EU-member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said the EU is willing to give Britain reassurances about the Irish backstop before British lawmakers vote on May's Brexit deal next week.
""We don't want to trap the UK into anything – we want to get on to the talks about the future relationship right away,"" Varadkar said, the Irish Times reported. ""I think it's those kind of assurances we are happy to give.""

However, Britain's former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who opposes May's deal, said assurances such as proposed by Varadkar would not be enough to convince rebels to support the deal.

The Xicheng government did not give other details of the attack, but posts on social media said the children suffered knife wounds to the head. 
About six police cars were parked outside a hospital near the school, according to a Reuters witness.
Police declined to comment by telephone when asked about the attack.
Violent crime is rare in China but there has been a series of knife and axe attacks in recent years, many targeting children.
In January 2017, a man in southern China stabbed 12 children with a vegetable knife to extract revenge for his life not going as he wanted and a dispute with a neighbor.

The man was executed this month.

The Southeast Asian country suffered its deadliest year in over a decade in 2018, when over 3,000 people died in tsunamis and earthquakes in Sulawesi, Lombok, and West Java and Sumatra islands.
Indonesia straddles the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and sees frequent earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunami, and localized incidents like landslides, floods, and forest fires. 
""The funds have been prepared in anticipation of 2019,"" said Askolani, budgeting director general at the finance ministry.
Five trillion rupiah would be allocated to rehabilitation and reconstruction, while 10 trillion would be reserved for disaster response, said finance ministry spokesman Nufransa Wira Sakti. 
President Joko Widodo, who is running for re-election in April, said on Monday more money will be channeled toward disaster education and response. 
""Given our disaster-prone geographic conditions, we must be prepared, responsive, alert, and resilient in facing any natural disaster,"" he said during the first cabinet meeting of the year. 
Widodo has also called for disaster preparedness to be included in the national school curriculum and for a defunct country-wide early tsunami warning system to be renewed. 
Last year, the finance ministry said it planned to launch a new strategy in 2019 to fund disaster recovery, which could include selling ""catastrophe bonds"". The central government would insure state assets against disaster and then create a disaster risk financing instrument for affected regions to draw upon. 
Last month, 437 people were killed along the coasts of the Sunda Strait after a landslide on Anak Krakatau volcano sent waves up to five meters high crashing into western Java and southern Sumatra.

This followed a double quake-and-tsunami disaster in Sulawesi that killed over 2,000 people in September, and a series of major earthquakes that flattened much of the northern coast of the holiday island of Lombok in August.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's highest court ordered the reinstatement of the head of the country's top crime fighting bureau on Tuesday, in a blow to the government that has been accused of undermining it. 
In October the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was paralyzed after director Alok Verma and his second-in-command, Rakesh Asthana, accused each other of bribery and interference in police investigations. 
The government placed both men on leave, ordering a probe into the allegations.
But on Tuesday, India's Supreme Court said Verma would be reinstated as CBI head, though he will not be able to take major policy decisions until the government completes its investigation. 
The spat has embarrassed the CBI, that serves a similar role as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and led to accusations India's government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is attempting to undermine India's independent institutions.
""I do not see it solely as a victory for Alok Verma,"" Verma's lawyer, Sanjay Hegde, told reporters on Tuesday. 
""I see it as a victory for the independence of investigative agencies in this country."" 
The opposition Congress Party said in a statement it welcomed the verdict, which it said ""lambasted"" the government's decision to place Verma on leave. 
In a petition to the Supreme Court Verma had earlier said his ousting ""erodes the independence of the institution"" as well as officers' morale, and which analysts said was part of a wider pattern of government authoritarianism.

The CBI is currently investigating several high profile cases, including a $2 billion fraud at Punjab National Bank involving fugitive diamond billionaire Nirav Modi and loan defaults by liquor baron Vijay Mallya.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Guatemala notified the United Nations it was terminating a U.N.-backed anti-graft commission on Tuesday, months ahead of schedule, accusing the body of abuses of power, and prompting a swift rebuke from the U.N. secretary-general.
The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, was set up over a decade ago with the authority to conduct independent investigations and work with the country's prosecutors, bringing down the last president in 2015.
The CICIG also went after President Jimmy Morales, who said in August he would not renew the organization's mandate, which was due to expire in September 2019. Days later, he banned CICIG head Ivan Velasquez, a hard-charging Colombian prosecutor, from re-entering the country.
Working with the then-attorney general, CICIG tried to prosecute Morales, a former comedian, in 2017 over alleged campaign finance violations. That move followed separate CICIG corruption probes into members of the president's family.
Guatemalan Foreign Minister Sandra Jovel met with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in New York on Monday and handed him a letter informing him of the government's intention to end the agreement that had established CICIG.
""It is regrettable that the Secretary-General, in a bid to maintain one person in the position, sacrificed the legitimacy of the commission,"" Jovel told a news conference after the meeting, referring to Guterres' decision to stand by Velasquez.
""Therefore we reported to the Secretary-General that within 24 hours the agreement (that was struck to create CICIG) will be terminated by the Guatemalan government,"" she said.
Guterres ""strongly rejects"" the content of the letter, a spokesman for the secretary-general said in an emailed statement, adding that the United Nations expected Guatemala's government to ""fulfill its legal obligations under the agreement"" until the CICIG mandate ends in September.
""The Secretary-General recalls the important contribution of CICIG to the fight against impunity in Guatemala,"" it said.
Accompanied by prominent Guatemalans accused of wrongdoing by the CICIG, Morales told a news conference in Guatemala City he had ordered prosecutors to start investigating allegations that the commission had acted outside the law and abused its power.
The foreign-led CICIG is unusual among U.N. bodies for its powers to bring cases to prosecutors, and many politicians in Guatemala consider it to be a violation of national sovereignty. Anti-corruption activists credit it with cleaning up government. 
Last month, Guatemala's government revoked visas and immunity for 11 CICIG investigators and two relatives.

In a bid to eliminate years of mounting theft, state oil firm Pemex has changed its distribution, triggering shortfalls in at least six states, including Guanajuato, a major car-making hub in central Mexico.
Guanajuato's state government said that less than one third of the state's gas stations were open on Monday.
Lopez Obrador told a news conference the government had not established a date for when operations would return to normal, but stressed that supply was not in danger.
""We are changing the whole distribution system, that's the reason for the shortage. We have enough gasoline,"" he said.
Mexican television showed long lines of drivers waiting to fill up in central states as well as Jalisco in the west and Tamaulipas in the north.
Years of fuel theft by criminal groups and others by tapping pipelines and stealing tanker trucks has led to losses totaling billions of dollars for public coffers.
Lopez Obrador's government has ordered the armed forces to intervene in Pemex's facilities, including one refinery.
""The supply will normalize, and at the same time we are going to guarantee that fuel is not stolen,"" said Lopez Obrador, who took office in December. ""We have seen a reduction in theft like never before ... but we still have work to do.""
Guanajuato's governor Diego Sinhue told local radio that of the state's 415 gas stations, only 115 were open. In Leon, Guanajuato's biggest city with a population of more than 1.5 million, only 7 of 196 stations were open on Sunday, he said.
""Fuel is becoming a serious problem,"" said Sinhue, a member of the opposition center-right National Action Party (PAN). ""People are really angry about this shortage.""
Sinhue said the army had informed him it had taken control of the state's Salamanca refinery on Monday morning. There, members of the armed forces were monitoring tankers going in and out of the facility, as well as the pressure of pipelines.

Energy Minister Rocio Nahle offered an apology on Mexican radio for the shortages. Asked when the problem would be fixed, she said it was in the process of being ""normalized"".

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The leaders of Canada and the United States on Monday agreed to continue pressing Beijing to free two Canadian citizens who were detained after the arrest of a senior Chinese executive in Vancouver, Ottawa said.
Canada wants the immediate release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were picked up after Canadian authorities arrested Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States.
China denounced the move and the affair is threatening to increase global tensions at a time when Washington and Beijing are already locked in a trade war.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and thanked him for ""the strong statements of support by the United States"" in response to the detentions of the two men, Trudeau's office said in a statement.
""The two leaders agreed to continue to seek their release,"" it said.
Although Canada says China has made no specific link between the detentions and Meng's arrest, experts and former diplomats say they have no doubt Beijing is using the cases of Kovrig and Spavor to pressure Ottawa.
Beijing insists the charges against Meng be dropped but Canada says it cannot interfere with the judicial process.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland reacted unhappily last month after Trump suggested he could waive the request to have Meng sent to the United States in return for progress on a bilateral trade deal with China. She said the extradition process should not be politicized.
Trudeau's office said the two leaders had discussed the U.S. request and ""reaffirmed the importance of respecting judicial independence and the rule of law"". 
The China Daily newspaper on Monday published a commentary saying Canada ""could lose the trust and cooperation of most developing countries"" over the matter.
""By continuing to follow the U.S., either passively or actively, Canada will eventually harm its national interests,"" said the commentary by Li Qingsi, a professor on international studies at Renmin University.

Earlier in the day a group of legislators from Canada on a visit to China pressed authorities on Monday to release Spavor and Kovrig but had little success, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported.

Cyntoia Brown, now 30, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the killing of Johnny Allen, a 43-year-old Nashville real estate agent. She will walk out of prison on Aug. 7 after serving 15 years, Governor Bill Haslam's office said. Brown was 16 at the time of the murder.
Brown received a life sentence with the possibility of parole after serving a minimum of 51 years in prison. Without the governor's commutation, she would not have been eligible to be considered for parole until 2055 at the earliest. 
""Imposing a life sentence on a juvenile that would require her to serve at least 51 years before even being eligible for parole consideration is too harsh, especially in light of the extraordinary steps Ms. Brown has taken to rebuild her life,"" Haslam, a Republican, said in a statement. 
Brown, who admitted to killing Allen, will be under parole supervision until Aug. 7, 2029, when her sentence will expire. 
In November 2017, the singer Rihanna referred to the case when wrote on her Instagram page: ""Did we somehow change the definition of #JUSTICE along the way?? ... Something is horribly wrong when the system enables these rapists and the victim is thrown away for life!""
Reality TV star Kardashian also drew attention to Brown's case in November 2017 when she wrote in a Twitter message: ""The system has failed. It’s heart breaking to see a young girl sex trafficked then when she has the courage to fight back is jailed for life!""
While in prison, Brown earned her GED, or high school equivalency certificate, and an associate degree with a 4.0 grade point average. She is expected to complete a bachelor's degree this year. 
Brown thanked Haslam for giving her a second chance, she said in a statement released by her legal team. 
""With God's help, I am committed to live the rest of my life helping others, especially young people. My hope is to help other young girls avoid ending up where I have been,"" Brown said. 

Haslam, whose term ends on Jan. 19, has previously granted five commutations, 15 pardons and one exoneration.

153,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 04:46PM ET</span>","EU looks at help for May, but will not rework Brexit deal","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering ways to help Prime Minister Theresa May convince the British parliament to back the Brexit treaty she agreed with EU leaders last month but ruled out on Monday any change to the deal.
EU sources told Reuters that senior officials in Brussels are discussing whether and how to issue ""reassurances"" that might help May overcome resistance to the deal before lawmakers vote in London next week.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC he hoped the EU and United Kingdom could find a way to avoid ""negative ramifications from a hard Brexit related not only to commerce and trade, but importantly to the national security issues that we have with the British as well as the European Union.""
Among the reassurances EU officials were considering was a request they said May put to fellow EU leaders at a summit before the Christmas break, on Dec. 14, to commit to having a new UK-EU free trade treaty in place by the end of 2021. However, the European Union shows no sign of going beyond an existing aspiration to do that, not a hard promise.
The date is important as it could allow May to assure her own party and others that the unpopular ""Irish backstop"" in the treaty would not be triggered after a status-quo transition period ends some time by 2022.
The backstop would bind Britain to follow EU rules to avoid a ""hard"" customs border across the island of Ireland unless a better way is agreed to do that by means of a new trade pact. Critics of May's deal to smooth Britain's passage out of the EU on March 29 say the backstop could leave Britain subject to EU rules indefinitely, long after it gives up any say over them.
EU officials familiar with the discussions said they saw little sign of any shift in the position of EU leaders last month, when they said the agreement could not be renegotiated and they would make no binding commitments that could be construed as altering it.
""We can provide reassurances,"" one official said. ""But whatever it might be will just reiterate the (summit) conclusions from last month.""
Among ways in which the EU could offer more detail and clarity on its agreed position, officials said, would be an exchange of legal letters with the British government setting out expectations of when a trade deal could be completed. However, EU leaders are wary of introducing legal ambiguity if the language of any statement differs from the original text.
The EU executive repeated on Monday that leaders would not renegotiate the treaty and said it was pressing on with planning for Britain to crash out of the Union without a deal.
""The deal that is on the table is the best and the only deal possible,"" the European Commission's chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters when asked about a phone conversation on Friday between May and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
""This deal will not be renegotiated.""
He also repeated that there were no talks planned between negotiators from the two sides as ""negotiations are complete"".

Schinas said that Juncker's conversation with May on Friday was ""friendly"" and that the two would speak again this week. May also spoke last week to EU summit chair Donald Tusk.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is on his way to China for his fourth summit with China's Xi Jinping, South Korean media said on Monday.
South Korea's Hankyoreh newspaper, citing an unidentified source with close knowledge of North Korea-China affairs, reported that Kim was traveling to Beijing late on Monday to meet with Xi.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency, citing an unspecified source familiar with North Korea issues, said a North Korean train possibly carrying a ""high-level"" official had crossed the border into China.
The source told Yonhap it had not been confirmed whether a senior official was on board, but that dozens of security vehicles and officials had blocked the roads around a station in the Chinese border city of Dandong as the train passed.
Last year Kim traveled to China three times to meet with Xi, before and after Kim held other summits with U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
Kim is expected to meet again with both the U.S. and South Korean presidents in the near future, and another visit to China has been seen as a possible move before those summits.
Earlier on Monday the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported that U.S. State Department officials recently met multiple times with North Korean counterparts in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between Trump and Kim, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event.
The U.S. State Department and White House declined to comment on the Munhwa Ilbo report and the State Department referred queries about Kim's reported China visit to the Chinese government.
In an interview with CNBC, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China's support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the U.S. trade dispute with Beijing would affect this. 
""The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,"" Pompeo said. 
""Their behavior has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so.""
At a landmark June summit in Singapore, Kim and Trump pledged to work toward denuclearization, but the pact was light on details and talks since have made little headway.
China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over its neighbor's nuclear and missile programs. Ties have warmed in the last year as Pyongyang’s relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved.
China also played a role in Trump's meeting with Kim, lending the North Korean leader an airliner for his trip to Singapore.
Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon, which would make him the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005.

In early December, Xi told North Korea's foreign minister during a visit in Beijing that he ""hoped North Korea and the United States meet each other halfway and address each other’s reasonable concerns, allowing positive progress on the peninsula’s nuclear talks.""

FORTALEZA, Brazil (Reuters) - Criminal gangs on a rampage in northeast Brazil are posing an early security test for new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, highlighting the challenge he faces in quelling drug-related violence and halting a record wave of murders in the country. 
The state of Ceará has been rocked by five nights of attacks including a bomb that exploded under a highway, torched buses and assaults against banks and police barracks.
Security officials believe the attacks were triggered by the new state government's plan to undercut the power of gangs by sending prisoners to whatever jails have space to take them in, ending a longstanding practice of separating them according to gang affiliation. 
The attacks, which on Friday prompted Brazil's new Justice Minister Sergio Moro to dispatch 330 federal security agents to Ceará, followed the Jan. 1 inauguration of Bolsonaro, who has made no secret of his admiration for the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964-1985.
The former army captain – who ran on a law-and-order platform - won support from Brazilians tired of the warring drug gangs that have come to terrorize large swaths of the country. 
His task now is to make good on promises to design a coherent federal security strategy and end the wave of violence that saddled Latin America's largest nation with a record 63,880 murders in 2017. The murder tally last year is still unknown. 
In Ceará's state capital Fortaleza, residents returned to the streets on Monday, making their way to work warily.
""The situation is tense,"" said taxi driver Weverton Barbosa. ""We're scared, because we don't know what's coming, and it could get worse.""
Ceará's public security and defense ministry said on Monday 148 people had been arrested for their alleged role in the attacks. In a statement on Sunday, it said at least three suspected gang members had been killed in gun battles with police.
Speaking last Friday, Bolsonaro, 63, praised Moro for quickly sending federal forces into Ceará to try and ease the situation.
Nonetheless, despite promising a tough stance on gangs, which profit from drug trafficking and often carry out mass attacks to spread fear and in response to police crackdowns in prisons or on the streets, he has provided few specific details on how he will bring them to heel.
At a press conference after his election, Bolsonaro urged prosecutors to follow the money to hobble prison gangs, such as Sao Paulo's powerful First Capital Command and Rio de Janeiro's Red Command. 
""Let's fight organized crime and work to stop inmates from continuing to control their foot-soldiers from within prisons,"" Bolsonaro tweeted on in October, shortly after his first-round election victory.
On Friday, Bolsonaro asked lawmakers to quickly pass a bill to provide police and soldiers freedom from prosecution when on active duty, warning that sky-high violence would only slow if laws were passed to give security officials a free hand as they combat gang violence.
Last week, after being sworn in as justice minister, Moro said he would present an anti-crime bill within weeks, pledging to isolate the jailed leaders of drug gangs, which he called a threat to democracy. 
Brazil's constitution mandates that public security is managed by state governments, and Bolsonaro may be limited in what he can achieve to restore calm from the federal level. 
Ignacio Cano, a security expert at the Rio de Janeiro State University, said that given the high levels of violence in the northeast of the country, and the inability of state governments to cope with it, federal interventions such as the one in Ceará may become more prevalent under Bolsonaro.
""I think this mechanism is something they will end up using a lot more than they expect,"" he said.
He added that gang crime posed a new challenge for Moro, who made his name as a crusading anti-graft judge, jailing scores of Brazil's corrupt political and business elite as part of the country's notorious ""Car Wash"" probe.

""Moro's experience is in investigating white-collar crime, and now he will have to face a new, more violent type of criminal,"" he said.

He spoke after rioters torched motorbikes and set barricades ablaze on Paris's upmarket Boulevard Saint-Germain on Saturday, underscoring how protests against high living costs and President Emmanuel Macron have turned violent on the fringes. 
""We need to preserve the right to demonstrate in France and we must sanction those who break the law,"" Philippe told TF1 television.
""That's why the government favors updating the law in order to sanction those who do not respect this obligation to declare protests, those who take part in undeclared protests, those who arrive at protests with balaclavas,"" Philippe said.
He said the government could model the new law on existing legislation against football hooligans whereby individuals can be banned from stadiums. It could be introduced as soon as February, he said.
Philippe also said the ""casseurs"", or thugs, who have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major cities where shops have been looted and banks vandalized would be forced to pay for the damage they cause.
The latest ""yellow vest"" marches began peacefully but degenerated on Saturday afternoon as protesters threw missiles at riot police blocking bridges over the Seine.
Officers fired tear gas to prevent protesters crossing the river and reaching the National Assembly. One riverboat restaurant was set ablaze and a policeman was wounded when he was hit by a bicycle hurled from a street above the river bank.

Two months after they started blocking roads, occupying highway tollbooths and staging sometimes-violent street protests in Paris, the yellow vests aim to inject new momentum into a movement that weakened over the holidays.

157,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 02:51PM ET</span>",Khamenei aide says U.S. approached him in Kabul seeking talks with Iran,"DUBAI (Reuters) - An aide to Iran's supreme leader said on Monday U.S. officials approached him during a December visit to Afghanistan to request talks with Tehran, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, but the U.S. State Department denied the report.
Tensions between Iran and the United States have increased since May, when President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers and later reimposed sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the pact. 
""During my visit to Kabul last month, the Americans ... asked to hold talks,"" Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council and a close aide to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted as saying, without specifying what the U.S. side wanted to discuss.
""This report is not accurate,"" said a State Department spokeswoman on condition of anonymity.
While denying it made a specific overture to Shamkani, the spokeswoman repeated that Trump is open to a dialogue with Iran on ""urgent national security issues"" and wants Tehran to ""make fundamental changes in their destructive behavior.""
Washington accuses Tehran of destabilizing the region by projecting its power via proxies in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.
In 2001, Iran worked with the United States to help set up a new Afghan government to replace the Taliban, which had been toppled by a U.S.-led military campaign following al Qaeda’s September 11 attacks on U.S. cities.
Shamkhani was in Kabul last month for talks with the Taliban ""to help curb the security problems in Afghanistan."" He said the Kabul government had known of his talks with the Taliban.
Majority-Shi'ite Iran has long had close ties to Shi'ites in neighboring Afghanistan whose militias have fought the Taliban's Sunni militants.
Washington accuses Iran of trying to extend its influence in western Afghanistan by providing military training, financing and weapons to the Taliban, a charge Tehran denies.
Shamkhani's comments came days after reports of talks between U.S. and Taliban officials over proposals for a ceasefire in Afghanistan and a future withdrawal of foreign troops ahead of possible peace negotiations.
Khamenei slapped down an offer of direct talks made by Trump last year and Iranian officials have said Washington's crippling sanctions would fail to wreck the economy.

In July, Iranian authorities said Tehran had rejected eight U.S. requests for a meeting between Trump and President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in Sept 2017.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, contesting an April election under the shadow of possible corruption charges, demanded on Monday to confront the state's witnesses against him.
Announcing on Twitter, three hours beforehand, that he would make a ""special announcement"" on Israeli TV, Netanyahu - now in his fourth term - touched off a wave of social media speculation that he might resign or even launch legal action of his own to try to stay any indictment.
Instead, he kicked off Israel's main TV evening news programs with an anticlimactic speech in which he again professed his innocence in a series of corruption cases. He contended he was a victim of a political witchhunt and said he was being denied the chance to challenge his accusers face-to-face.
""I demand a confrontation with the state's witnesses now. What are they afraid of? What do they have to hide? I am not afraid and I have nothing to hide...As far as I am concerned it can be broadcast live, so the public can see and hear it.""
In response, Israel's Justice Ministry said the investigations against Netanyahu - who is now in his fourth term - have been carried out professionally and thoroughly.
Netanyahu's calling of the snap election, ahead of a national ballot due by November, was widely seen as a direct appeal to voters for a fresh political mandate that could help him weather a potential indictment.
Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, said investigators had twice turned down his requests to confront the witnesses. At least three ex-Netanyahu confidants have agreed to provide evidence against him, Israeli media reports said.
Netanyahu is enmeshed in three graft cases. He has said he would not bow out of the election race if Israel's attorney-general announces his intention to accept police recommendations to indict him.
Should he decide on an indictment, the attorney-general would, under Israeli law, then hold a hearing with Netanyahu in which the prime minister and his lawyers could make their case against filing charges in court.
There has been mounting speculation in Israel that an indictment decision will be announced in the next few weeks, before election day.
Police have alleged that Netanyahu granted regulatory favors to Israel's leading telecommunications company, Bezeq Telecom Israel, in return for more positive coverage on a news website belonging to the firm's owner.

In a second case, police contend that Netanyahu received expensive gifts from wealthy friends. A third investigation focuses on suspicions that Netanyahu negotiated a deal with one newspaper for better coverage in return for promises to back legislation that would have limited the circulation of a rival.

159,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 01:50PM ET</span>",French cardinal tells court no pedophile cover-up,"LYON, France (Reuters) - The Roman Catholic archbishop of Lyon, the highest-profile cleric to be caught up in the pedophile scandal inside the Catholic Church in France, told a court on Monday he never tried to cover up sexual abuse and was not guilty of anything. 
Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, who stands trial alongside five others from his diocese, is accused of failing to report allegations of sexual abuse on Boy Scouts in the 1980s and early 1990s by Father Bernard Preynat.
Preynat has admitted sexual abuse, according to his lawyer, and is due to go on trial later this year.
""I never sought to conceal or cover up the facts,"" Barbarin said on the first day of trial in Lyon. 
""I am grateful justice intervened in this affair, but I didn't think it was up to me to file a complaint, especially since the victim was told it was too late to act,"" he said.
""I can't see what I am guilty of.""
While most of the recent focus in the Church's global abuse crisis has been on Australia and Chile, Barbarin's trial puts the spotlight on Europe's senior clergy again, just as Pope Francis prepares to host a meeting of senior bishops from around the world in Rome next month to discuss the protection of minors.
Barbarin, who moved to the Lyon diocese in 2002, visited the priest in his parish the same year but said he had not checked Preynat's file, where mail from parents denouncing the abuse was recorded, before doing so.
After being officially informed of Preynat's actions in 2014, Barbarin said he convinced one of the alleged victims, Alexandre Hezez, to write a letter describing the facts, which he passed on to Church hierarchy in Rome.
He removed the priest from his post in 2015, six months after being told to do so by the Vatican. ""It was to avoid public scandal, just as Rome had suggested,"" he told the court.
Lyon prosecutors had previously investigated Barbarin but dropped the probe in the summer of 2016 without a detailed explanation. However, an association of alleged victims called Parole Liberee (""Freed Word"") used a provision of French law to compel the cardinal to stand trial.
Pope Francis has come under fire over the Church's handling of the spreading sexual abuse crisis. 

He met Barbarin in early 2016, and later told the Catholic newspaper La Croix that it would make no sense for the cardinal to resign before any eventual trial.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese space probe successfully touched down on the far side of the moon on Thursday, China's space agency said, hailing the event as a historic first and a major achievement for the country's space program.
The Chang'e-4 lunar probe, launched in December, made the ""soft landing"" at 0226 GMT and transmitted the first-ever ""close range"" image of the far side of the moon, the China National Space Administration said. 
The moon is tidally locked to Earth, rotating at the same rate as it orbits our planet, so most of the far side - or ""dark side"" - is never visible to us. Previous spacecraft have seen the far side, but none has landed on it.
The landing ""lifted the mysterious veil"" of the far side of the moon and ""opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration"", the agency said in a statement on its website, which included a wide-angle color picture of a crater from the moon's surface. 
The probe, which has a lander and a rover, touched down at a targeted area near the moon's south pole in the Von Karman Crater after entering the moon's orbit in mid-December. 
The tasks of the Chang'e-4 include astronomical observation, surveying the moon's terrain, landform and mineral makeup, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atoms to study the environment of its far side. 
The control center in Beijing will decide when to let the rover separate from the lander, state news agency Xinhua said. 
""It's an important milestone for China's space exploration,"" Wu Weiren, chief designer of the lunar exploration program, said, according to Xinhua.
The probe also took six live species - cotton, rapeseed, potato, arabidopsis, fruit fly and yeast - to the lifeless environment to form a mini biosphere, Xinhua said.
A MAJOR SPACE POWER
The landing is the latest step for China in its race to catch up with Russia and the United States and become a major space power by 2030. Beijing plans to launch construction of its own manned space station next year.
While China has insisted its ambitions are purely peaceful, the U.S. Defense Department has accused it of pursuing activities aiming to prevent other nations from using space-based assets during a crisis.
Besides its civilian ambitions, China has tested anti-satellite missiles and the U.S. Congress has banned NASA from two-way cooperation with its Chinese counterpart over security concerns.
As competition accelerates in space, U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to create a new ""Space Force"" by 2020, as the sixth branch of the military.
But the private space race is also heating up, as numerous companies aim to commercialize space travel, such as California-based SpaceX, which has upended the industry with its low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets. 
The United States is the only country to have landed humans on the moon, and Trump said in 2017 he wanted to return astronauts to the lunar surface to build a foundation for an eventual Mars mission. 
NASA administrators have said people could be put on Mars by as soon as the mid-2030s, with the agency having landed eight spacecraft there, the most recent in November. 
As soon as 2022, NASA expects to begin building a new space station laboratory to orbit the moon, as a pit stop for missions to distant parts of the solar system. 
In 2003, China became the third country to put a man in space with its own rocket after the former Soviet Union and the United States, and in 2017 it said it was preparing to send a person to the moon.

China completed its first lunar ""soft landing"" in 2013, but its ""Jade Rabbit"" rover began malfunctioning after several weeks.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 12:20PM ET</span>",Activists urge Pope to sack some Polish bishops for not reporting sex abuse cases,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Some Polish bishops should lose their jobs after Pope Francis receives a report next month that will accuse them of failing in their duty to report pedophile cases inside the country's powerful Catholic Church, activists said on Monday.
The Roman Catholic Church worldwide is reeling from crises involving sexual abuse of minors in a number of countries including Chile, the United States, Australia and Ireland.
In devoutly Catholic Poland, debate on the issue has barely begun, but the anti-pedophilia foundation ""Have no fear"" is compiling a report on abuse and said it would soon inform Polish prosecutors of 20 previously unreported sexual crimes.
""By the end of January we will have a report documenting Polish bishops' negligence which will be presented in February at the Vatican,"" Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, an activist and lawmaker from the small opposition party ""Now"", told a news conference.
""When it turned out that bishops in Chile had concealed pedophile crimes, they lost their jobs. Plenty of bishops in Poland should bear the same consequences,"" she said.
Senior bishops from around the world are due to meet Pope Francis at a conference in the Vatican in February to discuss protection of minors. Organizers say the Church must show full accountability or risk losing further credibility worldwide.
In its campaign to expose pedophile priests in Poland, ""Have no fear"" in October posted an interactive pedophilia map on the internet which has seen some five million clicks and prompted about 300 allegations of sexual misconduct by clergy.
Now the foundation is encouraging victims to report their cases and offers lawyers' help to those who previously stayed silent for fear they would be doubted or shunned.
Asked about the report, a spokesman for the Polish Episcopate Conference, Pawel Rytel-Andrianik said:
""The protection of children and young people is of the utmost importance, which is why the bishops remind (people) that there is an obligation to report cases of abuse to the prosecutor's office.""
He declined to comment directly on the report as it had not yet been made available.
In a November statement, Poland's bishops asked victims of clerical abuse for forgiveness and said the Church had begun collecting data to assess the scale of crimes.

About 12 million people, or almost a third of Poland's population, regularly attend mass, according to a survey by the Institute for Catholic Church Statistics, a Warsaw-based research center.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Monday missed oral arguments for the first time since joining the U.S. Supreme Court in 1993 as the 85-year-old liberal jurist continues to recuperate from lung cancer surgery last month.
Chief Justice John Roberts addressed Ginsburg's absence before the first of the day's two arguments in cases before the court, saying she was ""unable to be present today."" Ginsburg instead will work from home and use the case briefs and argument transcripts to participate in the cases, court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said.
Ginsburg, the oldest member of the nine-justice court, underwent a surgical procedure called a pulmonary lobectomy on Dec. 21 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to remove two cancerous nodules in her left lung and was released from the hospital on Dec. 25.
Monday's arguments were the first on the court's schedule since her surgery. After the procedure, the court said there was no evidence of remaining disease. It is not known whether Ginsburg will attend the court's oral arguments in more cases on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
It was the first time Ginsburg, one of the court's nine justices, has missed oral arguments as a result of her various health scares, including two previous cancer diagnoses. Ginsburg participated in the court's private meeting last Friday in which the justices voted on which new cases to take up, but was not present at the court, Arberg said.
As the oldest justice, Ginsburg is closely watched for any signs of deteriorating health. Ginsburg, appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, also is the senior liberal member of the court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority.
Ginsburg broke three ribs in a fall in November. The nodules were found as part of the tests the justice underwent after the earlier fall, according to the court.
Ginsburg was treated in 1999 for colon cancer and again in 2009 for pancreatic cancer but did not miss any argument sessions either time. In 2014, doctors placed a stent in her right coronary artery to improve blood flow after she reported discomfort following routine exercise. She was released from a hospital the next day.
She is viewed as something of a cult figure for U.S. liberals, known by the nickname ""Notorious RBG,"" after the late rapper Notorious BIG. A documentary film, ""RBG,"" and a feature film about her life, ""On the Basis of Sex,"" were released in 2018.

If Ginsburg were unable to continue serving, Trump could replace her with a conservative, further shifting the court to the right.

Christophe Dettinger, who was twice national light-heavyweight champion, was caught on camera jumping over the railings of a pedestrian bridge blocked by baton-wielding police before swinging blows at the officers, forcing them to retreat. 
Nicknamed the ""Gypsy of Massy"", the 1.92m (6ft 4in) tall Dettinger was taking part in an eighth Saturday of anti-government protests that have undermined President Emmanuel Macron's authority.
The demonstration began peacefully but turned aggressive as police fired tear gas to prevent protesters, who torched cars and burned barricades, from reaching parliament.
""I was gassed with my friend, my wife, and at some point I was taken over by anger, so yes I acted badly. I acted badly, but I defended myself,"" Dettinger said in a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) before he handed himself in to police who arrested him.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner described Dettinger's assault as ""cowardly and intolerable"".
In another video, Dettinger, wearing a black hat, gloves and coat but no mask, can be seen kicking a policeman on the ground. One of the officers the former boxer attacked has been sent on 15 days' sick-leave, according to the Paris prosecutor's office.
Macron has been shaken by the demonstrations and the authorities' struggle to maintain order at the weekend raises questions over policing tactics and the president's broader response to the wave of unrest.
That is likely to be closely scrutinized as he prepares to bring in stricter rules for unemployment benefits and cut thousands of public sector jobs.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 12:00PM ET</span>",UK's no-deal Brexit truck 'war game' prompts scorn,"By Toby Melville
MANSTON, England (Reuters) - A convoy of nearly 90 trucks rolled through the southeast English countryside to Britain's main port to continental Europe on Monday in a government test-run for a potentially chaotic Brexit that was mocked as a farce by opponents of the split. 
Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to force her Brexit deal through parliament but lawmakers are expected to reject it. If so, business chiefs and investors fear the world's fifth-largest economy will leave the European Union at 2300 GMT on March 29 without an agreement on their future relationship.
With parliament deadlocked, the ultimate destination of the Brexit project remains unclear. Possible outcomes range from another referendum on European Union membership to a disorderly departure with no deal.
May's government has repeatedly warned that a no deal will lead to severe economic disruption, and Monday's exercise was part of preparations to ensure essential supplies can keep flowing through Dover, Europe's busiest ferry port.
The transport ministry said it was testing Manston airfield as a holding facility for lorries and traffic congestion on Kent roads in the event of disruption at the border.
Setting off from Manston, 87 trucks drove the 20 miles (32 km) to Dover and back again. They then drove again to Dover. Hiring the lorries cost 48,950 pounds ($62,484), the transport ministry said.
The 'war game' was criticized by lawmakers as a waste of time and money and mocked on Twitter as ""a fake traffic jam ... to show the EU we are ready for no deal"". 
Britain's Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the trial was too little, too late and would need to be repeated to properly stress-test the management of thousands of lorries. 
""Less than a hundred lorries is a drop in the ocean compared to the more than 10,000 that go to the channel ports every day,"" said Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative lawmaker for Dover. 
""Sending lorries across Kent on a wild goose chase to Manston airport and then to the port of Dover by small and winding, often single track 'A roads' through Kent villages is not the right plan.""
Dover has been Britain's most important gateway to Europe since Roman times and the port now handles 17 percent of the United Kingdom's goods trade. Up to 10,000 trucks a day pass through with everything from perishable food to medicines.
Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat lawmaker who wants another referendum on EU membership, said the truck journey would not convince the EU that Britain was ready for no deal. 
""This is a taxpayer-funded farce,"" Moran said. 
Brexit supporters say that, while there may be some short-term disruption, in the long-term the UK will thrive outside the EU, which they cast as a doomed and excessively bureaucratic project dominated by Germany.
But pro-Europeans fear Britain's exit will hammer the economy and undermine the West as it grapples with Donald Trump's unpredictable U.S. presidency and growing assertiveness from Russia and China.
""Today’s trial cannot possibly duplicate the reality of 4,000 trucks being held at Manston airport in the event of a no-deal Brexit,"" the RHA's chief executive Richard Burnett said in a statement.
""It's too little too late -- this process should have started nine months ago. At this late stage it looks like window dressing.""
""EXISTENTIAL THREAT"" 
Facing defeat in parliament last month, May postponed a vote on the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with the EU and pledged to seek further political and legal assurances from the bloc. The EU has signaled it may try to allay the fears of May's critics but will not renegotiate the deal.
May said on Sunday that Britain would be in uncharted territory if her Brexit deal is rejected by parliament. A vote is due around Jan. 15.
""It's still hard to see any upside to Brexit,"" said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which said new car sales in 2018 fell at their fastest rate since the global financial crisis a decade ago.
""Everyone recognizes that Brexit is an existential threat to the UK automotive industry and we hope a practical solution will prevail,"" he said, calling for lawmakers to support May's deal to guarantee a transition period.
Britain's main opposition Labour Party is expected to back a proposal on Tuesday that could mean the government needs parliamentary approval for a no-deal Brexit.
The European Commission repeated on Monday that EU leaders would not renegotiate the Brexit deal agreed with May, who said she was seeking further assurances from Brussels on the deal.
""The deal that is on the table is the best and the only deal possible,"" chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters when asked about a phone conversation on Friday between May and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
""This deal will not be renegotiated.""

The ultra hardline jihadist group claimed responsibility for the reported attack in a statement issued by the affiliated Amaq news agency. The statement said the attack targeted a recruitment center in Raqqa and that 17 people were killed or wounded. Amaq provided no further details.
There was no immediate reaction from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which seized the city in Syria's northeast from Islamic State (IS) with the crucial help of U.S.-led air strikes in 2017 after months of devastating fighting.
Two Raqqa residents reached by Reuters said they heard an explosion in a central district of the city where the SDF military has offices. Militiamen had cordoned off the area and surrounding streets after the blast, the residents said. 
Raqqa, which IS declared the capital of its self-proclaimed caliphate, was taken by the SDF six years into Syria's civil war after a protracted battle that killed thousands of civilians and wrecked much of the city.
Rebuilding and restoring Raqqa, which was once home to more than 200,000 people, is proving to be a monumental task.
Since losing almost all the large swathes of territory it took in lightning offensives in Syria and Iraq in 2014-15, IS has returned to deadly hit-and-run attacks and ambushes. 
Some people in Raqqa resent effective Kurdish control over the mainly Arab city, with many objecting to compulsory enlistment to its forces and heavy taxes on civilians.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's cabinet on Monday approved proposals to reserve 10 percent of government jobs for less well-off upper caste Hindus, a plan the main opposition party called an attempt to lure back wavering voters as a national election nears.
The upper echelons in India's centuries-old caste system have traditionally been a core voter base for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP.
Modi must call a national election by May and was handed a setback in December when the BJP lost power to the opposition Congress party in three states, its biggest defeat since he took office in 2014.
They included Rajasthan, one of four states - the others being Maharashtra, Gujarat and Haryana - in which upper caste land-owning farming communities have held large protests in recent years demanding quotas for government jobs.
More broadly, Modi has been criticized for failing to deliver jobs for young people and better conditions for farmers.
""The ... Modi government has suddenly woken up to the woes of economically poor (upper caste Hindus), facing imminent defeat in the 2019 elections,"" said Congress spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala.
""Creating reservations in jobs may just prove to be one more 'Jumla' (gimmick) for the purpose of election promises.""
Ashwini Kumar Choubey, junior health minister and a BJP member, welcomed the proposal, calling it ""historic.""
Hindus, who account for about four-fifths of India's 1.3 billion people, were traditionally grouped into thousands of castes, whose membership is determined by birth. 
The lower castes have faced various forms of discrimination including segregation and social boycotts.
There have been attempts to reduce caste-related inequality, and the country has had many lower caste leaders, including current president Ram Nath Kovind.
But introducing quotas for lower castes has always been a contentious issue and have led to violent protests, though India's income levels and expenditure patterns remain largely linked to caste.
The government is expected to submit the bill in favor of ""economically weak"" upper castes to the lower house of parliament on Tuesday. Modi's BJP has a majority there, but not in the upper house.

Two BJP sources said the government defined ""economically weak"" as anyone with annual income below 800,000 rupees ($11,500) and owning fewer than five acres of land. In 2017, the average income in India was $1,939.60, according to the World Bank.

Plans to boost scrutiny over public funds that NGOs receive has raised concern that their activities might be restricted by a nationalist government that has criticized foreign interference in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) region.
The responsibility for monitoring NGOs has been put in the hands of Government Secretary Carlos dos Santos Cruz, a retired Army general who said the initiative will help determine whether the organizations are fulfilling their role of carrying out work that complements government actions.
An executive order issued last week gave the new administration potentially far-reaching and restrictive powers over NGOs.
""The government's intention is to optimize the use of public funds and bring more benefits"" to people assisted by the NGOs, Cruz said in an interview published on Monday on the G1 news portal.
He denied the intention was to restrict their activity.
""The plan is not to interfere in the life of the organizations or restrict anything. But it's public money. There needs to be transparency and there needs to be results,"" Cruz said. 
Leaders of NGOs that work in Brazil, such as Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, said the decree on NGOs could be viewed in a positive light, but also expressed concerns.
If the new rules ""facilitate a constructive relationship between international civil society groups and the government,"" that is positive. But Vivanco said he was also worried about how far the Bolsonaro government will go in monitoring the groups. 
Rules to increase oversight over NGOs was one of Bolsonaro's very first acts after he was sworn in on Jan. 1. 

Bolsonaro's temporary decree, which expires unless it is ratified within 120 days by Congress, gives Cruz's office the power to ""supervise, coordinate, monitor and accompany the activities and actions of international organizations and nongovernmental organizations in the national territory.""

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's Orthodox Christian Church celebrated its first Christmas on Monday outside Russian control and President Petro Poroshenko said the document enshrining its newly gained independence had broken ""the last fetters tying us to Moscow"".
Hundreds of Ukrainians queued in the snow after the lavish two-hour liturgy at Kiev's St Sophia Cathedral to view the document, known as a ""Tomos"", which was only handed to the head of the new Church Metropolitan Epifaniy on Sunday.
Many Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7, not Dec. 25, as they follow a different calendar.
Accompanied by Poroshenko, Epifaniy processed into the cathedral on Monday carrying the decree, a scrolled white parchment. White-robed clergy then unfurled it and placed it in front of the iconostasis, a richly decorated screen that separates the sanctuary from the nave in Orthodox churches.
""For the first time, we celebrate Christmas with an independent autocephalous church,"" said Poroshenko after the service. ""It is the basis of our spiritual freedom, we broke the last fetters tying us to Moscow,"" said the president, who faces a tough re-election battle this year.
Russia bitterly opposes the move to grant the Ukrainian Church autocephalous, or self-governing, status, comparing it to the Great Schism of 1054 that divided western and eastern Christianity.
The Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow has called the leaders of the Ukrainian Church charlatans and schismatics, and President Vladimir Putin has warned of possible bloodshed.
""DAY OF JOY""
Despite the snowy weather, hundreds of people watched Monday's service on a big screen outside because there was not enough space in the packed cathedral to accommodate them.
""This is the most happy day in the life of every Ukrainian. And I understand that every soul desires to be here,"" Oksana Pasenok, a university professor, told Reuters.
People formed a long queue after the service to see the decree, which will remain on public display.
""Today the words of those holy fathers who died for Ukraine, for our freedom, for our liberty, come true,"" said Oleksandr Sydoruk, engineer, standing in the queue to see the document.
""Today, with this 'Tomos', our Ukrainian Church and Ukraine revive. And this is a day of joy for all Ukrainian Orthodox believers.""
St Sophia Cathedral was built by the son of Prince Volodymyr, whose baptism in 988 led to the spread of Christianity across what are now Ukraine and Russia.
Russians trace the origins of their own nation to the Kievan state of that era.

The rupture in inter-church relations mirrors the collapse of political relations between Moscow and Kiev following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Modi said last week his government was determined to pass a bill in parliament to relax rules for Hindus and other non-Muslim minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan to become citizens of Hindu-majority India.
Critics have called the bill, to be discussed in parliament on Tuesday, an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to boost its Hindu voter base ahead of a national election due by May.
The Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), based in the border state of Assam in India's northeast, has become the fourth ally to quit the ruling National Democratic Alliance in the past year, for a variety of reasons.
Protests have erupted in recent months and on Monday in Assam, where a movement against illegal immigrants, of all religions, from Bangladesh has simmered for decades, with some residents blaming them for eating into their resources and job opportunities.
It is estimated that millions of Bengali-speaking people in Assam trace their roots to Muslim-majority Bangladesh, which won independence from Pakistan in 1971 with India's help.
""The home minister clearly told us they will try to get this bill passed tomorrow, so there's no question us staying with the BJP anymore,"" AGP President Atul Bora told reporters in New Delhi.
The BJP has the numbers in the Assam assembly to stay in power in the state despite the AGP pullout, but the regional party could help galvanize anger amongst many ethnic Assamese opposed to giving citizenship to migrants who came to India after 1971.
That could hurt the BJP's goal of sharply increasing its parliamentary seats from the northeast region of the country in the national election.
At least two of the parties that have left the BJP fold have already largely agreed to ally with the main opposition Congress, which hopes to take on Modi as a united front and says the citizenship should not discriminate against Muslims.
The BJP says it is in favor of institutionalist ""constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards"" to the ethnic Assamese, but also wants to give citizenship to Hindus from Bangladesh as the growth in the Hindu population of Assam had been overtaken by that of Muslims.

""We're trying to save Assam from Jinnah,"" BJP leader and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, referring to Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah who was instrumental in carving Muslim-dominated Pakistan out of India after winning independence from British colonial rule in 1947.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The day before Deb Haaland was sworn in last week as a freshman lawmaker in the most diverse U.S. House of Representatives class in history, she said the weight of being one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress had not yet fully hit her.
Haaland, 58, had just conducted a brief staff meeting and was sitting in her new office on Capitol Hill as staffers got phones working and solved logistical problems like wrestling a printer through a narrow doorway.
The first-time elected official represents New Mexico's 1st Congressional District and is a member of the state's Laguna Pueblo tribe. ""Congress has never heard a voice like mine,"" the Democrat said.
""As the first Native American woman in Congress, I know that there will be an expectation on me by tribes across the country to be somebody that can move their issues forward,"" Haaland said. ""That's absolutely something I feel optimistic that I will be able to do.""
She said there is an ""epidemic"" of missing and murdered indigenous women, and Haaland would like Congress to hold additional oversight hearings on the issue and make sure tribal justice systems have the resources they need to conduct proper investigations.
Also at the top of her list is combating climate change, which threatens fragile tribal lands. ""If you're not scared to death right now about climate change, you're not reading the news,"" she said.
Haaland is one of a record-breaking 102 women who will serve in the 435-seat House during the 2019-2020 session.
There are many firsts among them. Haaland and Sharice Davids of Kansas, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, are the first Native American women. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan are the first Muslim women. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Jahana Hayes of Connecticut are the first black women to represent their states. All are Democrats.
When Haaland was born in 1960, Native Americans did not have the right to vote in New Mexico - despite being granted full U.S. citizenship by the federal government in 1924. They got it in 1962, making the Southwestern state the last in the nation to extend it.
On Thursday, Haaland welcomed her new constituents to an open house at her congressional office before being sworn in on the House floor. She wore traditional tribal garments to the ceremony, including a pomegranate blossom necklace of silver and turquoise, signifying protection and strength, made by a Laguna artist.
After raising her hand to take the oath of office with her peers, the consequence of the milestone sunk in.
Overcome with emotion, Haaland turned to embrace Davids, borrowing the edge of her new colleague's scarf to dab away her tears.

172,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 09:15AM ET</span>",Turkey frees opposition figure pending terrorism trial: Anadolu,"ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Monday ordered the release on bail of a former opposition lawmaker while he is being tried on terrorism-related charges, state-owned Anadolu news agency said.
Eren Erdem, who lost his seat in mid-2018 elections that granted President Tayyip Erdogan sweeping new powers, has been jailed since June and accused of publishing illegal wiretaps while editor of an opposition newspaper in 2014.
He denies charges of assisting followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is accused of orchestrating a failed 2016 putsch. 
Prosecutors sought a sentence of up to 19 years for Erdem over ""membership of an armed organization"" and aiding terrorists, Anadolu said. However, the court ruled on Monday that he should be released on bail.
He is the second politician from the secularist Republican People's Party (CHP) to be taken in a sweeping crackdown that has seen more than 70,000 people imprisoned, sparking outrage from rights groups and some of Turkey's Western allies. 
The other CHP politician, Enis Berberoglu, was initially sentenced to 25 years in jail for espionage charges in June 2017, but was later released in September. 
He also denies the charges against him.
The cleric Gulen, a former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan who now lives in the United States, denies any connection with the 2016 attempt to overthrow the government.
Since then, 77,000 people have been formally arrested, while more than 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from jobs over alleged links to Gulen's network.
Foes have criticized the scale of the crackdown, saying Erdogan was using the putsch as an excuse to quash dissent.
The government, however, has said the security measures were justified by the gravity of the threat.
It was not clear if Erdem had left prison after Monday's ruling, and there was no immediate reaction from his family or supporters.

173,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>","Myanmar's civilian, military leaders meet, vow to 'crush' Rakhine rebels","YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar government leader Aung San Suu Kyi discussed insurgent attacks on Myanmar police on Monday in a rare meeting with the military chief, and her administration called for the armed forces to ""crush"" the rebels, a government spokesman said.
Fighting between government forces and the rebel Arakan Army in the western state of Rakhine has displaced thousands of people since early December, according to the United Nations.
The Arakan Army wants greater autonomy for Rakhine, where the mainly Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group makes up the majority of the population.
Rakhine State saw a military-led crackdown in 2017, following attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents that prompted hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to flee westwards into neighboring Bangladesh.
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay said Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other cabinet members met military leaders, including army chief Min Aung Hlaing, his deputy and the military intelligence chief, to discuss ""foreign affairs and national security"". 
""The president's office has instructed the military to launch an operation to crush the terrorists,"" Zaw Htay told a news conference in the capital, Naypyitaw.
While Suu Kyi is barred from being president by a military-drafted constitution, Win Myint is a loyalist and she is seen as de facto leader of the civilian government, while the military remains in charge of security.
The insurgents killed 13 policemen and wounded nine in attacks on four police posts on Friday, as Myanmar celebrated Independence Day, state media reported.
An Arakan Army spokesman outside Myanmar told Reuters last week the group attacked the security forces in response to a broad military offensive in northern Rakhine State that also targeted civilians.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Monday that 4,500 people were sheltering in monasteries and communal spaces after being displaced by the fighting in the past month. 
'CYCLE OF VIOLENCE'
Zaw Htay described the Arakan Army as a ""terrorist organization"" and said it had surprised security forces on guard against Rohingya insurgents.
He said the Arakan Army could destabilize Rakhine State for years to come and warned people not to give it support.
""Do they want to see a cycle of violence lasting decades?"" he said. ""I want to tell Rakhine people who are supporting (the Arakan Army): Don't think about yourself, but think about your next generation.""
Myanmar governments have battled various ethnic minority insurgent groups since shortly after independence from Britain in 1948, though some have struck ceasefire agreements.
Zaw Htay also accused the Arakan Army of meeting the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, a group of Rohingya insurgents that Myanmar also considers terrorists but added that Myanmar was unable to eliminate the groups as they had bases across the border in Bangladesh.
A Bangladeshi foreign ministry official and two Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) officers denied the accusation. 
One BGB officer asked Myanmar to provide evidence of militant camps in Bangladesh.
“All the terrorism is taking place on the other side of the border,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Manzural Hasan Khan, a BGB commander in Cox's Bazar, the district where more than 900,000 Rohingya Muslims are sheltering having fled bouts of violence that have drawn international condemnation against Myanmar.
""The world knows what happened on the other side,"" he said.
The Myanmar government and military leaders also discussed a temporary ceasefire the military announced last month in other parts of the country, where other insurgent groups operate, Zaw Htay said.

The meeting was held at the request of the president's office, he said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis warned on Monday against a resurgence of nationalist and populist movements and criticized countries that try to solve the migration crisis with unilateral or isolationist actions.
The pope, speaking to diplomats in an annual speech known informally as his ""state of the world"" address, suggested such movements and closed-door policies were turning the clock back 100 years to the dangerous period between the world wars.
Relationships within the international community ""are experiencing a period of difficulty, with the resurgence of nationalistic tendencies,"" he said, making dialogue between countries and hurting the most vulnerable members of society, including migrants.
Populist anti-immigrant parties made gains in a number of countries last year, including Italy, France, the Netherlands, Hungary, Brazil and Poland.
In the United States, a partial government shutdown entered its third week as President Donald Trump has pledged not to bend in his demand for a wall along the southern border with Mexico..
In his hour-long speech, Francis several times mentioned the League of Nations, which was set up after World War One to promote peace but failed to stop the nationalist and populist movements that helped lead to World War Two. 
""The reappearance of these impulses today is progressively weakening the multilateral system,"" he told envoys from 183 countries in the speech, which touched on the situation in many countries.
CRITICIZES UNILATERALISM
While migration has led to diffidence and unilateral actions by governments, particularly in Europe and North America, the international community has a duty to defend refugees and migrants, he said.
""I do not believe that partial solutions can exist for so universal an issue,"" he said.
Francis praised the United Nations' Global Compact on Migration, which set objectives for how the movement of people can be managed. The United States, Italy, Hungary and Poland are among nations that boycotted the meeting in Morocco last year.
The pope again condemned the arms trade and possession of nuclear weapons, lamenting that past efforts at nuclear disarmament had given way to ""the search for new and increasingly sophisticated and destructive weapons"".
He called for a more decisive commitment to combating global warming and for ""rethinking our relationship with our planet"".

Calling sexual abuse of children ""one of the plagues of our time"", he said a meeting of key bishops at the Vatican in February would aim to ""shed full light on the facts and to alleviate the wounds caused by such crimes"".

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwean teachers will go on strike from Tuesday to press for salaries to be paid in U.S. dollars, a union said, as pressure builds on President Emmerson Mnangagwa to contain a runaway currency crisis.
Cash shortages have plunged Zimbabwe's financial system into disarray, threatening social unrest and undermining Mnangagwa's efforts to win back foreign investors who were sidelined under his predecessor Robert Mugabe.
With not enough hard currency to back up funds showing in bank accounts, the value of electronic money has plummeted, prompting businesses and civil servants to demand payment in U.S. dollars they can withdraw.
Just over four months into Mnangagwa's contested presidency, the Zimbabwe Teachers' Union (ZIMTA) said its members would strike as spiraling inflation has left them unable to buy basic goods and fuel that are in short supply. Government doctors have been on strike for more than a month over the same issue.
""To enable the teachers to report for work and to subsist, we demand the payment of salaries in U.S. dollars,"" ZIMTA president Richard Gundane said in a statement dated Jan. 6. 
The government employs more than 100,000 teachers and ZIMTA has 44,000 members.
Acting Labour Minister July Moyo was set to meet all government unions on Monday, according to an official circular.
On Monday police arrested 10 members of the smaller Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe who were picketing at a park in central Harare, according to a Reuters witness.
There was a heavy presence of police with water canon elsewhere in the capital.
As doctors continue their strike, Zimbabwe's public hospitals have been left short of drugs and reliant on patients to buy them. Pharmacies have stopped accepting insurance policies for purchases and demand payment in dollars.
Zimbabwe is also struggling with acute shortages of fuel, forcing motorists to queue for hours.
Civil servant salaries accounted for 90 percent of the budget last year but Mnangagwa's government has made an ambitious pledge to cut this to 70 percent in 2019 as part of reforms aimed at boosting growth and investment.

Mnangagwa came to power in November 2017 after Mugabe was forced to resign following an army coup. He was declared president in August 2018 after a presidential vote that his main opponent says he won fraudulently.

LIBREVILLE (Reuters) - Gabon foiled an attempted military coup on Monday, arresting several plotters just hours after they took over state radio in a bid to end 50 years of rule by President Ali Bongo's family.
Government spokesman Guy-Bertrand Mapangou told Reuters that four of the five officers involved were arrested in the capital Libreville. A fifth officer fled and is being pursued, he said. 
In a radio message at 4:30 a.m. (0330 GMT), Lieutenant Kelly Ondo Obiang, who described himself as an officer in the Republican Guard, said Bongo's New Year's Eve address from Morocco, where he is recovering from a stroke, ""reinforced doubts about the president's ability to continue to carry out of the responsibilities of his office"".
In one of his first television appearances since he suffered the stroke in Saudi Arabia in October, Bongo, 59, slurred his speech and he appeared unable to move his right arm. It is unclear if he is able to walk. He has been in Morocco since November to continue treatment. 
Outside the radio station, loyalist soldiers fired teargas to disperse about 300 people who had come out into the streets to support the coup attempt, a Reuters witness said. Helicopters circled overhead. 
Most of the beachside capital was quiet, however, and a government spokesman said the situation was under control after the arrests. ""The government is in place. The institutions are in place,"" Mapangou told France 24. 
The Bongo family has ruled the oil-producing country since 1967. Bongo has been president since succeeding his father, Omar, who died in 2009. His re-election in 2016 was marred by claims of fraud and violent protest.
The economy was long buoyed by oil revenues, much of which went to a moneyed elite while most of the two-million population live in deep poverty. In Libreville, expensive western hotels overlook the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the capital's hillside shanties to the east. 
A sharp drop in oil production and prices in recent years has squeezed revenues and stoked discontent. Oil workers' strikes have become increasingly common. 
The international community condemned the coup attempt, including former colonial ruler France which urged its 8,900 citizens registered in Gabon to avoid moving around Libreville. 
""Gabon's stability can only be ensured in strict compliance with the provisions of its constitution,"" French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said.
In a tweet on Monday, African Union Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat reaffirmed ""the AU's total rejection of all unconstitutional changes of power."" 
DISPUTED ELECTION
In a video on social media, Ondo is seen in a radio studio wearing military fatigues and a green beret as he reads the statement. Two other soldiers with rifles stand behind him. 
Ondo said the coup was being carried out by a group called the Patriotic Movement of the Defence and Security Forces of Gabon against ""those who, in a cowardly way, assassinated our young compatriots on the night of August 31, 2016,"" a reference to violence that erupted after Bongo was declared winner of the disputed election. 
Bongo won the poll by fewer than 6,000 votes, sparking deadly clashes between protesters and police during which the parliament was torched. 
The military officer said the coup attempt was carried out by one unit under the command of a high-ranking officer but that other units were monitoring the situation. 
""President Bongo’s record as defense minister under his father lowers the possibility that current military leadership is supportive of his ouster,"" said Judd Devermont of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
France has a permanent force of 300 soldiers in Gabon. The United States also sent about 80 soldiers to Gabon last week in response to possible violence in Democratic Republic of Congo after a presidential election there. 
Bongo and members of his government have faced repeated suspicions by foreign governments of corruption. They have denied the accusations. During his father's rule, Gabon was a pillar of ""La Francafrique"", a web of diplomacy, trade and French military might giving French companies favored access to African autocrats. 
Gabon’s dollar-denominated sovereign debt   tumbled in early trading, with both outstanding bonds losing around 3 cents in the dollar. However, prices recovered in late morning, with bonds trading around half a cent lower.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ruling alliance, led by the Awami League, won more than 90 percent of the seats contested in the Dec. 30 election that was marred by accusations of ballot stuffing, voter intimidation and violence that killed at least 19 people.
The United Nations said on Friday that there were ""worrying indications"" that reprisals have continued to take place, notably against the political opposition.
The Awami League denied the charges and said it did not believe in ""politics of revenge"".
Police said medical examination of the woman has confirmed sexual assault and police said they were also investigating complaints of threats against her family following the arrests over the past few days.
The Awami League said it has already suspended the main accused, Ruhul Amin, from the party. Reuters could not contact Amin's family.
The woman's husband told Reuters that a group of 10-12 men barged into their house in the southeastern district of Noakhali on the night of the election, tied up him and his four children inside the house, and raped her outside one by one.
The husband said she was raped because she voted for the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
""We could not do anything,"" the husband said from her hospital bedside, adding that he had received threats on his phone to withdraw the complaint with police.

The case, which comes ahead of a general election expected as soon as this year, stems from a dispute over the old house of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first premier and the father of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
The siblings have publicly bickered since June 2017 over the future of the family home in which the late leader, who died in 2015, had lived for most of his life.
Prime Minister Lee's younger brother, Lee Hsien Yang, and sister, Lee Wei Ling, want the house to be eventually demolished in accordance, they have said, with their father's wishes as stated in his will.
But the prime minister has questioned whether his father really wanted the home, near Singapore's bustling Orchard Road shopping district, to be knocked down. He has said he has recused himself from government discussions on the matter.
On Monday, the Attorney General's Chambers (AGC) said it had referred to the Law Society a case of ""possible professional misconduct"" over the involvement of the wife of the prime minister's brother in the will.
The wife, Lee Suet Fern, who is a lawyer, appears to have prepared the elder Lee's last will despite the fact that her husband was one of the beneficiaries of the will, the AGC said in a statement.
Lee Suet Fern declined to comment. She has never commented on whether she had prepared the late founder's will.
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post late on Sunday, Lee Wei Ling said:
""Lee Kuan Yew, a highly regarded lawyer, never complained about his will ... Why therefore this new attack on our father’s will? Why is this being initiated now, and by the AGC, after all this time?"" 

The government panel that had been set up to examine the future of the house said early last year that a future government should make the final call.

Authorities in the Chinese port city of Tianjin had said in December that they were investigating TCM firm Quanjian Group over allegations including false marketing.
The official local Tianjin Daily reported on Monday that police has arrested Quanjian founder Shu Yuhui and 17 others. The story was widely picked up by national state media.
An official at the Wuqing office of the Tianjin Administration for Market Regulation confirmed the arrests to Reuters but declined to comment further.
An employee in Quanjian's customer service department told Reuters that authorities were dealing with the matter but declined to provide further comment on the arrests. 
Reuters could not reach Shu for comment. 
Quanjian, headquartered in the northeastern city of Tianjin, has been under fire after an article recounting the death of a four-year-old girl from cancer went viral on social media. The girl had received a treatment from the firm. 
Chinese people expressed anger over the case and shared their own experiences about how the company overstated the efficacy of its treatments. Some criticized Quanjian for operating a pyramid scheme for sales. 
Operators of pyramid schemes typically make money by recruiting members, who pay fees to act as salespeople of goods, rather than relying on the sale of the goods themselves.
Founded in 2004, Quanjian has expanded into an empire with billions of yuan in sales and many hospitals and stores, local media reported. The company says it also owns sports clubs.
The Quanjian case has become one of the most widely discussed health cases since it went viral in late 2018, underscoring public concern over medical problems in China that range from a lack of doctors to slow approvals for new drugs.
The case also has echoes of an incident in 2016 when the death of a student drew attention to misleading advertising after he used search engine Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) to look for treatment for his rare form of cancer.

That prompted a major probe into healthcare advertising and led to a drop in Baidu's earnings.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kangm asked at a regular briefing about reports that China had invited UN experts to Xinjiang, said that all parties, including the U.N., were welcome, as long as they respected appropriate travel procedures.
U.N. officials should also ""avoid interfering in domestic matters"" and adopt an objective and neutral attitude, he added.
The top U.N. human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, in December said her office was seeking access to Xinjiang to verify ""worrying reports"" of re-education camps holding Muslim minorities, including the Turkic speaking Uighurs.
In August, a U.N. human rights panel said it had received credible reports that a million or more Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang were being held in what resembled a ""massive internment camp"".
In a rare move, a group of 15 Western ambassadors in Beijing, spearheaded by Canada, have sought a meeting with the top official in the region, Communist Party boss Chen Quanguo, for an explanation of alleged rights abuses against Uighurs.
Beijing has launched an increasingly active publicity campaign to defend its actions in Xinjiang in the face of an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and U.N. rights experts.
In the last two weeks, the Chinese government has arranged for diplomats from 12 non-Western countries to visit the region, as well as organizing a trip for a small group of reporters, including Reuters, to three facilities, which it called vocational education training centers.
In the centers, Uighur students learned in Mandarin about the dangers of extremist thought and sang and danced for reporters, including a rendition in English of ""If You're Happy and You Know it, Clap Your Hands"".
Xinjiang officials told Reuters on the trip that the de-radicalization program had been highly successful but that fewer people would be sent through the system in future.
Reuters last year reported on harsh extrajudicial detentions and interrogations at the camps, which are at odds with Beijing's claims, and took pictures of guard towers and barbed wire surrounding some. (https://tinyurl.com/y9zzouss)

The Taliban say they are fighting to topple the Western-backed government and restore strict Islamic law after their ouster in 2001. 
The United States and its allies say they want to stop Afghanistan from becoming a haven for international Islamist militants plotting attacks in the West.

The operation was not about any one country or to make a political statement, McMarr said.
The statement came as trade talks between China and the United States were under way in Beijing, the first round of face-to-face discussions since both sides agreed to a 90-day truce in a trade war that has roiled international markets.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that the conduct of the U.S. ship had violated China's and international law, and China had lodged ""stern representations"".
""We urge the United States to immediately cease this kind of provocation,"" he said, adding that China had sent military ships and aircraft to identify and warn off the ship.
Asked about the timing of the operation during trade talks, Lu said resolving issues would benefit the two countries and the world.
""Both sides have the responsibility to create the necessary positive atmosphere for this,"" he said.
China claims almost all of the strategic South China Sea and frequently lambastes the United States and its allies for freedom of navigation naval operations near Chinese-occupied islands.
Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan have competing claims in the region.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in December agreed to put on hold a spiraling trade dispute of tit-for-tat import tariffs on hundreds of billions worth of goods.
Trump has imposed tariffs to pressure Beijing to change its practices on issues ranging from corporate espionage to market access and industrial subsidies. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own.
Fears have grown in recent months that the dispute is just one vector in a bilateral relationship that is fast cooling across the board, with top administration officials sharply criticizing Beijing for everything from human rights abuses and its influence operations in the United States.
The two countries are also at odds over regional security, including Washington's overtures to the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own.
China and the United States have in the past repeatedly traded barbs over what Washington says is Beijing's militarization of the South China Sea by building military installations on artificial islands and reefs.
China defends its construction as necessary for self-defense and says that it is rather Washington that is responsible for ratcheting up tensions in the region by sending warships and military plans close to islands Beijing claims.

Violent crime is rare in China but there has been a series of knife and axe attacks in recent years, many targeting children.
China Central Television said that in January 2017 Qin Pengan stabbed the children with a vegetable knife in order to extract revenge for his life not going as he wanted and a dispute with a neighbor.
None of the children died from their injuries.
A local court in Pingxiang city in south China's Guangxi province sentenced Qin to death, and the sentence was carried out on Friday after being approved by the China's Supreme People's Court, the broadcaster said.
Despite efforts to reduce the number of people executed every year, China still puts more people to death every year than any other country, according to estimates from rights groups.
A Supreme People's Court judge in December made a rare defense of the death penalty, saying that China could not abolish the system for fear of angering a public that overwhelmingly supports its use.

U.S. officials discussed the schedule for the second Trump-Kim summit while in contact with North Korean officials in the Vietnamese capital city, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event, the Munhwa Ilbo reported, citing unnamed diplomatic sources in Seoul and Washington. 
Vietnam has diplomatic relations with both the United States and North Korea, with North Korea maintaining a diplomatic office in Vietnam, and has the symbolic significance of a communist country that has reformed its economy, the newspaper reported. 
A spokesperson for the U.S Embassy in Seoul did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
On Sunday, Trump told reporters in Washington that the United States and North Korea are “negotiating a location” for a second summit. 
""It will be announced probably in the not too distant future,” Trump said. “They do want to meet and we want to meet and we'll see what happens."" 
While the two sides had “a very good dialogue” and the American president had “indirectly” communicated with Kim, Trump said sanctions would be enforced until more progress is made.
In a nationally televised New Year address, Kim said he is willing to meet Trump again anytime to achieve their common goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, but warned he may have to take an alternative path if U.S. sanctions and pressure against the country continued.

""I am always ready to sit together with the U.S. president anytime in the future, and will work hard to produce results welcomed by the international community without fail,"" Kim said.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - At the height of Pol Pot's genocidal Khmer Rouge ""killing fields"" regime which devastated Cambodia for more than three years from 1975-79, Srey Heng overcame her crippling hunger by catching and eating frogs, snails and insects.
""I was just skin and bones,"" said Srey Heng, who was conscripted by the Khmer Rouge into a mobile labor unit for children, and forced to dig canals.
Thousands of Cambodian survivors of the Khmer Rouge marked the 40th anniversary of their demise in a commemoration in Phnom Penh on Monday.
About 60,000 people gathered at a stadium in the capital, where dancers and performers held banners and waved flags in scenes reminiscent of an Olympic opening ceremony.
The event was organized by the ruling Cambodian People's party (CPP), whose Prime Minister Hun Sen has led the Southeast Asian country for more than 33 years. 
The 66-year-old, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, came to power under a government installed by Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia at the end of 1978 and captured Phom Penh on Jan. 7, 1979, ending Khmer Rouge rule and forcing its leader, Pol Pot, into hiding.
Much of the event was dedicated to the achievements of Hun Sen, who has come under fire from rights groups for his intimidation of political opponents and for winning a widely criticized general election last July.
Songs praising the prime minister as a ""peaceful and loyal statesman"" echoed through the stadium. Traditional dancers performed in honor of his policies.
Outside, survivors like Srey Heng, now a street vendor selling water and soft drinks, cast a more somber figure compared with the scenes inside.
""Many of my relatives died under Pol Pot because they were hungry, Srey Heng said. 
""I don't even know what happened to the others"".
'CHAOS'
An estimated 1.7 million people died at the hands of the extremist, communist regime. 
Most victims died of torture, starvation, disease, or exhaustion in labor camps. Others were beaten to death during mass executions.
Seang Tharuon, 69, lost 11 siblings and both her parents during the killings. She was forced by the Khmer Rouge to marry her husband.
Like many others, Seang Tharuon was evacuated from Phom Penh by the Khmer Rouge at the start of its nightmarish rule. She walked for more than 100 km (62 miles) from the countryside back to the capital when the regime fell in 1979.
""We mainly had gruel to eat, and they would let us eat rice once a month,"" Seang Tharuon told Reuters as she bought drinks from Srey Heng's stall outside the stadium.
In downtown Phnom Penh, former Khmer Rouge soldier Prum Punly balanced on one leg as he fed birds by the river. 
He lost his other leg to a landmine while fighting against U.S.-backed Cambodian government forces in 1975, as the Khmer Rouge came to power:
""I was too young to understand politics,"" the 67-year-old said.

""It was chaos"".

BANGKOK/DUBAI (Reuters) - An 18-year-old Saudi woman fleeing her family barricaded herself inside a Thai airport hotel on Monday, refusing to allow immigration officials to escort her on to a flight to Kuwait and saying she fears her family will kill her. 
Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun has been at Bangkok airport since Saturday when she was denied entry by Thai immigration officials, who deny her accusations that she was detained at the behest of the Saudi government.
The Saudi Foreign Ministry denied her allegations that its embassy had confiscated her passport, saying in a Tweet she was stopped at the airport for violating Thai immigration laws.
Qunun posted a video on Twitter on Monday of her barricading her hotel door with a table and a mattress.
A Thai immigration official confirmed Qunun was still in the hotel room on Monday morning. Another airport official confirmed that the Kuwait Airways flight she was scheduled to be on had left.
Qunun told Reuters she fled Kuwait while her family was visiting the Gulf country and had planned to travel from Thailand to Australia to seek asylum. She said she was detained after leaving her plane in Bangkok and told she would be sent back to Kuwait.
""My brothers and family and the Saudi embassy will be waiting for me in Kuwait,"" Qunun said by text and voice message from the hotel late on Sunday.
""They will kill me,"" she said. ""My life is in danger. My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things.""
Asked why she was seeking refuge in Australia, she said: ""Physical, emotional and verbal abuse and being imprisoned inside the house for months. They threaten to kill me and prevent me from continuing my education.
""They won't let me drive or travel. I am oppressed. I love life and work and I am very ambitious but my family is preventing me from living."" 
THAIS, SAUDIS DENY ALLEGATIONS
Her family could not immediately be reached for comment. In her initial social media pleas, Qunun said her family was powerful in Saudi society but she did not identify them.
Saudi culture and guardianship policy requires women to have permission from a male relative to work, travel, marry, and even get some medical treatment.
Thai immigration authorities denied Qunun's allegations they were acting at the behest of the Saudi government, saying she was refused entry because she did not have the proper documents for a visa on arrival.
The Saudi Foreign Ministry said on its official Twitter account: ""She was stopped by the airport authorities for violating the laws. Her passport was not impounded by the Saudi embassy.""
New York-based Human Rights Watch said Thailand should not send Qunun back to her family because she says she faces danger.
""Thai authorities should immediately halt any deportation, and either allow her to continue her travel to Australia or permit her to remain in Thailand to seek protection as a refugee,"" Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
Qunun said she had obtained an Australian visa and booked a flight. She said she planned to spend a few days in Thailand so she would not spark suspicion when she left Kuwait.
""When I landed at the airport, someone came and said he would process the (Thai) visa but he took my passport. He came back with what seemed to be airport security and said that my parents objected and said I must return to Saudi Arabia via Kuwait Airways,"" she said.
She said she believed she was stopped after her family appealed to Kuwait Airways. A spokesman for Kuwait Airways said he had no information about the case.
Thai immigration chief Surachate Hakparn said he had had no contact with Saudi officials or Thailand's foreign minister before Qunun's arrival. He said she was denied entry because she did not have a paid return ticket or hotel reservation.

""She was over-exaggerating... She fled her family from Saudi Arabia and arrived in Thailand but she didn't have necessary documents to enter. Thai immigration had to deny her entry,"" he said, describing such cases as standard procedure.

The king resigned on Sunday after just two years on the throne, the first time a monarch has stepped down before completing their five-year tenure. 
No reason was given for the resignation.
Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy and the king assumes a largely ceremonial role, including acting as custodian of Islam in the Muslim-majority country. The king's assent is needed for the appointment of a prime minister and various senior officials.
Malaysia's nine royal households take turns to provide a king, who is chosen through a vote in a Council of Rulers, made up of the nine households, most of which are led by a sultan.
Heads of six of the nine households met on Monday at the national palace to decide a date for the election of a new king, Bernama reported. It was not clear why the other three did not attend.
A vote must be held within four weeks of the throne becoming vacant.
King Muhammad, 49, had resumed duties last week after spending two months on medical leave.
Images purporting to show him getting married in Russia appeared on social media in December and identified his new wife as Oksana Voevodina, who won a Miss Moscow contest in 2015.
The palace did not respond to earlier requests for comment on the photos or reports of a marriage.
Media has reported tension between the palace and the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad since the latter returned to power last year. 
Mahathir led the opposition to a historic election win in May, defeating a coalition that had governed Malaysia for 60 years. 
In June, the government and palace faced a near two-week impasse over a plan to appoint someone how was not from the majority ethnic Malay community as attorney-general. 
The king eventually approved the appointment, though the incident had stoked ethnic tensions.
Mahathir, known for challenging royalty during his earlier 22-year tenure as prime minister, said in a blog post last week that everyone ""from the Rulers to the Prime Minister and Ministers, to the civil servants and ordinary citizens"" are subject to the law. He did not elaborate.

Mahathir said on Monday the government hoped the council would elect a new king as soon as possible as the government needed to keep the king apprised on ""certain matters"", Bernama reported.

The detentions were the result of investigations into pay phone communications between alleged members of cleric Fethullah Gulen's network, Anadolu said. It said the detentions were in progress.
Police have conducted a steady stream of raids against Gulen's alleged supporters since the July 2016 coup attempt, in which 250 people were killed. Gulen denies involvement.
More than 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial, while 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from their jobs as part of the post-coup purges. Widespread operations are still routine. 
Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have voiced concerns over the scale of the crackdown, saying President Tayyip Erdogan has used the abortive putsch as a pretext to quash dissent.

The government, however, has said the security measures were necessary due to the gravity of the threat Turkey faces.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Former Venezuelan Supreme Court Justice Christian Zerpa has fled to the United States to protest President Nicolas Maduro's second term that will begin with his inauguration this week, the onetime Maduro backer told a Miami broadcaster on Sunday.
The latest defection from the crisis-stricken OPEC nation's government comes amid growing international pressure on Maduro over his new term, which resulted from a broadly boycotted 2018 vote dismissed by countries around the world as a sham.
""I've decided to leave Venezuela to disavow the government of Nicolas Maduro,"" Zerpa said in an interview with EVTV, which is broadcast over cable and the internet. 
""I believe (Maduro) does not deserve a second chance because the election he supposedly won was not free and competitive.""
The Supreme Court confirmed in a statement that he had fled, referring to him as a former magistrate and adding it opened an investigation of him in November over accusations of sexual harassment by women in his office. The court's leadership recommended that he be dismissed over the allegations, it said, without providing details.
Zerpa was for years a crucial ally of Maduro on the Supreme Court, which has backed the ruling Socialist Party in every major legal dispute since Maduro's 2013 election. 
He wrote a 2016 ruling that provided the legal justification for Maduro's government to strip congress of most of its powers after the Socialist Party lost control of the body to the opposition in a landslide election.
Zerpa in the interview described the Supreme Court as ""an appendage of the executive branch,"" and said that justices were at times summoned to the presidential palace to receive instructions on how to rule on certain sensitive cases.
The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Zerpa said he did not criticize Maduro's May 2018 election to make sure he could pave the way for a safe exit from the country in the company of his family.
Opposition leaders have urged foreign governments not to recognize Maduro after his inauguration on Thursday, and a group of Latin American nations on Friday called on Maduro not to take office.

But diplomats consulted by Reuters said few countries were likely to shutter embassies or sever ties with Venezuela.
Zerpa's words echoed those of former Justice Eladio Aponte, who fled to the United States in 2012 and said the government of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez - Maduro's predecessor - systematically manipulated court affairs.

194,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2019 09:45PM ET</span>","Air quality worsens in China's Henan province, improves elsewhere","By David Stanway
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Air pollution in China's heavy-industrial province of Henan worsened in December even as other regions improved, official data showed, with its cities hit by unfavorable weather and a struggle to find cleaner sources of economic growth.
China is restricting industrial output, traffic and coal consumption in the smog-prone north for a second year in a bid to cut pollution during the winter heating period, when thousands of mainly coal-burning boilers are switched on.
But nine cities in Henan, home to around 95 million people, still recorded a rise in small, lung-damaging emissions known as PM2.5 to an average of 82 micrograms per cubic meter in the last month of 2018, up 12 percent from a year earlier. 
Emissions in the cities - which include several big steel, aluminum and coal producing districts - had already soared by 107 percent from a year earlier in November, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. 
As many as 79 cities throughout the north and east have drawn up plans to control smog this winter, with many committed to cutting PM2.5 emissions by 3 percent from last year. 
For these cities, average PM2.5 levels fell 18 percent in December from a year earlier to 66 micrograms per cubic meter, according to Reuters calculations, although still nearly double China's national standard of 35 micrograms.
But the local increases in Henan and elsewhere show how much cities are at the mercy of the weather, with conditions such as high humidity and low wind exacerbating smog.
""My analysis indicates that (the rises in Henan) are accounted for by the weather,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, energy analyst with Greenpeace.
Henan's smog concentrations have worsened since the end of last year, with the local government saying on Saturday that 12 provincial cities have issued ""red alerts"" for the coming week. 
Some 28 cities in the major pollution control zone around China's capital Beijing are also struggling to meet winter air quality targets, with average PM2.5 in the last two months of 2018 up 17 percent compared with a year earlier. 
The zone includes the country's top steel producing province of Hebei, where average emissions rose 11 percent in the last two months of 2018.
Hebei has promised to cut PM2.5 by 5 percent this year compared to 2018, the official Hebei Daily reported on Monday, citing the local environmental bureau. 
It vowed to cut another 14 million tonnes of steel smelting capacity and 9 million tonnes of coal production, after shutting 12.3 million tonnes and 13 million tonnes respectively in 2018.

The province said last week it had cut PM2.5 by 12.5 percent to an average of 56 micrograms over the whole of 2018, beating its target.

KALINOWKA, Poland (Reuters) - The former Catholic priest of the Polish village of Kalinowka is serving three years in jail for molesting five schoolgirls. But Marta Zezula, a mother whose testimony helped convict him, says the priest's victims are the ones made to feel guilty.
""We are witches ... because we have pointed at the priest,"" Zezula fumed as she shoveled straw into a chaff cutter in her barn in the tiny settlement in eastern Poland.
Many parishioners believe she and other mothers of those molested ""simply convicted an innocent man"", she said.
Home to about 170 people, Kalinowka is a short drive from the main road, but feels more remote. The Holy Cross church, built in 1880, sits on a hill overlooking rolling farmland and forests full of deer.
Krystyna Kluzniak, hurrying into the well-kept church on a chilly November evening, said people should give the jailed priest a break. ""The priest was cool and we miss him,"" she said.
The priest, who cannot be named under Polish law, is now on trial again, charged with molesting another child. His lawyer, Marek Tokarczyk, said he denies the allegations. ""We need a fair trial,"" Tokarczyk said.
Similar scandals have shaken the Catholic Church and split communities in the United States, Ireland, Australia and elsewhere.
But Poland is one of Europe's most devout nations, where most people identify as Catholics and the Church is widely revered. Priests were active in the fight against communism and in 1989, led by a Polish pope, John Paul II, the Church helped overthrow Communist rule.
Divisions over allegations of abuse are particularly stark here, said Marek Lisinski, the director of ""Have no fear"", a group that advocates for victims of clerical abuse. Parishioners often side with priests and ostracize victims and their families, Lisinski told Reuters.
LANDMARK RULING 
In October, ""Have no fear"" published a map that revealed the scale of the issue. It used black crosses to mark places where 60 priests had been convicted of abuses dating back to 1956.
Afterwards, Lisinski said, people called in to report another 300 cases of suspected abuse by priests which they had not raised with the Church or police for fear they would be doubted or shunned.
The same month, a Polish court of appeal upheld a landmark ruling which granted a million zloty ($260,000) in compensation to a woman abused by a priest as a child.
Jaroslaw Gluchowski, a lawyer in Poznan who represents victims of clerical abuse, said the ruling set an important precedent.
""We're now at a moment when all victims in Poland are realizing that they're not alone,"" he said.
In a November statement, Poland's bishops asked victims of clerical abuse for forgiveness and said the Church had begun collecting data to ""identify the causes of these deeds and assess their scale"".
Archbishop Wojciech Polak, the primate of Poland, told Reuters the Church will publish its findings within six months. 
Polak encouraged victims of clerical abuse to talk to their bishops, who are ""obliged to report to the prosecutors' service all credible cases they get knowledge of"".
He said he was aware the issue had caused rifts in some communities. ""It is the Church's responsibility to act in a way that doesn't create divisions but heals them,"" he said.
Senior bishops from around the world will meet Pope Francis at a conference in the Vatican in February to discuss protection of minors. Conference organizers have said everyone must be held accountable or the Church risked losing credibility worldwide.
The issue could also have political ramifications in Poland, Lisinski and other observers say. The country is due to elect a new parliament by December 2019.
The Catholic Church has long played a major political role in Poland, making its 25,000 priests not only revered but also influential with voters.
In December, a report appeared in Gazeta Wyborcza, a leading Polish daily, containing molestation allegations from a woman, Barbara Borowiecka, against the late priest Henryk Jankowski, an iconic figure in the anti-communist Solidarity movement.
The mayor of Gdansk, the birthplace of Solidarity, asked the Church to investigate the allegations. Archbishop Polak told Reuters the Jankowski allegations ""should be investigated for the good of the Church"" and said it was up to bishop of Gdansk to address them.
""POLAND'S COLLAPSE""
The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party won power in 2015 with a blend of patriotism and piety that echoed the religious nationalism of the Church. In October, a former PiS minister, Antoni Macierewicz, credited the Polish clergy with helping the party win local elections that month.
Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, an MP for a small opposition party called Now, is seeking an independent inquiry into child abuse by priests because she says the Church cannot be relied upon to investigate itself. She says the idea has received no support from PiS or other big parties.
A PiS spokesperson did not respond to several requests asking whether it supported the idea of an inquiry. Ryszard Czarnecki, a PiS MP for the European Parliament, responded to Reuters by asking why the Church should be singled out.
""I don't know why we are focusing on one group, as this also concerns different groups - for example, artistic or journalistic ones,"" he said.
About 12 million people, or almost a third of Poland's population, regularly attend Mass, according to a survey by the Institute for Catholic Church Statistics, a Warsaw-based research center. The numbers slightly declined from 2015 to 2016, the survey showed.
Most children attend religious classes, but their numbers are dropping, too. In Lodz, Poland's third-largest city, they fell from 80 percent in 2015 to fewer than 50 percent now, according to local government data quoted by the daily Dziennik Lodzki.
In November, the Church said such trends could have dire consequences. ""Abandoning the Catholic faith and the Christian principles governing our national life and state's functioning"" could lead to Poland's collapse, it warned in a pastoral letter.
In Kalinowka, Reuters spoke to seven parishioners. Most of them were sticking by the convicted priest. ""I have a cousin whose son went to one of his classes and they didn't see it,"" Wieslaw Solowiej, a pensioner, said outside the Kalinowka church.
Jolanta Zych, whose nine-year-old daughter was among those molested, said neighbors spurned the family. ""I always greet people but some turn their faces from me,"" said Zych.
The other mother Reuters spoke to, Zezula, said her daughter began refusing food after the court case. ""She didn't want to eat because one woman told her the priest was in jail because of her.""
During Mass, Zezula said, people shrank away or refused to shake hands during a ritual greeting known as the sign of peace. She no longer goes to church.
Piotr Lenart, the current priest, referred questions to the Zamosc-Lubaczow Diocese in which the Kalinowka parish lies.
Michal Maciolek, a priest and spokesman for the diocese, said it had offered the victims and their families pastoral and psychological help, but this had been rejected. No financial compensation was offered, because ""the diocese can't take responsibility for the priest's actions"".

The program said Cairo had asked the network not to air the interview but did not give further details.
Under Sisi, Egypt has quietly cooperated with Israel on security in Egypt's Sinai, a desert peninsula demilitarized as part of a U.S.-sponsored 1979 peace treaty between the two countries but where Cairo's forces now operate freely.
Acknowledging such cooperation with Israel can be a sensitive topic in Egypt.
Asked whether the cooperation was the closest and deepest that he has had with Israel, Sisi responded: ""That is correct.""
""The Air Force sometimes needs to cross to the Israeli side. And that's why we have a wide range of coordination with the Israelis,"" Sisi said, according to a transcript provided by CBS.
Defeating militants in the Sinai and restoring security after years of unrest has been a key promise of Sisi, who was re-elected in March last year in a landslide victory against no real opposition.
Islamist militants have been waging an insurgency for years in the north of the peninsula, which lacks basic infrastructure and job opportunities. In contrast, the region's southern coast is peppered with Red Sea tourist resorts.
Egyptian security forces have battled Islamist militants in the mainly desert region, stretching from the Suez Canal eastwards to the Gaza Strip and Israel, since 2013. 
Asked why he had not managed to wipe the militants out, Sisi responded by pointing to the difficulties that the United States has faced in Afghanistan against the Taliban insurgency.
""Why hasn't the U.S. eliminated the terrorists in Afghanistan after 17 years and spending a trillion dollars?"" he asked.
Sisi's critics accuse him of cracking down on all dissent, but supporters say tough measures are needed to stabilize Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011.
In his interview with ""60 Minutes,"" Sisi denied that Egypt was holding political prisoners. CBS cited one rights group's estimate of 60,000 political prisoners.
""I don't know where they got that figure. I said there are no political prisoners in Egypt,"" Sisi said.

""Whenever there is a minority trying to impose their extremist ideology ... we have to intervene regardless of their numbers.""

Badawi was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2003 over his role in the October 2000 deadly bombing of the USS Cole, a Navy guided-missile destroyer. He escaped from prison in Yemen twice, once in 2003 and again in 2006.
""U.S. forces confirmed the results of the strike following a deliberate assessment process,"" said Central Command spokesman Captain Bill Urban, two days after the Defense Department said U.S. forces had targeted Badawi in the strike.
It is the latest blow to Yemen's al Qaeda branch, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which has lost key leaders in U.S strikes in recent years. In 2018, U.S. officials said they believed that Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, once one of the world's most feared bombmakers, had been killed.
Still, Katherine Zimmerman at the American Enterprise Institute conservative thinktank cautioned that AQAP had proven it will remain a threat. The group has benefited from the chaos of Yemen's civil war, although it has lost major strongholds, including the port city of Mukallah.
""There is certainly a degradation of the leadership,"" Zimmerman said. 
""The big concern is that al Qaeda has always proven that its bench is much deeper and there is no clear strategy for stabilizing Yemen and setting the conditions where we don't have a new generation (of militants) coming forward.""
Yemen's conflict has pushed it to the verge of famine, with millions relying on food aid.
The death of Badawi removes perhaps the last major figure in the USS Cole attack from the battlefield.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: ""Our GREAT MILITARY has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the USS Cole."" 
There was a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest.
The Cole attack was a devastating blow to the U.S. Navy.

On Oct. 12, 2000, two men in a small boat detonated explosives alongside the vessel as it was refueling in Aden, killing 17 sailors, wounding more than three dozen others and blasting a gaping hole in its hull.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian soldiers raided the offices of the country's Daily Trust newspaper and arrested two of its journalists following an article about the military's fight against Islamist militants in the northeast, the newspaper said on Sunday.
The Daily Trust published photographs on its website of armed soldiers raiding its head office in the capital, Abuja. The paper also said the military had shut down its office in the northeastern city of Maiduguri after arresting a regional editor and a reporter. 
The paper said the raids and arrests followed the publication of a story about the fight against Islamists. An uptick in attacks in recent months has made security a key campaign issue in the run up to the Feb. 16 presidential election in which Muhammadu Buhari will seek a second term. 
A Nigerian army spokesman did not respond to text messages and telephone calls seeking comment. 
""The Federal Government has directed the military to vacate the premises of @daily_trust and the order has been complied with,"" the president's spokesman, Garba Shehu, said on Twitter. 
""Issues between the military and the newspaper as they affect the coverage of the war in the Northeast will be resolved through dialogue,"" he added. 
Atiku Abubakar, a businessman and former vice president who is the main opposition party's candidate, also posted a message on Twitter following the raids. 
""Freedom of the press is the bedrock of our democracy and nothing should be done to compromise it,"" he said. 
The Islamist militant group Boko Haram has killed around 30,000 people since 2009 in an insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria that has spawned a humanitarian crisis. 
It was pushed off most of the swathe of territory around the size of Belgium that it controlled in early 2015, but a faction that broke away in 2016 - Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) - has in the last few months claimed responsibility for a series attacks on military bases and strategically located towns. 
The group attacked Baga - a town that borders Niger, Chad and Cameroon - in December, forcing hundreds to seek safety in Maiduguri, some 200 km (125 miles) to the south.
Opponents of Buhari have criticized his security record, pointing to such battles and a notable attack on an army base in Metele, Borno state, in which about 100 soldiers were killed.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2019 04:45PM ET</span>",WikiLeaks tells reporters 140 things not to say about Julian Assange,"LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks on Sunday advised journalists not to report 140 different ""false and defamatory"" statements about its founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since June 2012.
It was not immediately clear what prompted the advice to media organizations, but WikiLeaks singled out Britain's Guardian newspaper for publishing what it said was a false report about Assange. The Guardian did not immediately respond late on Sunday to a Reuters request for comment.
The Australian set up WikiLeaks as a channel for publishing confidential information from anonymous sources. He is a hero to some for exposing what supporters cast as government abuse of power and for championing free speech, but to others he is a rebel who has undermined the security of the United States.
WikiLeaks angered Washington by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables that laid bare often highly critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family.
""There is a pervasive climate of inaccurate claims about WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, including purposeful fabrications planted in large and otherwise 'reputable' media outlets,"" Wikileaks said an email sent to media organizations and marked ""Confidential legal communication. Not for publication.""
""Consequently journalists and publishers have a clear responsibility to carefully fact-check from primary sources and to consult the following list to ensure they are not spreading, and have not spread, defamatory falsehoods about WikiLeaks or Julian Assange.""
WikiLeaks did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The 5,000-word email included 140 statements that WikiLeaks said were false and defamatory, such as the assertion that Assange had ever been an ""agent or officer of any intelligence service"".
WikiLeaks also said it was false and defamatory to suggest that Assange, 47, had ever been employed by the Russian government or that he is, or has ever been, close to the Russian state, the Kremlin or Putin.
Other items listed as false and defamatory included more personal claims including that Assange bleaches his hair, that he is a hacker, that he has ever neglected an animal or that he has poor personal hygiene.
Assange made international headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopters that killed a dozen people in Baghdad, including two Reuters news staff.
Later that year, the group released over 90,000 secret documents detailing the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, followed by almost 400,000 internal U.S. military reports detailing operations in Iraq.

More than 250,000 classified cables from U.S. embassies followed, then almost 3 million dating back to 1973.

GAZA (Reuters) - The Palestinian Authority said on Sunday it had ordered its employees to pull out from the Gaza-Egypt border crossing, effectively closing the main exit point from the impoverished Gaza Strip. 
The dispute over the border stems from a rift between the PA, based in the occupied West Bank and headed by Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and the Islamist militant group Hamas, which took control of Gaza more than a decade ago in a civil war.
Re-opening the Rafeh crossing, which according to human rights groups is the sole exit point from Gaza for an estimated 95 percent of its 2 million population, will require Egypt to agree on a new operator. 
It is unclear whether it will allow Hamas to run the passage. Cairo has not so far commented on the situation. 
PA employees were deployed to Gaza's border crossings with Israel and Egypt in 2017 under Egyptian mediation in what was seen as the first concrete step towards ending the dispute.
The PA said Sunday's decision to pull out from the crossing was a response to Hamas undermining its operations and detaining some of its workers.
""After Hamas's insistence on bolstering division ... and the questioning, detention and suppression of our employees, we have become convinced it is useless to maintain our presence there,"" it said. 
The decision takes effect on Monday, though the crossing was already scheduled to be closed until Tuesday due to a holiday. 
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told Reuters the closure of the border amounted to ""additional sanctions by Abbas against the people of Gaza"".
""This is a blow to... Egypt, which had overseen the handover of the crossings as part of the implementation of the reconciliation deal that Abbas has destroyed,"" he said. 
Poverty is rampant in Gaza due to an Israeli-Egyptian blockade and three armed confrontations with Israel since 2008, as well as the internal rivalry. Israel says its restrictions are to stop weapons entering the territory.
The two Palestinian groups have tried and failed numerous times to end their dispute.

Officials from Abbas's Fatah movement said Hamas-led security forces have detained nearly 400 of their supporters and activists in Gaza in recent days, while Hamas said dozens of their men were detained by the PA in the West Bank.

Copts, the largest Christian minority in the Middle East, were due hold a midnight mass in the Cathedral of the Nativity, billed by the government as the Middle East's largest church, a few hours after the inauguration.
Coptic Christians make up an estimated 10 percent of Egypt's nearly 100 million people and have long complained of discrimination under laws that favor Muslims.
They have also increasingly been targeted in recent years by Islamist militants including Islamic State, which is waging an insurgency in the north of the remote Sinai Peninsula.
Foreign dignitaries and officials including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Arab League Chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit flanked Sisi at the opening, state television showed.
Angham, a prominent local singer, sang for Muslim-Christian coexistence as a display of fireworks lit the skies over the two houses of worship.
""This is an important moment in our history,"" Sisi said in a speech as he opened the cathedral. ""We are one and we will remain one,"" he added, referring to Egyptian Christians and Muslims.
""On this day we see you have fulfilled this promise and here we are witnessing a great opening on this grand occasion,"" the head of the Coptic church Pope Tawadros II said. He will preside over midnight mass later in the evening with Sisi in attendance.
U.S. President Donald Trump also praised the opening of the church and the mosque.
""Excited to see our friends in Egypt opening the biggest Cathedral in the Middle East. President Al-Sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future,"" Trump tweeted on Sunday.
The Cathedral of the Nativity, adorned with Coptic icons, can accommodate more than 8,000 worshippers while the al-Fattah al-Aleem Mosque can hold nearly double the number. Both are located in the new administrative capital, a major development located some 45 km (28 miles) east of Cairo.
Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, Grand Imam of the al-Azhar Mosque, said Islam obliges Muslims to safeguard and defend houses of worship, whether Muslim, Christian or Jewish.
Contractors have been clearing debris from the perimeter of the cathedral in the last two weeks in preparation for its grand opening.
The new Egyptian capital, announced in March 2015, is intended partly to reduce crowding in Cairo but will also be home to government ministries and an airport. The government is expecting to begin moving to the new premises later this year.

Fernandez passed away in the early hours of the morning, Cuban state-run media reported, but as is customary in Cuba no information was given on the cause of death. He had reportedly been in poor health the last few years and was hospitalized several months ago.
Fernandez joined the Cuban military in the 1940s and received training in the United States. He joined the opposition to the Batista dictatorship in the 1950s but was caught and imprisoned in 1956. He remained behind bars until Castro's revolution triumphed in 1959.
Fernandez was soon put in charge of training the country's civilian militia due to his military background. He was named commandant in 1961 and brigade general of the reserve in 1966.
Fidel Castro and his younger brother Raul considered Fernandez a man they could always rely on and he served throughout the decades in various military, government and Communist Party posts, including adviser to the president, minister of education and president of the Olympic Committee.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - White House national security adviser John Bolton added a new condition on Sunday to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, saying Turkey must agree to protect the United States' Kurdish allies.
President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to announce a U.S. pullout from Syria left many questions open, chiefly whether Kurdish fighters who had been operating in northern Syria alongside U.S. forces would now be attacked by their long-time enemy, Turkey.
Bolton, on a trip to Israel and Turkey, said he would stress in talks with Turkish officials, including President Tayyip Erdogan, that Kurdish forces must be protected.
Ahead of talks with Israeli officials, he told reporters the pullout would be done in a way that guaranteed the Islamic State jihadist group ""is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again.""
And it would be carried out in such a way as to ""make sure that the defense of Israel and our other friends in the region is absolutely assured, and to take care of those who have fought with us against ISIS and other terrorist groups.""
Asked whether a U.S. withdrawal would not take place in Syria until Turkey guaranteed the Kurdish fighters would be safe, Bolton said: ""Basically, that's right.""
The Syrian YPG militia has been highly effective in the war against Islamic State, a part of the wider Syrian conflict pitting a range of insurgent groups against President Bashar al-Assad's forces and sometimes against each other. 
But Turkey has long castigated Washington for its military relationship with the YPG. Ankara regards the YPG an extension of the PKK, a Kurdish armed group that has waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey for over three decades.
""PRESIDENT'S REQUIREMENT""
""We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States at a minimum,"" Bolton said, ""so they don't endanger our troops, but also so that they meet the president's requirement that the Syrian opposition forces that have fought with us are not endangered.""
The YPG has indicated that it might seek a deal with Damascus after the U.S. forces have gone. 
Bolton, who will travel to Turkey on Monday, said the United States would talk to Ankara to find out what its objectives and capabilities were.
Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey's targets were the YPG, the PKK and Islamic State.
""One aim of Turkey's fight against the PKK and its Syrian extensions is to rescue the Kurds from the cruelty and oppression of this terrorist group,"" state-owned Anadolu news agency quoted Kalin as saying, in comments that emerged after Bolton made his remarks.
""Turkey will continue decisively its efforts to end the war, provide security, and implement the process of political transition without discriminating between our Syrian brothers on the basis of religion, ethnicity or sect,"" Kalin said.
In Washington on Sunday, Trump reiterated that the United States would be pulling its troops out of Syria but suggested the move might not happen soon.
""I never said we are doing it that quickly. But we are decimating ISIS,"" Trump told reporters.

Later on Sunday Bolton met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and reassured Israel and other allies of the United States' commitment to their security.

RAXRUHA, Guatemala (Reuters) - In the poor, hot region of Guatemala that was home to a seven-year-old migrant girl before she died in U.S. border custody last month, palm oil cultivation is taking over from subsistence farming, adding to pressure on people to leave.
Many villagers around the municipality of Raxruha have sold land to palm oil producers, residents and local officials say, helping to make Guatemala one of the world's biggest exporters of the versatile product in the space of just a few years.
Supporters of the industry say it has created jobs and investment in an area where poverty and violence have long been the main drivers of migration.
But critics say farmers have given up land that long fed them, with many then entering a state of co-dependency with palm oil companies that have become major employers, but do not pay well enough to stop people migrating.
Cesar Castro, Raxruha's mayor, said money raised from land sales had been used to pay people smugglers, a major factor in a surge in families leaving Guatemala.
""These people get the money, and they go to the United States, and the vast majority come back to find more poverty and end up employed as workers on their own land,"" Castro said.
More than 50,000 Guatemalans were apprehended in family groups at the U.S.-Mexico border in the 2018 fiscal year, more than double the year before, U.S. government data shows. Most get deported.
Jakelin Caal, who died in U.S. custody after succumbing to a fever, left Raxruha with her father because he was struggling to earn enough to support his family as a corn farmer, relatives said. Smugglers tell families that having children with them can make it easier to enter the United States.
While her father had not sold his land, others in the family have worked on palm plantations that surround their village.
""The work's a killer,"" said Dorrian Caal, Jakelin's uncle. ""You have to get up at 3 a.m. and you get home at 10 at night, and with the little you're paid, it's not enough.""
Dorrian said he earned 60 quetzales ($7.80) a day working from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. last year for local producer Industria Chiquibul, which has been listed as a supplier by international commodities purchasers including ADM and Cargill [CARGIL.UL].
That would be below the 90 quetzales stipulated as the daily minimum wage for the agricultural sector in 2018. The National Council for Displaced People of Guatemala, a labor rights group, lodged a complaint with Cargill about the wages in 2016.
Local farmer Jose Maria Ical said the company agreed to raise its wages to 91 quetzales after repeated workers' complaints.
Chiquibul did not reply to repeated requests for comment on this article. Questioned on Chiquibul, ADM said it set high standards for its suppliers of palm oil, without making any specific reference to the company in its reply.
""We take violations of our policies very seriously, and thoroughly investigate any allegations and take appropriate actions as a result of those findings,"" ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson said.
Cargill did not reply to a request for comment.
Carlos Tut, 38, of the Raxruha Community Indigenous Association, said the seasonal nature of palm cultivation meant work tended to dry up outside harvest time, another reason landless families were leaving. 
POVERTY
Used in foodstuffs, detergents and fuels, palm oil is mostly produced in Indonesia and Malaysia, where environmental groups are worried that its planting has caused deforestation and habitat destruction.
In the past few years, Guatemala has become the biggest exporter in the Americas, according to Guatemalan palm oil industry association Grepalma.
Exports leapt almost seven-fold in the last ten years to 727,000 tonnes in 2017. Over one seventh of the area under cultivation in Guatemala is in Alta Verapaz, the remote, forested region where Raxruha lies.
Traversed by dirt streets without sidewalks or drains, the town is peopled by children and adults that sometimes walk barefoot, often living in cramped thatched dwellings.
Farmer Ical related how he and others sold land to Chiquibul in 2010 in the Raxruha area when the firm purchased plots through intermediaries who said they were ranchers.
But access was later blocked to farmers' other allotments when Chiquibul's land was fenced off, he said. 
""They virtually obliged me to sell,"" Ical added.
Most of those who sold now work for the industry, he said.
Some see the arrival of the palm oil industry as a positive development. Darlyn Lemus, a 30-year-old teacher, said the firms had taken undue flak.
""There's been a lot of speculation the palm industry has forced them to sell, but it's not like that, people have had their own reasons,"" said Lemus, whose family is one of few in the area that have kept their lands.
One palm oil company in Raxruha, NaturAceites, told Reuters most of the land it operates in Guatemala had been converted from ""intensive cattle ranching.""

Describing the industry as ""the only chance of decent work there is in parts of the country,"" Hector Herrera, NaturAceites' director of sustainability, said the firm had created thousands of jobs, invested in roads, schools and health centers, and met all the labor standards required by law.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",France's Macron reeling as tough stance against 'yellow vests' backfires,"By Richard Lough and Caroline Pailliez
PARIS (Reuters) - Emmanuel Macron intended to start the new year on the offensive against the 'yellow vest' protesters. Instead, the French president is reeling from more violent street demonstrations.
What began as a grassroots rebellion against diesel taxes and the high cost of living has morphed into something more perilous for Macron - an assault on his presidency and French institutions.
The anti-government protesters on Saturday used a forklift truck to force their way into a government ministry compound, torched cars near the Champs Elysees and in one violent skirmish on a bridge over the Seine punched and kicked riot police officers to the ground.
The French authorities' struggle to maintain order during the weekend protests raises questions not just over policing tactics but also over how Macron responds, as he prepares to bring in stricter rules for unemployment benefits and cut thousands of public sector jobs.
On Sunday evening, Macron wrote on Twitter: ""Once again, the Republic was attacked with extreme violence - its guardians, its representatives, its symbols.""
His administration had hardened its stance against the yellow vests after the protest movement appeared to have lost momentum over the Christmas holidays. 
The government would not relent in its pursuit of reforms to reshape the economy, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said on Friday, branding the remaining protesters agitators seeking to overthrow the government.
Twenty-four hours later, he was fleeing his office out of a back door as protesters invaded the courtyard and smashed up several cars. ""It wasn't me who was attacked,"" he later said. ""It was the Republic.""
Driving the unrest is anger, particularly among low-paid workers, over a squeeze on household incomes and a belief that Macron is indifferent to citizens' needs as he enacts reforms seen as pro-business and favoring the wealthy.
Macron's government has been shaken by the unrest, caught off-guard when in November the yellow vests began blocking roads, occupying highway tollbooths and staging violent invasions of Paris and other cities on weekends.
Two months on, it has not found a way to soothe the yellow vests' anger and meet their demands, which include a higher minimum wage, a more participative democracy and Macron's resignation.
With no clear leader, negotiating with the group is hard.
""IMPASSE""
Macron sought to head off the rebellion in December with a promise of tax cuts for pensioners, wage rises for the poorest workers and a reversal of planned fuel tax hikes, while pledging a national debate on key policy issues. He fell short.
The price tag for those concessions: 10 billion euros ($11.39 billion), enough to send French borrowing costs higher as investors fretted about debt levels and Macron's ability to reform the euro zone's second largest economy.
Laurent Berger, head of the reform-minded CFDT trade union, France's largest by members, on Sunday accused Macron's government of going it alone at a time it needed to reach out. 
""We're at an impasse. We have on the one side a violent movement ... and on the other a government which thinks it can find the answers all on its own,"" Berger told France Inter.
Some 50,000 protesters marched through cities and towns across France, including Paris, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Rennes and Marseille.
In Paris, the street marches began peacefully but degenerated when some protesters threw punches at baton-wielding officers, torched electric scooters and garbage bins along the Left Bank's upscale Boulevard Saint Germain and set cars ablaze near the Champs Elysees. Clashes erupted in other cities too.
Both yellow vests and ""casseurs"", hooded youths from anti-capitalist or anarchist groups, appeared to be involved. 
Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud said the prolonged unrest was hurting foreign investment.
Opposition lawmakers demanded the government put forward concrete proposals to address the yellow vests' demands, but government ministers dismissed caving in to a minority of troublemakers.

""We need to stop being a country that listens to those who cry the loudest,"" Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer told LCI news channel.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2019 12:00PM ET</span>",Cardinal's trial puts French Church in glare of Catholic abuse scandal,"By Catherine Lagrange
LYON, France (Reuters) - The Roman Catholic archbishop of Lyon goes on trial on Monday charged with failing to act on historical allegations of sexual abuse of boy scouts by a priest in his diocese.
Cardinal Philippe Barbarin is the highest-profile cleric to be caught up in the pedophile scandal inside the Catholic Church in France, and will stand trial alongside five others from his diocese.
While most of the recent focus in the Church's global abuse crisis has been on Australia and Chile, Barbarin's trial puts the spotlight on Europe's senior clergy again, just as Pope Francis prepares to host a meeting of senior bishops from around the world in Rome next month to discuss the protection of minors.
Barbarin is accused of failing to report allegations of sexual abuse in the 1980s and early 1990s by Father Bernard Preynat - a priest who has admitted sexual abuse, according to his lawyer, and is due to go on trial later this year.
The charges carry a potential three-year prison sentence and fines of up to about $50,000.
Barbarin told the newspaper Le Monde in August 2017 that he had never concealed allegations against Preynat, but acknowledged shortcomings in his handling of them.
""I myself realize that my response at the time was inadequate,"" he said. 
Barbarin's lawyer, Jean-Felix Luciani, said he expected Barbarin to be acquitted.
""He's accused of covering up for Preynat, whereas in fact it was Barbarin who triggered this whole process,"" Luciani said. ""You don't repair one injustice with another.""
""KNOCKED ON DOORS""
Barbarin told Le Monde in 2017 that he had previously opened an investigation of Preynat under church or canon law because a judicial investigation was moving so slowly.
Barbarin, who moved to the Lyon diocese in 2002, has said he became aware of Preynat’s activities in 2007. He eventually removed the priest from his post in 2015. 
Barbarin told Le Monde that he had suspended two other priests and called in the judiciary ""when I learned of allegations of recent abuses, in 2006 and 2014"". But faced with allegations of abuses said to have taken place 15 or 20 years earlier, he said he ""knocked on doors"" for advice, but received no satisfactory answer.
Lyon prosecutors had previously investigated Barbarin but dropped the probe in the summer of 2016 without a detailed explanation. However, an association of alleged victims called Parole Liberee (""Freed Word"") used a provision of French law to compel the cardinal to stand trial.
Pope Francis has come under fire over the Church's handling of the spreading sexual abuse crisis.
In September, researchers said they had found indications of sexual abuse in Germany by 1,670 Catholic clerics over the course of seven decades. On Friday, the Vatican said an Argentine bishop working in a top Vatican financial department was under preliminary investigation for sexual abuse.
Pope Francis himself met Barbarin in early 2016, and later told the Catholic newspaper La Croix that it would make no sense for the cardinal to resign before any eventual trial.

""According to the information at my disposal, Cardinal Barbarin took the appropriate measures, he took things in hand. He is brave, creative, a missionary,"" Francis was quoted as saying.

AMMAN (Reuters) - The main Turkish-backed rebel army has deployed along frontlines close to jihadists in northwest Syria to repel any new militant advance after an offensive that expanded their control over the country's last rebel-held bastion, rebels and residents said.
Islamist Tahrir al Sham, formerly affiliated to al Qaeda, on Sunday entered the town of Atareb, days after capturing from their mainstream rivals the strategic town of Darat Izza, both in the western Aleppo countryside, in a military campaign that has since spread across Idlib and areas near the Turkish border.
A convoy of Tahrir al Sham fighters entered the densely populated town after forcing its leaders to hand over control by threatening to storm it if mainstream rebels opposed to their hardline Islamist ideology do not leave.
The offensive by Tahrir al Sham has alarmed the National Army, the main Turkish-backed rebel force aimed at unifying disparate factions in the northwest.
""We took a decision to repel the aggression by Tahrir al Sham on the Aleppo and Idlib countryside,"" their spokesman Major Youssef Hamoud said. ""We are reinforcing areas to prevent their expansion and control of more villages and towns.""
The National Army compromises about 35,000 fighters from some of the biggest factions in a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced 11 million people from their homes over the last seven years.
The jihadists have been the dominant force in rebel-held Idlib province and also have a civil administration that runs basic services in many towns including Idlib city, the provincial capital.
Ideological differences divide them from nationalist groups in the Free Syrian Army gathered under the banner of the National Army and the National Liberation Front (NLF), both backed by Turkey. 
The rebel cause to topple President Bashar al-Assad has been plagued by turf wars and local rivalries.
""Tahrir al Sham seek to end the presence of the NLF and control all of Idlib,"" Hamoud said.
He echoed the view of military experts that the territorial gains would help widen the jihadists' grip over a strip along the northern border with Turkey to their strongholds further south in the western Aleppo countryside.
Hamoud also accused the jihadists of attempting to divert their forces from any Turkish army campaign to seize the city of Manbij and Arab towns located east of the Euphrates River, controlled by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militias.
President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to announce a U.S. pull-out from Syria has left open many questions, chiefly whether Kurdish fighters operating in northern Syria would now be targeted by their long-time enemy Turkey.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that Britain would be in uncharted territory if her Brexit deal is rejected by parliament later this month, despite little sign that she has won over skeptical lawmakers.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 but May's inability so far to get her deal for a managed exit through parliament has alarmed business leaders and investors who fear the country is heading for a damaging no-deal Brexit.
May said the vote in parliament would be around Jan. 15, as expected, contrary to reports she could delay it.
May has already delayed the vote once, in December, when it became clear she would lose unless extra reassurances from the EU were agreed.
Describing what would happen if she was defeated, May told the BBC: ""We're going to be in uncharted territory. I don't think anybody can say exactly what will happen in terms of the reaction we'll see in parliament.""
Amid the uncertainty over Britain's next steps - which range from leaving without a deal to not leaving at all - a poll showed more Britons want to remain a member of the EU than leave, and voters want to make the final decision themselves.
May's party itself is divided over her deal, with many fearing that an insurance policy designed to avoid the re-emergence of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland could leave Britain subject to EU rules indefinitely.
One of those leading that opposition, lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, said in a newspaper article that it was ""wishful thinking"" that time away from parliament over the Christmas holiday could persuade him to change his mind and back the deal.
The Northern Irish party that props up May's minority government called on her to stand firm in demanding that the EU changes its ""poison"" backstop provision on Ireland's post-Brexit border.
WORK TO DO
With the parliamentary debate on her deal due to begin on Jan. 9, May said there was still work to do to get reassurances over the backstop from the EU. She also promised parliament would have a greater say in the rest of the Brexit process and warned that rejecting her deal could prevent Britain's exit.
""Don't let the search for the perfect become the enemy of the good, because the danger there is actually we end up with no Brexit at all,"" May said.
She did not answer whether she would, if defeated, make a second attempt to get the deal passed by parliament.
May also did not directly respond, when asked, if she was leading the country toward a no-deal Brexit. 
On Tuesday, her government could face a bid to block an unmanaged exit when a group of lawmakers try to amend budget legislation to deny funding for some no-deal preparations unless they are approved by parliament. 
It is unclear yet whether the amendment has enough support to pass. 
May repeated her objections to holding a fresh public vote on the deal. 
She said a second referendum would be divisive, and also highlighted the lack of time available to hold a new referendum. 

""Practically, actually you couldn't get a referendum in time before the 29th of March - you'd be talking about extending Article 50,"" she said, referring to the two-year exit notice Britain sent to the EU in March 2017.

The arrests came amid fresh demonstrations in Khartoum and Wad Madani in response to a call by a coalition of professional unions to push for Bashir to step down.
Witnesses said security forces blocked professors and lecturers from coming out to protest outside the university, arresting at least eight. It was the first time the faculty of the country's oldest and most prestigious educational institution has joined the protests since they began last month.
The rest were forced to return into the faculty club house, where security forces surrounded the building trapping about 100 professors and lecturers inside for nearly three hours.
""We demand the president of the republic to step down,"" one placard read carried by the lecturers inside the club house, according to pictures posted on social media.
A police spokesman could not immediately be reached to comment. 
Intermittent protests have rocked Sudan since anger over food shortages and rising bread prices erupted into demonstrations in the city of Atbara in the north on Dec. 19.
Security forces have used tear gas on occasions, live ammunition against demonstrators and rounded up more than 2,000 people. The Sudanese government has said that 19 people were killed in the protests, including at two members of the security forces. Amnesty International has put the death toll at 37.
FRESH PROTESTS
In Sunday's protests, witnesses said hundreds of men and women marched from three separate locations in the capital trying to reach the presidential palace in central Khartoum but were dispersed by security forces using tear gas and stun grenades.
A separate protest in Wad Madani, Sudan's second largest city, was also dispersed by security forces using tear gas, according to witnesses.
The protests were smaller than previous demonstrations.
They are the most persistent opposition Bashir has faced since he took power in an Islamist-backed coup nearly 30 years ago. 
Sudan's economy has struggled to recover from the loss of three quarters of its oil output - its main source of foreign currency - since South Sudan seceded in 2011, keeping most of the oilfields.
The United States lifted 20-year-old trade sanctions on Sudan in October 2017. But many investors have continued to shun a country still listed by Washington as a state sponsor of terrorism, whose president is wanted by the International Criminal Court over charges of masterminding genocide in Darfur - charges he dismisses.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Syria’s chief opposition negotiator said on Sunday he was surprised by countries rebuilding ties with the Syrian government and urged them to reverse their decision.
Arab states, including some that once backed rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, are seeking to reconcile with him after decisive gains by his forces in the war, aiming to expand their influence in Syria at the expense of non-Arab Turkey and Iran.
The United Arab Emirates re-opened its embassy in Damascus last month and Bahrain said its embassy there, and the Syrian diplomatic mission in Manama, had been operating “without interruption”.
""We do not have the power to stop this reconciliation,"" Nasr Hariri told reporters in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh, where he is based. 
""We still hope there is a possibility for (these countries) to revisit their decisions and realize that the real and solid relation should be with their brothers of the Syrian people not with the regime that has committed all these crimes,"" he said.
""Bashar al-Assad will remain a war criminal even if thousands of leaders had a handshake with him.""
Kuwait said last week it expected more Arab countries to reopen embassies in Damascus in “coming days”, although the move would need a green light from the Arab League.
Syria’s membership of the Arab League was suspended in 2011 in response to the government’s violent crackdown on “Arab Spring” protests. For Syria to be reinstated, the League must reach a consensus.
""We do not think it would be a sound step to readmit Syria into the Arab League. We think this is a decision that won’t be in the interest of the political process,"" Hariri said. 

U.S-allied Gulf Arab states, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar, were the main regional backers of armed groups opposed to Assad, providing finance or weapons or both, acting largely as part of a program of support for the armed opposition coordinated by Washington.

The detainees ""are suspected of grave terrorist offenses including murder"", the Shin Bet service said in a statement after a court order limiting media coverage of the Dec. 30 arrests was lifted.
Aisha al-Rawbi, 47, suffered a fatal head wound from a rock thrown at her car near the Palestinian city of Nablus on Oct. 12.
The Shin Bet said the five detainees, who it did not name, attend a seminary in Rehelim, a neighboring Jewish settlement. They are all under the age of 18 and have not been formally charged.
Lawyers for the five have said their clients were being held in isolation in a bid by the Shin Bet to force false confessions. The Shin Bet said in its statement the detainees had been questioned in accordance with the law.

BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Mohammed Abdul Ameer's nostalgia for better days and his roots in the Levant were what inspired him to open Basra's first mixed-gender cafe since the rule of Saddam Hussein, and themed in honor of the Lebanese singer Fairouz.
The southern Iraqi city, the home of Abdul Ameer's father, has since Saddam was toppled in a 2003 U.S. invasion seen conflict, unrest, religious conservatism and an acute lack of jobs and services.
Abdul Ameer hopes his customers, mostly young Iraqis, can temporarily forget that and lose themselves in the Arab literature stacked on bookshelves at his cafe while they drink coffee out of cups imprinted with Fairouz's face.
""Fairouz songs are associated with good memories. This place will bring people back to the past, to better days,"" the owner said at his new Fairouz Cafe and Bookshop in central Basra.
""We learned Fairouz's songs during school days so we associate her name with nostalgia."" Mugs picturing Fairouz, whose soothing voice emanates from car radios in Iraqi cities and throughout the Arab world, are also sold at the cafe.
The 29-year-old grew up in his mother's homeland of Syria but fled for Basra in 2012 near the beginning of the Syrian civil war.
The conflict, which began more than seven years ago with protests against President Bashar al-Assad, has killed hundreds of thousands and driven millions from their homes.
""Life in Syria became tough. Snipers and kidnappings became common. I decided to leave and find a new life in Basra,"" said Abdul Ameer.
CONSERVATIVE CITY
The economics graduate's dream project - to open a cafe that emulates the Damascus cafe culture - has come to fruition, and many locals are delighted.
""What I love about this place is the library and the good service. This place is quiet and free from people who try to restrict our freedom,"" said Samana Sajjad, a 23-year-old woman who works as a local radio presenter.
""After a long day, it's a place where you can forget your worries by listening to Fairouz and reading a book.""
Located where the Euphrates and Tigris rivers merge near the Gulf, Basra was for centuries a melting pot of Arabs, Persians, Turks, Indians and Greeks who left their cultural imprint.
After Saddam was toppled, conservative Shi'ite-led parties took power in Basra, bringing with them a religiously restrictive lifestyle.
Young people in Basra took part in protests in September which turned violent, complaining of unemployment, lack of services and corruption.
Basra's oil fields bring in the vast majority of Iraq's oil wealth but the city suffers from power and water shortages like much of the country.

Iraq's population is predominantly Shi'ite Muslim, and much of its society in the south is conservative, with many women wearing the black head-to-toe abaya and public mixed-gender socializing often frowned upon.

The breach has shocked Germany's establishment and risks rocking Merkel's awkward 'grand coalition' again just months after a row over the fate of the domestic intelligence agency chief came close to tearing apart the ruling alliance.
The government said on Friday that personal data and documents from hundreds of German politicians and public figures including Merkel had been published online, in what appeared to be one of Germany's biggest data breaches.
Lars Klingbeil, secretary general of the center-left (SPD), told the Funke media group the government must quickly shed light on ""which agencies knew what exactly when, and how that was dealt with"".
""This should be a priority for (Interior Minister) Horst Seehofer. It's about protecting our democracy,"" Klingbeil added.
Seehofer told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung he only became aware of the breach on Friday morning, but that he would share everything he finds out with the public and intended to do so by the middle of this week at the latest.
The ecologist Greens leader in parliament, Anton Hofreiter, said the president of the BSI cyber defense agency, Arne Schoenbohm, must explain himself urgently in an extraordinary parliamentary committee meeting.
The BSI on Saturday defended its role in responding to the data breach, saying it could not have connected individual cases it was aware of last year until the entire data release became public last week.
Last year, Seehofer was at the center of a political storm over another security agency chief, whose the fate almost tore apart Merkel's coalition of her conservative bloc and the SPD.
Despite SPD resistance, Seehofer rescued Hans-Georg Maassen from dismissal in September when the domestic spy chief questioned the authenticity of videos showing far-right nationalists chasing immigrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz.
But Maassen was subsequently sacked in November over a speech given behind closed doors condemning ""naive and leftist"" government policies.

Against the backdrop of crumbling hotels and homes ringed with barbed wire, a Greek Orthodox priest cast a cross into the sea off the coast of Famagusta, symbolizing a blessing of the waters, and the manifestation of Jesus as the son of God. 
Earlier, a liturgy was held within the walled medieval city of Famagusta.
Varosha, a southern suburb of Famagusta, has been fenced off and abandoned since Turkey invaded northern Cyprus after a Greek-inspired coup in 1974. Religious ceremonies in the north require permission from Turkish Cypriot authorities.
Ringed by a fence which extends into the sea, the former holiday resort has been off limits to anyone but the Turkish military since its 39,000 Greek Cypriot residents fled advancing Turkish troops. 
""This is part of our being and we want to reunify the island,"" said Greek Cypriot Anna Marangou, who is from Varosha.
""We want peace, we want to bring up our kids and grandkids in ways where people are safe...It's a wish for a new year, its a wish we get our act together to do it,"" she said.

With his comments at his address to tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) at the end marking the feast of the Epiphany, Francis jumped into a diplomatic fracas between Italy and Malta.
""I make a heartfelt appeal to European leaders to show concrete solidarity for these people,"" Francis said.
They were ""seeking a safe port where they can disembark,"" he said. 
Thirty-two people are aboard the Sea-Watch 3, a vessel run by a German humanitarian group, which plucked them from an unsafe boat off the coast of Libya on Dec. 22. They include three small children and four teenagers. Another ship run by the German humanitarian group, Sea-Eye, carries 17 people rescued on Dec. 29 on board its ship.
Last week, nearly two dozen humanitarian groups, including Amnesty International and the United Nations' International Organization for Migration, called on the European Union to offer a safe port to both vessels.

Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star Movement, has said Italy would take in women and children if Malta allowed the ships to dock. But Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who leads the anti-immigrant League party and has closed ports to rescue ships, opposes this.

The junta has promised and postponed the election several times since it came to power, with the latest date set for Feb. 24.
However, the vote faces yet another postponement after Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam suggested on Friday that post-election events might clash with rituals related to King Maha Vajiralongkorn's coronation from May 4-6. 
That prompted the first protest since the junta lifted a ban on political activities and a gathering of more than five people in December. 
""We want the government to hold an election as soon as possible, so that democracy can move forward in our country,"" said Anon Nampa, a human rights lawyer and anti-junta activist who organized the protest at the Victory Monument area in central Bangkok. 
Protestors carried signs which read ""We Want Election"" and ""Election only on Feb 24, 2019"", chanting ""No delay!"" in unison. 
Thailand's Election Commission has not officially announced the postponement but said it has acknowledged the government's suggestion that the vote be pushed back. 
The military government also failed to issue an official decree committing to holding a general election by Friday, meaning it is less likely to be held on Feb. 24 under the current timeline laid out. 

The election is meant to restore democracy after a 2014 military coup ousted an elected prime minister, though changes to the constitution in the interim ensure the military will retain a great deal of control.

Britain is due leave the EU on March 29, but Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to get her exit deal approved by parliament, opening up huge uncertainty over whether a deal is possible, or even whether the country will leave at all.
The survey by polling firm YouGov showed that if a referendum were held immediately, 46 percent would vote to remain, 39 percent would vote to leave, and the rest either did not know, would not vote, or refused to answer the question.
When the undecided and those who refused to answer were removed from the sample, the split was 54-46 in favor of remaining. 
That is broadly in line with other polls in recent months which show a deeply divided electorate, in which opinion has swung slightly towards remaining in the EU. The 2016 referendum voted 52 to 48 percent in favor of leaving. 
The poll of more than 25,000 voters was commissioned by the People's Vote campaign, which is spearheading an increasingly vocal push for a second referendum on Brexit. 
May has strongly opposed holding a second referendum. 
But, the survey showed 41 percent thought the final decision should about Brexit be made by a new public vote versus 36 percent who believe it should be up to parliament. Removing those who are undecided, the split was 53 percent in favor of another referendum and 47 percent against.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians worldwide on Sunday presented the head of the Ukrainian church with a decree granting it independence from Moscow, a historic split strongly opposed by Russia.
Ukraine sees the break as vital to its security and independence, but it is bound to aggravate the wider conflict between the two countries.
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who signed the autocephaly decree on Saturday, handed the document to Ukrainian Metropolitan Epifaniy at St George's Cathedral in Istanbul after a mass to mark the feast of Epiphany. 
""Unity has been restored. Now we are united,"" Epifaniy told the congregation, standing with Bartholomew at the front of the crowded church, both wearing ceremonial robes and holding staffs.
The 39-year-old Epifaniy was chosen to head the new church last month.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who also attended the event, compared the development to Ukraine's referendum for independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Russia bitterly opposes the split, comparing it to the Great Schism of 1054 that divided western and eastern Christianity. President Vladimir Putin has warned of possible bloodshed.
""We ask you, mother church and all churches to pray for peace in Ukraine,"" Epifaniy said, adding Ukrainian people had been suffering for five years from a war ""brought from outside"".
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Moscow's seizure of Crimea in 2014. Ukraine imposed martial law in November, citing the threat of a full-scale invasion after Russia captured three of its vessels in the Kerch Strait.
The patriarchate, the seat of the spiritual leader of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide, endorsed Ukraine's request for the new church in October.
""God has heard our prayers,"" Poroshenko said in an address on Ukrainian television after the handover of the decree, or tomos. ""Tomos for Ukraine is actually another act of declaring the country's independence.""
The pro-Western Poroshenko lobbied hard for the church's creation. He faces a tight election race in March and it may give him a boost.
He will take part in a service in Kiev on Monday at the St Sophia Cathedral, now a museum only used for major religious events. The decree will be displayed at the cathedral for the public to view from Monday, the church said.
The Ukrainian Orthodox church has been beholden to Moscow for hundreds of years, and Ukraine's leaders see church independence as vital to tackling Russian meddling.
Kiev says Moscow-backed churches on its soil are a Kremlin tool to spread propaganda and support separatists in the eastern Donbass region in a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people. The churches strongly deny this. 
Religious divisions deepened in Ukraine after 2014 and two Orthodox factions vie for dominance. 
The church known as the Moscow Patriarchate, aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, sees itself as the only legitimate church in Ukraine. On Dec. 20, Ukrainian MPs passed a law that could force the church to add ""Russian"" to its name. 

The rival Kiev Patriarchate was born after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its popularity has grown since 2014. It favors European integration and championed the independent church but the Moscow Patriarchate denounces it as schismatic.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Taliban will not attend planned peace talks with the United States in Saudi Arabia this month, and want to shift the venue to Qatar, Taliban officials said on Sunday, seeking to fend off Riyadh's push to include the Afghan government in talks.
The upcoming negotiations, the fourth in a series aimed at ending the 17-year war in Afghanistan, are scheduled between the leaders of the Taliban and U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to discuss the withdrawal of foreign forces and a possible ceasefire in 2019.
Leaders of the hardline Islamic militant group have rejected the Kabul government's offer for direct talks, despite growing international pressure in favor of the Western-backed Afghan government having a seat at the table.
""We were supposed to meet U.S. officials in Riyadh next week and continue our peace process that remained incomplete in Abu Dhabi last month,"" a senior Taliban member based in Afghanistan told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""The problem is that leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) wanted us to definitely meet the Afghan government delegation, which we cannot afford to do now, and we have canceled the meeting in Saudi Arabia,"" he said.
The Taliban want to change the venue for the talks to Qatar, he said, the political headquarters of the militant group that is fighting to restore strict Islamic law in Afghanistan and the site for earlier talks.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed the group has decided to cancel the meeting in Saudi Arabia, but did not provide information about a new meeting venue.
The United States embassy in Afghanistan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Another senior Taliban leader said the group had explained to Saudi Arabia that it was not possible for the Taliban to meet the Afghan government at this stage.
""Everyone is aware of the fact that the Afghan government wanted the U.S. and its allies not to leave Afghanistan and we have paid a heavy price to expel all foreign forces from our country,"" he said.
""Why should we talk to the Afghan government?""
The Taliban regards the United States as its main adversary in the Afghan war and views direct talks with Washington as a legitimate effort to seek the withdrawal of foreign troops before engaging with the Afghan government.
The war in Afghanistan is America's longest overseas military intervention. It has cost Washington nearly a trillion dollars and killed tens of thousands of people.
Diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have intensified since Taliban representatives began meeting with Khalilzad, an Afghan-born, U.S. diplomat last year. Officials from the warring sides have met at least three times, but fighting has not subsided.

His statements add to criticism by governments around the world that have accused Maduro of undermining democracy and mismanaging the economy. But the largely powerless congress has few concrete means of stopping the inauguration or easing Maduro's grip on power.
""Maduro from January 10 will be usurping the presidency of the Republic,"" said Guaido, a 35-year-old industrial engineer, in his first speech. ""This National Assembly, as the only legitimate power elected by Venezuelans, assumes the representation of the people.""
Venezuela's annual inflation now tops 1 million percent and basic food and medicine are out of the reach of most citizens, spurring an exodus of some 3 million people since 2015, according to the United Nations.
Maduro says the country is the victim of an ""economic war"" by opposition leaders with the help of Washington, which has levied several rounds of sanctions against his government and top officials.
He won a second term in 2018, but the vote was broadly boycotted by the opposition on the grounds that it was rigged in his favor.
The ruling Socialist Party with the help of the country's top court has turned the Congress into a mostly symbolic entity, replacing its day-to-day functions with an all-powerful body called the Constituent Assembly.
Guaido on Saturday vowed ""not to give up"" while demanding justice for dozens of imprisoned or exiled political leaders, including some of his fellow legislators. He blamed the government for creating a ""miserable"" life for Venezuelans.

A group of Latin American countries on Friday called on Maduro not to take office on Jan. 10, but Mexico - which has warmed to Venezuela after the election of a leftist government - urged the group not to meddle in Venezuelan affairs.

The Sunday Telegraph said May's aides were believed to be drawing up a plan to make approval of the deal by members of parliament conditional on the European Union providing further concessions.
The newspaper said the move was intended to help limit the scale of opposition in parliament to her plan while allowing more time for negotiations to continue with EU leaders.
May was forced to postpone in December a key vote on the Brexit plan she has agreed with other EU leaders in the face of deep opposition from within her own Conservative Party and other groups in parliament.
The vote has been rescheduled for the week starting Jan. 14 after a debate which is scheduled to begin in the coming week.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 and May's inability so far to get her deal through parliament has alarmed business leaders and investors who fear that the country is heading for an economically damaging no-deal Brexit.
May renewed her warnings about the possible consequences of parliament not backing her plan, telling the Mail on Sunday newspaper that jobs were at stake and lawmakers would be putting democracy at risk if they did not deliver on the outcome of a the 2016 referendum that backed leaving the EU. 
The Sunday Times said lawmakers, including some from May's Conservatives, would try to thwart a no-deal Brexit by proposing that the finance ministry lose its emergency funding powers if parliament did not agree to Britain leaving the bloc without an agreement.

The device was one of two found inside a bag on a nearby rooftop, three security sources and state media reported.
Two policemen and an onlooker were also injured when the device exploded, the security sources said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Egyptian security forces have for years battled Islamist insurgents who have attacked Coptic Christians, tourists and security personnel. 
Security forces have stepped up their presence outside churches and other places of worship ahead of New Year's Eve and Coptic Christmas, which is celebrated on Jan. 7. 
The Copts, who make up around 10 percent of the population, have long complained of discrimination. Authorities have placed armed guards outside churches and monasteries in an attempt to protect them from jihadist attacks.
In November, militants killed seven people returning from baptizing a child at a Coptic monastery about 260 km (160 miles) up the River Nile from Cairo.

234,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2019 02:06PM ET</span>",Thousands rally in Belgrade against Serbian president,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Thousands marched through Belgrade's frozen city center on Saturday to protest against President Aleksandar Vucic and his ruling Serbian Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (SNS) and demand media freedoms and end to attacks against journalists and opposition figures.
Protesters blew whistles, waved banners that read ""Stop the Treason, Defend the Constitution and Back the People"", and chanted ""Vucic, thief!"" in the fifth such protest in as many weeks.
The protests, which have also been staged in the town of Kragujevac, were triggered by an incident in November in which opposition politician Borko Stefanovic was beaten by unknown assailants in the town of Krusevac.
Backers of the Alliance for Serbia, a grouping of 30 opposition parties and organizations, say Vucic is an autocrat and his party is corrupt, something its leaders vehemently deny.
The demonstrators demanded more coverage of opposition groups by the public broadcaster and assurances of thorough investigations of attacks on journalists and opposition politicians.
Vucic had earlier said he would not bow to opposition demands for electoral reform and increased media freedom ""even if there were 5 million people in the street"", but suggested he was willing to test his party's popularity in a snap vote. 
Opposition groups have said they would boycott any election. 
According to an October poll by the Belgrade-based CESID election watchdog, the SNS alone has 53.3 percent support, far ahead of other parties.
If the opposition parties ran as an alliance, they could count on around 15 percent of the vote, according to the survey. However, there is little sign so far of such an agreement between parties united by little apart from their animosity towards Vucic and his party.
The SNS-led ruling coalition has a comfortable 160 of parliament's 250 seats. The next national vote is due in 2020. 
Major opposition protests have been relatively rare in Serbia since the popular unrest that ousted strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. 
Most of the current opposition leaders served in successive pro-Western coalitions that led Serbia between 2000 and 2012 - when the SNS forged a coalition with Milosevic's Socialists and came to power.

Vucic was a nationalist firebrand during the violent collapse of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, but later embraced pro-European values and set membership of the European Union as Serbia's strategic goal. He also maintains close ties with Russia and China.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Preliminary results from Democratic Republic of Congo's tumultuous presidential election will be delayed past Sunday's deadline, the head of the election commission told Reuters. 
The commission, known as CENI, had received only 47 percent of vote tally sheets as of Saturday, said its president, Corneille Nangaa, and it was not yet clear when the results would be ready.
The delay is the latest setback in a disorganized poll to pick a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who has ruled the country of 80 million people since his father was assassinated in 2001. 
The Dec. 30 vote could mark Congo's first democratic transition of power since independence from Belgium in 1960. But tensions rose after observers reported a litany of irregularities that the opposition says are part of the ruling party's effort to steal the election. 
The opposition, represented by its two main candidates Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi, and the ruling coalition all say their candidates have won. 
""It will not be possible to announce the results tomorrow,"" Nangaa said. 
A CENI spokesman later said that the commission was holding a meeting on Sunday to decide when they will be announced. 
Worried that disputes and delays could spark the kind of violence seen after the 2006 and 2011 elections, the United Nations Security Council met on Friday to discuss how to react, but was unable to reach an agreement, according to an internal report seen by Reuters.
The United States condemned a lack of transparency in the contest, while China, a major investor, lauded the process. 
""Tensions were mounting while the CENI tabulated the results, notably in light of posturing by parties and candidates,"" Leila Zerrougui, head of the UN Stabilization Mission in Democratic Republic of Congo, told the meeting, according to the internal report. 
But the 15 council members ""differed in their appreciation of the problems that beset the process and were divided over the question of whether the Council should issue a press statement"", the report went on to say. 
A negative international reaction could be problematic for Kabila, whose government has defended the election's organization, and could weaken the legitimacy of Kabila's hand-picked successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, should he be declared winner. 
INFLAME THE SITUATION
In the meeting, France pushed for the publication of a statement that recognized that Congo's election had allowed people to exercise their democratic right and called for calm, but criticized the government's decision to cut access to the Internet and some media outlets. 
The United States, which has threatened to impose sanctions against those who undermine the election process and has deployed troops to Gabon in case its citizens need rescuing from any violence, backed the statement, alongside Britain, Ivory Coast, Belgium and others. 
South Africa, long a Kabila ally, said the statement could ""inflame"" the situation if issued before the results, the report said. Russia said it could be seen as an attempt to skew public opinion. China ""lauded the manner in which elections were conducted"", the report said, and said a statement should not be published before the results. 

Congo's Catholic church body, CENCO, said this week that it had identified the victor based on its own tallies collected by 40,000 observers, though it did not name the winner. The declaration was widely seen as a warning to authorities against rigging the vote.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2019 12:59PM ET</span>",Clashes erupt in Paris as 'yellow vests' protest at unrepentant Macron,"By Richard Lough and Elizabeth Pineau
PARIS (Reuters) - Rioters in Paris torched motorbikes and set barricades ablaze on the upmarket Boulevard Saint Germain on Saturday, as protests against high living costs and the perceived indifference of President Emmanuel Macron turned violent on the fringes.
The latest ""yellow vest"" street marches began peacefully in the French capital but degenerated in the afternoon as protesters threw missiles at riot police blocking bridges over the Seine river.
Officers fired tear gas to prevent protesters crossing the river and reaching the National Assembly. One riverboat restaurant was set ablaze and a policeman wounded when he was struck by a bicycle hurled from a street above the riverbank.
Two months after they started blocking roads, occupying highway tollbooths and staging sometimes-violent street protests in Paris, the yellow vests wanted to inject new momentum into a movement that weakened over the holidays.
Macron's government, shaken by the unrest, had this week hardened its stance against the uprising, branding the protesters as agitators seeking to overthrow the government. 
Driving the unrest is anger particularly among low-paid workers over a squeeze on household incomes and a belief that Macron is deaf to citizens' needs as he enacts reforms seen as favoring the wealthy.
""They have no right to leave us in the shit like this,"" said protester Francois Cordier. ""We're fed up with having to pay out the whole time, we've had enough of this slavery, we should be able to live on our salaries.""
Thousands more rallied in cities including Bordeaux and Toulouse in southwest France, Rouen in the north of the country and Marseille in the southeast. 
An estimated 25,000 took to the streets nationwide in what was dubbed Act VIII, BFM TV reported, barely 10 percent of the number in the first weeks of protests but higher than last week. 
""POWER TO THE PEOPLE""
As darkness fell, officers dispersed scores of yellow vests gathered on the Champs Elysees. Television images showed hooded youths setting a car alight on a side street, but there was no repeat of the unrest that erupted in late November, when shops were looted, banks vandalized and the Arc de Triomphe defaced.
Authorities have blamed the worst of the violence in recent weeks on anarchists, anti-capitalists and extreme groups on the fringes of the yellow vest movement.
The protests which come 18 months into Macron's tenure and his drive to reshape the economy have already forced concessions from the 41-year-old president.
Last month, Macron promised tax cuts for pensioners, wage rises for the poorest workers and the scrapping of planned fuel tax increases to quell the unrest at a cost to the Treasury of 10 billion euros ($11 billion).
The measures marked the first big U-turn for a president elected 18 months earlier on a platform to break with traditional French politics and liberalize the heavily-regulated economy.
In a New Year's Eve address, Macron vowed to press on with his reform agenda, saying: ""We can't work less, earn more, cut taxes and increase spending.""
Faced with record low popularity ratings, Macron is expected to pen a letter soon to the nation setting out his plans for coming months. These include a nationwide debate with citizens on ecological, fiscal and institutional questions, the results of which he says will feed into the policy-making process.
""We have to give power back to the people and not a minority that serves its own interests,"" said a second yellow vest protester outside the old stock market building.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Comments from Brazil's new right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro that he would be open to the United States operating a military base on Brazilian soil have not been well received by the country's armed forces, a senior army officer told Reuters on Saturday. 
Bolsonaro, who took office on Jan. 1, said in a television interview on Thursday he might be willing to allow a U.S. base in Brazil as a way to counter Russian influence in Venezuela, a move that would mark a sharp shift in direction for Brazilian foreign policy.
Brazil's military would be against a U.S. base in the country, the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he has not been authorized to discuss the matter publicly. 
He added that the possibility of ceding territory for a base took officers by surprise in the Brazilian military, which has traditionally been a zealous guardian of national sovereignty.
The Ministry of Defense said on Saturday it has not been informed of such a proposal by Bolsonaro, a former Army officer turned politician who has appointed retired generals to his cabinet.
""The president has not discussed this with the defense minister,"" said Major Sylvia Martins, a spokeswoman for the ministry.
Bolsonaro, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, has quickly moved to align Brazil more closely with the Trump administration, which was represented by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at his swearing in on Tuesday.
Pompeo told reporters on Wednesday that the United States and Brazil had ""an opportunity to work alongside each other against authoritarian regimes"" in the region, naming Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua.
Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo confirmed Bolsonaro's willingness to allow a U.S. base in comments to reporters in Lima on Friday during a meeting of the Lima Group of 13 countries monitoring Venezuela's political and economic crisis.
Araújo said Bolsonaro would discuss the base offer with Trump during an expected visit to Washington in March, the Estado de S. Paulo newspaper reported.
The Lima Group of Latin American nations plus Canada said on Friday that last year's elections in Venezuela were not democratic and they would not recognize the legitimacy of leftist President Nicolas Maduro's new term starting Jan. 10.
Bolsonaro said in the television interview that he is worried about Russia's closeness with Maduro, the most significant U.S. foe in Latin America.

A visit to Venezuela by two Russian nuclear-capable strategic bombers in December angered the U.S. government..

MOSCOW/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday the United States had detained a Russian citizen, a day after Moscow arrested the former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan on suspicion of spying.
Whelan was taken into custody by Russia's Federal Security Service on Dec. 28. His family have said he is innocent and that he was in Moscow to attend a wedding.
The ministry said the United States detained Russian citizen Dmitry Makarenko on Dec. 29 on the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean, and had transferred him to Florida.
""... Makarenko, born in 1979, has arrived on Saipan Island with his wife, underage children and elderly parents. He was detained by FBI personnel at the airport right after his arrival,"" the ministry said.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow could not immediately be reached for comment. A State Department spokesman in Washington referred a request for comment to the Department of Justice, which did not immediately respond.
Papers filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of Florida show Makarenko was accused in June 2017 by federal prosecutors of conspiring with another man, Vladimir Nevidomy, to export defense articles including night-vision scopes from the United States to Russia without U.S. approval.
Makarenko, who was listed as a resident of Vladivostok, was declared a fugitive from U.S. justice in Jan. 2018. Nevidomy, a resident of Hallandale Beach, Florida, pleaded guilty in June 2018 and was sentenced to 26 months in prison, the court papers showed. 
The accusations from both sides could further complicate a strained relationship between Moscow and Washington, despite the professed desire of Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to build a personal rapport.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that Washington had asked Moscow to explain Whelan's arrest and would demand his immediate return if it determined his detention is inappropriate.
Britain cautioned Russia on Friday that individuals should not be used as diplomatic pawns. Whelan also holds a British passport.
The Russian ministry said in its statement that Moscow diplomats had not been able to reach Makarenko in Florida and said Washington had yet to explain his detention. 
Before Moscow gave details of Makarenko's detention, experts had speculated that Moscow could exchange Whelan for Russian nationals held by Washington.
Commenting on that possibility, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Saturday:
""I see no reasons to raise this issue in context of exchanges. We should undergo all the procedures needed in this situation,"" Interfax news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying.
Whelan's Toronto-based twin brother David Whelan told Reuters on Saturday that U.S. embassy officials met with his sibling on Wednesday and would visit him again next week.

""He seemed as well as can be expected in a Russian jail. He was missing a lot of personal necessities, like toilet paper, that aren't provided,"" David Whelan said in a telephone interview. ""So the State Department has helped us set up an account ... so that he can buy the supplies that he needs.""

On Friday, assailants destroyed cameras, editing and broadcasting equipment in the Gaza office of the station, part of the Palestinian Broadcast Corporation (PBC), which broadcasts material supportive of Abbas. Station officials immediately blamed Hamas for the attack.
The incident underscored tensions between Abbas's Western-backed Palestinian Authority, based in the occupied West Bank, and Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza.
But Hamas on Saturday said all five suspects men were former employees of the Palestinian Authority, whose salaries were recently suspended. There was no immediate response from the Palestinian Authority.
There has long been antipathy between Hamas, which won the last Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 and is opposed to any peace negotiations with Israel, and with Abbas's more moderate and secular Fatah faction.

The two rivals have tried and failed to end the divisions. Egypt has brokered a Palestinian reconciliation pact that provides for Hamas to cede control of Gaza to Abbas, but a dispute over power-sharing has hindered implementation.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Thousands marched through Budapest's city center on Saturday to protest against a new law that allows employers to ask staff to work up to 400 hours per year of overtime.
Opposition groups have staged several rallies in the past weeks in the Hungarian capital and other cities against what they said was an authoritarian rule of conservative nationalist Viktor Orban.
Saturday's rally, organized by opposition parties, trade unions and civic groups, mainly targeted the new labor law dubbed by critics as ""slave law"".
The protesters marched in snowfall from the historic Heroes Square (NYSE:SQ) to the parliament building on the bank of the Danube river, carrying banners such as ""Sweep away the regime"".
""We disagree with almost everything that is going on since this government got into power (in 2010), from corruption to pseudo-democracy,"" said 50-year old housewife Eva Demeter.
She said more Hungarians were pouring onto the streets because the slave law ""affects a bigger crowd"".
Some of the protesters posted on social media or carried banners calling for a ""national strike"". 
The modification to the labor code passed by parliament last month has faced intense criticism and sparked the biggest street protest in over a year. Potentially, it could add two extra hours to an average work day, or the equivalent of an extra workday per week.
Zoltan Mucsi, the head of steelmaker Dunaferr's Vasas trade union, said it was undemocratic that the government did not discuss the labor code changes with the unions. 
Some of the main trade union groups may resort to a strike if the government does not sit down with them to negotiate, he told Reuters.
Trade union membership in Hungary is estimated at below a tenth of the workforce, about half the level in Germany, according to data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The past weeks' anti-government rallies were also against a law that sets up new courts which critics say could be politically manipulated, and against bias in state-controlled media.
The earlier protests have been mostly peaceful, though there were some clashes with police who used tear gas.
The ruling Fidesz party reiterated in a statement on Thursday that the protests were part of a campaign for the European Parliament elections in May to help those who support mass migration into the European Union.

Fidesz won Hungarian elections with a landslide last year, with the ticket of resisting mass immigration into the EU.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton has warned the Syrian government it should not see the impending U.S. military withdrawal from the country as an invitation to use chemical weapons.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in December that U.S. troops had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State militants and were no longer needed in the country.
The announcement, which took officials in Washington and allies abroad by surprise, contributed to Jim Mattis' decision to resign as U.S. defense secretary and prompted concern that Islamic State could stage a comeback.
""There is absolutely no change in the U.S. position against the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime and absolutely no change in our position that any use of chemical weapons would be met by a very strong response, as we've done twice before,"" Bolton told reporters on his plane shortly before landing in Tel Aviv, Israel. 
""So the regime, the Assad regime, should be under no illusions on that question,"" said Bolton, who is on a four-day trip to Israel and Turkey. 
Trump has twice bombed Syria over the government's alleged use of chemical weapons, in April 2017 and April 2018. In September a senior U.S. official said there was evidence showing chemical weapons were being prepared by Syrian government forces in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold in the country.
More than half a million people have died during the Syrian war and 11 million have been forced to flee their homes.
During his trip Bolton is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. He said he was not suggesting Syria appeared ready to use chemical weapons.
""As we elaborate how the (U.S. troop) withdrawal is going to occur and the circumstances, we don't want the Assad regime to see what we do as representing any diminution in our opposition to the use of weapons of mass destruction,"" he said. 

If chemical weapons were to be used, ""a lot of options would be on the table ... if they don't heed the lessons of those two strikes the next one will be more telling,"" Bolton said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The spiritual head of Orthodox Christians worldwide formally granted independence to the Ukrainian church on Saturday, marking an historic split from Russia which Ukrainian leaders see as vital to the country's security. 
The decree, granting ""autocephaly"", was signed by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew at a service with the head of the Ukrainian church Metropolitan Epifaniy and President Petro Poroshenko in St George's Cathedral in Istanbul.
""I want to thank the millions of Ukrainians around the world who responded to my appeal to pray for the church to be established,"" Poroshenko said at a ceremony accompanied by solemn liturgical singing.
""I want to thank the generations of Ukrainians who dreamed...and finally God sent us the Orthodox Church of Ukraine,"" he told the congregation in the crowded church.
The patriarchate, the seat of the spiritual leader of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide, endorsed Ukraine's request for the new church in October. The decree, or Tomos, will be handed to Epifaniy at a ceremony on Sunday, completing the process of recognition by the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
Ukraine last month chose 39-year-old Epifaniy to head the new church, in a move which Poroshenko compared to Ukraine's referendum for independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
The move incensed Moscow, and prompted President Vladimir Putin to warn of possible bloodshed in his annual news conference. Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Moscow's seizure of Crimea in 2014.
Ukraine imposed martial law in November, citing the threat of a full-scale invasion after Russia captured three of its vessels in the Kerch Strait.
BITTER RUSSIAN OPPOSITION
The Ukrainian Orthodox church has been beholden to Moscow for hundreds of years, and Ukraine's leaders see church independence as vital to tackling Russian meddling.
Kiev says Moscow-backed churches on its soil are a Kremlin tool to spread propaganda and support fighters in the eastern Donbass region in a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people. The churches strongly deny this.
""Tomos - is just a paper, the result of restless political and personal ambitions. It was signed in breach of canonicity and this is why it has no power"", Vladimir Legoida, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church Synodal Department for Church-Society and Media Relations, posted in Telegram messenger.
Epifaniy was chosen by a council at the St Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, built by the son of Prince Volodymyr whose baptism in 988 led to the spread of Christianity in the region.
The new church may boost pro-Western leader Poroshenko, who lobbied hard for its creation and faces a tight election race in March.
Russia bitterly opposes the split, comparing it to the Great Schism of 1054 that divided western and eastern Christianity. Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill made a last ditch appeal against the process last month.
""Huge win for Ukraine, defeat for the Kremlin,"" economist Timothy Ash wrote on Twitter. ""(It) will make Moscow's hope of some future pull of Ukraine back into its 'orbit' nigh on impossible without the use of overwhelming (catastrophic) military force.""
Religious divisions deepened in Ukraine after 2014 and two Orthodox factions vie for dominance. 
The church known as the Moscow Patriarchate, aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, sees itself as the only legitimate church in Ukraine. On Dec. 20, Ukrainian MPs passed a law that could force the church to add ""Russian"" to its name. 

The rival Kiev Patriarchate was born after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its popularity has grown since 2014. It favors European integration and championed the independent church but the Moscow Patriarchate denounces it as schismatic.

India recently approved a bill empowering authorities to seize assets of super-rich fugitives whose economic offences or crimes involve sums over 1 billion rupees ($14.3 million).
The bill is part of a push to prosecute a number of accused who have fled India in the last four years even as the country reels from a series of banking scandals, including a $2 billion fraud at state-run Punjab National Bank that was uncovered in February.
The financial crime fighting agency Enforcement Directorate had sought to declare Mallya a ""fugitive economic offender"" and to confiscate 125 billion rupees worth of his assets. 
On Saturday, Mallya became the first person to be declared fugitive under the new law. His lawyer could not be reached for comment.
India has been trying to extradite Mallya from Britain after the collapse of his defunct  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines. 
It wants to bring fraud charges against the 62-year-old businessman over $1.4 billion in loans Kingfisher took out from Indian banks which the authorities argue he had no intention of repaying.
A London court ruled on Monday that Mallya should be extradited to India adding that there was a prima facie case against the tycoon, who moved to Britain in March 2016.
Mallya, who co-owned the Formula One motor racing team Force India which went into administration in July, has denied any wrongdoing and says the case against him is politically motivated.

The world's most populous country must now draw up policies to try to cope with a declining labor force and a rapidly ageing population, according to the summary of the latest edition of the ""Green Book of Population and Labor"" published by the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
Growth in the working population had now stagnated, the report said, and the rising number of elderly people will have a far-reaching impact on the social and economic development in the country, especially if fertility rates remain low.
""From a theoretical point of view, the long-term population decline, especially when it is accompanied by a continuously ageing population, is bound to cause very unfavorable social and economic consequences,"" it said. 
China's population is expected to fall back to 1.36 billion by the middle of the century, it said, which could mean a decline in the workforce of as much as 200 million. If fertility rates remain unchanged, the population could fall to 1.17 billion by 2065, it said. 
China decided in 2016 to relax a controversial ""one-child policy"" aimed at curbing population growth and allow all couples to have two children. However, the country's birth rate still fell 3.5 percent in 2017 and is expected to have fallen again last year.
China's ""dependency rate"" - or the proportion of non-working people, including children and the elderly, in the total population - rose for the first time in more than 30 years in 2011, and is widely predicted to increase further for at least the next few decades. 
The proportion of retirees is projected to rise until 2060, the CASS report said, and while the decision to relax ""one-child"" rules was designed to rebalance China's age structure, in the short term it will also lead to a greater dependency rate.

According to previous forecasts, China's elderly population is expected to reach 400 million by the end of 2035, up from around 240 million last year.

Tsai's comments came days after Chinese President Xi Jinping said nobody could change the fact that Taiwan was part of China, and that people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should seek ""reunification"".
""We hope that the international community takes it seriously and can voice support and help us,"" Tsai told reporters in Taipei, referring to threats by China to use force to bring Taiwan under its control.
If the international community did not support a democratic country that was under threat, ""we might have to ask which country might be next,?"" Tsai added.
Taiwan is China's most sensitive issue and is claimed by Beijing as its sacred territory. Xi has stepped up pressure on the democratic island since Tsai from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party became president in 2016.
President Xi said on Wednesday that China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control but will strive to achieve peaceful ""reunification"" with the island. 
In response, Tsai has said the island would not accept a ""one country, two systems"" political arrangement with China, while stressing all cross-Strait negotiations needed to be carried out on a government-to-government basis. 
Tsai on Saturday also urged China to have a ""correct understanding"" of what Taiwanese think and said actions such as political bullying were unhelpful in cross-strait relations.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The owner of a Japanese sushi restaurant chain on Saturday set a record by paying more than $3 million for a bluefin tuna in the year's first auction at Tokyo's new fish market, exceeding his own record price of 2013. 
Kiyoshi Kimura, who owns the Sushizanmai chain, paid 333.6 million yen ($3.1 million) for the 278-kg (613-lb) fish caught off the coast of northern Japan's Aomori prefecture, or double what he had paid six years ago. 
""The tuna looks so tasty and very fresh, but I think I did too much,"" Kimura told reporters outside the market later.
""I expected it would be between 30 million and 50 million yen, or 60 million yen at the highest, but it ended up five times more.""
Saturday's event was the first New Year auction of the Toyosu market, after the famed Tsukiji fish market shut last year to provide temporary parking for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics.
Kimura had held the record for top price paid for a single fish at the new year's auction for six straight years until 2017. But last year, the owner of a different fish restaurant chain paid the highest price.
After the auction, the fish was taken to one of Sushizanmai's branches located in the old market of Tsukiji.

    Tuna is prized around the world for its use in sushi, but experts warn growing demand has made it an endangered species.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A former North Korean diplomat who staged a high-profile defection to the South on Saturday urged an old colleague who has gone missing in Italy to defect to Seoul, following a report that he was seeking asylum in the United States. 
Jo Song Gil, the 44-year-old who was until recently North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy, disappeared with his wife after leaving the embassy without notice in early November, South Korean lawmakers said on Thursday.
Jo has sought asylum in the United States and is under the protection of Italian intelligence, Italy's La Repubblica newspaper said on Friday, citing an unidentified diplomatic source. 
The State Department and the U.S. embassy in Seoul did not immediately respond to a query from Reuters.
In an open letter, Thae Yong Ho, Pyongyang's former deputy ambassador to Britain, who said he went to the same university and worked with Jo before defecting to South Korea in 2016, urged Jo to follow in his footsteps.
To defect to the South is an ""obligation, not a choice"" for North Korean diplomats committed to unification, Thae said, calling Seoul ""the outpost"" for that task. 
""If you come to South Korea, the day when our suffering colleagues and North Korean citizens are liberated from the fetters would be moved forward,"" Thae said in the letter released on his website. 
""If you come to Seoul, even more of our colleagues would follow suit, and the unification would be accomplished by itself.""
Thae said his family visited Jo in Rome in 2008, where the latter was studying from 2006 to 2009. He guided them to sites such as St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. 
South Korea could not be ""heaven on earth"" but a place where Jo can realize his wishes, Thae said, highlighting the ardent desire for unification among many of the roughly 32,000 defectors there. 
""The defectors may not be as wealthy as South Koreans,"" Thae added. ""But isn't it the only thing you and I, as North Korean diplomats, should do the rest of our lives - to bring about unification and hand over a unified nation to our children?""
'SAFER PLACE FOR DEFECTION'
If confirmed to have fled, Jo would be another Europe-based diplomat who has sought to leave the impoverished, oppressive North under the rule of Kim Jong Un.
In 2015, a counselor in charge of science affairs at the North's embassy in Germany defected with his wife to an unidentified country, while a secretary-level trade official stationed in Bulgaria and his wife also fled, Thae told South Korean cable news Channel A in an interview this week. 
South Korean officials said they could not comment on intelligence matters. 
Europe could be a safer place for North Korean diplomats than elsewhere due to its openness to receiving asylum seekers, defectors and experts say.
North Korea has formal diplomatic ties with 26 European nations, as well as Britain and Germany, since 2013, Seoul's Unification Ministry says.
Pyongyang requires diplomats going overseas to leave at least one child at home, but those from the top echelons or seen as the most loyal to the regime get some exceptions. 
Jo hailed from a wealthy family of diplomats, and was able to take his child on his posting to Italy in 2015, Thae said. 
""Diplomats in Europe are well-connected and sensitive to political changes at home, which allow them to make a move quickly,"" said Ahn Chan-il, a former North Korean military officer and defector.
Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a North Korea specialist at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, said Europe offered a ""more open, safer environment"" for North Korean officials to discuss sensitive issues and consider defection. 

""Also, Western European countries, such as Italy or the United Kingdom, are very likely to approve the asylum application or support the defection of any North Korean official who asks for it,"" said Pacheco Pardo, who regularly meets North Korean officials and defectors in Europe.

252,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 10:43PM ET</span>",U.S. says no timeline for Syria withdrawal as fighting continues,"By Lesley Wroughton and Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has no timeline to withdraw troops from Syria but does not plan to stay indefinitely, a senior State Department official said on Friday, a strong signal that forces could stay until the fight against Islamic State militants ends.
U.S.-backed forces are still retaking territory from Islamic State in Syria, Pentagon officials said on Friday, two weeks after Washington said it would withdraw its roughly 2,000 troops there. At the time, President Donald Trump said the troops had succeeded in their mission and were no longer needed there.
The administration's abrupt announcement last month, which took officials in Washington and allies by surprise, contributed to Jim Mattis' decision to resign as U.S. defense secretary and prompted concern that Islamic State could stage a comeback. 
The State Department official, briefing reporters before a visit to the Middle East next week by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, appeared to be seeking to allay that concern.
""We have no timeline for our military forces to withdraw from Syria,"" said the official, who asked not to be identified.
""It will be done in such a way that we and our allies and partners maintain pressure on ISIS throughout and we do not open up any vacuums for terrorists.""
The United States did not intend to have an indefinite military presence in Syria, the official added. 
U.S. officials have told Reuters a withdrawal could take several months, potentially giving time for U.S.-backed forces to deal parting blows to the militant group that once held broad swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.
But a senior administration official traveling with White House national security adviser John Bolton on a trip to the Middle East said Trump had received assurances from his military commanders that their mission ""can be done in weeks.""
Trump said on Wednesday the United States would get out of Syria slowly ""over a period of time"" and would protect U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in the country as Washington draws down troops.
""Bolton will travel to Israel and Turkey to discuss the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, and how the U.S. will work with allies and partners to prevent the resurgence of ISIS, stand fast with those who fought with us against ISIS, and counter Iranian malign behavior in the region,"" Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said.
Marquis said Bolton would be joined in Turkey by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford and U.S. special Syria envoy James Jeffrey.
Separately, the State Department said Jeffrey would be taking on the additional role of the special envoy for the coalition to defeat Islamic State. 
Jeffrey will be involved in negotiations on a political process and also assumes the diplomatic role of coordinating with allies and partners on the fight against Islamic State.
Brett McGurk, the previous special envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State, quit last month over Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria.
'FINAL BLOWS'
The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which include Kurdish fighters, captured the Syrian town of Kashmah on Jan. 2 after retaking the town of Hajin on Dec. 25, Pentagon spokesman Navy Commander Sean Robertson told Reuters.
The capture came the same day that Trump stated during a cabinet meeting his strong desire to gradually withdraw from Syria, calling it a place of ""sand and death.""
Trump also said it was up to other countries to fight Islamic State, including Russia and Iran, adding that Islamic State was down to its last remaining bits of territory in Syria.
""We're hitting the hell out of them, the ISIS people,"" Trump said, using an acronym to refer to Islamic State, adding, ""We're down to final blows."" 
Separately on Friday, the U.S.-led coalition said it carried out 469 strikes in Syria between Dec. 16 and Dec. 29 that destroyed nearly 300 fighting positions, more than 150 staging areas, and a number of supply routes, oil lubricant storage facilities and equipment.
Islamic State retains control of just a ""sprinkle of villages"" near the Euphrates river, said Aaron Stein, the Middle East program director at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.
""(ISIS) will simply revert to a diffused rural insurgency where it could use just the tyranny of space - the desert is very big - to sort of hide out and be able to launch raiding attacks,"" he added.
The Pentagon spokesman said coalition forces, which Washington coordinates, were continuing to assist the SDF with close air support and artillery strikes in the Middle Euphrates River Valley.
""We will continue to work with the coalition and regional partners toward an enduring defeat of ISIS,"" Robertson said.
He called the capture of Hajin significant.
""This was a milestone, since it was among the largest of the last remaining ISIS strongholds in the Middle Euphrates River Valley.""Islamic State declared its ""caliphate"" in 2014 after seizing large swathes of Syria and Iraq. The hardline Islamist group established its de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe.

Much of the U.S. campaign in Syria has been waged by warplanes flying out of Qatar and other locations in the Middle East.

China is keen to beef up its armed forces amid territorial disputes in the South China Sea and escalating tension with the United States over issues ranging from trade to the status of Taiwan. 
The official Xinhua news agency said Xi told a meeting of the top military authority that China faced increasing risks and challenges, and the armed forces must work to secure its security and development needs.
Xi, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, said the armed forces must devise strategies for the new era and take on responsibilities for preparing and waging war.
""The world is facing a period of major changes never seen in a century, and China is still in an important period of strategic opportunity for development,"" he was quoted as saying. 
He said the armed forces needed to be able to respond quickly to emergencies, needed to upgrade their joint operations capabilities and nurture new types of combat forces. 
Xi's comments followed his remarks on Wednesday that China still reserved the right to use force to achieve ""reunification"" with Taiwan and prevent the island's independence. 

Xi's Taiwan speech came just days after U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act into law, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the island's security.

254,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 08:47PM ET</span>","Mexican president owns no cars or real estate, but his wife does","By Julia Love
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday he owns no real estate, vehicles or personal property, echoing what experts say is a pattern among the country's politicians of shifting assets to relatives.
Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, told a regular news conference his family's cars and home are in his wife's name.
The veteran leftist won a landslide victory in July after a campaign centered on rooting out corruption in Mexico, which experts say is among the worst in Latin America. Heg cuts an austere figure, ditching the presidential residence, flying coach and driving a white Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Jetta.
Transparency advocates welcome Lopez Obrador's disclosure after battling to get members of his predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto's administration to open up about their finances, said Alexandra Zapata of the Mexican Institution for Competitiveness (IMCO), a think-tank that promotes good governance and fighting corruption.
But his declaration raised as many questions about his wealth as it answered, she added.
""The president, in an effort to send this message of austerity, loses credibility in how he talks about his property, his assets and his interests,"" said Zapata, who is the group's director of education and civic innovation.
Lopez Obrador disclosed monthly net income of 108,744 pesos ($5,600) from his government work and savings worth 446,068 pesos.
In addition to real estate and vehicles, Lopez Obrador's personal possessions and household goods, including works of art and other valuable objects, were disclosed in his wife's name, a spokesman for the president's office said.
Mexican politicians have long been accused of obscuring their wealth by registering assets under relatives' names. Those who absorb the assets are sometimes referred to as ""prestanombres,"" or people who lend their names. 
Lopez Obrador has slashed salaries for public officials, including his own, and stressed on Friday that others in his administration would be required to declare their assets, too. 
The president said during the news conference that his principal asset had been a property in the southern state of Chiapas, which he inherited from his parents and is now registered under his children's names. 
""Money has never interested me,"" he said. ""I fight for ideals, for principles.""
Under a new national anti-corruption system, federal, state and local officials will soon be required to submit detailed disclosures about their income and assets, as well as those of their families.
Lopez Obrador has long cast himself as a man of the people in a poor country.
During the news conference, he said he has no credit card, a common refrain in his speeches. Just 37 percent of Mexicans had an account with a bank or other type of financial institution in 2017, according to a World Bank study of people over 15 years old.
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who backed another candidate in the election, criticized the disclosure.

""Only his grandmother could believe this,"" Fox wrote in a post on Twitter. ""Wake up, Mexico!!!""

LIMA (Reuters) - Mexico's new leftist government on Friday called on its peers to refrain from interfering in Venezuela's internal affairs, declining to back a regional declaration that urged Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro not to take office on Jan. 10.
Mexico was the sole country in the 14-member Lima Group that opted not to sign a statement critical of Maduro, the first time Mexico has not supported a declaration by the group since it was created in 2017 to push for democratic reforms in Venezuela.
Mexico was once among the most outspoken critics of Maduro. But ties with Venezuela have warmed under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who invited Maduro to his inauguration last month.
Maximiliano Reyes, Mexico's deputy foreign minister responsible for Latin America, said following a Lima Group meeting in Peru that Mexico was concerned about the ""situation regarding human rights"" in Venezuela but would not comment on the legitimacy of its government.
Instead, he asked the Lima Group to rethink its approach.
""We call for reflection in the Lima Group about the consequences for Venezuelans of measures that seek to interfere in internal affairs,"" Reyes said in a statement.
In a Friday evening state television broadcast, Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said Maduro would take office on Jan. 10 in a ""legitimate and constitutional"" process, which he said ""does not require the approval of any foreign government."" 
He said Venezuela was ""perplexed"" by the statement and that the country would take reciprocal action for diplomatic steps taken by any other government.
Reyes called for mediation and dialogue from the Lima Group, not isolation.
Mexico's stance was a blow to regional efforts to ramp up pressure on Maduro ahead of his inauguration, which Venezuela's opposition hoped would be a watershed moment to highlight how he has undermined democracy and mismanaged the OPEC member's economy.
Still, Mexico did not appear to be lining up any heavyweight representation for the inauguration. Asked who would attend from Mexico, a foreign ministry spokesman said it would be the Mexican embassy's charge d'affairs.
Diplomatic measures against Venezuela from neighboring countries remain timid, and Friday's communique added little to previous statements that urged Maduro to step down but offered few concrete mechanisms to make this happen.
Peru said last month that it would propose ending diplomatic relations with Venezuela to Lima Group members. But no country has yet announced it would sever ties.
The 13 remaining countries in the Lima Group that signed Friday's statement, which include Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia, called Maduro's new term ""illegitimate"" and urged him to hand power over to the National Assembly until democratic elections can be held.

They also said they would seek to bar high-ranking Venezuelan officials from entering their territory or having access to their financial systems.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Federal police took steps to close a migrant shelter in Mexico's city of Tijuana on Friday, sparking protests from some of the dozens of U.S.-bound people who had been staying there after traveling in a caravan from Central America.
The arrival of several thousand migrants in recent months, many fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, has challenged Mexico's new president to make good on pledges to protect migrants in Mexico, just as the United States makes it increasingly hard for them to cross the border.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who began his presidency last month, has yet to detail how he will improve what he has described as deplorable conditions for people trekking thousands of miles across Mexico to the U.S. border.
Officials in mid-December said that, of the nearly 6,000 migrants who had arrived in Tijuana in recent caravans, about half were at a large shelter in a former concert venue and another several hundred had dispersed to other shelters in the city, such as the one being closed. About 1,000 had crossed into the United States, while another 1,000 returned to their home countries.
Tijuana officials cited sanitary reasons for closing the shelter, a two-story warehouse in a zone known for crime and prostitution near the border. 
The industrial site was overcrowded, poorly lit and lacked proper facilities for food preparation, said Isain Venegas, a supervisor in Mexico's public health system. Common illnesses had been treated, he added. 
Officials told migrants that they could move to the bigger shelter, run by the federal government, about 7 miles (11 km) from the border. 
Many migrants protested, saying they did not expect other sites to be any better. 
""Not one of the shelters in Tijuana has the conditions for them to keep us in ... the authorities are tricking us,"" said Honduran migrant Reinerio Laine. 
By mid-afternoon, several dozen migrants had refused to leave and were joined by U.S. activists, as federal and local police in riot gear took formation at the entrance. 
Others packed belongings and set off on foot to nearby shelters, while several dozen waited for a bus that would bring them to the larger, government-run facility.
""We had hoped that now with President Lopez Obrador he could see the conditions we're in. They said he was going to help, but they've treated us worse than animals,"" said Maria Claros, 28, from Honduras.
""We don't have anywhere to wash or do our business. I bathe with cold water when I have 20 pesos to pay for it,"" she added.
For decades, Tijuana, a notoriously crime-ridden border city, has attracted migrants headed north. When Central Americans began arriving in large numbers in November, officials provided lodging at a sports center, but closed it after rains flooded the venue. 

Last month, two boys from Honduras were killed outside a shelter for migrant youths.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's electoral commission accused the country's Catholic Church on Friday of ""preparing an insurrection"" by saying it knows the winner of last Sunday's presidential election.
The commission is scheduled to release provisional results on Sunday but has said there could be delays because of the slow arrival of tally sheets. 
Donatien Nshole, the secretary-general of the Church's bishops' conference, known as CENCO, said on Thursday its vote tallies showed a clear victor in the Dec. 30 election, a pronouncement widely seen as a warning to authorities against rigging the vote. 
""The announcement of voting trends by Priest Nshole is likely to brainwash the population while preparing an insurrection that CENCO alone will be responsible for,"" commission president Corneille Nangaa wrote in a letter to CENCO president Marcel Utembi, seen by Reuters. 
Nangaa said CENCO's declaration violated electoral law and a code of conduct signed by poll monitors that gives the electoral commission, CENI, alone the authority to announce results.
The Catholic Church is one of Congo's most powerful institutions, representing about 40 percent of its 80 million people.
The ruling coalition of President Joseph Kabila, which is backing his hand-picked successor Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, also took aim at CENCO on Thursday. 
The coalition ""deplores ... the partisan, irresponsible and anarchic attitude of CENCO,"" said Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi, an adviser to Kabila and spokesman for Shadary.
The U.N. Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on the latest developments on Friday at the request of France. French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre said the 15-member body would continue to monitor the electoral process in Congo.
""The consolidation of the results must continue with transparency,"" Delattre told reporters. ""We call on all actors for calm and restraint."" 
Observers and the opposition say the election was marred by serious irregularities. The opposition, represented by its two main candidates Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi, and Shadary's camp have all claimed they are on course to win, without posting specific figures.
Kikaya told Reuters Kabila had met Catholic bishops on Friday but provided no details. 
The government says the election was fair and went smoothly. 
The poll is meant to lead to Congo's first democratic transfer of power, but the international community has raised concerns that a disputed result could cause unrest, as was the case after the 2006 and 2011 elections. 
President Donald Trump said on Friday about 80 U.S. military personnel had deployed to Gabon in case they were needed to protect American citizens and diplomatic facilities in Congo.
On Thursday, the United States called on CENI to publish accurate results and threatened sanctions against anyone who sought to undermine the process.
An election dispute could further destabilize Congo's volatile eastern provinces, where wars around the turn of the century resulted in millions of deaths, most from hunger and disease, and where dozens of militia remain active. 
INTERNET CUT
Kabila's government cut access to the internet as well as Radio France Internationale (RFI) and some local media this week, saying it wanted to prevent fake results from circulating. 
""This being a very sensitive, a very tense period, we are concerned that these efforts to silence dissent could backfire considerably when the results are announced,"" Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters in Geneva. 
    ""We are calling on all sides to refrain from the use of violence,"" she said.
The European Union also called on election authorities to ensure the results reflect the will of the Congolese people. 
Opinion polls had shown Shadary trailing Fayulu and Tshisekedi, who have been buoyed by rising dissatisfaction with Kabila's tenure. 
Kabila, who succeeded his assassinated father in 2001, helped reunify the country amid civil war and has presided over strong economic growth, driven by exports of copper and cobalt, a component of electric car batteries. 

But critics say there has been little improvement in the quality of life for average Congolese and accuse the government of brutally suppressing dissent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A routine U.S.-hosted conference of nations fighting the Islamic State militant group has become a damage control effort following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The previously scheduled conference, tentatively set for Feb. 7 in Washington, aims to gather ministers from many of the 79 nations in the Global Coalition To Defeat Islamic State and galvanize their fight against the militant group. 
However, Trump's shock Dec. 19 decision to withdraw and the mixed signals Washington has sent about when it may pull out the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria have left U.S. allies and partners rethinking their own commitments.
In the latest ambiguous signal, a senior State Department official on Friday first told reporters the United States has no timeline for the withdrawal of troops from Syria and then said it does not plan to stay indefinitely.
Another senior State Department official, also briefing reporters before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's trip to the Middle East next week, said one of his main messages would be that ""the United States is not leaving the Middle East.""
""Despite reports to the contrary and false narratives surrounding the Syria decision, we are not going anywhere.""
However, three sources familiar with the matter said that the Trump administration is still working assiduously to contain the fallout from Trump's troop decision.
A Pentagon adviser described the conference as part of a ""damage control"" effort necessitated by Trump’s abrupt decision and as designed to explain to the coalition members ""that nothing has been put in place"" with regard to the pullout.
""This (Trump's withdrawal announcement) was a slap-dash, individual decision"" that angered and frustrated U.S. military commanders and blind-sided members of the anti-ISIS coalition, said the Pentagon adviser on condition of anonymity. ""This is nothing more than damage limitation.""
Other people familiar with the administration's discussions stressed that the meeting had been previously scheduled, but one said it had been given ""extra urgency"" by the troop decision.
A State Department spokeswoman who declined to be identified confirmed the conference was going ahead as scheduled and that ""save the date"" invitations had gone out but she declined comment on the agenda, saying it was still being worked out.
Another source familiar with administration discussions said the meeting had been made more pressing and more difficult by the mixed signals about the withdrawal, possibly making foreign officials reluctant to attend until there is greater clarity.
""They are trying to square the circle of what the president said and what they (other U.S. officials) want to do, which is not easy,"" said this person, who is familiar with the administration's discussions on the issue.
U.S.-backed forces are still retaking territory from Islamic State in Syria, Pentagon officials said on Friday, two weeks after Trump said the troops had succeeded in their mission and were no longer needed there.
Trump has provided a number of different timelines on the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria. On Dec. 19, he said that the forces would be ""coming back now.""
A few days later, he tweeted that the pullout would be ""slow and highly coordinated."" Earlier this week Trump said the withdrawal would be ""over a period of time.""
While military planners have looked at various timelines, U.S. officials have told Reuters it could take several months to carry out a withdrawal, potentially giving time for U.S.-backed forces to deal parting blows to the militant group that once held broad swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.
One of the proposals under consideration is a 120-day withdrawal period, according a person familiar with discussions.
Two sources familiar with the discussions predicted it would take at least until the end of 2019 to complete a U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria.

""Even if they wanted to, they couldn’t be out in four months,"" said the Pentagon adviser on condition of anonymity.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 04:33PM ET</span>",Britain cautions Russia not to use detained ex-U.S. Marine as pawn,"By Kate Holton and Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber
LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Britain cautioned Russia on Friday that individuals should not be used as diplomatic pawns after a former U.S. Marine who also holds a British passport was detained in Moscow on espionage charges.
Paul Whelan was arrested by Russia's Federal Security Service on Dec. 28. His family have said he is innocent and that he was in Moscow to attend a wedding.
""Individuals should not be used as pawns of diplomatic leverage,"" British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said. 
""We are extremely worried about Paul Whelan. We have offered consular assistance,"" Hunt said. ""The U.S. are leading on this because he is a British and American citizen.""
Official sources familiar with U.S. and British intelligence told Reuters on Friday that they were unaware of any possible connections between Whelan and any U.S. or British agency.
One of the sources said experts at intelligence agencies believe Whelan would have been far more careful if he was a spy, working under official cover as a U.S. diplomat or ""non-official cover"" posing as a civilian.
Since leaving the U.S. military, Whelan had worked as a global security executive with U.S. companies, had visited Russia and developed a network of Russian acquaintances. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week Washington had asked Moscow to explain Whelan's arrest and would demand his immediate return if it determined his detention is inappropriate.
The FSB has opened a criminal case against Whelan but given no details of his alleged activities. In Russia, an espionage conviction carries a prison sentence of 10 to 20 years.
Whelan's detention further complicates a strained relationship between Moscow and Washington, despite the professed desire of Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to build a personal rapport.
U.S. intelligence officials accuse Russia of meddling in U.S. elections - a charge Russia denies. 
Putin has previously stated he would rein in Russian retaliatory measures against U.S. interests in the hope relations would improve, but Whelan's detention indicates the Kremlin's calculations may now have changed.
SWAP SPECULATION
A Russian national, Maria Butina, admitted last month to U.S. prosecutors that she had tried to infiltrate American conservative groups as an agent for Moscow.
David Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief, said it was ""possible, even likely,"" that Russia had detained Whelan to set up an exchange for Butina.
Dmitry Novikov, a first deputy head of the international affairs committee in Russia's lower house of parliament, commenting on a possible swap, said Russian intelligence first needed to finish their investigations. ""Then we'll see,"" Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.
Whelan's British citizenship introduces a new political dimension. Relations between London and Moscow have been toxic since the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury in March last year. 
Britain alleges Skripal was poisoned by Russian intelligence agents posing as tourists, while Russia denies any involvement.
RTE, Ireland's national broadcaster, reported that Whelan also holds an Irish passport, and that the country's Department of Foreign Affairs said the Irish embassy in Moscow had requested consular access to one of its citizens detained in Russia who had requested assistance.
RUSSIAN TIES
Paul Whelan is 48 and lives in Novi, Michigan, according to public records. He is director of global security at BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA), a U.S. auto parts maker based in Michigan.
The company said Whelan was ""responsible for overseeing security at our facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and at other company locations around the world"". Its website lists no facilities in Russia.
U.S. media said he had previously worked in security and investigations for the global staffing firm Kelly Services, which is headquartered in Michigan and has operations in Russia.
""We are relieved and very pleased to know that staff of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow have been given consular access to Paul and confirmed that he is safe,"" his brother, David Whelan, said in an emailed statement on Friday. ""Our focus remains on ensuring that Paul is safe, well treated, has a good lawyer, and is coming home.""
Whelan's military record, provided by the Pentagon, showed that he served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 14 years. The highest rank he attained was staff sergeant. He was discharged in 2008 after being convicted on charges related to larceny, according to his records.
Additional records provided by the Pentagon said Whelan had attempted to steal about $10,410 while in Iraq in 2006.
Whelan has for years maintained an account in VKontakte, a Russian social media network, which showed he had a circle of Russian acquaintances.
Out of the more than 50 people tagged as Whelan's friends on VKontakte, a significant number were software engineers or worked in the IT sector, and a significant proportion had ties to the fields of defense and security.
One of these people served in the Russian navy's Black Sea fleet, a photo of that person posted on his own account indicated. A second friend had on his VKontakte page photos of people in the uniform of Russian paratroop forces.
Whelan used the account to send out congratulations on Russian public holidays. In 2015, he posted the words in Russian: ""In Moscow ..."" and accompanied it with a Russian mobile phone number. The number was not answering this week.
According to his brother David, Whelan was in Moscow to attend the wedding of a fellow retired Marine. When he was detained he was staying with the rest of the wedding party at Moscow's upmarket Metropol hotel, the brother said. He did not specify the wedding location.

An employee at the hotel, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Friday they could not access its database to check, but could not recall any weddings scheduled there in the second half of December.

U.S. Central Command said in a statement that the strike on Jan. 1 in the Marib governorate of Yemen had targeted Jamal al-Badawi, who was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2003 and was wanted for his role in the USS Cole attack. He escaped from prison in Yemen twice, once in 2003 and again in 2006.
There is a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest.

On Oct. 12, 2000, two men in a small boat detonated explosives alongside the Navy guided missile destroyer as it was refueling in Aden, killing 17 sailors, wounding more than three dozen others and blasting a gaping hole in its hull.

262,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 02:15PM ET</span>","Libyan authorities seeking 37 suspects over attacks on oil, military facilities","TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan authorities issued arrest warrants for 37 suspects over attacks on key oil ports in the east of the country and a military base in the south, a source in the attorney general’s office said on Friday.
The source, who asked not to be named, confirmed the authenticity of the arrest warrants, which were dated Jan. 2 and were leaked on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Thursday.
The warrants showed that 31 members of the Chadian and Sudanese opposition based in Libya, along with six Libyan nationals, are wanted for attacks on the oil 'crescent' in the east of the country and on the Tamanhint military base as well as for their participation in fighting between Libyan rivals.
After the toppling of veteran Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011, fighters from neighboring Chad and Sudan joined the ensuing turmoil. Competing Libyan armed factions frequently accuse each other of deploying mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa.
The Libyan suspects include Abdul Hakim Belhadj, a rebel leader who helped to topple Gaddafi in 2011 and is now an Islamist political leader.
Last year Britain apologized to Belhadj and his wife over the role of British intelligence officers in their 2004 rendition from Thailand to Libya. 
Ibrahim Jadhran, who is accused of launching an attack last June on the oil crescent, is also among those sought by the Libyan authorities.
Jadhran's forces controlled the oil crescent for years until it was taken over in 2016 by the Libyan National Army, which is loyal to Commander Khalifa Haftar in eastern Libya. 
The closure of the oil crescent, where key oil ports are located, has led to production losses of up to 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a total national output of little over one million bpd.
Last September, the U.N. Security Council added Jadhran to the list of individuals subject to an assets freeze and a travel ban.
Libya's east-west division, in place since disputed elections and an escalation of fighting in 2014, has split key institutions and produced a deadlock between the rump parliaments and the shifting military factions they are aligned with.

ABOARD SEA-WATCH 3, Mediterranean (Reuters) - After two weeks stranded at sea and battered by winter storms, migrants onboard a rescue ship are growing frustrated, supplies are dwindling and the crew are exhausted as European countries refuse to offer a safe port of call.
The Sea-Watch 3, a vessel run by a German humanitarian group, plucked 32 people from an unsafe boat off the coast of Libya on Dec. 22, including three small children who are suffering from seasickness and four teenagers, who are traveling alone.
The vessel is now in Maltese waters sheltering from high winds and rough seas. In an act of desperation, one migrant jumped into the frigid waters on Friday, trying to swim for shore, but was quickly pulled back on board by the crew.
""We are here on this boat and we do not understand what is happening,"" Bob Kiangala, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, told Reuters. 
""We are not fish, we are not sharks, we are human beings like everyone else. We made this crossing, we risked our lives to get to Europe, and now that we have arrived, Europe refuses, and we do not know why,"" he said.
Another German humanitarian group, Sea-Eye, is also in waters off Malta with 17 people rescued on Dec. 29 on board its ship.
This week almost two dozen humanitarian groups, including Amnesty International and the United Nations' International Organization for Migration, called on the European Union to offer a safe port to both vessels. 
Until June last year, Italy took in almost all of the migrants rescued by humanitarian groups, but since then the new populist coalition government's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who leads the anti-immigrant League party, has closed the ports to rescue ships. 
In a surprising move, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star Movement, said that Italy would take in the women and children if Malta allowed the ships to dock. 
""Malta should allow the immediate disembarkation of women and children and send them to Italy,"" Di Maio wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Friday. ""Children shouldn't pay the price of a Europe that turns its back so it cannot see.""
However, underscoring tensions within the government over migration, Salvini swiftly replied on his own Facebook page that Italy should not take in any more boat migrants.
""Human trafficking must be stopped. People escaping war should come to Italy by plane, as many already do, not by boat. We can send medicines, food and clothes to the boats, but enough of this blackmail,"" he wrote. ""I have not changed my mind."" 
In recent months Spain and Malta have agreed to take in some rescued migrants, but often not before long negotiations with other EU countries. As a consequence, most humanitarian groups have abandoned sea rescue efforts.
Crew members on the Sea-Watch 3 are in good spirits but tired, getting an average of about five hours sleep a night, and the migrants, many of whom endured months of abuse in Libya after making a dangerous desert crossing, are showing signs of stress and mental fatigue, Sea-Watch's head of mission, Philipp Hahn, said.

Sixteen-year-old Achuil Abdallah, who set off alone from his native South Sudan, said he is relieved to have escaped Libya and now is just hoping to reach dry land: ""We all need help.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will appoint a new envoy to Somalia, a U.N. spokesman said on Friday, after failing to convince the country to retract its decision to expel the current representative over accusations of interference.
Since Somalia's foreign ministry declared late on Tuesday that U.N. envoy Nicholas Haysom ""cannot work in this country,"" Guterres has spoken twice with Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters in New York.
""The Secretary-General deeply regrets the decision of the Government of the Federal Republic of Somalia,"" Haq said. ""The Secretary-General has full confidence in Mr. Haysom.""
Haq noted that the doctrine of persona non grata does not apply to United Nations personnel. 
""At the same time the Secretary-General is totally committed to ensuring that the needs of the Somali people are at the forefront of the work of the United Nations in Somalia,"" Haq said. ""Therefore, he intends to appoint in due course a new Special Representative for Somalia.""
The U.N. Security Council is due to discuss the developments behind closed doors later on Friday, diplomats said.
The United Nations is a major backer of Somalia, a country that has lacked strong central government since 1991. The government's decision on Haysom could intensify a confrontation between Mogadishu and the semiautonomous regions.
Haysom had raised questions in a letter on Sunday about the involvement of U.N.-supported Somali security forces in the arrest of a former militant of the Islamist al Shabaab group who was blocked from running in a regional election.
Haysom, a South African, told the Security Council on Thursday that the allegations of interference by the federal government in the regional election and the violence that followed the former militant's arrest ""does not bode well for the upcoming electoral processes in other regions or for the 2020 national elections.""
Somalia's U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman told the Security Council that the Somali people wanted ""Somalia leading international support, not international support leading Somalia.""

""Somalia distinguishes between the institutions that we are part of and individual conduct that's had detrimental effect on our fragile nation,"" he said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - An Argentine bishop working in a top Vatican financial department is under preliminary investigation for alleged sexual abuse, the Vatican said on Friday, in what could become another setback for Pope Francis over sex scandals pervading the Church. 
Gustavo Zanchetta, 54, the former bishop of Oran in northwest Argentina, had been working in the department known as APSA, a general accounting and human resources office that also manages the Vatican’s real estate holdings in Italy.
In a statement responding to recent reports in the Argentine media, Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said there were no allegations of sexual abuse at the time Zanchetta began working at APSA in December 2017, about five months after he left Oran.
""The accusations of sexual abuse surfaced this past autumn,"" Gisotti said, adding that at the time of Zanchetta's resignation as bishop of Oran he had tense relations with priests in the diocese, who had accused him of being authoritarian.
Zanchetta could not be reached for comment on the accusations or the Vatican statement, which said he would ""abstain from work"" in APSA - where the pope had created a new position for him - while a preliminary investigation went ahead.
El Tribuno, a newspaper in Argentina's northern province of Salta, reported on Dec. 28 that three priests made accusations of sexual abuse by Zanchetta to the Vatican's ambassador in the capital Buenos Aires. The allegations included abuse of power and mismanagement of finances, according to the newspaper.
The accusing clergy members said the abuses happened within St. John XXIII seminary, which Zanchetta founded in Oran in 2016, according to El Tribuno. The seminary is now slated to close.
The Vatican said the current bishop of Oran had gathered testimony which would be sent to the Holy See's department that oversees bishops, and if the allegations were deemed credible, Zanchetta would go before a special tribunal.
News of the investigation could not have come at a worse time for Pope Francis, a fellow Argentine.
He has summoned heads of some 110 national Catholic bishops’ conferences and dozens of experts and leaders of religious orders to the Vatican on Feb. 21-24 for an extraordinary gathering dedicated to the global crisis of clergy sexual abuse.
On Thursday, as American bishops were gathered in a retreat to reflect on the crisis in their country, Francis sent them a tough-worded letter saying internal bickering had shredded the Church’s credibility in the United States. 
The U.S. Church is still reeling from a grand jury report last year that found that 301 priests in the state of Pennsylvania had sexually abused minors over a 70-year period.

After nightfall on Dec. 31, armed men on motorbikes descended on the village of Yirgou, made up largely of people of Mossi ethnicity, and killed seven people, the government said. 
The following day, Yirgou residents killed 39 people in Fulani herding communities across the region in retaliation. 
The government earlier this week told Reuters that only 13 people had been killed.
To the north of Burkina Faso, in Mali, ethnic clashes are being fueled by the presence of Islamist militants as Fulani communities are accused of hiding jihadists.
Burkina Faso has seen a spike in Islamist attacks in recent months as jihadists seek to increase their influence across the Sahel. On Dec. 31, the Burkinabe government declared a state of emergency in several northern provinces bordering Mali, though these did not include the region around Yirgou.

DHAKA (Reuters) - The United Nations on Friday called for an independent and impartial investigation into the Dec. 30 election in Bangladesh in which Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won a third straight term amid accusations of violence and voting irregularities. 
Hasina's ruling alliance won more than 90 percent of the seats contested in Sunday's election, which was marred by accusations of ballot stuffing, voter intimidation and violence that killed at least 19 people. 
Opponents rejected the election result but Hasina and her Awami League have denied any impropriety, saying that the vote was peaceful and there was enthusiastic participation from her supporters.
""We urge the authorities to carry out prompt, independent, impartial and effective investigations into all alleged acts of violence and human rights violations related to the elections, with a view to holding accountable those responsible, regardless of their political affiliations,"" the United Nations said.
On Thursday, newly elected members of parliament, including Hasina, were sworn in, but the seven opposition members stayed away, saying the results were rigged and calling for a new election.
""There are worrying indications that reprisals have continued to take place, notably against the political opposition, including physical attacks and ill-treatment, arbitrary arrests, harassment, disappearances and filing of criminal cases,"" the United Nations said.
""Reports suggest that violent attacks and intimidation, including against minorities, have been disproportionately carried out by ruling party activists, at times with complicity or involvement of law enforcement officers.""
The United Nations called on the authorities to take urgent measures to prevent further reprisals, and to ensure that law enforcement authorities exercised their powers in accordance with the rule of law.
It also urged the national Human Rights Commission to play an independent and proactive role.
Western governments, including the United States and the European Union, have condemned the election-day violence and called for an investigation into a range of irregularities. 
On Thursday, New York-based Human Rights Watch said the run-up to the vote was characterized by ""violence and intimidation against the opposition ... and the misuse of laws to limit free speech"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. court on Friday ruled in favor of a Trump administration policy barring certain transgender people from serving in the U.S. armed forces, handing the president his first legal victory on the issue after several defeats.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned a decision by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that blocked the policy, saying it likely violates the constitutional rights of transgender recruits and service members.
President Donald Trump announced in March that he would endorse a plan by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to restrict the military service of transgender people who experience a condition called gender dysphoria.
The appeals court victory is limited because other federal courts issued injunctions against the policy, which applied nationwide. The administration already has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue. 
The high court is due to consider whether to hear three separate government appeals at its private conference on Jan. 11.
The various injunctions allowed transgender troops to join the ranks as of Jan. 1, 2018.
""Today’s ruling is a devastating slap in the face to transgender service members who have proved their fitness to serve and their dedication to this country,” said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, one of the groups challenging the policy.
The three-judge panel said in an unsigned opinion that District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly was wrong to conclude that the new restrictions were essentially the same as the original ban, which she had also blocked.
""It was clear error to say there was no significant change,"" the judges wrote in the ruling. 
The new plan, for example, ""appears to permit some transgender individuals to serve in the military consistent with established military mental health, physical health, and sex-based standards,"" the court said.
The American Psychiatric Association defines gender dysphoria as a “clinically significant distress” due to a conflict between a person’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. Not all transgender people suffer from gender dysphoria, according to the association, which opposes a military ban.
The gender dysphoria restriction replaced an outright ban on transgender service members that Trump announced in July 2017 on Twitter.

Trump's move reversed Democratic former President Barack Obama’s policy of allowing transgender troops to serve openly and receive medical care to transition genders.

(Reuters) - An attempt to embarrass newly elected U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a nine-year-old video showing her dancing while in college backfired when it drew a wave of support for the liberal lawmaker on social media.
The widely-shared video shows the 29-year-old Democrat, the youngest woman ever elected to the U.S. Congress, dancing on a roof with other students at Boston University as they recreate dance scenes from famous 1980's films like ""The Breakfast Club.""
The caption under the original Twitter post, which was reported to be uploaded by the now deactivated account @AnonymousQ1776, read: ""Here is America's favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is...."".
Ocasio-Cortez graduated from the university in 2011 with degrees in international relations and economics.
A representative of the New York lawmaker, who rose to prominence last year after beating a 10-term incumbent in a Democratic primary, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Ocasio-Cortez was part of a wave of Democratic women congressional candidates elected in November aiming to put more support behind the liberal progressive wing of the party.
Twitter comments broke down along partisan lines, with opponents describing the dance video as showing immaturity while supporters saw it as cute.
""Hey @AOC, just wanted to say that I thought the high school video of you dancing was awesome,"" wrote Twitter user David Weissman, a New York-born columnist now living in Israel on Thursday, referring to Ocasio-Cortez by her Twitter handle. ""It also shows your haters are desperate and pathetic, keep being you.""
The original posting meant to demean Ocasio-Cortez incorrectly said she was in high school at the time the video was recorded.
""The video of @AOC dancing is so well done. And she's all joy in it. I can't believe they thought that was going to be some scandal,"" wrote DeRay McKesson (NYSE:MCK), a U.S. civil rights activist who was a leader of the Black Lives Matter wave of protests against police violence that swept U.S. cities including Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore in 2014 and 2015.

""Whoever rules in Gaza must afford protection to everyone here,"" Qidra told Reuters.
The station broadcasts material supportive of Abbas's Western-backed Authority, whose power base lies in the West Bank. Station officials immediately blamed Hamas for the attack.
""Hamas is deeply involved in this conspiracy,"" said Ahmed Assaf, chairman of the Palestininan Broadcast Corporation (PBC), speaking to the channel in the West Bank city of Ramallah. 
The PBC issued a statement saying the attack was a ""clear reflection of the mentality of the Hamas movement and criminal gangs who believe only in their voice, and who seek to suppress freedoms"". 
Neither Assaf nor the PBC offered any evidence for their accusations, and Hamas officials swiftly condemned the incident.
""What happened is rejected, and we condemn it,"" Eyad Al-Bozom said in a statement issued by the Hamas-run Interior Ministry in Gaza. He urged the station's officials to cooperate with investigators.
There has long been antipathy between Hamas, which won the last Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 and is opposed to any peace negotiations with Israel, and with Abbas's more moderate and secular Fatah faction. 
The two rivals have failed to end the divisions since 2007. Egypt has brokered a Palestinian reconciliation pact that provides for Hamas to cede control of Gaza to Abbas, but a dispute over power-sharing has hindered implementation of the deal. 

The TV station was able to continue broadcasting from Gaza later in the day. The attack was widely condemned by other Palestinian political factions and by journalists.

In his first cabinet meeting of the year, Macron told ministers they should be more radical in their attempt to reform the country and law and order must be restored, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said.
The sometimes violent protests over the cost of living have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major cities and forced Macron to make concessions, including scrapping a planned fuel tax rise.
Since then attendance at the protests has dwindled - some tallies put the turnout on Dec. 29 at 12,000, below the 40,000 the previous Saturday - but many demonstrators have said they will carry on.
""Since these announcements, the yellow vest movement, for those who continue to protest, has become the thing of agitators who promote insurrection to topple the government,"" Griveaux told reporters.
""We must take the desire of the French for change to its fullest because it is this desire which brought us to power,"" he said. ""Maybe we have made too many concessions to conservatism, we'll have to change that.""
Since Macron swept to power in May 2017 promising to transform France and do away with a political class he blamed for the country's malaise, he has seen his popularity slide to a record low as discontent with his style and policies grew. 
Facing the sternest challenge of his 20-month tenure, Macron has vowed to press on with other reform pledges, such as stricter rules for unemployment benefit and overhauling the civil service.
One of the faces of the leaderless yellow vest movement, Eric Drouet, was detained on Wednesday for organizing an undeclared protest, before being released on Thursday. Macron's critics have called the tougher response a mistake likely to inflame the situation. 
The protests have squeezed many businesses, including retailers and hotels that closed their doors or suffered cancellations in early December at the height of the violence. 

French services activity retreated at the fastest pace in more than four years last month, a survey showed on Friday.

If such a deal could be agreed, it would piece back together the two biggest chunks of a country splintered by eight years of war and leave one corner of the northwest in the hands of anti-Assad rebels backed by Turkey.
The talks with Russia and new overtures towards Damascus underline a recalibration of Kurdish strategy since President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw U.S. forces whose presence has stabilized the Kurdish-led region.
Their immediate priority is to find a way to shield the region from Turkey, which views the Kurdish YPG militia as a national security threat.
Turkey has already sent its army into Syria twice to roll back the YPG. But it has held off attacking the large Kurdish-controlled area of the northeast where U.S. forces operate.
Trump, who has not set out a withdrawal timetable, said on Wednesday the United States would leave slowly ""over a period of time"". He also said the United States wanted to protect Kurds, who have been vital to the U.S. campaign against Islamic State.
Jia Kurd welcomed the idea of a slow withdrawal but said the United States had not discussed the pullout with its Syrian allies who were caught off guard by Trump's announcement.
To fill the expected vacuum, they want Russia to help secure a Syrian army deployment at the northern border. This is part of a wider effort to strike a deal with Damascus they hope will also safeguard their regional autonomy. 
Jia Kurd said Russia had agreed to mediate.
""The final decision is (to reach an) agreement with Damascus, we will work in this direction regardless of the cost, even if the Americans object,"" Jia Kurd said in the northern Syrian city of Qamishli.
""Our view is that (Russia) is trying to open new horizons with Damascus, this is what we sensed from them.""
BALL IN RUSSIA'S COURT
Damascus and the YPG have mostly avoided confrontation during the war. At times, they have even fought common foes.
They convened political talks last year in Damascus, but these broke down without progress. Jia Kurd said the need for Damascus to enter serious dialogue was now more pressing.
The main aims of the road-map are to protect the border from Turkey, to find a way to integrate the governing structures of northern Syria into the constitution, and to ensure a fair distribution of resources in northern and eastern Syria.
""The ball is in the court of Russia and Damascus,"" Jia Kurd said. ""On this basis we can negotiate and start a dialogue."" 
One of the biggest challenges will be reconciling the regional autonomy demands with Assad's goal of exercising authority over the whole country again. The Syrian foreign minister recently said a federal Syria was unacceptable.
Jia Kurd said ""conservative"" elements in Damascus wanted to ignore political changes and to ""impose their control and influence"" through the kind of agreements forced on areas where anti-Assad rebels had been defeated.
""This is rejected by us,"" he said.
The Kurds' bargaining chips include control of dams on the Euphrates River, oil fields and other resources. Jia Kurd said these would be one main element of the dialogue.
Analysts however say their bargaining position has been weakened by Trump's announcement, which heightened Kurdish fears of a Turkish offensive.
Turkey views the YPG militia as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waved a 34-year insurgency in Turkey.
Analysts believe Assad and the YPG could eventually work together against Turkey-backed rebels in northwestern Syria.
Jia Kurd said ending the Turkish occupation and defeating the remaining insurgents there required an agreement between Damascus and the Kurdish-led administration:

""This will give a big push towards ending the occupation and terrorism in Syria.""

The gathering was quickly dispersed after security forces fired teargas at the crowd. 
The protest was significantly smaller than other demonstrations seen in Sudan in recent weeks, triggered by price increases and shortages of cash and fuel following months of deteriorating economic conditions.
Organizers have urged protesters to march toward the presidential palace in Khartoum on Sunday, when larger numbers are expected to take to the streets. 
Friday's protesters, mainly young men, chanted ""peaceful, peaceful"" and ""step down, step down,"" as they called for a change in government. 
Many protesters during the past two weeks have called for an end to the rule of President Omar al-Bashir.
The protests represent the most persistent opposition Bashir has faced since he took power in an Islamist-backed coup nearly 30 years ago. The demonstrations are more widespread and sustained than bouts of unrest in September 2013 and January 2018.
Security forces have fired live ammunition as well as tear gas and stun grenades at protesters, witnesses say. They have also detained some protesters and opposition figures.
Officials have acknowledged 19 deaths in the demonstrations. Amnesty International said last week it had credible reports that 37 protesters had been killed by bullets fired by security forces. 
Bashir and the head of Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Service have called for restraint in the response to the protests, which officials have blamed on infiltrators.

Colombia has long accused Venezuela's socialist government of turning a blind eye to the presence of groups such as the National Liberation Army (NLA) in areas close to the two countries' border. 
Former commanders of the rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which demobilized in 2017, were believed to have stayed in Venezuela in a bid to avoid capture.
Colombia sent a note to the government of President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday, the foreign ministry said in a statement, to request Venezuela ""verify the presence and continuity in its territory of some members of the ELN.""
If ELN members Eliecer Herlinto Chamorro Acosta, known as Antonio Garcia, Gustavo Anibal Giraldo Quinchia, known as Pablito, and Rafael Sierra Granados, known as Ramiro Vargas, are in Venezuela, Colombia asks that it carry out red notices against them, the statement added. Interpol notices list people wanted for extradition.
The ELN said in a statement on Friday it had successfully completed a 12-day ceasefire during the festive period.
Maduro will be sworn in for a new term next week, after being re-elected in a May election considered a sham by the opposition.

The containers, including hazardous chemicals, fell off one of the world's largest container ships, the MSC Zoe, during a North Sea storm on Wednesday.
A statement from MSC on Friday said that the company was ""directly taking over more of the clean-up"" and was working with several salvage companies.
An MSC spokesman had no immediate comment on the letter sent by Dutch officials, but the statement said it had deployed boats to locate and tow drifting containers, plus sonar-tracing vessels for underwater recovery. 
""MSC is not giving a detailed account of the cargo on board to the general public at this time,"" it said, adding that ""caution should be applied in particular for any containers or drums which are labeled as having hazardous content"".
Tineke Schokker, the mayor of Vlieland, one of the Wadden Islands, said she had sent a ""sharply worded"" letter to the company. Debris continued to wash up on Friday, she said, posing a threat to flora and fauna.
""They need to remove this as quickly as possible because the longer it's here the more damage it does,"" she said in an interview. ""We have decided to collectively pass on the costs to the shipping company.""
It was not clear if there would be lasting environmental damage to the area, a vast expanse of tidal flats and wetlands known for its rich biological diversity.
Roughly 100 soldiers were assisting the clean-up operation, in which local authorities and volunteers have already gathered hundreds of thousands of tonnes of waste.
It was also unclear how many of the containers had sunk and how many were still floating and could pose a hazard to marine traffic or fishing boats.
Among the lost cargo were 25 kg (55lb) bags of peroxide, a strong bleaching agent that can cause injury on contact with skin, some of which had washed ashore.
At least three of the containers were thought to contain hazardous chemicals, the Dutch coastguard has said.

German authorities are leading the investigation into what caused the accident in German waters near the island of Borkum.

The state security court's ruling against Mansoor, who prior to his imprisonment had been one of a tiny number of publicly active rights campaigners in the UAE, was confirmed by the state news agency WAM.
""We are concerned that Mansoor’s conviction and harsh sentencing relate to his exercise of the right to freedom of expression and opinion,"" U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva.
""We urge the government of the UAE to promptly and unconditionally release Mansoor and to ensure that individuals are not penalized for expressing views critical of the government or its allies,"" she said.
The ruling, upholding the May 2018 conviction, which is not subject to appeal, was accompanied by a fine of 1 million dirham ($270,000).
A trade and tourism hub, the UAE is an absolute monarchy which tolerates little public criticism.
""This is certainly not a one-off case in the UAE,"" Shamdasani said.
Prominent critic Nasser bin Ghaith was sentenced in March 2017 to 10 years in prison for tweeting about human rights violations in Egypt and criticizing the politicization of the judiciary in the UAE, she said.
Mansoor, a 49-year-old electrical engineer and poet, was among five activists convicted of insulting the UAE's rulers in 2011. They were pardoned the same year.
He was arrested again in March 2017 on charges of publishing false information and rumors, promoting a sectarian and hate-incited agenda, and using social media to ""harm national unity and social harmony and damage the country's reputation"".
In 2015 Mansoor received the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, an annual prize awarded in Geneva by a panel of international human rights organizations, for his work documenting the human rights situation in the UAE.

Public sector salaries account for more than 90 percent of Zimbabwe's $4 billion national budget -- a situation seen as unsustainable by foreign lenders like the International Monetary Fund, with which Zimbabwe would eventually like to secure an economic reform program.
In a statement, the Public Service Commission said it would cut 3,365 youth officers from the Ministry of Youth, Sports, Arts and Recreation on Friday, in line with a plan announced in November's budget.
""The Youth officers will be paid their cash in lieu of accrued days leave and cash in lieu of notice,"" it said.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa is under pressure to repair an economy shattered during nearly four decades of rule by Robert Mugabe, who had blocked efforts to cut public salaries before being removed in an army coup in late 2017.
However Mnangagwa's administration is grappling with a crippling dollar shortage and growing budget deficit, as well as tarnished investor confidence in a country once known as Africa's breadbasket.
In October, Zimbabwe's cabinet approved an economic recovery program taking aim at the wage bill.
Cutting unnecessary spending will be key to helping the country clear more than $2 billion in arrears to creditors -- a precondition to IMF support.

MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Taliban fighters are threatening major oil wells near the northern Afghan city of Sar-e Pul following days of fighting in which dozens of members of the security forces have been killed and wounded, officials and residents said on Friday.
""The security situation in Sar-e Pul province is alarming,"" said Zabiullah Amani, the provincial governor’s spokesman.
""We have had promises that reinforcements would be sent to the city but nothing has been done yet,"" he said.
About 40 members of the security forces were killed or wounded near Sar-e Pul on Tuesday during hours of fighting that underlined the heavy pressure Afghan government forces are facing even as moves towards peace have intensified.
""The Taliban have been launching major attacks for some time with the aim of securing these oil fields and we’ve set up a special protection force but they don’t have advanced equipment,"" Amani said.
The wells in the Angot field, about 11 km east of Sar-e Pul city and Kashkari, 12 km to the south, were developed during the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. 
Amani said eight wells were active, with millions of dollars' worth of military equipment, including armored vehicles stored close by.
""These wells are economically important, not just for the province of Sar-e Pul but for the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said.
The capture of the wells would deliver a blow to the government and bolster Taliban finances, adding to revenues from taxation, mining and opium.
An aide to interior minister Amrullah Saleh said additional forces had been sent to the oil fields from neighboring districts and a team from Kabul would be sent in coming days.
""As of now, the area is secure but we cannot deny the threat warning,"" he said, adding that companies operating the wells had been alerted.
The fighting comes as another round of talks is expected between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives to try to work out the basis for peace talks to end the 17-year Afghan war.
With U.S. intentions unclear following reports that President Donald Trump is preparing to withdraw almost half of the estimated 14,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan, pressure on Afghan forces has been mounting.
Hekmat Haidari, a resident of Sar-e Pul city, said the situation in the province had been deteriorating sharply over recent days as the Taliban have stepped up operations.
""The oil wells in this province are a major source of income for Afghanistan and specially for Sar-e Pul province and the Taliban are trying to capture these wells or to destroy them,"" he said.

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday continued to set out priorities for his new administration, stressing his desire for the quick passage of a bill to protect security officials and measures to open up competition in the banking sector.
The far-right president, elected on a law-and-order platform, warned in a tweet that sky-high violence would only slow if laws were passed to provide police and soldiers freedom from prosecution when on active duty.
""The legislative, executive and judicial powers have to make this commitment urgently,"" he tweeted.
Throughout the campaign, Bolsonaro said he wanted to give police and soldiers peace of mind while on often-violent operations, and he has also advocated broadening access to guns so people can defend themselves. 
Critics argue those ideas only risk inflaming Brazil's violent streets and worsening Brazil's murder tally, nearly 64,000 people in 2017, a record. 
Since his inauguration on Tuesday, Bolsonaro has used executive orders to open up Brazil's economy, crack down on violent drug gangs and redraw the country's foreign policy while pushing conservative social measures. 
The fast pace continued on Friday, with current central bank Governor Ilan Goldfajn telling newspaper Valor Economico that Bolsonaro is likely to confer power on the central bank to approve the entrance of new foreign lenders into Brazil.
The move could foster competition in a highly concentrated banking system, in which the five largest banks hold 85 percent of total assets. Currently, foreign banks need a presidential decree to operate in Brazil.
Separately, newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported Bolsonaro is considering a higher tax on personal loans as a way to fund development projects in Brazil's poor north and northeast.
A presidential decree is likely to be issued in the coming days, the paper reported. This measure may displease Brazilian bankers as they have been lobbying for lower taxation as a way to reduce interest rates for consumers.
In a TV interview on Thursday, Bolsonaro said he would be open to the possibility of the United States operating a military base in Brazil, a sharp shift in foreign policy.
Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former Army captain and admirer of Brazil's military dictatorship of 1964 to 1985 and U.S. President Donald Trump, has quickly deepened ties with the Unites States and Israel.

On the domestic front, Onyx Lorenzoni, Bolsonaro's chief of staff, said after a cabinet meeting on Thursday that the new administration was committed to a pension overhaul, and that a privatization program was under evaluation.

285,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 07:57AM ET</span>","Spain's Socialists lead in opinion poll, but no majority: CIS survey","MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's ruling Socialists would win most votes if an election were held today but would not have a majority, while the far-right Vox would see its support rise slightly, an opinion poll showed on Friday. 
The official poll by the Centre for Sociological Studies (CIS) showed that it would likely be hard for any party, or group of parties, to pull together a coalition that would have a majority of seats.
Spanish politics, dominated since dictator Francisco Franco's death in 1975 by the Socialists and the conservative People's Party (PP), have become increasingly fragmented over the past years.
The CIS poll forecast that Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez' Socialists would win 28.9 percent of the vote, more than any other party but its worst score since taking power in June.
A parliamentary election is not scheduled before 2020, but the Socialists hold fewer than a quarter of the seats and speculation has been rife over the possibility that an early election could be held this year. 
Vox would get 3.7 percent of the vote according to the CIS poll, up from 2.5 percent in its survey carried out in November and up from 1.3 percent in October. 
That is still well below the 13 percent of votes forecast for Vox by Sigma Dos pollsters in a survey published by El Mundo earlier this week, a sign of how hard it is for pollsters to estimate the far-right party's popularity. 
The anti-immigration Vox unexpectedly won 12 seats in a regional election in Andalusia in December, becoming a kingmaker there.
Vox has been dominating headlines, telling the PP and center-right Ciudadanos, who depend on its votes to rule the region, that it would only back them if they agreed to policy changes, including on laws protecting women against sexist violence, which it says discriminate against men.
The CIS poll sees PP getting 19.1 percent of the vote in an election, unchanged from last month's poll, while Ciudadanos would drop slightly to 17.9 percent and the far-left Podemos would get 14.9 percent. The rest of the votes would be spread among smaller parties. 

CIS describes itself as an independent administrative body. Its surveys are considered in Spain as official opinion polls.

It was not immediately clear how the woman, a Sri Lankan national, got into the temple. 
When the first two women to breach the ban entered the temple in the early hours of Wednesday, they arrived in an ambulance with a plainclothes police escort and went in through a side gate without any devotees noticing.
Conservative Hindu groups paralyzed Kerala on Thursday, shutting businesses and halting transport with a protest strike against the left-wing Kerala state government, which has supported the right of women to enter the temple.
    The protests against Kerala's communist coalition, led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, were backed by both of the main national parties - Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress party.
The Sabarimala temple, which pays homage to the celibate God Ayyappan, is one of a few in India that bar entry to women and girls between the ages of 10 and 50 years old, saying that menstruating women are impure.
Women's rights groups say the ban is discriminatory.
Media reported that the latest woman, whom they identified as Sasikala, has had her uterus removed, which would mean she cannot menstruate. She entered the temple at about 10.55 p.m. on Thursday, media reported.
The chief minister's office said she went to the temple with her husband and she was offered police protection. 
The Supreme Court in September ordered the lifting of the ban on women and girls entering the hill temple, which draws millions of worshippers a year.
But the temple has refused to abide by the ruling and subsequent attempts by women to visit had been blocked by thousands of devotees. It says that the ban is necessary because menstruating women are impure.
On Friday, Kerala had largely returned to normal after the previous day's strike but small protests were reported from across the state. 
Fewer than 100 members of the youth wing of the Congress party marched and shouted slogans against the chief minister in the city of Kochi.
Discrimination against menstruating women is common in some parts of South Asia, where they are forbidden from entering houses or temples and taking part in festivals and community events.
Religion is often a contentious in India and political parties at times try to use the issue to their advantage. India is due to hold a general election by May.

(This story corrects paragraph 13 to clarify protest took place in Kochi, not state capital.)

No one was injured in the explosion outside the AfD office in the city of Doebeln late on Thursday. The blast set the office on fire and damaged vehicles and nearby buildings, Saxony's LKA criminal investigation office said in a statement.
The LKA said its anti-terrorism unit had determined that the explosion was an escalation in politically motivated attacks targeting AfD offices in Saxony that are usually limited to acts of vandalism.
""The attack against the AfD office in Doebeln is special given that the explosion was intended to harm people,"" the LKA said.
Saxony was the site of far-right riots and demonstrations sparked by the stabbing to death of a Cuban-German man in the city of Chemnitz in August, initially blamed on two migrants from Iraq and Syria.
The riots, which featured skinheads performing the Hitler salute and chasing migrants in the streets of Chemnitz, highlighted the depth of a rift created by Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome almost one million asylum seekers, mainly Muslims from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Saxony has a large far-right scene. But it is also home to many supporters of the hard-left Die Linke, which is the second-largest party in the regional assembly.

Police said the three men it detained were aged 29, 32 and 50. The LKA's anti-terrorism unit is still investigating the incident.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May's bid to push her Brexit plans through parliament was dealt another blow on Friday when a survey showed most of her own party's members oppose the agreement and would prefer to leave the EU without a deal.
If lawmakers do not approve the deal, the world's fifth largest economy is on course to leave the European Union on March 29 without one, a nightmare scenario for many big businesses who fear disruption to trade.
May needs 318 votes to get the deal she struck with Brussels in November through parliament, yet 117 of her Conservative Party's 317 lawmakers voted against her in a confidence vote on Dec. 12. 
That means that, unless she gains the support of some of the 257 lawmakers in the opposition Labour Party - which has said it will not back the deal - she will need to win over swathes of her own party.
Friday's YouGov survey offered a snapshot of the challenge she faces.
Of 1,215 of the Conservative Party's rank-and-file members questioned by the pollster, 59 percent opposed May's deal and 76 percent said warnings over the risks of disruption in the event of a no-deal were ""exaggerated or invented"". 
The British economy is showing clear signs of slowing with house prices taking a hit, services companies reporting crisis-like pessimism and lending to British consumers grew at its slowest pace in nearly four years.
The pound, which sank to its lowest since April 2017 on Thursday, rose against the dollar to $1.2670.
Just 38 percent of those polled by YouGov said they supported May's deal.
""Grassroots Tories (Conservatives) are even less impressed than Tory Members of Parliament (MPs),"" said Tim Bale, Professor of Politics at Queen Mary University of London, who helps run a study of British political party membership which commissioned the survey.
NO DEAL BREXIT?
Facing defeat in parliament last month, May postponed a vote on the deal and pledged to seek further legal and political assurances from the other 27 members of the EU, which has signaled it could try to allay rebel's fears but will not reopen negotiations. 
The parliamentary vote is now due to take place the week of Jan. 14 and if May's bid to push her deal fails, the United Kingdom will either leave without a deal or have to delay Brexit.
Pro-Europeans fear Britain's exit will weaken the West as it grapples with Donald Trump's unpredictable U.S. presidency and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. It weakens Europe's economy and removes one of its only two nuclear powers.
Brexit supporters say while there may be some short-term disruption, in the long-term the UK will thrive outside what they cast as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending.
May is seeking assurances from the EU over the Irish 'backstop', an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between the British province and EU-member Ireland, which remains the main obstacle to securing the backing of parliament.
The DUP, the Northern Irish party that props up May's government, said on Friday that it would not support her Brexit deal but that businesses should be relaxed about leaving the EU without an agreement.
With the future path of Brexit still uncertain two and a half years after the 2016 referendum, the British economy was slowing.
Growth slowed to a crawl at the end of 2018, according to a IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), showing optimism among services companies has sunk to levels typical of the global financial crisis.
British house prices took a pre-Brexit hit in December, falling by the most month on month since mid-2012 and rising by their slowest pace in nearly six years in annual terms, according to data from mortgage lender Nationwide.

Iran sees the presence of U.S. aircraft carriers in the Gulf as a security concern and its navy has sought to counter that by showing the flag near American waters.
A flotilla will leave for the Atlantic early in the Iranian new year, starting from March, Iran's naval deputy commander said.
""The Atlantic Ocean is far and the operation of the Iranian naval flotilla might take five months,"" Rear-Admiral Touraj Hassani was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.
He said Sahand, a newly-built destroyer, would be one of the warships. Sahand has a flight deck for helicopters and Iran says it is equipped with anti-aircraft and anti-ship guns, surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles and has electronic warfare capabilities.
Hassani said in December that Iran would soon send two to three vessels on a mission to Venezuela.
A senior Iranian military official said last month that the navy could sail in the Atlantic near U.S. waters since U.S. aircraft carriers were allowed to move around in international waters near Iran.
Iran's navy has extended its reach in recent years, launching vessels in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden to protect Iranian ships from Somali pirates.
""By their continuous presence in international waters, Iranian naval forces aim to implement the orders of commander-in-chief of the armed forces (Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei), wave the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran, thwart the Iranophobia plots, and secure shipping routes,"" Hassani said.
A U.S.-Iranian war of words has escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump took Washington out of a world powers’ nuclear deal with Iran in May, and reimposed sanctions on its banking and energy sectors.
Iran has warned that if it cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressures, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf. A third of the world's sea-borne oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz.
In recent years, there have been periodic confrontations between the Revolutionary Guards and U.S. military in the Gulf, but the number of incidents has dropped in recent months.

GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - Indian rescuers trying to reach a group of miners trapped in a remote and illegal ""rat-hole"" coal mine are struggling to pump out water from the 370-foot-deep pit, further dimming their chances of survival more than three weeks into their ordeal.
The slow progress in the rescue efforts in the northeastern state of Meghalaya has been contrasted with the dramatic rescue of 12 Thai boys and their football coach from a flooded cave in July last year, which drew a massive international audience.
The mine became flooded after at least 15 miners went down the narrow pit on Dec. 13. Rat-hole mines killed thousands of workers in Meghalaya before India's environmental court banned the practice in early 2014.
Many mines continued operation, despite the ban, requiring workers, often children, to descend hundreds of feet on bamboo ladders and dig coal out of narrow, horizontal seams.
""We are continuously engaged in our efforts but the terrain and conditions out here are extremely difficult,"" Santosh Kumar Singh, an assistant commandant with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), told Reuters from the site.
Navy divers and NDRF personnel had not been able to reach the trapped miners, he said.
Rescuers are now placing their hopes on a huge pump from state miner Coal India Ltd that is being installed on a concrete platform near the mine.
India's Supreme Court on Friday ordered the federal government and Meghalaya to file a report by Monday on the rescue operation. Meghalaya told the court on Thursday that nearly 86 people had been working on the rescue effort.
At its peak, the state produced coal worth $4 billion a year, or about a tenth of India's total production. 
While the Thailand drama got round-the-clock international media coverage, the trapped miners in Meghalaya are getting very little attention, even within India.

""Whole media, government and us, the common people, have completely ignored them,"" one Twitter user, Rahul Sribastab, wrote. ""The government, opposition and media have failed us.""

""At least"" eight of those 13 had since been released, the Canadian government said in a statement, without disclosing what charges if any have been laid.
Prior to Thursday's statement, detention of only three Canadian citizens had been publicly disclosed. Diplomatic tension between Canada and China has intensified since Meng's arrest on Dec. 1. 
The Canadian government has said several times it sees no explicit link between the arrest of Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, and the detentions of Canadian citizens.
But Beijing-based Western diplomats and former Canadian diplomats have said they believe the detentions were a ""tit-for-tat"" reprisal by China.
Meng was released on a C$10 million ($7.4 million) bail on Dec. 11 and is living in one of her two multi-million-dollar Vancouver homes as she fights extradition to the United States. The 46-year-old executive must wear an ankle monitor and stay at home from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.
The 13 Canadians detained include Michael Kovrig, Michael Spavor and Sarah McIver, a Canadian government official who declined to be identified, said on Thursday.
McIver, a teacher, has since been released and returned to Canada. Kovrig and Spavor remain in custody. Canadian consular officials saw them once each in mid-December.
Overall, there are about 200 Canadians who have been detained in China for a variety of alleged infractions who continue to face on-going legal proceedings. ""This number has remained relatively stable,"" the official said. 
In comparison, there are almost 900 Canadians in a similar situation in the United States, the official added.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang did not provide details about the other detained Canadians at a news briefing in Beijing on Friday, but said that China was ruled by law and it protected the legal rights of foreigners.
The Chinese government has not drawn a direct link between the detention of any Canadian and Meng's arrest. It has demanded that Canada free Meng and threatened unspecified consequences if it does not.

YANGON (Reuters) - Buddhist Rakhine fighters killed seven Myanmar security forces in attacks on four police posts in Myanmar's troubled Rakhine state on Friday as the country marked Independence Day, spokesmen for the military and the armed group said. 
The western state has been torn by violence once again since early December, when fighting intensified between government forces and the Arakan Army, which wants more autonomy for the Buddhist Rakhine ethnic minority.
Rakhine was where a brutal military-led crackdown in 2017 drove hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims into bordering Bangladesh. 
The recent fighting with the Arakan Army had forced 2,500 civilians to flee their homes by the end of last year, according to the United Nations.
Arakan Army spokesman Khine Thu Kha told Reuters the group attacked four police posts and later retrieved the corpses of seven ""enemies"". 
The group also detained 12 Myanmar security force members, he said. ""We will process them according to international law. We will not harm them,"" he said.
The attacks were a response to a Myanmar military offensive against the Arakan Army in recent weeks that had also targeted civilians, he said.
The Myanmar military last month announced a four-month halt in fighting in the north and northeast of the country to kick-start peace talks with multiple armed groups fighting for ethnic autonomy, but that announcement excluded Rakhine.
Myanmar state media earlier reported an attack by the same group on Tuesday that seriously injured one policemen.
Myanmar military spokesman Zaw Min Tun told Reuters security forces were responding to Friday's attacks, which targeted police posts in the northern parts of Buthidaung and Maungdaw townships, a rugged area near the border with Bangladesh.
""The military will continue its operations in the area for security,"" he said, declining to confirm how many people were killed and captured by the armed group. 
""These police posts are there to protect the national races in the area so shouldn't attack them,"" Zaw Min Tun said, referring to mostly Buddhist ethnic groups in the area that are recognized as Myanmar citizens. Those groups include the Rakhine but not the Rohingya.
Zaw Min Tun said the attacks began minutes after the national flag was raised across Myanmar to mark 71 years since independence from Britain.
The Arakan Army's Khine Thu Kha said the attacks were not intended to coincide with the anniversary.
""We are not independent yet. Today is not our Independence Day,"" he said, referring to the Rakhine who he said faced discrimination in Myanmar.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's first tropical storm in three decades killed one person on Friday as it arrived on the south coast, knocking down trees and blowing off roofs in its path, but was losing speed, officials said, while warning against the risk of flash floods. 
Accompanying winds churned up high waves and gusts in the Gulf of Thailand as tropical storm Pabuk made landfall in the Pak Phanang district of Nakhon Si Thammarat province, where trees crashed down on houses to cause widespread damage. 
Disaster mitigation officials said the person killed was among the crew of a fishing boat that capsized in strong winds near the coast of nearby Pattani province. Another of the crew was missing, but four others were safe. 
Weather officials warned of torrential downpours and strong winds in 15 provinces in the Thai south, home to one of the world's largest natural rubber plantations and several islands thronged by tourists. 
But by Friday afternoon, the storm was slowing, and was heading for the province of Surat Thani, the Thai Meteorological Department said in a statement. 
""It is expected to downgrade to be a tropical depression,"" it added. ""People should beware of the severe conditions that cause forest runoffs and flash floods."" 
The conditions are expected to persist into Saturday. With airports and ferry services shut, people were advised to stay indoors until the storm passed. 
The National Disaster Warning Center also sounded alarms around tourist beach destinations, such as Koh Samui and Koh Phangan, urging people to leave high-risk areas for higher ground. 
During the past few days, 6,176 people have been evacuated to shelters from Nakhon Si Thammarat as well as the provinces of Pattani, Songkhla and Yala, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation has said. 
The Nakhon Si Thammarat airport said it had closed, and low-cost Nok Airlines Pcl said it had canceled all eight flights to and from the province. 
The Surat Thani airport will also close from Friday afternoon to Saturday, cancelling flights by Nok Airlines, Lion Air, and Thai Smile, a subsidiary of national carrier Thai Airways. 
Earlier, Bangkok Airways Pcl said it had canceled all flights to and from the holiday destination of Koh Samui, where ferry services have also been suspended. 

National energy company PTT Exploration and Production Pcl said it had suspended operations at Bongkot and Erawan, two of the country's biggest gas fields in the Gulf of Thailand.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian man rammed his four-wheel drive into a Sydney police car, hijacked a supermarket delivery truck and taxi, rammed other cars and stabbed and wounded a passerby before killing himself in front of police on Friday.
The dramatic chain of events, which police said was not terror-related, began when police tried to pull over the four-wheel drive for not displaying license plates.
The driver rammed the police car, dumped the four-wheel drive and hijacked a supermarket delivery truck about 7 km away, then continued across town for another 20 km to a suburb near the airport, hitting several cars along the way.
The driver, 24, tried to steal another car, stabbing a passerby who tried to stop him, before stealing a taxi. Police finally stopped the attacker in the taxi and tried to Taser him, but the man stabbed himself in the chest and died at the scene.
""The offender wasn't trying to intentionally harm people,"" Acting Assistant Commissioner Mick Fitzgerald told reporters in Sydney.
""It was a man who was attempting to do everything he could to avoid arrest. His actions, in particular the actions when he stabbed the innocent person, (are) the actions of a person 
who we believe had mental health problems.""
Police did not identify the attacker or give further details. Fitzgerald said the man was known to police and did not have a significant criminal history.
Footage circulated on social media showed a man in a beige shirt and cap gesturing for a taxi driver to get out of his car, then getting in and driving the red taxi away.
The Australian Associated Press quoted a tradesman who witnessed the first stabbing, Chris Burton, as saying the attacker looked ""crazy and frazzled"".
""He goes to the guy, 'stab me, stab me, stab me' and stuck his neck out,"" AAP quoted the witness as saying.
The passerby who was stabbed was in a serious but stable condition in hospital, police said. Media reported that a woman was also stabbed in the melee but police did not confirm a second stabbing.
A staunch U.S. ally, Australia has been on alert for militant attacks after a Sydney cafe siege in 2014 and its intelligence agencies have stepped up scrutiny.
In November, a man set fire to a pickup truck laden with gas cylinders in Melbourne and stabbed three people, killing one, before being shot by police. Police described that rampage as an act of terrorism.

""In fact we're more alarmed about what is coming out from the EU and especially the Irish government,"" the Democratic Unionist Party's Sammy Wilson said when asked if he was reassured by signals from Brussels.
May still hopes to get her deal through parliament, though even members of her own cabinet admit privately that to do so she will need to make significant changes and win over lots of opposition lawmakers.
If the lower house of the British parliament does not approve May's deal then the world's fifth-largest economy will leave the EU without one on March 29 at 2300 GMT as the date is set in law - the 2018 Withdrawal Act.
The Northern Irish DUP, whose 10 lawmakers have propped up May's minority government, has demanded she ditch the Irish backstop, something the EU and May have ruled out.
The DUP's Wilson told BBC radio that the Irish backstop was a ""con trick"" and added that farmers and businesses should be totally relaxed about a no-deal Brexit.
""If anyone should be worried about the tariffs on beef and sheep then it should be the Irish because of course, we, the United Kingdom are net importers of food,"" Wilson said.
Facing the defeat of her deal last month, May postponed a parliamentary vote on it, pledging to seek ""legal and political assurances"" from the EU. 
Those efforts appear so far to be in vain. The EU said it will not reopen the negotiation though it signaled it might offer some concessions.
May needs 318 votes to get a deal through parliament yet 117 of her 317 lawmakers voted against her in a confidence vote on Dec. 12. 

So she will need the support of some of the Labour Party's 257 lawmakers or to win over swathes of her own party and the DUP.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's ruling and opposition parties condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's comments this week mocking New Delhi's role in war-torn Afghanistan, where the South Asian country has invested billion of dollars in economic projects and military training.
The United States and India have drawn closer in recent years as they seek ways to counter-balance China's spreading influence across Asia.
But Trump's apparent bid to undermine India's developmental work in Afghanistan has annoyed not just politicians but also many ordinary Indians.
Trump said on Wednesday he got along very well with Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi but that Modi was ""constantly telling me he built a library in Afghanistan"".
""You know what that is? That's like five hours of what we spend,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""And we are supposed to say, 'oh, thank you for the library'. I don't know who is using it in Afghanistan.""
It was not immediately clear which library Trump was referring to, but both Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main opposition Congress were united in their criticism of the U.S. president.
India has centuries-old ties with Afghanistan and both accuse common neighbor Pakistan of not doing enough to stop Islamist militants operating on their territory. Pakistan denies the charges.
""May be Trump should know that while he is decrying every other help in Afghanistan, India has been building not only libraries, but roads, dams, schools and even parliament building,"" Ram Madhav, a BJP general secretary, said on Twitter.
""We are building lives, for which the Afghan people thank us, no matter what others do or don’t.""
Congress said India did not ""need sermons from the U.S on Afghanistan"". 
The United States has 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, with reports it may be set to withdraw more than 5,000, a sign Trump's patience is thinning with America's longest war. Trump has already decided to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria.
Modi's office did not respond to an email seeking comment. Reuters could not reach the White House outside regular business hours in the United States.
India is the biggest South Asian donor to Afghanistan, spending around $2 billion on reconstruction and rehabilitation, according to the Indian embassy in Kabul. Over the past few years India has helped Afghanistan build roads, erect power transmission lines and construct a parliament building.
Kabul has not yet responded to Trump's comments.
Afghanistan’s national security advisor, Hamdullah Mohib, is meeting his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval and other officials in New Delhi on Friday.

""Trump mocked India, a key U.S. non-NATO partner that's done major development work in Afghanistan, for building a library there,"" Michael Kugelman, South Asia senior associate at the Washington-based Wilson Center think-tank, said on Twitter. ""Sigh.""

The Southeast Asian nation sends students to Taiwan under a work-study program that allows them to do internships while studying. Officials said students under this scheme had ""faced problems"", without providing details.
""We have asked for an explanation...and for authorities to take steps needed to protect the interests and safety of these students,"" Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir said in a statement. 
Taiwan's education ministry said in a statement on Thursday the media reports were not accurate and that it found no violations of local labor laws after speaking to the students. If any illegal practice was found in any school, the ministry would suspend the programs there, it added.
A Taiwanese lawmaker, Ko Chih-en, said last week that six universities had been ""forcing"" their Southeast Asian students, especially Indonesians, to work long hours in factories making contact lenses, according to Taiwan News website. 
Reuters was not able to independently verify the accusation. 
There are around 6,000 Indonesian university students in Taiwan, around 1,000 of whom were sent under the work-study scheme, Nasir said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday he intends to push forward towards a World War Two peace treaty with Russia, which has been stymied for decades by a territorial row, during a summit in Russia later this month. 
Abe, who has signalled he is keen to clinch a deal, will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in their 25th summit for discussions aimed at ending the disagreement over a group of windswept islands seized by Soviet troops in the final days of the war.
""I'll visit Russia later this month and intend to push forward with discussions towards a peace treaty,"" he told a news conference in the western city of Ise.
There had been ""absolutely no progress"" on the issue for more than 70 years, he said.
Abe said that, while there were no guarantees of an agreement, the two nations had been cooperating over issues concerning the islands, as well as economically, over the past two years ""as never before"".
Putin caught Abe off guard in September when, on stage with the Japanese leader at a conference in Vladivostok, he suggested signing a peace treaty by year-end ""without any pre-conditions"".
Abe later rejected the proposal, repeating Japan's stance that the question of sovereignty must be settled first.
He told reporters after the two met again in Singapore in November they had agreed to speed up negotiations based on a 1956 joint statement in which Moscow agreed to transfer the two smaller islands to Japan after a peace treaty was concluded.
""We both do not want this to drag out into another generation,"" Abe said on Friday.
Putin may be open to a deal now, expecting that better ties will act as a counter-balance to China and attract more Japanese investment and technology, some experts say.

Others doubt Putin really wants any agreement, partly because a majority of the Russian public is opposed to returning any of the islands, known in Japan as the Northern Territories and in Russia as the Southern (NYSE:SO) Kurils.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court will name a panel on Thursday to hear arguments over a controversial plan to build a Hindu temple on the ruins of a 16th-century mosque.
A Hindu mob tore down the mosque in 1992, triggering communal riots that killed about 2,000 people across India. The site, in the northern town of Ayodhya, has been the focus of dispute between majority Hindus and minority Muslims for many years.
Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, who fixed the date for setting up the panel, did not give details. 
Building the temple is a key demand of the conservative Hindu allies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has gained fresh impetus ahead of a general election due by May.
Both Hindu and Muslim communities have petitioned the Supreme Court, which has taken control of the site, to resolve the dispute.
The allies of the BJP, including the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, its parent, have asked the government to introduce legislation to allow the temple to be built, bypassing any Supreme Court ruling.
Hindu groups believe the site to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of the religion's most revered deities. 
Asked about the issue, Modi told Reuters partner ANI on Tuesday that the judicial process should take its course.
A day later, Alok Kumar, an official of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, or the World Hindu Council, responded that Hindus were getting impatient because the case had been pending for a long time.

Over the past three decades, the group has spearheaded a campaign to build the temple. In the past few months, it has organised rallies of tens of thousands of activists, monks and other supporters, in support.

China's animal husbandry and veterinary affairs bureau is stepping up investigation and punishment of illegal activity in the pig industry, said a statement published on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website on Friday.
Failing to report deaths and privately slaughtering and selling sick or dead pigs would be pursued under criminal law, it said, and compensation of 1,200 yuan ($175) for each pig culled was sufficient incentive for farmers to report the disease.
In the worst epidemic of the disease ever seen, China has confirmed about 100 cases of African swine fever across 23 provinces since August last year. The disease, for which there is neither cure nor vaccine, is deadly to pigs but does not harm people.
But many experts believe it is even worse than has been reported, and Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen urged Beijing last month to ""not conceal"" information about the disease.
Tsai raised the issue again in a New Year's speech after a dead pig was found on a beach on Taiwan's Kinmen island, a half-hour ferry ride from the east coast of China. The pig has since been confirmed to have the African swine fever virus, while another dead pig was found on a nearby island on Friday, Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported.
""During our recent efforts to prevent an African swine fever epidemic, China's government has never followed the relevant agreements and provided Taiwan with accurate, real-time reports about the epidemic situation,"" she said.
China has repeatedly said that the disease has been effectively dealt with and is under control. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not immediately respond to a fax seeking comment on Friday.
The dead animals found on the Taiwanese islands have stoked fears that Taiwan's pigs could soon become infected with the disease. 
Taiwan's herd of 5.39 million pigs is tiny compared with China's 700 million, but pork is the most popular meat in both places and domestic production in Taiwan reduces its need for imports of the staple meat.

Moreno said there were massive cost overruns, operational failings and non-transparent bidding processes at the five projects built during Rafael Correa's presidency, including a $2.2 billion upgrade to the Esmeraldas refinery. 
""Nearly $5 billion of Ecuadoreans' money, when it should have cost half that,"" Moreno said in a national broadcast. ""This theft of public funds cannot go unpunished.""
Moreno took office in May 2017 after earning Correa's endorsement during the campaign, but the two later fell out over Moreno's market-friendly policies.
Last year, Moreno asked a United Nations unit to conduct a technical and economic review of the five projects undertaken by the previous administration.
Correa has denied allegations of corruption in his administration, calling them a political smear campaign. He lives in Belgium and has not returned to Ecuador since a judge last year ordered that he be jailed as part of a case involving the kidnapping of a lawmaker, in which he denies involvement.

The other projects Moreno mentioned included a natural gas liquefaction plant, a seaport, a fuel distribution center, a pipeline and a partly-built refinery that has run out of financing after receiving some $1.5 billion in investment.

SEOUL (Reuters) - In just over a decade, South Korea has spent the equivalent of a small European economy trying to fix its demographic crisis, yet birthrates have dropped to the lowest in the world.
This year, President Moon Jae-In, who describes himself as a feminist president, is testing a new angle: showing women more respect.
At the end of last year, South Korea announced plans to remove some of the disincentives for employing women, allowing both parents to take parental leave at the same time and extending paid paternal leave. Employers also get incentives to allow either parent to work fewer hours.
""Efforts on gender equality are very timely,"" said Shin Eun-kyung, an economist with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. South Korea is the worst place for women to work in the OECD, despite women being among the organization's best educated, and more highly so than men.
But the measures go beyond the workplace: mothers can choose to give the baby their own last name and a tickbox on birth certificates showing whether a baby was born outside marriage will be removed. 
Fertility treatments will be offered to single women and unmarried couples as well. Social campaigns will encourage men to participate more in child care and household chores.
Contrast that with a 2016 effort by the previous government, run by the country's first woman president, Park Geun-hye, which launched a website carrying a real-time statistical heatmap of women of child-bearing age, marriages and births in the hope of spurring competition between cities and regions. 
The website was taken down after one day, with women complaining it made them feel like ""reproductive organs"".
""The country sees women as baby factories,"" says Hong Sook-young, who produces the country's most popular children TV show. Asked about the latest measures, Hong said ""at least pretending to hear what people really want is a start toward change"". 
(Graphic: South Korea birth rates versus the world - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RfZDEo)
TEMPLE BONDING
South Korea's demographic time bomb is ticking louder. The government's latest forecast sees its population declining from 2027, and a presidential committee said the country's economic growth potential could fall to below 1 percent.
Birth rates have long been a policy priority: since 2006, the government has spent 152.9 trillion won ($135.65 billion) - about the size of an economy like Hungary or Nevada - on perks for families and subsidies for children from birth through university and beyond. Last year's 26.3 trillion low birth policy budget was more than half the defense spending of a country technically still at war with its northern neighbor. 
But demographic experts say money is not the main issue: the experience of advanced countries with higher birth rates, such as France or Sweden, shows gender equality plays a crucial role. 
The previous allocation of resources drew criticism as well.
The government went far beyond child allowances and subsidizing care and education. For instance, it funded temple stays for family bonding and financed youth seeking brief jobs abroad. 
Many such programs will end, with the 2019 birth-support budget cut by a quarter, to 20.5 trillion won.
""It should have been cut a long time ago,"" said Jung Jae-hoon, social welfare professor at Seoul Women's University.
Jung cautioned, however, the signal the government was finally sending will take a long time to filter through the conservative east Asian society.
Births outside marriage, for instance, are so widely frowned upon that they amount to only 1.9 percent of the total, the lowest anywhere. Experts compare that to France, where the ratio is over 50 percent and the birth rate is 1.9 versus South Korea's 1.05. Abortion is illegal and adoption rules very strict. 
The stigma of out-of-wedlock babies has seen Seoul's Jusarang Community Church build an oven-sized ""baby box"", with cushions and a heating system into its outside wall. 
Last year, 261 children were abandoned across the country, according to Statistics Korea.
JOBS FOR MEN
About 56 percent of women aged 15-64 work in South Korea, below the OECD average of almost 60 percent, and 72-75 percent in Denmark and Sweden, where birth rates are among the highest of advanced economies.
Recruiters say married young women are less likely to get job opportunities due to discrimination. 
In November, the Supreme Court upheld a four-year jail sentence against a former CEO of state-run Korea Gas Safety Corp over manipulating interview scores to knock women out of the hiring process. 
While Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) has a more balanced gender ratio than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  globally, with women accounting for 45 percent of the staff versus a third at its U.S. rival, only one in four staff at its Korea headquarters are women. None of the nine board members at  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) are women, versus six out of 12 at General Motors (N:GM).
""The whole period of before, during and after childbirth weighs on our career,"" said a female assistant manager at Hyundai Motor. The pay gap between sexes only makes it harder, she added.
South Korea's gender wage gap is highest among advanced countries at 34.6 percent, above OECD average of 13.8 percent. 
A Hyundai Motor spokeswoman said the firm was committed to providing equal opportunities to all employees and opposes discrimination. A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman said the company has been recruiting more females, including in managerial positions, and that most staff return to work after parental leave and its daycare centers can look after 3,000 children.
WEAK ECONOMY
Still, critics say while Moon's approach to birth rates is an improvement, his job and housing policies discourage parenthood. Minimum wage hikes have led to higher unemployment, while larger downpayment requirements have made homes unaffordable for many. 
""Creating a structure that enables us to have our own house is mostly needed,"" said Lee Kyoung-min, a store manager at Lotte Mart, a father of three.
Some also argue work-life balance could be better: Moon in July cut the working week to 52 hours from 68, but South Koreans still work 15 percent longer than the OECD average.
If birth rates don't improve, South Korea's economy could be 5 percent smaller by 2060, as productivity falls and higher spending for elderly care leaves less room for investment, the National Assembly Budget Office estimates. 
Industries catering for babies are struggling. Seoul has lost one in four maternity wards and in 2018 the capital sacked more than half its teachers.
Ryu Won-woo, manager of baby fair organizer BeFe, praised the government's measures, especially those encouraging more responsibilities for dads. But he does not expect quick results.

NAKHON PATHOM, Thailand (Reuters) - Boodsabann Chanthawong recently joined a growing number of women defying generations of Thai Buddhist tradition by becoming ordained as novice monks at an unrecognized all-female monastery outside Bangkok.
Leading a procession of 21 other women - from teenagers to senior citizens - to a chapel in the Songdhammakalyani monastery in Nakhon Pathom province, Boodsabann teared up as she prepared to exchange her white garments for the distinctive saffron robes otherwise seen almost exclusively on male monks.
""I'm going to overcome this obstacle and become ordained like I've always wanted,"" the 49-year-old businesswoman said before the ceremony on Dec. 5, where she would have her head shaved. She stayed for nine days at the temple.

Officially, only men can become monks and novices in Thailand under a Buddhist order that since 1928 has forbidden the ordination of women. The country does not recognize female monks or novices. 
One option for devout Thai women is to become white-clad Buddhist nuns, who follow a less-strict religious regimen than monks and are often relegated to housekeeping tasks in temples.
In recent years, more Thai Buddhist women seeking to become full-fledged ""bhikkunis"", or female monks, have been defying the tradition by pursuing the other option: getting ordained overseas, usually in Sri Lanka or India. 
Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, the 74-year-old abbess of the Songdhammakalyani monastery, flew to Sri Lanka to be ordained in 2001 as Thailand's first female monk. 
Since then, she has helped women like Boodsabann join the Buddhist order as novices at the monastery's ordination ceremonies every April and December.
""It's been 90 years and the social context has changed, but they still don't accept us,"" Dhammananda told Reuters in an interview at the temple's library, where an entire shelf is dedicated to books about women's rights and role in religion.
""It's a shame that women aren't allowed to make decisions for their own lives. You have to rebel against injustice because this is not right,"" she added.
While Dhammananda's monastery ordains female novices, it cannot do the same for those seeking to become female monks. Such a ceremony would require not only 10 female monks but also 10 male monks, who are forbidden under Thailand's 1928 order to participate in it. 
There are about 270 female monks across Thailand and they were all ordained abroad, Dhammananda said, adding that her monastery houses seven of them. In contrast, Thailand has more than 250,000 male monks. 
Efforts in the past by advocates to undo the 1928 order have been futile. It has been officially upheld during meetings of the Sangha Supreme Council, the council of top monks, in 2002 and most recently in 2014. 
The government says this is not gender discrimination but a matter of long-held tradition, and women are free to travel abroad to be ordained, just not in their own country.

""Women can't be ordained here, but no one stops them from doing that overseas. They just can't be ordained by Thai monks, that's all,"" said Narong Songarom, spokesman of the National Office of Buddhism.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than two years after news broke that one of New York City's busiest subway lines would stop running between Manhattan and Brooklyn to allow for repairs, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday that the ""L"" train would keep rolling. 
The expected closure of the L train tunnel under the East River for at least 15 months had dismayed residents of Brooklyn communities. Many were braced to squeeze onto other, already overcrowded lines or promised new bus services. Some moved out of their neighborhoods. 
But Cuomo told a news conference on Thursday that engineering experts from Cornell and Columbia universities had looked at the plans drawn up by the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority and found them needlessly disruptive.
""The simple fact is you have roughly 250,000 people who would need another way to get to work,"" Cuomo said. 
""No 'L-pocalypse!"" added Fernando Ferrer, the MTA's acting chairman.
Chloe Philips, 23, relies on the L train to travel from her home in Bushwick to her sales job at a technology company in Manhattan every day. Her lease is up in May and she was considering moving before Thursday's news.
""Everyone's really relieved,"" she said, describing how the many Brooklyn residents who work at her company had exulted on their internal online messaging chatrooms. ""I was thinking how much money I was going to have to spend on Ubers.""
Under the new plan, work will take place only on nights and weekends, with trains running on limited service through one of the two tubes inside the tunnel, causing longer wait times. 
Asked whether he would promise that work would not exceed 20 months, Cuomo said: ""I can't promise.""
The repairs are needed to fix damage from Storm Sandy in 2012, one of the most devastating storms ever to hit the U.S. East Coast, which pushed salt water inside old cracks and leaks in the century-old tunnel structure and corroded electrical switches and power lines. 
Under the new plan the MTA will not remove and replace all 32,000 feet of benchwall, a gangway-like walkway that allows workers, or evacuating passengers, to walk along the edge of the tunnel. 
Instead, weakened parts of the benchwall will be patched up with strengthened, industrial-use plastic, and the cables that currently run inside the benchwall will be suspended from racks higher up the tunnel wall. 
""So long as this new strategy proves to be real, the mayor thinks this is great news for L-train riders,"" a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said. ""But like everyone else, the mayor thinks the MTA has some real explaining to do about how it has handled this for the last few years. This is certainly no way to run a railroad."" 
The Riders Alliance, an advocacy group for the city's transit users, called on the governor to release more details.

""The governor's plan may or may not work,"" John Raskin, the alliance's director, said in a statement, ""but you'll pardon transit riders for being skeptical that a last-minute Hail Mary idea cooked up over Christmas is better than what the MTA came up with over three years of extensive public input.""

306,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 07:05PM ET</span>",Most of UK PM May's Conservative Party members oppose her Brexit deal: survey,"By Kylie MacLellan
LONDON (Reuters) - A majority of Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party members oppose her Brexit deal with the European Union, according to a survey published on Friday.
With less than three months until Britain leaves the bloc, May is yet to win parliament's backing for her deal and the research may dent hopes that pressure from local members over Christmas might persuade Conservative lawmakers to support it.
May postponed a planned December vote on her deal in parliament after admitting it was set to be defeated and is seeking further assurances from EU leaders ahead of a vote now due to take place the week beginning Jan. 14.
The survey of 1,215 Conservative Party members found 59 percent opposed May's deal, with 38 percent in favor.
More than half of members questioned said they did not believe it respected the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum.
Asked how they would vote if another referendum were held to choose between May's deal or leaving without a deal, just 29 percent said they would pick May's agreement, compared to 64 percent who would opt for no deal.
The survey was conducted Dec. 17-22 by YouGov for the Party Members Project, a three-year study of membership of the six largest British parties funded by a non-departmental public body, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).
""Grassroots Tories are even less impressed than Tory Members of Parliament (MPs),"" said Tim Bale, Professor of Politics at Queen Mary University of London, who helps run the Party Members project.
""If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the Prime Minister's deal, it won't be because they've come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break.""
May is seeking assurances from the EU over the so-called Irish backstop, an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between the British province and EU-member Ireland, which remains the main obstacle to securing the backing of parliament.
The backstop has cost her the support of dozens of her own lawmakers and the small Northern Irish party that props up her minority government, with critics fearing it could leave Britain indefinitely trapped in the EU's customs union.
Only 11 percent of Conservative members thought the backstop made sense and should be part of the Brexit deal. Although 23 percent thought it was a bad idea but a price worth paying to secure a deal, 40 percent said Britain should reject any deal that included the backstop. 
The government has said it is stepping up planning for a no-deal Brexit, which Brexit minister Stephen Barclay said on Thursday was a more likely outcome if parliament rejects May's deal.
Business leaders have warned a no-deal Brexit would cause huge disruption, clogging up ports with additional border checks and dislocating supply chains in Europe and beyond.

Asked about warnings over the risks of no-deal disruption, including potential food and medicine shortages, 76 percent of Conservative members said they were ""exaggerated or invented"".

307,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 06:05PM ET</span>",Second referendum would only divide UK further: Brexit minister,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A second referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union would only exacerbate divisions among the British people, Brexit minister Stephen Barclay told a German newspaper.
Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said last month there would be a ""plausible argument"" for another referendum if parliament failed to reach a consensus on the way forward, something Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out.
Barclay echoed May's view.
""A second referendum would cause yet more division,"" he told German daily Die Welt. ""The current extent to which Britain is divided now would be small compared to the tensions that a second vote would cause. It would further divide our nation.""
The future of a Brexit agreement that May negotiated with the EU hangs in the balance in the run-up to a parliamentary vote, and calls for a second referendum - which she has consistently rejected - are growing.
Brexit is scheduled for March 29. 
Barclay said a second referendum could not be organized before elections to the European Parliament in May.
""But then, European elections would have to take place in Britain,"" he added. ""Which means huge democratic damage, because people voted for a withdrawal but would have to nonetheless vote again at the end of May.""
""Our European colleagues couldn't have any interest in it (a second referendum) either as that would trigger a very populist reaction,"" he said.

British lawmakers must choose whether to accept May's plans for a structured exit and relatively close economic ties to the EU, or reject it and spawn huge uncertainty about the country's next steps. The vote is due in the week beginning Jan. 14.

A wave of ""yellow vest"" street protests in the past two months have rocked Macron's presidency, forcing him into policy concessions including scrapping a planned fuel tax rise to try and defuse anger over a perceived squeeze on family budgets. 
Facing the sternest challenge of his 20-month tenure, Macron has since vowed to press on with other reform pledges, however, like tackling unemployment benefits or overhauling the civil service, even as the protest movement rumbles on.
Only 25 percent of people surveyed by Odoxa and Dentsu Consulting for franceinfo and the Figaro newspaper said they were satisfied with the French government's measures and action since Macron came to power in mid-2017. 
The poll of 1,004 people, carried out on Jan. 2 and 3, compared to one from April 2018, when 59 percent of those surveyed were unhappy with the government versus 75 percent now. 
The biggest political priority for 54 percent of French people was finding measures to boost purchasing power, the poll found, while reducing unemployment, long the number one worry, slipped to become the fourth most urgent concern. 
Support for the ""yellow vest"" demonstrations, which have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major cities, has also dwindled somewhat versus earlier surveys, and following Macron's bid to meet some of the protesters' demands. 

Fifty-five percent of those surveyed said they thought the protests should carry on, compared to 54 percent on Dec. 11 and 66 percent on Nov. 22 shortly after the movement erupted.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 04:40PM ET</span>",Cyber researcher pulls public talk on hacking Apple's Face ID,"By Jim Finkle and Stephen Nellis
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A cyber security researcher canceled a hacking conference briefing on how he said he could crack biometric facial recognition on Apple Inc (O:AAPL) iPhones, at the request of his employer, which called the work ""misleading.""
The prospect that Face ID could be defeated is troubling because it is used to lock down functions on tens of millions of iPhones from banking and healthcare apps to emails, text messages and photos.
There is a one in 1 million chance a random person could unlock a Face ID, versus one in 50,000 chance that would happen with the iPhone's fingerprint sensor, according to Apple.
Face ID has proven more secure than its predecessor, Touch ID, which uses fingerprint sensors to unlock iPhones. Touch ID was defeated within a few days of its 2013 launch. 
China-based researcher Wish Wu was scheduled to present a talk entitled ""Bypass Strong Face ID: Everyone Can Deceive Depth and IR Camera and Algorithms"" at the Black Hat Asia hacking conference in Singapore in March. Wu told Reuters that his employer, Ant Financial, asked him to withdraw the talk from Black Hat, one of the largest and most prestigious organizers of hacking conferences.
Ant Financial's Alipay payment system is compatible with facial recognition technologies including Face ID. 
Nobody has publicly released details on a successful Face ID hack that others have been able to replicate since Apple introduced the feature in 2017 with the iPhone X, according to biometric security experts. The company has introduced three other Face ID phones: iPhone XS, XS Max and XR.
Wu told Reuters that he agreed with the decision to withdraw his talk, saying he was only able to reproduce hacks on iPhone X under certain conditions, but that it did not work with iPhone XS and XS Max. 
""In order to ensure the credibility and maturity of the research results, we decided to cancel the speech,"" he told Reuters in a message on Twitter.
An Apple spokesman declined comment.
""The research on the face ID verification mechanism is incomplete and would be misleading if presented,"" Ant Financial said in a statement.
Black Hat withdrew an abstract of the talk from its website in late December after Ant uncovered problems with the research.
The abstract claimed that Face ID could be hacked with an image printed on an ordinary black-and-white printer and some tape. The only other claim of a Face ID hack was in 2017 by a Vietnamese cybersecurity company Bkav, which posted it on YouTube videos. Other researchers have not been able to replicate that attack.
Apple's facial recognition uses a combination of cameras and special sensors to capture a three-dimensional scan of a face that allows it to identify spoofs with photographs or determine if the user is asleep or otherwise not looking at the phone.
It is rare for talks to be pulled from cybersecurity conferences such as Black Hat, whose events are attended by professionals looking to understand emerging hacking threats. 
Black Hat told Reuters it had accepted Wu's talk because Wu convinced its review board he could pull off the hack.
""Black Hat accepted the talk after believing the hack could be replicated based on the materials provided by the researcher,"" conference spokeswoman Kimberly Samra said.

Anil Jain, a Michigan State University computer science professor who is an expert on facial recognition, said he was surprised by Wu's claim because Apple has invested heavily in ""anti-spoofing"" technology that makes such hacks very difficult.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The national security adviser to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Thursday that the leader wants to move Brazil's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, but that logistical considerations were standing in the way.
Retired Army General Augusto Heleno, Bolsonaro's top adviser on security, did not elaborate. But the country's powerful agriculture sector is opposed to moving the embassy from Tel Aviv and angering Arab nations that buy billions of dollars worth of Brazilian halal or ""permissible"" meat each year. 
Separately, Bolsonaro met Thursday with the head of the World Trade Organization, Roberto Azevedo, who said the new Brazilian government's sharp rebukes of globalism were shared by many other countries and that the trade body was making changes. 
Azevedo met with Bolsonaro the day after Brazil's new Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo sharply rebuked globalism, saying that under his watch the country would fight for change at multilateral institutions like the WTO.
Araujo's words were not a threat, Azevedo said.
""To the contrary, I think it was very propitious and compatible with what is happening,"" he said after meeting Bolsonaro. ""The World Trade Organization itself is beginning the process of reforms."" 
SHARP SHIFTS
The far-right Bolsonaro has dramatically changed Brazil's diplomatic alliances, rejecting the emphasis on South-South relations that the leftist Workers Party pushed when it held the presidency from 2003 to 2016. 
Bolsonaro, an avid fan of U.S. President Donald Trump, has deepened ties with the United States and Israel. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to Brazil for Bolsonaro's Jan. 1 inauguration, and after the pair met Netanyahu said that Bolsonaro told him that moving the embassy was a matter of ""when, not if.""
Security adviser Heleno said on Thursday ""there is a clear desire that this happens, but there has been no decision on a date."" 
Heleno said he did not think there would be problems with Arab nations who have threatened to boycott Brazilian exports if it moves the embassy to Jerusalem, arguing that Brazilian diplomats would work with Middle Eastern trading partners to ease concerns. 
Bolsonaro and some state governors in Brazil are looking to purchase Brazilian drones and lean on the United States and Israel for other technology and know-how as the government had made dismantling the South American nations powerful and heavily armed drug cartels a top priority. 
PENSION PENDING 
Onyx Lorenzoni, Bolsonaro's chief of staff, said after a first full meeting of the cabinet that the new administration was committed to an ambitious pension overhaul, adding that a privatization program was still under evaluation. 
By early next week each minister should announce their top priority, Lorenzoni said.
Bolsonaro's economic team has promised to liberalize Brazil's hidebound economy, rid the country of ""socialism,"" and enact conservative social measures in areas like education.
On Wednesday, Bolsonaro unveiled plans to step up privatizations, toughen prison sentencing guidelines and hand control over indigenous land claims to the powerful Agriculture Ministry. Brazilian markets soared on promises to shrink government.
Bolsonaro's administration is made up of free market economists, statist former military generals, and religious ideologues, and it remains to be seen just how committed he is to liberalizing the economy. 

Nonetheless, Bolsonaro tweeted on Thursday morning that privatization of 12 Brazilian airports and four ports should attract 7 billion reais ($1.85 billion) in initial investment. He did not give further details.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday it feared for the safety of Syrians barred from entering Algeria from the south, saying some of those turned back were refugees left stranded in the desert and not suspected militants as Algiers maintains. 
The official overseeing migrant policy at Algeria's interior ministry said on Wednesday that Syrians who had arrived overland from the south recently were members of defeated militant groups from Syria's civil war who would pose a security threat.
But the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees criticized the decision, saying that some of the Syrians mentioned by the Algerian official were known to be registered refugees.
""(They) have fled conflict and persecution or claim to have attempted to seek international protection in Algeria,"" a UNHCR statement said.""According to information made available to UNHCR, 20 individuals from this group currently remain stranded in the desert, three kilometers from the Guezzam border post where they are exposed to the elements. The other 100 individuals who were taken to the border are unaccounted for,"" the statement said.
Citing an ""urgent humanitarian imperative"", UNHCR said it had appealed to Algerian authorities for access to Syrians affected by the ban to identify those in need of international protection and ensure their safety.
Hassen Kacimi, the interior ministry officials, said around 100 Syrians had reached the southern border with the help of local armed escorts in recent weeks but were intercepted and expelled shortly after they slipped into Algeria.
He said these Syrians had transited Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan and Niger or Mali using fake Sudanese passports. 
Algeria has taken in around 50,000 Syrians on humanitarian grounds in recent years, Kacimi added. 
Algeria went through years of devastating civil war with Islamist militant groups in the 1990s. While violence is now greatly diminished, sporadic attacks continue in isolated areas. 
In Algeria's south and southeast, largely desolate areas with few inhabitants, the government has beefed up its security presence after neighboring Libya and northern Mali and Niger descended into lawlessness with various armed groups active.

Transport Minister Chris Grayling met police, aviation and defense chiefs on Thursday to discuss the issue, the report said. The airports did not immediately comment on the report.
Drone sightings caused chaos at Gatwick, Britain's second busiest airport, last month, disrupting the travel plans of tens of thousands of people in the run up to Christmas.
The incident revealed a vulnerability that is being scrutinized by security forces and airport operators worldwide.
The military was drafted in to deploy specialist equipment, enabling authorities to reassure the airport that it was safe for planes to take off and land.
The technology included the Israeli-designed Drone Dome system, The Times reported. 
Security minister Ben Wallace said last month Britain's security forces had detection systems that could be deployed throughout the country to combat the threat of drones. 

Media reports suggested that the defense ministry had since removed its anti-drone hardware from Gatwick.

The updated travel advisory maintains the warning at ""Level 2"" but also warns about extra security checks and increased police presence in the Xinjiang Uighur and Tibet Autonomous Regions.
The advisory follows the detentions by Chinese authorities in December of Canadians Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and an adviser with the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank, and businessman Michael Spavor. China says both men were suspected of endangering state security.
Tensions with China increased after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Dec. 1 in Vancouver at the request of the United States.
U.S. prosecutors have accused her of misleading banks about transactions linked to Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions.
Earlier on Thursday, China's top prosecutor said the two Canadians had ""without a doubt"" violated the law. 
In its previous travel advisory for China issued on Jan. 22 last year, the State Department urged Americans to ""exercise increased caution"" in the country because of ""the arbitrary enforcement of local laws and special restrictions on dual U.S.-Chinese nationals.""
The latest advisory repeats that warning but adds: ""Extra security measures, such as security checks and increased levels of police presence, are common in the Xinjiang Uighur and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Authorities may impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice.""
The advisory also warns about China's use of ""exit bans"" that would prohibit U.S. citizens from leaving the country, sometimes keeping them in China for years.

315,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 01:16PM ET</span>","Pope Francis criticizes U.S. bishops over abuse scandal, demands unity","By Crispian Balmer
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis accused U.S. bishops on Thursday of failing to show unity in the face of a sexual abuse crisis, saying internal bickering had to end over a scandal that has shredded the Church's credibility.
In a long and highly unusual letter sent to U.S. bishops as they embarked on a week-long retreat, Francis said the handling of the scandal showed the urgent need for a new approach to management and mindset within the Roman Catholic Church.
""God's faithful people and the Church's mission continue to suffer greatly as a result of abuses of power and conscience and sexual abuse, and the poor way that they were handled,"" the pope wrote, adding that bishops had ""concentrated more on pointing fingers than on seeking paths of reconciliation"".
Pope Francis has summoned the heads of some 110 national Catholic bishops' conferences and dozens of experts and leaders of religious orders to the Vatican on Feb. 21-24 for an extraordinary gathering dedicated to the now global crisis.
Victims of clergy sexual abuse are hoping that the meeting will finally come up with a clear policy to make bishops themselves accountable for the mishandling of abuse cases.
Ahead of that encounter, U.S. bishops gathered on Wednesday near Chicago for seven days of prayer and spiritual reflection.
""The Church's credibility has been seriously undercut and diminished by these sins and crimes, but even more by the efforts made to deny or conceal them,"" Francis said.
The pope said he was so concerned by the situation that he had hoped to attend the retreat in person, but added that he had been unable to do so ""for logistical reasons"". However, he sent his own preacher, Raniero Cantalamessa, to lead proceedings.
PAST WRONGS
The U.S. Church is still reeling from a grand jury report last year that found that 301 priests in the state of Pennsylvania had sexually abused minors over a 70-year period. Other U.S. states have launched investigations of their own.
""The hurt caused by these sins and crimes has also deeply affected the communion of bishops, and generated not the sort of healthy and necessary disagreements and tensions found in any living body, but rather division and dispersion,"" the pope said.
Critics accuse Francis, who became pontiff in 2013, of responding much too slowly to the sex scandals, of failing to empathize with the victims and of blindly believing the word of his fellow clergy.
But in 2018 he tried to address past wrongs, publicly admitting he was wrong about a case in Chile and vowing that the Church would never again seek to cover up such wrongdoing.
In July, he accepted the resignation of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the U.S. Church's most prominent figures, following allegations he had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy, while in October, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington D.C., stepped down over his handling of abuse cases.
""Combating the culture of abuse, the loss of credibility, the resulting bewilderment and confusion, and the discrediting of our mission urgently demands of us a renewed and decisive approach to resolving conflicts,"" the pope wrote on Thursday.

""This requires not only a new approach to management, but also a change in our mindset.""

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The partial U.S. government shutdown is showing signs of straining the country's immigration system and has been blamed for worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.
U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to continue the shutdown until he gets the $5 billion he is seeking for a wall on the Mexican border, which the opposition Democrats have refused, prompting the 13-day shutdown.
About 800,000 federal employees have been affected. That includes border patrol agents who are working without pay, according to Joshua Wilson, vice president of the border patrol union in San Diego.
Immigration judges have been furloughed, which means thousands of long-delayed deportation cases will have to be rescheduled, frustrating efforts by Trump's Justice Department to clear a backlog of 800,000 cases.
Jeremy McKinney, an immigration lawyer in North Carolina, said a client who is fighting deportation had a procedural hearing canceled this week and it probably will not be rescheduled until 2020 due to overflowing dockets.
""That's one case for one judge in one city. Multiply that by hundreds in Charlotte and thousands and thousands of cases across the country,"" he said. ""The shutdown has resulted in a complete standstill for most of the immigration docket.""
The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is part of the Justice Department and runs the immigration courts, said in a notice that immigrants in detention still will have court dates. However, the judges hearing those cases are working without pay, according  to Ashley Tabaddor, the president of the national immigration judges' union.
“In the past there has been retroactive pay provided but that has to be provided by Congress, so there is a lot of anxiety among the judges about what will happen,” Tabaddor said.
A Justice Department spokesman said he could not respond to a request for comment because of the shutdown.
A system known as E-Verify, which is used to check if a person is authorized to work in the United States, was taken offline for a lack of funding. Several states require employers to use the program and the Trump administration has considered making E-Verify mandatory for employers.
Shanon Stevenson, a lawyer with Fisher & Phillips in Atlanta, said she has heard from clients that they may postpone adding staff until E-Verify is available.

""They don’t want to invest the time and training and find they then have problem,"" she said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Clashes among rival Syrian rebel factions have spread across northwest Syria, rebels and residents said on Thursday, in the latest bout of tit-for-tat fighting between opponents of President Bashar al Assad's rule.
Infighting has long plagued Syria's armed opposition since the uprising against Assad began in 2011. Turf wars have helped the Syrian president, with his Iranian and Russian allies, recover much of the territory previously held by rebels.
Tahrir al Sham, formerly affiliated to al Qaeda, had launched an attack on Tuesday against towns controlled by Nour al Din Zinki, a member of the mainstream National Liberation Front (NLF), the rebels and residents told Reuters by telephone.
The Islamist group, which on Wednesday seized the town of Darat Izza in rebel-held Aleppo province northwest of the Syrian city of Aleppo, said it was retaliating for an ambush this week that killed five of its fighters. It blamed Nour al Din Zinki.
Ideological differences divide hardline Islamist militants from nationalist groups in the Free Syrian Army that have gathered under the banner of the NLF, which has the backing of Syria's neighbor Turkey.
A rebel source said capturing the town of Darat Izza would strengthen the Islamist group in talks with Turkey, which has a military foothold in the northern region and wants to tighten its grip on the area to secure its border.
In a further bout of tit-for-tat fighting, NLF forces attacked Islamist strongholds and checkpoints in Idlib province, residents and rebels said.
""We hold Tahrir al Sham responsible for the dangerous and catastrophic repercussions that result from its escalation and call on its wisemen to stop the fighting and preserve what is left of the revolution,"" the NLF said in statement.
Residents say the NLF has made little progress in dislodging the Islamists from Saraqeb, one of the main cities they hold in Idlib province.
Scores of civilians in Maarat al Numan, an NLF-controlled town, held a rally against Tahrir al Sham on Wednesday, accusing the group and its leader Sheikh Abu Mohammad al Golani of serving Assad by launching its latest attack.
Clashes between rebel factions have extended to Atma, a town on Idlib province's northern border with Turkey. The town is now home to tens of thousands of Syrian displaced by the years of conflict and who now live in makeshift tents.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A former U.S. Marine detained in Russia has been charged with espionage, the Interfax news agency said on Thursday, meaning he could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
Russia's FSB state security service detained Paul Whelan, 48, in Moscow last Friday on suspicion of spying, in a case which threatens to aggravate diplomatic tensions with the United States. 
The FSB opened a criminal case against Whelan but gave no details of his alleged espionage activities.
Interfax said the Russian authorities had brought formal charges against Whelan on Thursday, citing what it described as an informed source. Reuters could not independently verify the Interfax report.
Whelan's lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, declined to comment on the charges but told Reuters that under the terms of the arrest order, Whelan was expected to remain in custody in Moscow until at least Feb. 28.
""I consider his detention and arrest baseless. It's based on investigators' supposition that he will hinder the investigation process. We are asking for bail instead,"" Zherebenkov told Reuters by telephone.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday the United States had asked Russia to explain Whelan's arrest and would demand his immediate return if it determines his detention is inappropriate.
Whelan's family has said that he was visiting Moscow for the wedding of a retired Marine and is innocent of the espionage charges against him. 
Under Russian law, espionage can carry sentences of between 10 and 20 years in prison.
""FEELING POSITIVE""
Zherebenkov said Whelan, who is being held at the Lefortovo detention facility in Moscow, was ""feeling positive"" and that a translator was explaining the legal procedures to him.
""All his rights and all international principles are being fully followed,"" Zherebenkov said. 
Russia's relations with the United States plummeted when Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Washington and Western allies imposed sanctions on Russian officials, companies and banks.
U.S. President Donald Trump's relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have been under a microscope because of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. 
Moscow has denied interfering in the election. Trump has said there was no collusion and says Mueller's probe is a witch hunt.
Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief, said it was ""possible, even likely"" that Putin had ordered Whelan’s arrest to set up an exchange for Maria Butina, a Russian citizen who pleaded guilty on Dec. 13 to acting as an agent to influence conservative groups in the United States.
Russia says Butina was forced to make a false confession about being a Russian agent.
The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Whelan's detention.
Putin told Trump in a letter on Sunday that Moscow was ready for dialogue on a ""wide-ranging agenda,"" the Kremlin said, after a series of attempts to schedule a meeting between the leaders.

At the end of November, Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Putin on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina, citing tensions about Russian forces opening fire on Ukrainian navy boats and then seizing them.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations envoy to Somalia warned on Thursday that the arrest of a former militant leader could deter others from choosing politics over violence, speaking publicly about the incident despite being kicked out of the country just days earlier for privately expressing his concerns to the government.
Nicholas Haysom briefed the U.N. Security Council in New York but did not address a statement issued by Somalia's foreign affairs ministry late on Tuesday that accused him of interfering in internal affairs and said he ""cannot work in this country.""
Haysom had raised questions in a letter on Sunday about the involvement of U.N.-supported Somali security forces in the arrest of a former militant of the Islamist al Shabaab group who was blocked from running in a recent regional election.
He told the 15-member Security Council that the allegations of interference by the federal government in the regional election and the violence that followed the former militant's arrest ""does not bode well for the upcoming electoral processes in other regions or for the 2020 national elections.""
""This may also have implications for the likelihood of future al Shabaab defectors who may be considering exchanging violence for a political path,"" said Haysom, a South African. 
Somalia showed no signs on Thursday of backing down from its decision to effectively make Haysom persona non grata. The United Nations said on Wednesday it was looking into the matter and that Haysom would meet with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday. 
The United Nations is a major backer of Somalia, a country that has lacked strong central government since 1991. The government's decision on Haysom could intensify a confrontation between Mogadishu and the semiautonomous regions.
Somalia's U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman told the Security Council on Thursday that the Somali people wanted ""Somalia leading international support, not international support leading Somalia.""
""Somalia distinguishes between the institutions that we are part of and individual conduct that's had detrimental effect on our fragile nation,"" he said. ""We reject the criticism and attempt to re-brand renewed terrorists as an ice cream salesperson without redeeming themselves.""

Al Shabaab has sought for over a decade to topple the central government and implement its strict version of Islamic law. It was driven out of the capital in 2011 but maintains a foothold in some regions.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - Lawyers for Bijan Rafiekian, the ex-business partner of former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn, said Thursday they want to delay the upcoming February criminal trial into whether their client covertly lobbied for Turkey.
During a hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Rafiekian's attorney Robert Trout said he needs more time to review evidence turned over on Thursday morning, and plans to ask the judge to move the trial from February 11 to sometime in September.
Rafiekian, a former U.S. Export-Import Bank director and co-founder of the consultancy firm Flynn Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Group, is facing charges that he covertly lobbied for Turkey to discredit and extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen from the United States to Turkey.
He was indicted in December along with Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish-Dutch businessman, for failing to disclose their lobbying and lying about the nature of their work. 
Rafiekian is facing two criminal counts, including acting as a foreign agent and conspiracy, while Alptekin is facing six.
Rafiekian has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and Alptekin has previously denied the allegations through a spokesperson.
Rafiekian's indictment came about a year after Flynn was charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for lying to the FBI about his contacts with the former Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. President Donald Trump fired Flynn in early 2017. 
As part of his plea deal, Flynn also admitted to lying about his role in the Turkish lobbying effort. 
The case against Rafiekian is being brought by prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia, and not by Mueller's office.
However, prosecutor James Gillis told the judge on Thursday that much of the evidence turned over came from Mueller's investigators.
Last month, a federal judge in Washington fiercely criticized Flynn for lying to the FBI in connection with Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and delayed his sentencing until he has finished helping prosecutors.
It is unclear whether or not Flynn could be called upon to testify in the case against Rafiekian.
Trout said Thursday that as part of his plans to mount a defense, he may seek evidence abroad, including possibly deposing relevant witnesses overseas.

Judge Anthony Trenga ordered the defense to file a motion to requesting the trial delay by Jan. 21, and scheduled a hearing on the matter for Feb. 7.

""He denies any involvement in criminal activities and will oppose any request for his extradition,"" Rudi Krause, of BDL Attorneys, told Reuters in an email. 
Chang, who oversaw Mozambique's finances when it failed to disclose government guarantees for $2 billion in international borrowing by state-owned firms, was arrested in South Africa last week at the request of the United States.
The U.S. charges were initially reported by Mozambique's state news agency to be unconnected. But Krause said they were indeed linked to the loans, whose disclosure plunged the southern African country into a suffocating debt crisis it is still struggling to climb out of two years later. 
""The charges relate to the loans from two commercial banks and in respect of which the Mozambican government granted certain guarantees,"" Krause said. 
He added that he did not know how Chang's involvement in the borrowing had allegedly violated U.S. law. 
""That remains a mystery.""
Chang faces charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, according to Mozambique's state news agency, and is set to appear in court in Johannesburg on Jan. 8. 
In a note following Chang's arrest, Darias Jonker, Africa director at Eurasia Group, said his potential extradition could bring fresh revelations around the debt scandal ahead of closely contested elections in Mozambique later this year. 
Audits into what happened have left some questions unanswered, including the whereabouts of between $700 million and $1 billion in public funds.
If linked to members of the former government or ruling party, Frelimo, during U.S. legal proceedings, the scandal could sap support for the government ahead of the October vote and set back Mozambique's efforts to rebuild its reputation abroad. 
""Mozambique is facing a crisis and will do whatever they can to prevent Chang from cooperating with the U.S., as he is very likely to implicate other senior members of Frelimo,"" Jonker told Reuters by email on Thursday. 
Chang is seen as a key figure in the debt scandal, having signed off on guarantees for the loans obtained from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Russia's VTB bank in 2013 and 2014. 
Their disclosure in 2016 prompted foreign donors including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cut off support for Mozambique, triggering a currency collapse and debt default. The IMF said it believed Mozambique had concealed the borrowing.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Many Congolese were kept from voting in the Dec. 30 presidential election because polling stations often opened late, closed early and voting machines sometimes did not work, a group of observers said on Thursday. 
The report by Congo's SYMOCEL, which deployed thousands of staff to about a third of voting centers for last Sunday's poll, is the most comprehensive independent assessment to date of the election, which is meant to lead to the country's first democratic transfer of power. 
The electoral commission had been scheduled to publish provisional results on Sunday but it said on Thursday that could be delayed because counting centers are still waiting for 80 percent of local vote tallies.
The vote is meant to choose a successor to incumbent Joseph Kabila, who is due to step down this month after 18 years in power. Repeated delays since 2016, when Kabila's mandate officially expired, sparked violent protests in which security forces killed dozens of people. 
Pre-election polling showed ex-interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, Kabila's preferred candidate, trailing the main opposition candidates, Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi. Both Shadary and the opposition say they expect to win. 
The opposition says the vote was marred by widespread irregularities, while the ruling coalition and electoral commission say it went generally smoothly.
Government spokesman Lambert Mende on Thursday defended the credibility of the election and said the decision to cancel voting in the Ebola-hit cities of Beni and Butembo was justified by public safety concerns.
More than one million Congolese in opposition strongholds were barred from voting after the electoral commission canceled the polls there, citing an Ebola outbreak, the second-deadliest in history, and ethnic violence. 
Mende also defended a decision to cut Internet access until the results were known, saying it had been intended to stop the spread of false news about the outcome. 
SYMOCEL said 24 percent of the polling stations it observed closed without allowing those already in line at closing time to cast their ballots, as required by law. 
It added that 27 percent of polling stations it observed opened late, sometimes by many hours, and 18 percent had problems with malfunctioning electronic voting machines. 
Seventeen percent of polling stations it observed allowed voting by people who either did not having voting cards or whose names were not on the voter roll, and 15 percent did not publicly display vote tallies after counting, as required by law, it said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - It is three o'clock in the morning and Artak Tadevosyan is wafting incense through the corridors of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the site where Christians believe Jesus Christ was crucified and buried.
""Walking in the Lord's footsteps, really, you have feelings that cannot be explained,"" said the 26-year-old Armenian Orthodox cleric. ""We don't see it as stone, all these are holy places for us.""
The Holy Sepulchre lies in Jerusalem's Old City. A church was first built there in the 4th century under Constantine the Great, the Roman emperor who converted to Christianity.
Today, the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches share custody of the building, and tensions sometimes run high over who controls what.
Other denominations also hold services there, in languages including Latin, Arabic, Aramaic, Amharic and Ge'ez.
At night the building falls silent. Muslim families have long held the door key, because of the tensions between the Christian clergy.
In the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate nearby, His Beatitude Theophilos III, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, said he feels deep reverence for the church.
""For the Christian world the Holy Sepulchre is the heart of Jerusalem and the world,"" he said during preparations for the Orthodox Christmas on Sunday.
""Why? Because this particular place, which is the rock of the crucifixion and the rock of the tomb, or the burial site, of Jesus Christ, has been watered, and therefore blessed, by the blood of The Righteous One.""

DAKAR (Reuters) - Senegal's Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that jailed presidential hopeful Khalifa Sall could not appeal a prison sentence for embezzlement, his lawyers said, likely ending his chance of running as a free man in February polls.
The popular former mayor of Dakar was arrested in March 2017 on suspicion of embezzling 1.8 billion CFA francs ($3 million) in public funds. Last year he was sentenced to five years in jail.
Opponents of President Macky Sall, who is no relation to Khalifa, say he has tried to silence political opposition ahead of the Feb. 24 election. The ruling party and state lawyers have denied that.
In a report last year, Amnesty International criticized the Senegalese government for cracking down on peaceful demonstrations and said the judiciary handling Khalifa's case ""showed a lack of independence"".
Khalifa Sall's lawyer, Seydou Diagne, said his client had not been stripped of his political rights and still stood a chance of running in the election. Diagne said he plans to take the case to another chamber of the court, which would take more than a month. 
State lawyers were not available for comment. 
Despite his imprisonment, Khalifa Sall was one of just five candidates who collected the 53,000 supporting signatures required to run for election.
Karim Wade, the son of former president Abdoulaye Wade, also collected enough signatures. He served three years of a six-year prison sentence for corruption between 2015 and 2017 before going into exile in Qatar.
Senegalese law bans citizens sentenced to more than five years in prison from running for election.
The Constitutional Council said it would publish a final list of approved candidates on Jan. 21. 

Senegal has had three largely peaceful transitions of power since independence from France in 1960. ($1 = 569.2200 CFA francs)

325,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",Where do the Kurds fit into Syria's war?,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The future of Kurdish-led areas of northern and eastern Syria has been thrown into doubt by President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops who have helped to secure the region.
Amounting to about one quarter of Syria, the area is the largest chunk of territory still outside the control of President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Russia and Iran.
Trump said on Wednesday the United States would withdraw slowly ""over a period of time"" and would protect the U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters as Washington withdraws troops, but without giving a timetable.
Syrian Kurdish leaders fear Turkey will use the withdrawal as an opportunity to launch an assault.
As a result, they are in contact with Moscow and Damascus in the hope of agreeing arrangements to protect the region from Turkey while also aiming to safeguard their political gains.
HOW DID THE KURDS EMERGE AS A FORCE?
The main Syrian Kurdish faction, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), began to establish a foothold in the north early in the war as government forces withdrew to put down the anti-Assad uprising elsewhere. An affiliated militia, the People's Protection Units (YPG), secured the region.
Early in the conflict, their control was concentrated in three predominantly Kurdish regions home to roughly 2 million Kurds. Kurdish-led governing bodies were set up.
The area of YPG influence expanded as the YPG allied with the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State (IS), becoming the spearhead of a multi-ethnic militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
SDF influence widened to Manbij and Raqqa as IS was defeated in both. It has also reached deep into Deir al-Zor, where the SDF is still fighting IS.
Kurdish leaders say their aim is regional autonomy within a decentralized Syria, not independence.
WHY DOES TURKEY VIEW THEM AS A THREAT? 
The PYD is heavily influenced by the ideas of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, a founding member of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a 34-year insurgency in Turkey for Kurdish political and cultural rights. Ocalan has been in jail since 1999 in Turkey. He is convicted of treason.
The PKK is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Turkey says the PKK is indistinguishable from the PYD and YPG.
Turkey has a Kurdish minority equal to 15 to 20 percent of its population, mostly living in eastern and southeastern areas bordering Syria. Wary of separatistism, Turkey views the PYD's Syrian foothold as a national security threat.
Syria's main Kurdish groups do not hide Ocalan's influence: they organized elections towards establishing a political system based on his ideas.
Turkey has already mounted two cross-border offensives in northern Syria as part of its efforts to counter the YPG. 
FOR KURDS, IS ASSAD A FRIEND OR FOE?
Syria's Baathist state systematically persecuted the Kurds before the war. Yet the YPG and Damascus have broadly stayed out of each other's way during the conflict, despite occasional clashes. They also have been seen to cooperate against shared foes, notably in and around Aleppo. [IDnL8N1Q213V]
The YPG has allowed the Syrian state to keep a foothold in its areas. The YPG commander told Reuters in 2017 it would have no problem with the Assad government if Kurdish rights are guaranteed in Syria. 
But Damascus opposes Kurdish autonomy demands: the Syrian foreign minister last month said ""nobody in Syria accepts talk about independent entities or federalism"".
Talks between the sides last year made no progress.
The Kurdish-led authorities are launching a new initiative aiming to put pressure on the government to reach a political settlement ""within the framework of a decentralized Syria,"" leading Kurdish politician Ilham Ahmed said last week. 
Analysts say the Kurds' negotiating position has been weakened by Trump's announcement.
WHAT WOULD AN ASSAD-KURD DEAL MEAN FOR THE WAR?
The territory held by Damascus and the Kurdish-led authorities accounts for most of Syria. A political settlement - if one could be reached, perhaps with Russian help - could go a long way to stitching the map back together. 
But it would not mark the end of the war.
Anti-Assad insurgents, though defeated across much of Syria by the government and its allies, still have a foothold in the northwest stretching from Idlib through Afrin to Jarablus. Turkey has troops on the ground in this area.
The rebels include Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army groups and jihadists.
Enmity runs deep between the YPG and these groups.
For the YPG, one priority is recovering Afrin from the rebels who seized it in a Turkey-backed offensive last year.
Assad also wants Turkey out as he vows to recover ""every inch"" of Syria.

326,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 10:00AM ET</span>",Sudan unrest disrupts Bashir's push for vital financial support,"By Khalid Abdelaziz and Aidan Lewis
KHARTOUM/CAIRO (Reuters) - Short of time to save his sinking economy, Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir boarded a Russian jet on Dec. 17 and became the first Arab leader to visit Damascus since 2011, renewing what has been seen as a push for the financial help he needs to survive.
Events at home soon caught up with him. Two days later, demonstrators angered by bread price rises torched the ruling party headquarters in the city of Atbara, setting off two weeks of protests that quickly spread across the country, with crowds calling on Bashir to step down. 
The protests are the most sustained challenge to Bashir since he took power in an Islamist-backed coup nearly 30 years ago, more widespread and longer-lasting than bouts of unrest in September 2013 and January 2018.
They risk propelling Sudan deeper into crisis, upending Bashir's attempt to stave off financial collapse and destabilizing a country beset by simmering internal conflicts that straddles Africa and the Middle East.
""What we are witnessing today is the second and stronger wave of the protests that swept Sudan in September 2013. Frustration with the rising cost of living has been building up and is now boiling over again,"" said independent analyst Muhammad Osman.
Officials have acknowledged 19 deaths in the demonstrations. Amnesty International said last week it had credible reports that 37 protesters had been shot dead. ""Bashir and his inner circle will not go down without a fight,"" said Osman. 
Bashir has survived as one of the region's longest serving leaders, riding out 20 years of U.S. sanctions and shrugging off an indictment by the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity and genocide in Darfur. 
The protests come as the 75-year-old has been pushing to shore up his position economically as well as politically, lobbying to be removed from the list of countries, along with Syria, Iran and North Korea, that the U.S. considers state sponsors of terrorism. 
That listing has prevented an influx of investment and financial aid that Sudan was hoping for when the U.S. lifted sanctions October 2017, according to economists.
SPIRALING INFLATION
Instead, Sudan has been rapidly expanding its money supply to finance its budget deficit, causing spiraling inflation officially recorded at nearly 70 percent and a steep decline in the value of its currency. 
During his trip to Damascus, Bashir was courting the Russians by helping rehabilitate their ally Bashar al-Assad after Syria's civil war in order to win financial support or play them off against the U.S., analysts said.
Bashir has also sought favor with Gulf states including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cutting ties with Iran in 2016 and contributing troops to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, even while maintaining close relations with two of their regional rivals, Qatar and Turkey.
""The confusion in Sudanese foreign policy and the shift from one alliance to another is caused by the severe economic crisis in the country and President al-Bashir wants to obtain quick economic aid,"" said Faisal Mohamed Saleh, a journalist and political analyst in Khartoum. 
Those economic problems, at the root of discontent that has simmered for years, accelerated after Sudan lost three-quarters of its oil production when the south of the country seceded in 2011.
In the eyes of protesters, the economic troubles are deeply entwined with corruption and mismanagement in the political elite and the ruling National Congress Party (NCP), said Amjed Farid Eltayeb, an activist and spokesman for the Sudan Change Now movement.
""The NCP for the last 30 years have directed most of the national budget to the security apparatus, to the militias, and they cut all the funding of the social services, education, health,"" he said. 
""So those people who are now in the streets have no social protection nets, they are alone in a battle with fate ... they have nothing to lose.""
LEADERLESS PROTESTS
Opposition parties are emasculated, and the protests so far are leaderless, with demonstrators coalescing in individual towns and neighborhoods, and circumventing blocks on social media to share information on the web. [nL3N1YW277] 
Chanting the line made famous in the Arab Spring protests of 2011 - ""The people want the fall of the regime"" - they have continued to rally despite security forces using live ammunition, tear gas, and stun grenades to disperse them. 
With Sudan in its worst economic crisis since independence in 1956, Bashir risks the fate of other authoritarian rulers toppled eight years ago unless the NCP switches candidate ahead of elections due next year, said Eltayeb Zine al-Abedine, a political science professor at the University of Khartoum.
""The economic crisis and public discontent are lessening the chances of President Omar al-Bashir running for the 2020 elections,"" he said. 
But Bashir shows no sign of stepping aside. Members of Khartoum's parliament, which is dominated by the NCP, proposed a constitutional amendment last month to extend term limits that would have required Bashir to step down in 2020.
Since the demonstrations began, Bashir has appeared largely unperturbed, tempering his talk of conspiracies against Sudan 
with pledges of economic reform, calls for restraint and the announcement of a fact-finding committee – steps dismissed by protesters as symbolic.
""We are committed to holding free and fair elections in 2020, and we ask that all political powers prepare to participate,"" Bashir said on Monday.

More than 200 people took part in the demonstration, which broke up before the protesters reached the building.
Sudan has been hit by a series of protests triggered by price increases and shortages of cash and fuel following months of worsening economic conditions. Many protesters have called for an end to Bashir's rule. 
Security forces have blocked and broken up demonstrations using live ammunition as well as tear gas and stun grenades, witnesses say. They have also detained some protesters and opposition figures.
Earlier on Thursday, Bashir said in a speech the government was looking into handing out pay rises, starting this month, but he did not say by how much salaries would increase. 
The protesters in Port Sudan, on the Red Sea, represented a group of political parties who want Bashir to dissolve the government and form a transitional administration that would set a date for elections.
Signatories to the petition include the Umma Party, led by opposition figure Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, the Reform Now Movement, and the Democratic Unionist Party.
The petition also calls for the investigation of alleged abuses by security forces during two weeks of anti-government demonstrations across Sudan.
Bashir and the head of Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Service have called for restraint in the response to the protests, which officials have blamed on infiltrators.

329,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 09:53AM ET</span>","U.S. warns Iran against space launches, ballistic missiles","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States issued a pre-emptive warning to Iran on Thursday against pursuing three planned space rocket launches that it said would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution because they use ballistic missile technology. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Iran had announced plans to launch in the coming months three rockets, called Space Launch Vehicles (SLV), which he said incorporate technology that is ""virtually identical"" to that used in intercontinental ballistic missiles.
""The United States will not stand by and watch the Iranian regime's destructive policies place international stability and security at risk,"" Pompeo said in a statement. 
""We advise the regime to reconsider these provocative launches and cease all activities related to ballistic missiles in order to avoid deeper economic and diplomatic isolation.""
Iranian Deputy Defense Minister General Qassem Taqizadeh in late November was quoted by Iranian media as saying that Iran was planning to launch three satellites into space soon.
""The satellites have been made by domestic experts and will be put on various orbits,"" Taqizadeh said.
Pompeo said such rocket launches would violate United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. It calls upon Iran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such technology. It stops short of explicitly barring such activity.
U.S. President Donald Trump decided in May to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.
Pompeo said Iran has launched ballistic missiles numerous times since the U.N. resolution was adopted. He said it test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple warheads on Dec. 1.
""The United States has continuously cautioned that ballistic missile and SLV launches by the Iranian regime have a destabilizing effect on the region and beyond,"" Pompeo said. ""France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and many nations from around the world have also expressed deep concern.""
In July 2017, Iran launched a rocket it said could deliver a satellite into space, an act the U.S. State Department called provocative. Earlier that month, the United States slapped new economic sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program.

Iran says its space program is peaceful, but Western experts suspect it may be a cover for developing military missile technologies.

ROME (Reuters) - Naples is ready to defy Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini and let in a charity-run ship carrying 32 migrants that is blocked in the stormy Mediterranean, the city mayor said on Thursday.
His offer adds to a growing challenge from opposition politicians to Salvini's far-right League, which has vowed to bar migrants and make life difficult for those already here.
Both Italy and Malta are refusing to let the Sea-Watch 3, a ship operated by a German non-governmental organization (NGO), dock and set down the migrants who were rescued off Libya on Dec. 22.
Both countries say they have taken in too many migrants and accuse NGO rescue ships of acting as a taxi service for would-be refugees.
Naples' center-left mayor Luigi de Magistris said Salvini was playing politics with peoples' lives.
""To leave people and children in the middle of cold and stormy seas is a crime -- not simply indecent, immoral and appalling,"" de Magistris told Radio Crc.
""I hope that this boat approaches the port of Naples because, unlike what the government says, we will launch a rescue operation and we will let it enter the port,"" he said. ""I will be the first to lead the rescue.""
Naples is hundreds of miles to the north of the Sea-Watch 3 and there was no immediate response from the boat to the offer.
Malta overnight allowed the boat into its waters to sail closer to land where the seas are less choppy, but is refusing to let it dock.
Several local politicians from opposition parties have defied Salvini's anti-migrant policies.
On Wednesday, the mayor of the Sicilian capital Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, said he would join other cities in ignoring a new security law because it abolishes asylum protection for many migrants.
Salvini on Thursday threatened mayors with legal action.
""Anyone who helps clandestine migrants hates Italians. They will answer for their actions before the law and the history books. I will not back down,"" Salvini tweeted.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian prosecutors is seeking the death penalty for five of the 11 suspects detained over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the state news agency SPA said on Thursday, as a Saudi court held a first hearing on the case. 
Saudi Arabia said it also sent new letters to the Turkish public prosecutor asking for ""any evidence connected to this case"", which has rattled the Saudi royal court and damaged the reputation of 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
Khashoggi was close to the royal circles before becoming a critic of Prince Mohammed, writing for the Washington Post and speaking to international media about Saudi politics when he moved to the United States last year.
Saudi officials have rejected accusations that the crown prince ordered his murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, in which Khashoggi’s body was dismembered, removed from the building and handed over to an unidentified ""local cooperator"".
The whereabouts of Khashoggi’s remains are still unknown. A Turkish television channel on Monday showed men carrying suitcases purportedly containing the remains into the residence of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul.
""The initial hearing for the 11 individuals indicted by the Public Prosecution in the case of the murder of citizen Jamal Khashoggi was held today ... in the Criminal Court of Riyadh,"" a statement from the Saudi prosecutor carried by SPA said.
The prosecutor’s office said it was seeking the death penalty for five individuals among the 11 indicted. Ten other suspects were still under investigation.
MORE TIME
Without naming them, the prosecutor said last November the five individuals facing by the death penalty were “charged with ordering and committing the crime"".
SPA added that the defendants' lawyers attended the hearing and the court approved a request from the 11 for more time to prepare their defense. It gave no details on the next hearing.
Saudi King Salman sacked Saud al-Qahtani, a former top aide to Prince Mohammed, Istanbul Consul General Mohammed Alotaibi and former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Asiri in connection with Khashoggi's murder.
The kingdom has come under heavy international pressure, including from the United States, its closest ally, whose Senate has voted in favor of a resolution blaming the crown prince for the murder.
U.S. senators were briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies which concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the operation to kill Khashoggi.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said Khashoggi's killing was ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership.
Thursday's statement said the kingdom was still awaiting responses to requests for information sent to Turkish officials.
Last week, King Salman put Ibrahim al-Assaf, a veteran former finance minister, in charge of foreign affairs, in an effort to improve the kingdom’s image after the crisis caused by the killing.

Assaf replaced Adel al-Jubeir, and experts in Saudi politics said the move reflected a perception that Jubeir was tainted by having served as Riyadh’s chief global defender during the Khashoggi affair.

The blast in the early hours of December 31 damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk, some 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow.
The death toll has progressively risen in the past few days as rescuers battle blisteringly cold temperatures to recover people trapped under the rubble. 
The emergencies ministry said earlier on Thursday that 37 people had been killed. But the death toll went up to 39 when rescuers recovered another two bodies from the rubble on Thursday afternoon.
Deputy Emergencies Minister Alexander Chupriyan told Interfax there were no more bodies under the rubble and that the search and rescue operation was over. 
A Reuters witness at the scene said that workers were removing debris from the site using cranes and other equipment. 
Russia's Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, has said it is still investigating the exact cause of the blast.
It said no traces of explosives had been found at the site. Initial reports attributed the blast to a gas explosion. 
Gas explosions are relatively common in Russia because of ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations surrounding gas use.

(Reuters) - NASA's New Horizons explorer successfully ""phoned home"" on Tuesday after a journey to the most distant world ever explored by humankind, a frozen rock at the edge of the solar system that scientists hope will uncover secrets to its creation.
The nuclear-powered space probe has traveled 4 billion miles (6.4 billion km) to come within 2,200 miles (3,540 km) of Ultima Thule, an apparently peanut-shaped, 20-mile-long (32-km-long) space rock in the uncharted heart of the Kuiper Belt. The belt is a ring of icy celestial bodies just outside Neptune's orbit.
Engineers at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland cheered when the spacecraft's first signals came through the National Aeronautic and Space Agency's Deep Space Network at 10:28 a.m. EST (1528 GMT).
""We have a healthy spacecraft,"" Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman declared. 
The spacecraft will ping back more detailed images and data from Thule in the coming days, NASA said.  
Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on its 4 billion-mile journey toward the solar system’s edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons.
""Last night, overnight, the United States spacecraft New Horizons conducted the farthest exploration in the history of humankind, and did so spectacularly,"" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern told a news conference at the Johns Hopkins facility in Laurel, Maryland.
An image of Thule, sent overnight and barely more detailed than previous images, deepens the mystery of whether Thule is a single rock shaped like an asymmetrical peanut or actually two rocks orbiting each other, ""blurred together because of their proximity,"" Stern said.
During a 2015 fly-by, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed methane-rich dunes on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.
Now 1 billion miles (1.6 billion km) beyond Pluto for its second mission into the Kuiper Belt, New Horizons will study the makeup of Ultima Thule's atmosphere and terrain in a months-long study to seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.
Scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched, according to NASA, making the mission unique in that respect. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and the following year selected it for New Horizon's extended mission. 
As the probe flies 2,200 miles (3,540 km) above Thule's surface, scientists hope it will detect the chemical composition of its atmosphere and terrain in what NASA says will be the closest observation of a body so remote. 
""We are straining the capabilities of this spacecraft, and by tomorrow we'll know how we did,"" Stern told reporters on Monday. ""There are no second chances for New Horizons.""

While the mission marks the farthest close encounter of an object within our solar system, NASA's Voyager 1 and 2, a pair of deep-space probes launched in 1977, have reached greater distances on a mission to survey extrasolar bodies. Both probes are still operational.

IRNA said on Thursday President Hassan Rouhani accepted the resignation of Hassan Ghazizadeh Hashemi, widely seen as the key official behind the 2014 launch of an ambitious plan for universal medical insurance sometimes dubbed ""Rouhanicare"".
Hashemi had repeatedly complained about delays in payments of budgeted funds in the past and about cuts in his ministry's budget under the new state spending plans, IRNA said. 
U.S. President Donald Trump reintroduced sanctions on Iran last year, targeting in particular the country's lifeblood oil sector, after pulling out of a 2015 nuclear deal. The move has helped depress the value of Iran's rial currency and aggravated annual inflation fourfold to nearly 40 percent in November.
Last month, Rouhani presented a $47 billion draft state budget with increased spending on lower income groups, saying the U.S. sanctions would affect people's lives and economic growth but not bring the government to its knees.
Despite the rise in the rial value of the budget, however, it is effectively worth about half of the current budget because of the recent weakening of the currency and galloping inflation.
In recent months, various Iranian cities have been rocked by demonstrations as factory workers, teachers, truck drivers and farmers protested against economic hardship and corruption.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean diplomat who was until recently acting ambassador to Italy has gone missing, a South Korean member of parliament said on Thursday, after a South Korean newspaper reported he was seeking asylum in the West. 
The diplomat, Jo Song Gil, disappeared with his wife after leaving the embassy without notice in early November, according to Kim Min-ki, a South Korean lawmaker who was briefed by the National Intelligence Service. 
Earlier on Thursday, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, citing an unidentified diplomatic source, said Jo, 48, had applied for asylum to an unspecified Western country and was in a ""safe place"" with his family under the protection of the Italian government.
A senior diplomatic source in Rome said Italy's foreign ministry knew nothing about the reports. A second diplomatic source said the ministry had no record of Jo seeking asylum in Italy. The source added that North Korea had announced in late 2018 that it was sending a new envoy to Rome.
""It was a perfectly normal procedure,"" the source said.
Kim told reporters he had some information about the case but could not discuss it.
""They left the diplomatic mission and vanished,"" Kim said, referring to Jo and his family.
DEFECTIONS
If confirmed, Jo would join a slowly growing list of senior diplomats who have sought to flee the impoverished, oppressive North under the rule of Kim Jong Un. 
Thae Yong Ho, the North's then deputy ambassador to Britain, defected with his family to South Korea in August 2016, becoming the highest-ranking diplomat to do so. 
Jo took up the acting envoy post in October 2017 after Italy expelled then-ambassador Mun Jong Nam in protest over North Korea's nuclear and long-range missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions. 
Jo's stint began in May 2015 and was due at the end of November, lawmaker Kim said. 
A source familiar with the matter, who asked to remain unnamed in order to speak about a sensitive political issue, told Reuters that Jo was officially replaced as acting ambassador by Kim Chon in late November. 
The source could not confirm the JoongAng Ilbo report or whether Jo was still based in Italy. 
South Korea's presidential Blue House said earlier on Thursday it had no knowledge of the matter.
Italy said in a report it submitted to a U.N. panel monitoring the enforcement of sanctions in November 2017 that four diplomats were stationed at the North Korean embassy there, listing the acting envoy as first secretary.
The JoongAng Ilbo said Jo was with his wife and children. Citing an unidentified expert, it said he was known to be the son or son-in-law of a top-ranking North Korean official. 
North Korea forced diplomats stationed overseas to leave children at home after Kim took power in late 2011. 
Thae, the former deputy ambassador to Britain, said in his 2018 memoir that was the main reason behind his defection, calling it a ""hostage"" scheme.

However, Thae also wrote there were some exceptions for those from the top echelons and who were seen as the most loyal to Kim.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>",Macron's spin doctor to leave Elysee as yellow-vest protests simmer,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron's head of media relations said on Thursday he would quit, a sign that a grueling reform drive and a spate of political scandal and street protests are starting to wear down his inner circle a year and a half into his mandate.
Sylvain Fort, who shaped Macron's campaign messaging during his presidential campaign and penned some of the young leader's most memorable speeches, will leave the Elysee palace for ""personal reasons"", government ministers said. 
""After two years and a half of relentless work serving the candidate and later our president, I wish to pursue other professional and personal projects, and above all dedicate more time to my family,"" Fort told French news agency AFP.
His resignation follows the departure of Macron's political adviser late last year to lead the ruling party's European parliament election campaign. Rumors are swirling in French media of other close advisers who may head out the door. 
Privately, aides say the pace of reforms, Macron's own hyperactivity, his frequent foreign trips and a relentless news cycle are taking their toll on even the most committed of his loyalists.
Fort, an opera buff and literature graduate from the elite ENS school, preferred the more reclusive role of chief speechwriter after Macron's election victory in May 2017. 
Macron persuaded Fort to return to a front-line media relations role last summer after the violent conduct of Macron's former bodyguard and the Elysee's attempted cover-up of the matter sent his popularity into a nosedive and raised questions about decision-making inside the president's office.
Surrounded by a small coterie of close aides dubbed the ""Macron boys"", the 41-year-old pushed through a series of reforms to liberalize the economy and cut taxes in his first 15 months in office. 
But popular perceptions of an arrogant president whose monarchical style leaves him detached from the daily realities of most French people triggered street unrest in late 2018. The so-called ""yellow vest"" protests forced tax concessions and cast doubt over Macron's ability to see through his reform agenda. 
He wants to adopt stricter rules for unemployment benefits, merge varying pension plans into a single system, and create a leaner public sector - all prickly subjects that could give a new lease of life to the ""yellow vests"".
In his New Year message, Macron, whose popularity rating is at a record low, was unrepentant as he promised to press on. 

""In recent years, we've engaged in a blatant denial of reality,"" he said. ""We can't work less, earn more, cut taxes and increase spending.""

GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - India on Thursday deported a Rohingya Muslim family of five to neighboring Myanmar, the second such group expelled in four months during a crackdown on illegal immigrants.
India's Hindu nationalist government regards the Rohingya as illegal aliens and a security risk. It has ordered that tens of thousands of the community, who live in small settlements and slums, be identified and repatriated.
The husband, wife and three children had been arrested and jailed in northeastern Assam state in 2014 for entering India without valid documents, police said.
""The five Rohingya have been handed over to Myanmar officials and they crossed the border,"" Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta, Assam's additional director general of police, told Reuters.
A Reuters picture from the India-Myanmar border showed the family members posing, with security officials of both countries standing behind them.
Jails in Assam held 20 more Myanmar nationals, all arrested for illegal entry, he added. But it was not immediately clear if all were Rohingya, a largely stateless Muslim minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.
""We shall send them back to Myanmar once we get their travel permits from that country,"" Mahanta said. ""Most of them sneaked into India in search of a livelihood.""
India's first deportation of seven Rohingya men to Myanmar in October sparked fears of further repatriations among those sheltering in its refugee camps, and concern that those returned faced the risk of abuse at the hands of Myanmar authorities.
The men returned to their villages in a relatively untroubled area of Kyauktaw in the northern Rakhine state. They have been given so-called National Verification Cards, a residency document that conveys a status short of citizenship.
India's Border Security Force arrested 230 Rohingya last year until end-November, the highest number of detentions in at least four full years, the Ministry of Home Affairs told parliament on Tuesday.
India estimates that 40,000 Rohingya live in the country in camps across the country, including the capital, New Delhi, having arrived over the years after fleeing violence and persecution in Myanmar, which denies them citizenship.
In August, a U.N. report accused the Myanmar military of mass killings and rapes of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" in 2017 in an operation that drove more than 700,000 of them to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies.

Myanmar has denied the charges, saying its military launched a counter-insurgency operation after attacks on security posts by Muslim militants in August last year.

Beijing Daxing International Airport, due to open in September, will accommodate 72 million passengers a year by 2025 and is expected to become one of the world's busiest airports upon completion. 
This will be the city's second such facility and help relieve pressure on Beijing Capital International Airport, whose annual capacity has reached 100 million passengers.
Foreign airlines, along with those in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, can choose which airport they want to operate in, with the option of having a presence in both. Chinese carriers, except China Postal Airlines, will have to use only one airport, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). 
China initially planned to relocate airlines from the SkyTeam alliance to the new airport, while Star Alliance airlines would stay at the existing Beijing airport.
Airlines including China Southern (NYSE:SO), China Eastern, Beijing Capital Airlines and China United Airlines will be relocated to Beijing Daqing International Airport, while carriers such as Air China, Hainan Airlines and Grand China Air will stay at Beijing Capital International Airport. 
Relocation will last from the winter of 2019 to the winter of 2021, the CAAC said.

Authorities in Beijing had previously said the two men, Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and an adviser with the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank, and businessman Michael Spavor, were suspected of endangering state security. 
""Without a doubt, these two Canadian citizens in China violated our country's laws and regulations, and are currently undergoing investigation according to procedure,"" Zhang Jun, China's prosecutor general, said.
Zhang said the investigation process had been handled ""strictly"" according to law when asked by Reuters at a briefing when the two men might be charged. He did not elaborate.
The two were detained after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on Dec. 1 in Vancouver, at the request of the United States.
U.S. prosecutors have accused her of misleading banks about transactions linked to Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating sanctions.
The Chinese government has only given vague details about the detention of the two Canadians, and it has not drawn a direct link to Meng's arrest. It has demanded that Canada free her and threatened unspecified consequences if it does not.
Canada has said several times it saw no explicit link between the arrest of Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, and the detentions of Kovrig and Spavor.
But Beijing-based Western diplomats and former Canadian diplomats have said they have no doubt the cases are linked. 
Canada has said the detentions are unacceptable and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said China should free the men.
Under Chinese criminal procedure law, special forms of detention and interrogation can be used for state security suspects. 
China touts the rule of law, but its judicial system is tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party. 

Rights groups say conditions in Chinese detention facilities are often basic and can be harsh, with lack of legal representation and due process compounding worries about treatment.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 05:41AM ET</span>",Special Report: How a soccer agent and Chinese tycoon planned to trade in players,"By Tom Bergin and Cassell Bryan-Low
LONDON (Reuters) - In early 2016, Europe's most powerful soccer agent, Jorge Mendes, stood dressed in his trademark dark suit and white shirt alongside Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang at a luxury hotel in Shanghai. They were there to launch a new partnership in front of an audience of soccer glitterati, including former Chelsea and Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho and bosses from major European clubs.
Mendes and Guo, co-founder of a Chinese investment group called Fosun, announced they would create an agency to expand soccer in China and help players build careers. But that was only part of the plan.
What Mendes and Guo didn't publicly reveal then, or since, was that they also envisaged creating a network of clubs and soccer academies in Europe and buying and selling players, emails and internal presentations related to the deal show. Such a network would enable the partners to sidestep a ban on investors buying stakes in players and trading them. With the help of top agents like Mendes, such trading could capture profits that might otherwise go to assist smaller clubs.
Trading and representing players, Fosun believed, according to an internal presentation from 2015, was the only sustainably profitable part of the soccer industry.
The Fosun group, which encompasses a range of entities controlled by Guo and his two co-founders, is worth more than $10 billion and has assets ranging from the Club Med holiday group to prime New York property. In 2016 it set out bold ambitions in soccer. In August that year, an analyst working for Fosun emailed Mendes' business partner, Luis Correia, saying: ""Our goal is to build a complete system in global football world with you, with different levels of clubs and training facilities ... I believe together we can establish our strong presence in every major league.""
One aim was to create a network for identifying players who could later be sold on for profit, Fosun presentations and emails show. A 2016 email from a Fosun executive described investing and trading in players as ""the most lucrative part of business in the football industry.""
Fosun, Guo, Mendes, and Correia did not respond to requests for comment.
The insight into the ambitions of Guo, Fosun and 52-year-old Mendes comes from ""Football Leaks,"" a cache of emails, contracts and other documents relating to several football organizations that were obtained by the German publication Der Spiegel and reviewed by Reuters in partnership with European Investigative Collaborations, a media consortium.
The documents reviewed by Reuters run to mid-2017. It's unclear to what extent Fosun and Mendes have advanced their partnership since then.
Trading in talent is often more profitable than owning soccer clubs, say academics who study the sport. But it is also a business model that some fans, officials and club owners criticize and oppose. They say it diverts money to agents and financial investors that would otherwise go to clubs and help sustain the vibrant competition that fans pay to see.
Ivo Belet, a Belgian member of the European parliament who has taken a close interest in football governance, said the relationship between agents and clubs is a ""big threat to football in Europe and it should be looked into more carefully.""
The integrity of competition in the sport is at risk when there are multiple connections between players, agents and owners of teams, he said, and the EU needs to ""keep putting pressure"" on football authorities to increase transparency in the game.
""Those relationships ... they are all big threats to the integrity of our football,"" he said.
Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University in England, expressed concern about the financial effects of close relations between clubs, agents and investors. ""If there is leakage (of money) from the sport, then you potentially have an impact upon the lower reaches of football, into grassroots football,"" he said.
Soccer governing bodies say the transfer of players between clubs should be about strengthening competition and helping teams to win trophies, and not about generating profits for financial investors.
""Football is an entertainment business and should not be a financial business,"" said Didier Quillot, chief executive of France's governing body, Ligue de Football Professionnel. Speaking about the game in general, he added that it was important to avoid an ""excess of player trading.""
ENORMOUS POTENTIAL
Mendes started out as a soccer player but shifted focus to business after he didn't make the big time, running a video rental store and a nightclub in northwestern Portugal. At the nightclub, he met a goalkeeper called Nuno Espirito Santo and negotiated his transfer to a bigger team in 1996. For Mendes, a new career as a soccer agent beckoned.
He founded an agency called Gestifute, and Correia, who is his nephew, became a partner. In the early 2000s, Mendes began representing manager Jose Mourinho and striker Cristiano Ronaldo, who went on to be among the biggest stars of their generation. Mendes never looked back: At the 2017 Globe Soccer Awards he was voted Best Agent in the World for the sixth time.
Players are bought and sold by clubs. If someone other than a club has a share in the ""economic rights"" of a player, this is known as ""third-party ownership."" Newspapers in Portugal and Britain have reported over the past two decades that Gestifute had stakes in around a dozen prominent players. Mendes has not publicly gone into any detail about the matter.
But the documents seen by Reuters show Mendes' third-party ownership went much further than previously thought. His agency came to hold stakes in more than 50 top players by late 2015, according to a signed contract between Fosun and Gestifute.
By holding stakes in players, Mendes stood to increase his influence and to gain when those players were bought and sold by clubs. In July 2014, for example, Mendes' company Gestifute bought a 40 percent stake in a young player called Diogo Jota from Pacos de Ferreira, a soccer team of modest means based near Porto in Portugal. The player, then 17, was beginning his professional career and Gestifute acquired its stake for just 35,000 euros, according to the sale contract.
Jota became a rising star and in March 2016 Atletico Madrid, one of the top Spanish clubs, bought him for about 6.4 million euros. Gestifute's stake entitled it to about 2.5 million euros of the proceeds, according to emails and an invoice. Another agent was entitled to another 20 percent of the transfer proceeds, the emails show, leaving Pacos de Ferreira with only 40 percent of the profit on the player.
Pacos de Ferreira said the Jota deal was a ""closed matter,"" and that it believed it got the best price possible in the conditions prevailing at the time. Jota did not respond to a request for comment sent to him via his current club; Atletico Madrid did not respond to a request for comment.
Among those who saw the advantages of Mendes and his connections was China's Fosun. In October 2014, it approached him and suggested a partnership, with the idea that Fosun would provide capital and Mendes would select football projects in which the two could co-invest, according to emails.
Mendes' nephew Correia appeared excited at the prospect. ""The potential is enormous, in my opinion,"" he wrote in an email to Mendes on Oct. 31, 2014.
An internal Fosun presentation circulated between executives in November 2014 outlined the company's plans. A slide titled ""build a comprehensive football business empire"" showed an organization chart split between a ""Non-China"" business and a ""China entity"". The non-China business would include Gestifute, where the activity was described as ""Share economic rights of football players.""
As the two sides discussed a tie-up, Fosun was effusive in its admiration for Mendes. A September 2015 internal presentation in Chinese prepared by a Fosun analyst outlined the strength of the agent's business model. ""Mendes has surpassed the business influence of ordinary football agents. He has actually indirectly controlled many clubs in major European leagues on the strength of dependence from clubs and players on his ability to make deals,"" the presentation said. ""This has made him able to place his coaches and players in these clubs, thus achieving full closed-loop control of the player's career and strong long-term influence on the clubs by providing full service to the players.""
Another Fosun presentation a month later said that, with many clubs struggling to break even, operations like Mendes' were the only ones ""that can enjoy sustained profitability in the industry chain.""
Mendes' holding company, Start SGPS, had a net income of 25.1 million euros in 2015, emails show. That was more than all but 10 European soccer clubs, according to data compiled by governing body UEFA.
Mendes did not respond to requests for comment on the Fosun assessment.
In September 2015, Fosun's board agreed to buy 15 percent of Start SGPS, which owns Gestifute and other Mendes interests. Guo and his partners agreed to pay about 42 million euros ($48 million) for the stake, valuing the group at almost 280 million euros, and obtained the right to raise its holding to 37.5 percent over time.
""Bingo!!!!!!!!,"" Correia wrote in an email to Mendes and Carlos Osorio de Castro, a Gestifute lawyer and holding company director, when he heard Fosun had agreed to proceed with the deal.
According to the contract selling the Gestifute stake to entities controlled by Fosun's founders, Mendes' agency had acquired stakes in 54 players by November 2015. They included Diogo Jota, star goalkeeper Ederson Moraes, and defensive midfielder ""Fabinho"" Tavares, who recently joined English club Liverpool FC.
Moraes did not respond to questions sent to him via his club Manchester City; the club said it would not provide any comment. Tavares did not respond to a request for comment sent via his club.
At the time of the Fosun-Gestifute deal, Mendes publicly talked about the partners' ambitions in China, not Europe. ""I am more than honored to be a part of this project and to be able to help Chinese football become a new world power,"" Mendes said in a news release at the time of the deal.
Mendes and Gestifute did not respond to requests for comment on the Fosun tie-up or ownership of players' economic rights. De Castro declined to comment, saying that the content of Reuters questions was ""blatantly based on information obtained through a criminal hacking attack on privileged data.""
THIRD-PARTY BAN
But there was a problem for the Mendes business model and Fosun's grand vision. In 2012, Europe's governing body for soccer, UEFA, had said third-party ownership potentially distorted competition and took money out of the sport; and in May 2015, FIFA, soccer's global governing body, imposed a new rule intended to end the practice. It allowed existing contracts to run their course but barred clubs and players from entering new third-party ownership contracts.
There is no public register of third-party ownership, making it impossible to know how prevalent the practice was or is; and the influence of third-party owners can also be subtle. Some pre-2015 contracts stipulated that a club buy out a third-party owner if the club declined another club's lucrative bid for a player, according to emails reviewed by Reuters. Such arrangements could effectively force a club to sell a player it wished to keep, say some experts.
Officials believed that only players and clubs should influence where and when a player moved between clubs. And players' representative organizations, including FIFPro World Players' Union, said third-party ownership by agents, or similar arrangements, created incentives for the agents to steer young players towards accepting transfers that were in the best interests of the agent, not the player.
Some club owners and football officials also felt that financial investors took profits out of the game to the detriment of smaller clubs, which often rely on windfalls from the sale of rising stars like Jota to fund their development of young hopefuls, often from pre-teen ages.
Mendes opposed FIFA's ban, saying third-party ownership spread the cost of players and helped smaller clubs to afford better players. The ban was ""killing the competition, killing it,"" he told Reuters in an interview in January 2015.
Either way, the ban did little to hamper Fosun's ambitions. FIFA had stopped third-party investors. But there was nothing to prevent Fosun from buying a soccer club, which could freely own players' economic rights without Fosun breaching the ban on third-party ownership.
Initially, Fosun considered buying Espanyol, a club in Spain, and clubs in Portugal and Italy. Emails show that Fosun wanted Mendes' advice on these potential deals and proposed that Mendes either manage or invest in Espanyol. None of the prospects went ahead; Reuters could not determine why. Espanyol did not respond to a request for comment.
Still, Fosun remained keen to work with Mendes. ""If Fosun does any deal with a football club it's only for the future benefit of our alliance,"" wrote Jeff Shi, head of Fosun's media division, in an email to Correia in August 2015.
BUYING WOLVES
Fosun toyed with buying another Portuguese club and an English club, emails show. Again, no deals materialized. Then in May 2016, Correia emailed Shi to inform him about an English club called Wolverhampton Wanderers, which was on the market for about 40 million pounds. ""Wolves,"" as the club is popularly known, was struggling financially and on the soccer field. ""It's worth taking a look at,"" Correia said, attaching some details about the club, which is based in the Midlands city of Wolverhampton.
Within a month, Fosun had decided to buy Wolves, emails show, and Mendes remained important to its plans.
Ahead of a meeting between Mendes and Fosun co-founder and President Wang Qunbin, Shi wrote to Correia: ""Mr. Wang will be very keen to learn from Jorge about how to run a club very well and promote it to Premier League. And you always know the reason for the investment of Wolves is mainly because of our bet and trust on Jorge.""
In return for his guidance, Fosun promised Mendes significant reward. ""Jorge can take Wolves as the most reliable partner and agency revenue source for long long time,"" Shi wrote.
Fosun, Wang and the club did not respond to requests for comment on the strategy for Wolves.
Between Fosun's decision to buy the club in 2016 and February 2018, Wolves spent more than 65 million pounds buying players, its published accounts show. In some cases, the players purchased were represented by Mendes or he helped arrange the deals, the club has said in statements. Full details of the transfers are not publicly available, so Reuters could not determine the extent of Mendes' involvement.
The club also appointed as manager Nuno Espirito Santo, the former goalkeeper who had helped to launch Mendes' career as an agent.
The signings helped propel Wolves into the Premier League, the top rung of English soccer, last August. They also attracted criticism from several rivals. In March 2018, the owner of Leeds United Football Club, Andrea Radrizzani, said on Twitter and in a media interview that Wolves had an unfair advantage. He said Mendes' relations with top players and clubs allowed Wolves to buy talent not available to clubs that did not have strong ties with him. Officials at Aston Villa Football Club also questioned how Wolves could attract such high-quality signings.
Leeds said Radrizzani did not wish to comment for this article, and Aston Villa did not respond to a request for comment. Mendes and Espirito Santo did not respond to requests to comment.
Executives at Wolves have previously acknowledged that Mendes was an adviser but downplayed the links. ""Jorge is an agent just like any other,"" Wolves' sporting director Kevin Thelwell told reporters in June 2018. Wolves did not respond to Reuters requests for comment about the role of Mendes at the club.
In an interview with the Wolverhampton Express and Star newspaper in March 2018, Fosun executive Shi, who had been appointed executive chairman of Wolves in 2017, said rivals' criticism of Wolves' relationship with Mendes was ""laughable."" He said the English Football League and Football Association knew all about Wolves' deals and transfers.
In April, the English Football League said it had examined Mendes' relationship with the club and found it was not a breach of its rules forbidding an agent from having an executive role at a club or controlling its strategy. It said in a statement at the time that Mendes ""holds no role at the club.""
In response to questions from Reuters, the EFL referred to its statement from April 2018. The FA said it had strict regulations on intermediaries and had obtained information from Wolves regarding its compliance with those rules.
PROFIT SHARE
After acquiring Wolves, Fosun and Mendes pressed ahead with their broader plans to create a network from soccer training academies to clubs, according to emails.
On Aug. 16, 2016, Yang Zhang, then a business analyst for Fosun, sent Correia an email with the subject line ""Portugal Football Opportunities."" Fosun wished to press for a deal to buy a club called Rio Ave and pursue a partnership with a training academy. Zhang also wrote that Fosun wanted to buy a ""TPO club"" – apparently a reference to third-party ownership. Such a combination of assets would give Fosun and Mendes platforms for training, holding and trading players of different levels and ages - without being in breach of rules on third-party ownership because clubs are freely allowed to invest in players.
""Portugal is the perfect place to start with less regulation, larger talent pool, and your help,"" Zhang wrote.
However, Shi said in an April 2017 email to Gestifute's Correia that Chinese government restrictions on companies making overseas acquisitions, which were tightened in late 2016 and 2017, were complicating Fosun's plans to buy Rio Ave. It isn't clear where those plans stand. Rio Ave didn't respond to a request seeking comment.
Meanwhile, Wolves, just two years after being bought by Fosun, ascended to the top tier of English soccer. The team relies heavily on players from Mendes' home country. When it took to the field for the first time in the Premier League in August, five of the 11-man team were Portuguese.

Wolves did not respond when asked how many of those players were clients of Mendes.

Settlers had set up two caravans at the Amona outpost last month, in what they described as a protest against a recent surge in Palestinian attacks in the West Bank.
Two years ago, Amona's 300 settlers were removed by police after the Supreme Court ruled it had been built illegally and without Israeli government authorization on privately-owned Palestinian land in 1995.
Police said that in Thursday's operation, which lasted several hours, at least 23 officers were injured by stones thrown by the settlers, many of them teenagers, or in scuffles, and were taken to hospital for treatment.
Israeli media reports said at least three settlers were also hurt. At least seven people were arrested for attacking officers, police said.
The evacuation was carried out after the Jerusalem District Court on Wednesday denied the settlers' petition against eviction.
Most countries consider all Israeli settlements on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war to be illegal. Israel disputes this, and last week Israeli authorities issued approvals for more than 2,000 settler homes in the West Bank.
Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which was also captured by Israel in the 1967 conflict. The two areas are home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians.

While Israel’s settlement projects have regularly drawn condemnation from the Palestinians and in Europe, the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump has taken a largely uncritical public stand.

Boko Haram has attacked Niger, Chad and Cameroon from its base in northeast Nigeria, where it has been fighting for more than nine years to carve out an Islamist caliphate. 
Niger's defense ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that the army mounted a sweep operation against the group last Friday along the southeastern Komadugu river, which separates Niger from Nigeria.
More than 200 militants were ""neutralized"" by air strikes and 87 were killed by Nigerien troops on the ground, it said.
In June 2016, more than 30 Nigerien soldiers were killed during a Boko Haram attack on the town of Bosso, prompting Chad to send 2,000 troops to help its West African neighbor counter the militants. 
Those troops were withdrawn in October 2017, raising concern about security in the Diffa region.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the government to list the steps it plans for the rescue of at least 15 miners trapped in a so-called ""rat-hole"" coal mine for three weeks in a remote hilly state, warning that ""every second counts"".
The workers were ensnared on Dec. 13 when the illegal mine in the northeastern state of Meghalaya was flooded. Rescuers have so far only been able to find three helmets and two axes underground.
The country's top court wondered why attempts to reach the miners had not yet been successful.
""Tell us by tomorrow, because for people who are trapped, every second counts,"" Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri told the federal government, represented by Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta.
The Meghalaya government told the court that nearly 86 people were working on the rescue effort since Dec. 14, including employees of state-controlled Coal India Ltd, the world's biggest miner of the fuel.
Kyrmen Shylla, Meghalaya's disaster management minister, told Reuters both government and private agencies had been involved in the bid to reach the miners, many of whose family members have given up hope.
Rat-hole mining has killed thousands of workers in Meghalaya, including children, before India's environmental court banned the practice in early 2014.
At its peak, the state produced coal worth $4 billion a year, or about a tenth of India's total production.
Despite the ban, many mines continued operation https://in.reuters.com/article/india-coal-meghalaya-mines/meghalaya-cm-pushes-for-coal-mining-critics-say-hes-helping-wife-idINKCN0SM0N220151028, requiring workers, often children, to descend hundreds of feet on bamboo ladders and dig coal out of narrow, horizontal seams.
The unsuccessful rescue bid has drawn criticism of a lack of urgency shown by government agencies, particularly given the remote location of the mine, a journey to which can take more than five hours from the nearest commercial airport in Guwahati.
""Would we have cared more if the miners had not been at the fringes of national consciousness in the northeast?"" senior journalist Vir Sanghvi asked on Twitter.

""I have not given up hope, but our response to this crisis shames us as a nation.""

Ahmad Shah, who worked for the BBC's Pashto language service as well as for Reuters, was killed by unidentified gunmen while he was on his way home last April. The BBC said Shah was its fifth staff member to have been killed in Afghanistan since the early 1990s. 
The Special Anti-Terrorism Tribunal sentenced one of the convicted men to death and the others were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment. The case has been now been sent to a higher court to validate the tribunal's ruling, Jamshid Rasouly, a spokesman for the attorney general's office said.
As defense lawyers were not immediately available for comment, it was unknown whether they would challenge the verdict or seek a fresh trial in the higher court.
The Taliban denied having any role in Shah's killing.
He died on the same day that two bombs in Kabul killed 26 people, of whom nine were journalists and photographers, making it the deadliest day for media workers in Afghanistan.
The Islamic State(IS), a hardline militant Islamic group claimed responsibility for the bomb attacks.

KOCHI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Conservative Hindu groups forced India's southern state of Kerala to a standstill on Thursday as they protested against the state government for allowing two women to defy an ancient ban and enter a Hindu temple.
About 400 protesters, including some women, took to the streets of Kochi, the commercial capital of Kerala, in the early morning, backed by officials from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the BJP.
Many stores and other small businesses were shut after the Hindu groups called for a state-wide stoppage. Most bus services were halted and taxis were refusing to take passengers as some drivers said they feared they would be attacked.
The state's Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan,
told reporters that women were the target of some attacks by protesters, including women journalists covering the events.
India's Supreme Court in September ordered the lifting of the ban on women of menstruating age entering the Sabarimala hill temple, which draws millions of worshippers a year.
The temple has refused to abide by the ruling and subsequent attempts by women to visit have been blocked by thousands of devotees.
In the early hours of Wednesday, two women were escorted by police into the temple through a side gate without being spotted by devotees guarding the temple.
The women offered prayers from the back of the crowd from the top of a staircase where they could see the deity below without drawing the attention of the priest or other devotees, a police official familiar with the operation said. 
He did not wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. 
""Surprise was the biggest element here,"" the official said.
BUSES DAMAGED
Protests erupted soon afterwards. A woman police constable was attacked and molested by five protesters in one of the districts near Kochi on Wednesday, while a protester was pelted with stones and killed in a southern district of the state, police said.
On Thursday, protesters were seen marching towards the main city junction to stage a sit-in protest, shouting slogans and waving flags, with streets deserted. 
The protests remained largely peaceful on Thursday, Vijay Sakhare, Inspector General of Police Kochi Range, told Reuters. 
""We arrested more than 600 people on Wednesday from Kochi and four other adjoining districts and took nearly 300 into preventive custody,"" Sakhare said, adding that police were ready to offer protection to those who wanted to conduct routine business on Thursday.
""Some protesters may turn violent such as stone-throwing or blocking roads and we are armed with riot gear and have teargas and water cannons,"" he said.
In several places protesters damaged state transport buses, V.P. Pramod Kumar, deputy director, public relations, state police headquarters, told Reuters.
The Kerala state government is run by left-wing parties and has sought to allow women into the temple - a position that has drawn criticism from both of India's main political parties, the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress.
DEFIANCE BY STEALTH
The two women, Bindu Ammini, 42, and Kanaka Durga, 44, had approached the state police to find a way to enter the temple after a failed attempt on Dec. 24. 
As a result, officials from the state government and the police conducted a few rounds of reconnaissance to identify the side entrance, and to decide on the appropriate timing and transport, the police official said.
For more than a week before Wednesday's visit, the women were under police protection at an undisclosed location, unknown even to their families, to prevent the plan from leaking out, he said.
In the early hours of Wednesday, the police took the two women to the hill temple inside an ambulance to avoid attention. Medical services are frequently used outside the temple because the elderly who go on the trek often face discomfort, the official said.
After offering prayers, the women merged with the crowd and headed to the exit, accompanied by four police in plain clothes, the police official said.

""Every minute, about 100 devotees throng to the sanctum sanctorum and there was no way the priest would have noticed these two,"" he said.

With less than three months until Brexit lawmakers will make a pivotal decision later this month: accept May's plans for a managed exit and relatively close economic ties, or reject the deal and spawn huge uncertainty about the country's next steps. 
""No deal will be far more likely if MPs (Members of Parliament) reject the government's Brexit deal later this month,"" Barclay wrote in the Daily Express newspaper, arguing that May's plan was the only ""workable deal"" available.
May is seeking extra reassurances from Brussels to help persuade skeptical lawmakers within her own party, and the small Northern Irish party that props up her minority government, to back her plan. The vote is due in the week beginning Jan. 14.
Barclay, whose primary remit is to make sure Britain is ready in case a deal cannot be reached, said that next week the government would step up its campaign to make sure citizens are prepared for such an outcome.
""On Tuesday we will start a new phase in our public information campaign, using radio and social media to further raise awareness about the need to prepare,"" he wrote.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Opposition members of Bangladesh's parliament boycotted a swearing-in ceremony on Thursday, after rejecting results of a general election that they said was rigged to give Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina her third straight term.
Hasina's ruling alliance won more than 90 percent of the seats contested in Sunday's election, which was marred by accusations of ballot stuffing, voter intimidation and violence that killed at least 17 people. 
Hasina and her ruling Awami League party have dismissed the accusations.
While newly elected members of parliament from the ruling bloc, including Hasina, were sworn in, the seven opposition members stayed away.
""We have not taken a final decision yet on whether we'll take the oath or not,"" said a senior leader of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), declining to be identified ahead of a formal party decision.
They must take their oath within three months or forfeit their seats.
Hasina has denied any election impropriety, calling it a peaceful vote that saw enthusiastic participation.
The Election Commission has rejected an opposition call for a new vote, but despite that, the opposition alliance has said it will submit a new demand for a re-run of the vote.
BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam told Reuters on Wednesday he was collecting reports of rigging to submit to the commission to back up the call for a new vote.
The BNP, which boycotted the previous election, in 2014, has been hobbled by the absence of its leader, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, 74, who was jailed in February on corruption charges her party says were politically motivated.
The party has asked the government for permission to meet Khaleda.
Western governments, including the United States and the European Union, have condemned the election-day violence and called for investigation of a range of irregularities. 
On Thursday, New York-based Human Rights Watch said the run-up to the vote was characterized by ""violence and intimidation against the opposition ... and the misuse of laws to limit free speech"".
It called for an independent and impartial investigation of the accusations of electoral abuses.
""Reports of ballot stuffing, intimidation of voters, and ruling party control of voting locations on election day mean that an independent and impartial commission should be formed to determine the extent of the violations,"" Brad Adams, Asia director at the rights group, said in a statement.
Hasina, whose father, state founder Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated in a coup in 1975, has alternated in and out of power for nearly three decades with her main rival, Khaleda.

Khaleda was first lady when her husband, Ziaur Rahman, was president from 1977 until he was assassinated in 1981.

The crash, the world’s first of a  Boeing Co  737 MAX jet and the deadliest of 2018, killed all 189 people on board. 
Contact with flight JT610 was lost 13 minutes after it took off from the capital Jakarta heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang.
The main wreckage and cockpit voice recorder, one of two so-called black boxes, were not recovered in an initial search. 
Lion Air said in December that it was funding a 38 billion rupiah ($2.6 million) search using the offshore supply ship MPV Everest in what was seen as a rare test of global norms regarding search independence, as such costs are typically paid by governments.
Danang Mandala, the spokesman for Lion Air Group, told Reuters that the search using the ship had ended on Saturday. 
A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Commission (KNKT), however, said on Thursday the agency would to start its own search for the black box as soon as feasible.
The CVR is likely to hold vital clues that could give investigators insight into the actions of the pilots.
The KNKT spokesman said negotiations with the Indonesian navy were under way to use a navy ship to relaunch the search for the second black box as soon as possible.
""It might be as soon as next week. It won't be as fancy as the (Lion-subsidized) MPV Everest but will be equipped with a CVR detector and we already have a remote-operated vehicle,"" the spokesman said.
The clock is ticking in the hunt for acoustic pings coming from the L3 Technologies Inc cockpit voice recorder fitted to the jet. It has a 90-day beacon, the manufacturer’s online brochure shows.
The family of the Indonesian co-pilot of the flight filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Friday against Boeing in Chicago, adding to litigation piling up against the manufacturer in its hometown. [L1N1YX156]
A preliminary report by KNKT focused on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but did not give a cause for the crash.
The lawsuit alleges that the Lion Air-operated Boeing 737 MAX 8 was unreasonably dangerous because its sensors provided inconsistent information to both the pilots and the aircraft.
At least two other lawsuits have been filed against Boeing in Chicago by the victims.
The families of victims were not immediately reachable for comment.

(Reuters) - Arm teachers, spend more on school security and mental health and train police to be more aggressive when responding to school shootings -- those are some of the recommendations in a report into the deadliest U.S. high school shooting released Wednesday.
The 485-page report into the Parkland, Florida school massacre, that left 14 students and three adults dead at the hands of a lone gunman in February 2018, will be studied by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Governor-elect Ron DeSantis and a state commission charged with finding ways to prevent another school shooting massacre.
The report, by the state-appointed Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, finds a cascade of errors from law enforcement officers holding back as shots were fired and lax school security that allowed a former student with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle access to the campus.
The Parkland shooting has sparked a national debate about school security, gun-rights, and fueled a student-led movement calling for more gun-control, called Never Again MSD, after the school's initials.
Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, chairman of the school safety commission, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that there needs to be a sense of urgency in implementing change in school security.
""When you send your kids to school in the morning, there's an expectation they're going to come home alive in the afternoon,"" Gualtieri told the newspaper.
He also said he strongly supported the idea of arming some gun-trained teachers.
But not everyone on the 16-member commission agreed with all of its findings. 
Commission member Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was killed at Stoneman Douglas, told the Sun Sentinel that she opposes the idea of arming teachers.
""Teachers want to teach,"" she told the newspaper. ""That's their expertise. Law enforcement, their expertise is supposed to be to engage the threat.""
The report was critical of a perceived slow response from law enforcement officers who waited outside the school buildings while shots were still being fired.
Other recommendations included more funding for mental health services for students, creating safe areas at schools where students can hide from a potential gunman, locking school perimeter gates while school is in session and requiring law enforcement officers to immediately seek out a shooter instead of hanging back.
The report acknowledges that more money is needed to implement the recommendations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had received a ""great"" letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and would probably meet him again in the not-too-distant future as part of efforts to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons.
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump defended stuttering U.S. negotiations with Kim, saying that if it had not been for his administration ""you'd be having a nice big fat war in Asia."" He reiterated that there was no hurry.
""I'm not in any rush. I don't have to rush. All I know is there's no rockets, there’s no testing,"" he said, referring to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests that have been halted since the second half of 2017.
Trump said he had watched coverage of Kim's New Year speech on the U.S. Public Broadcasting Service.
""They said that in Chairman Kim’s speech he really wants to get together, he wants to denuclearize and a lot of good things are happening,"" Trump said.
""They really do want to do something. Now, does that mean it’s going to be done? Who knows? A deal's a deal, you never know, but I tell you, we've established a very good relationship with North Korea.""
""We'll probably now have another meeting. He'd like to meet, I'd like to meet,"" Trump said. ""We'll set that up, we'll be setting that up in the not-too-distant future.""
Kim vowed to work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula when he met Trump for the first time at a summit in Singapore in June, but there has been little concrete progress since.
Kim said in a nationally televised New Year address on Tuesday that he was ready to meet again with Trump anytime, but warned he may take a ""new path"" if U.S. sanctions and pressure continued. 
Trump, who in 2017 threatened to rain ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" on North Korea because of the threat its nuclear weapons and missiles posed to the United States, said a world war had been averted.
""That was going to be a war - there could have been a World War Three to be honest with you ... And instead, we have somebody who I really think wants to get on to economic development and making a lot of success and money, frankly, for his country.""
Trump said North Korea had ""tremendous"" potential, and added: ""We'll help them out too.""
On Monday, South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported that Kim had sent a message to Trump regarding the stalled nuclear talks. The report did not include details about the ""letter-like"" communication.
Trump told reporters on Wednesday the letter was ""great"" and that he would love to read it out loud, but did not do so.
Trump has said previously that a second summit with Kim was likely in January or February, though he wrote on Twitter last month he was ""in no hurry.""
'SINISTER INTENTION'
In his address on Tuesday, Kim said denuclearization was his ""firm will"" and North Korea had ""declared at home and abroad that we would neither make and test nuclear weapons any longer nor use and proliferate them.""
However, he warned that North Korea might be ""compelled to explore a new path"" to defend its sovereignty if the United States ""seeks to force something upon us unilaterally ... and remains unchanged in its sanctions and pressure.""
In spite of Trump's words, Kim's comments have fueled doubts over whether North Korea intends to give up a nuclear weapons program it has long considered essential to its security.
Analysts said Kim's message sent clear signals that North Korea, which has sought acceptance as a ""responsible"" nuclear power, was willing to stay in talks with Washington and Seoul this year - but on its own terms. 
North Korea’s main state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary on Thursday last year saw ""wonderful changes"" and ""great movements"" in North Korea's relations with the South Korea and the United States, but progress in inter-Korean relations were “locked up in stagnation” because of U.S policies. 
""The U.S. still remains unchanged in the policy hostile towards the DPRK,"" the paper wrote, using the initials of North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
The paper accused the United States of having a ""a sinister intention to deprive the DPRK of its nuclear weapons and bring it to its knees without goodwill to build a new, good relationship with the DPRK"".
""The U.S. is urged to do what it should do for the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations, not making useless admonition while meddling in the issue of north-south relations, an internal issue of the Korean nation,"" it said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made several trips to Pyongyang last year but the two sides have yet to reschedule an abruptly canceled November meeting between him and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol aimed at paving the way for a second summit.
As well as demanding a lifting of sanctions, Pyongyang has been seeking an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War in response to its initial, unilateral steps that have included dismantling its only known nuclear testing site and a missile engine facility.

U.S. officials have said the extent of initial North Korean steps was not confirmed and could be easily reversed. Washington has halted some large-scale military exercises with South Korea to aid negotiations, but has called for strict global sanctions enforcement until North Korea's full, verifiable denuclearization.

RIO DE JANEIRO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - New Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro issued an executive order on Wednesday making the Agriculture Ministry responsible for deciding on lands claimed by indigenous peoples, in a victory for agribusiness that will likely enrage environmentalists.
The temporary decree, which will expire unless it is ratified within 120 days by Congress, strips power over land claim decisions from indigenous affairs agency FUNAI.
It says the Agriculture Ministry will now be responsible for ""identification, delimitation, demarcation and registration of lands traditionally occupied by indigenous people.""
The move stoked concern among environmentalists and rights groups that the far-right president, who took office on Tuesday, will open up the vast Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest and other ecologically sensitive areas of Brazil to greater commercial exploitation. 
The executive order also moves the Brazilian Forestry Service, which promotes the sustainable use of forests and is currently linked to the Environment Ministry, under Agriculture Ministry control. 
Additionally, the decree states that the Agriculture Ministry will be in charge of the management of public forests. 
Bolsonaro, who enjoys strong support from Brazil's powerful agribusiness sector, said during his campaign he was considering such a move, arguing that protected lands should be opened to commercial activities.
Brazil's 900,000 indigenous people make up less than 1 percent of the population, but live on lands that stretch for 106.7 million hectares (264 million acres), or 12.5 pct of the national territory.
""Less than a million people live in these isolated places in Brazil, where they are exploited and manipulated by NGOs,"" Bolsonaro tweeted, referring to non-profit groups. ""Let us together integrate these citizens and value all Brazilians.""
Critics say Bolsonaro's plan to open indigenous reservations to commercial activity will destroy native cultures and languages by integrating the tribes into Brazilian society.
Environmentalists say the native peoples are the last custodians of the Amazon, which is the world's largest rainforest and is vital for climate stability.
Adding to the gloom for NGOs, Bolsonaro also signed an executive order to give his government potentially far-reaching and restrictive powers over non-governmental organizations working in Brazil. 
The temporary decree mandates that the office of the Government Secretary, Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz, ""supervise, coordinate, monitor and accompany the activities and actions of international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the national territory.""
GOOD NEWS FOR FARM LOBBY
After she was sworn in on Wednesday, new Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias defended the farm sector from accusations it has grown at the expense of the environment, adding that the strength of Brazil's farmers had generated ""unfounded accusations"" from unnamed international groups.
Dias used to be the head of the farm caucus in Brazil's Congress, which has long pushed for an end to land measures that it argues hold back the agricultural sector.
""Brazil is a country with extremely advanced environmental legislation and is more than able to preserve its native forests,"" Dias said. ""Our country is a model to be followed, never a transgressor to be punished.""
In comments to reporters after her speech, she said that decisions over land rights disputes were a new responsibility for the Agriculture Ministry. However, she indicated that in practice, the demarcation of land limits would fall to a council of ministries, without giving further details. 
Bartolomeu Braz, the president of the national chapter of Aprosoja, a major grain growers association, cheered Wednesday's move to transfer indigenous land demarcation to the Agriculture Ministry.
""The new rules will be interesting to the farmers and the Indians, some of whom are already producing soybeans. The Indians want to be productive too,"" he added. 
ENVIRONMENTAL FEARS
Three-time presidential candidate and former Environment Minister Marina Silva, who was beaten by Bolsonaro in October's election, reacted with horror to the move.
""Bolsonaro has begun his government in the worst possible way,"" she wrote on Twitter.
Dinamã Tuxá, a member of Brazil's Association of Indigenous Peoples, said many isolated communities viewed Bolsonaro's administration with fear.
""We are very afraid because Bolsonaro is attacking indigenous policies, rolling back environmental protections, authorizing the invasion of indigenous territories and endorsing violence against indigenous peoples,"" said Tuxá. 
Under the new plan, the indigenous affairs agency FUNAI will be moved into a new ministry for family, women and human rights. 
A former army captain and longtime member of Congress, Bolsonaro said at his inauguration on Tuesday that he had freed the country from ""socialism and political correctness.""
An admirer of Donald Trump, Bolsonaro has suggested he will follow the U.S. president's lead and pull out of the Paris climate change accord.

In addition to the indigenous lands decree, the new administration issued decrees affecting the economy and society on Wednesday, while forging closer ties with the United States.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s attorney general nominee William Barr is expected to back away from prior criticism of an anti-fraud law that allows private individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the government, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Barr will clarify his current thinking on the U.S. False Claims Act, which he has previously called an unconstitutional ""abomination,"" when he goes before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in a confirmation hearing in coming months, the source said.
Barr did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to his law firm email account.
The law allows whistleblowers who expose fraud against the U.S. government to bring private lawsuits and keep a percentage of any damages awarded. In October, for example, the Justice Department agreed to a $93 million bounty for three whistleblowers after drug wholesaler AmerisouceBergen Corp (N:ABC) paid $625 million to resolve their allegations of Medicaid fraud.
Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have criticized the False Claims Act (FCA) as primarily benefiting plaintiffs' lawyers and their clients instead of taxpayers. 
But the Justice Department has raked in nearly $60 billion in FCA settlements and judgments since the law was overhauled in 1986, including nearly $3 billion last year. 
The law also still enjoys the strong support of Iowa Republican and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, who was an architect of 1986 amendments that increased the FCA's potency.
In 1991, during Barr’s previous confirmation hearing to serve as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, Grassley explicitly asked Barr to pledge support to the FCA’s whistleblower provisions.
As a high-ranking Justice Department official in the Bush administration, Barr had authored a 1989 memorandum that concluded the law’s whistleblower provisions violated the separation of powers doctrine and other constitutional requirements.
Barr later said in a 2001 interview for an oral history of the Bush presidency that he wanted the Justice Department to attack the constitutionality of the law but was opposed by then Solicitor General Kenneth Starr.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 2000 that private whistleblowers can sue on behalf of the U.S. government.
Barr has recently told others that his prior comments are outdated, according to the source. Barr believes DOJ’s current handling of FCA cases protects federal interests and no longer thinks a constitutional challenge is warranted, the source said.
Grassley is expected to cede chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee to Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, before Barr’s confirmation hearing. He hailed President Trump’s nomination of Barr in a statement last month.
Grassley’s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

358,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 09:39PM ET</span>",Peru attorney general reverses decision on graft probe,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru Attorney General Pedro Chavarry on Wednesday reappointed two lead prosecutors he had dismissed from a high-profile graft probe after the decision sparked widespread opposition and a threat by President Martin Vizcarra to suspend him.
The prosecutors, Rafael Vela and Jose Domingo Perez, had recently drawn up a plea deal with Odebrecht that committed the Brazilian construction company to providing evidence on some $30 million in bribes it says it paid to local politicians. 
The two are celebrated as anti-graft crusaders by many Peruvians for going after high-profile politicians, including four former presidents and opposition leader Keiko Fujimori.
But late on Monday, Chavarry announced he was removing Vela and Perez from the case for exceeding their authority.
By Wednesday, after protests and waves of criticism, Chavarry signed a resolution reappointing them to their posts, saying other prosecutors had declined to replace them.
The reversal was a fresh win for President Vizcarra, who had promised to do all he could to return the two prosecutors to the case. Earlier on Wednesday Vizcarra sent Congress legislation to suspend Chavarry from his post and declare a state of emergency in the attorney general's office in order to restructure it. 
Chavarry has denied that he sought to meddle in the Odebrecht probe by dismissing Perez and Vela. 
Vizcarra, who took office to replace former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski after his resignation due to a graft scandal last year, has made fighting corruption a core focus of his government. His approval rating at the end of 2018 exceeded 60 percent after reforms he proposed to uproot entrenched corruption cronyism easily passed a national referendum. 
Vizcarra has repeatedly called for Chavarry to step down, but under Peru's constitution only Congress can force the attorney general from office.
Odebrecht is at the center of the ""Car Wash"" investigation in Brazil, which has rippled across Latin America and which U.S. prosecutors have said is the biggest political graft scheme ever uncovered.

In 2016, Odebrecht acknowledged it had paid millions of dollars in bribes to officials in a dozen countries to secure public works contracts dating back over a decade. The company has committed to paying billions of dollars in fines.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's new President Jair Bolsonaro has used an executive order to give his government secretary potentially far-reaching and restrictive powers over non-governmental organizations working in Brazil. 
The temporary decree, which will expire unless it is ratified within 120 days by Congress, mandates that the office of the Government Secretary, Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz, ""supervise, coordinate, monitor and accompany the activities and actions of international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the national territory.""
The order, signed late on Tuesday, is part of a raft of measures the far-right Bolsonaro administration implemented on its first day in power.
Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, said the decree on NGOs could be viewed in a positive light, but also expressed concerns.
""If the purpose of the measure were to facilitate a constructive relationship between international civil society groups and the government at its highest level, it would be a welcome step,"" he said. 
""However, what strikes me is the use of the terms 'supervise' and 'monitor', which suggest a fundamental lack of understanding of the independent role that these entities play in any open and democratic society.""
The decree did not give reasons for the change, but Bolsonaro said on Twitter that NGOs had ""exploited and manipulated"" the country's indigenous population of about 900,000.
""Let us together integrate these citizens and value all Brazilians,"" he wrote.
The president's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Bolsonaro is a former army captain and his cabinet is full of former high-ranking military officials - including Santos Cruz, a retired general. 
Brazil's military has long considered that the rich resources of the vast, sparsely-populated Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) should be protected from any foreign interest.
Environmental and rights groups were already upset by the new government's decision to give the agriculture ministry power over indigenous land rights decisions, and the latest move risks causing further tension with such groups.

A longtime member of Congress, Bolsonaro said at his inauguration on Tuesday that his election had freed the country from ""socialism and political correctness.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the United States would get out of Syria slowly ""over a period of time"" and would protect the U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in the country as Washington draws down troops.
Trump did not provide a timetable for the planned military exit from Syria, which he announced last month against the advice of top national security aides and without consulting lawmakers or U.S. allies participating in anti-Islamic State operations.
The decision prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign. Trump said on Wednesday he had essentially fired Mattis, whose letter of resignation was seen as a sharp rebuke to the Republican president.
During a Cabinet meeting at the White House in front of reporters, Trump said he had never set a reported four-month timetable for the withdrawal of 2,000 American troops stationed in Syria amid a battle against Islamic State militants.
""We're getting out and we're getting out smart,"" Trump said. ""I never said I'm getting out tomorrow."" He declined to be specific about how long troops would remain in Syria.
In recent days, Trump appeared to back off from any hasty pullout and stressed that the operation would be slow. ""We're slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting Isis [Islamic State] remnants,"" he said on Twitter on Monday.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he came out of a recent lunch with Trump feeling reassured about the Syria policy.
Graham told reporters that Trump was committed to making sure Turkey did not clash with the Kurdish YPG forces once U.S. troops leave Syria, and was assuring the NATO ally that it would have a buffer zone in the region to help protect its own interests.
Turkey views the YPG as a branch of its own Kurdish separatist movement and is threatening to launch an offensive against the group, igniting fears of significant civilian casualties.
U.S. commanders planning the U.S. withdrawal are recommending that YPG fighters battling Islamic State be allowed to keep U.S.-supplied weapons, according to U.S. officials.
That proposal would likely anger Turkey, where Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, is expected to hold talks in the coming days.
Trump said he was not happy that the Kurds were selling oil to Iran, but that he wanted to protect them either way.
""I didn't like the fact that they're selling the small (amount of) oil that they have to Iran, and we asked them not to sell it to Iran... We're not thrilled about that. OK? I'm not happy about it at all,"" he said.
""We want to protect the Kurds, nevertheless. We want to protect the Kurds, but I don't want to be in Syria forever. It's sand. And it's death.""

Trump has been critical of previous administrations for sending and keeping U.S. troops abroad, and has made bringing troops home part of his signature ""America First"" policy as he eyes a re-election bid in 2020.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",U.S. 'deeply concerned' about Colombia coca cultivation: Pompeo,"CARTAGENA (Reuters) - The United States is deeply concerned about an increase in coca cultivation in Colombia, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday, but will work with the Andean country to cut production of the raw material for cocaine in half by the end of 2023.
Pompeo met with Colombian President Ivan Duque on a brief visit to the coastal city of Cartagena.
""The United States remains deeply concerned about the surge in coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia since 2013,"" Pompeo told journalists following the meeting. 
Colombia has long been ranked as the world's top producer of cocaine, for which coca is the base ingredient, but figures compiled by the United Nations for 2017 showed the largest potential output since the organization began keeping records, with cocaine production at 1,379 metric tons.
""We will continue to work with you Mr. President side-by-side to achieve our joint objectives to cut coca cultivation and coca production by 50 percent between now and 2023,"" Pompeo said.
Colombia's acreage of coca, the raw material for cocaine, expanded 17 percent to 171,000 hectares (422,550 acres) in 2017, according to the U.N. The uptick was due to increased productivity and growers eager to expand in hopes of getting more aid to switch to legal crops.
The government wants to eradicate 100,000 hectares of coca crops in 2019. Duque said last month that 2018 eradication would total more than 80,000 hectares of illicit crops. 
The U.S. commitment to helping Colombia dismantle organized crime groups is ""vital"", Duque said in his remarks.
Aerial fumigation with the herbicide glyphosate, suspended in 2015 after being linked to cancer, may be reinstated if it can be made to comply with judicial conditions, Duque has said.
Duque and Pompeo also discussed the crisis in Venezuela, where hyperinflation and food and medicine shortages have spurred more than 3 million people to flee over the past several years, including more than a million who now live in Colombia.
Pompeo commended Colombia for its support of Venezuelan migrants and said he and Duque discussed how to collaborate on aid with regional and international bodies.
""All countries that defend democracy, all countries that share the value of democracy should unite to reject the Venezuelan dictatorship,"" Duque said.
The United States has placed sanctions on Venezuela's debt and on some officials in socialist President Nicolas Maduro's government, which it accuses of corruption and human rights violations. 

Maduro blames Venezuela's economic problems on U.S. sanctions and an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries.

BRASILIA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States wants an explanation of why Russia detained a retired U.S. Marine on spying charges in Moscow and will demand his immediate return if it determines his detention is inappropriate, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday.
Pompeo, in Brasilia for the inauguration of Brazil's new president, said the U.S. government hoped to gain consular access to Paul Whelan within hours.
""We've made clear to the Russians our expectation that we will learn more about the charges, come to understand what it is he's been accused of and if the detention is not appropriate, we will demand his immediate return,"" Pompeo said. 
In Moscow, RIA news agency cited a foreign ministry spokesman as saying Russia has allowed consular access to Whelan. Russia's FSB state security service detained Whelan on Friday and opened a criminal case against him.
The State Department did not immediately confirm that Moscow had provided consular access.
Whelan was visiting Moscow for the wedding of a former fellow Marine and is innocent of the espionage charges against him, his family said on Tuesday. 
He had been staying with the wedding party at Moscow's Metropol hotel when he went missing, his brother, David, said.
""His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected,"" Whelan's family said in a statement released on Twitter on Tuesday.
Russia's FSB state security service said Whelan had been detained on Friday, but it gave no details of his alleged espionage activities. Under Russian law, espionage can carry a prison sentence of between 10 and 20 years.
David Whelan told CNN that his brother, who had served in Iraq, has been to Russia many times in the past for both work and personal trips, and had been serving as a tour guide for some of the wedding guests. His friends filed a missing persons report in Moscow after his disappearance, his brother said.
He declined to comment on his brother’s work status at the time of his arrest and whether his brother lived in Novi, Michigan, as address records indicate.
BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA), a Michigan-based automotive parts supplier, said Whelan is the ""company’s director, global security. He is responsible for overseeing security at our facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and at other company locations around the world.""
BUTINA CASE
Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief, said it was ""possible, even likely"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered Whelan’s arrest to set up an exchange for Maria Butina, a Russian citizen who pleaded guilty on Dec. 13 to acting as an agent tasked with influencing U.S. conservative groups.
Russia says Butina was forced to make a false confession about being a Russian agent.
Putin told U.S. President Donald Trump in a letter on Sunday that Moscow was ready for dialogue on a ""wide-ranging agenda,"" the Kremlin said following a series of failed attempts to hold a new summit. 
At the end of November, Trump canceled a planned meeting with Putin on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina, citing tensions about Russian forces opening fire on Ukrainian navy boats and then seizing them.
Trump's relations with Putin have been under a microscope as a result of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.
Moscow has denied intervening in the election. Trump has said there was no collusion and characterized Mueller's probe as a witch hunt. 
Russia's relations with the United States plummeted when Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Washington and Western allies have imposed a broad range of sanctions on Russian officials, companies and banks.

(Reuters) - Two victims of sexual abuse by a Roman Catholic Church priest in Chile launched a fresh attack on the country's bishops on Wednesday, accusing them of failing to reform or learn from the crisis. 
Juan Carlos Cruz and Jose Andres Murillo, two prominent victims of the abuse who gave evidence of their ordeal to Pope Francis in Rome, said the pontiff had also acted to slowly in handling the crisis. 
Cruz said the Chilean church's leaders, several of whom face criminal investigation for their roles in allegedly covering up abuse, had failed to follow through on their promises to institute reform.
""What we have in Chile is a veritable band of criminal bishops,"" he said. ""After visiting the pope, after everything that's happened, that is happening with civil justice, they have learned nothing."" 
Church officials declined to comment. 
The Chilean Catholic Church was engulfed by scandal after a visit by the pope in January last year that brought to the surface a string of abuse allegations now being investigated by criminal prosecutors. 
After initially dismissing some claims, the pope later summoned Chile's bishops to Rome for questioning after a Vatican investigation reported that they had been guilty of ""grave negligence"" in investigating abuse in the church.
The pope has accepted the resignations of seven Chilean bishops, and the country's episcopal conference has vowed to tighten up child protection measures and work more closely with civil authorities to bring abusers to justice.
But the archbishop of Santiago, Ricardo Ezzati, remains in his post despite facing abuse cover-up allegations - accusations that he, like most of the Chilean church's senior leadership, denies. 
Cruz and Murillo, both victims of the now-defrocked father Fernando Karadima, called for a wholesale overhaul of Chile's church leadership.
Murillo called for ""more women and lay church workers"" to be made bishops in Chile. 
Cruz said he believed the pope's efforts to uncover abuse in the church were being hampered by powerful forces around him. 
""I believe the pope's apology to us was sincere, and I think he is trying with all his heart but not with the speed that the severity of these issues deserves,"" Cruz said.

""It is so much that the pope needs help and people to support him. What has struck me is the number of people working against him in his close circle.""

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia has kicked out the country's top United Nations official in a decision likely to harm relations with foreign powers backing government attempts to restore stability after decades of turmoil.
The government accused Nicholas Haysom, Special Representative of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, of interfering with internal affairs.
The United Nations is a major backer of Somalia, a country that has lacked strong central government since 1991. The government's decision over Haysom could intensify a confrontation between Mogadishu and the semi-autonomous regions.
Haysom raised questions in a Dec. 30 letter about the involvement of U.N.-supported Somali security forces in the arrest of a former militant of the Islamist al Shabaab group who was blocked from running in a recent regional election.
Haysom ""is not required and cannot work in this country"", the foreign affairs ministry said. ""He openly breached the appropriate conduct of the U.N. office in Somalia,"" said the statement late on Tuesday, which effectively makes the South African persona non grata.
The United Nations is looking into the matter, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters in New York on Wednesday. 
""We're trying to get the various details corroborated and we're going to see, based on that, what further steps are needed,"" Haq said.
He said Haysom was due to brief the U.N. Security Council on Thursday - as previously scheduled - on the U.N. mission in Somalia, which also supports an African Union peacekeeping force fighting al Shabaab. Haysom was also due to meet with Guterres. 
Haysom's letter to Somalia's interior security minister expressed concern over the government's handling of the arrest of former Shabaab leader Mukhtar Robow and subsequent unrest last month.
At least 15 civilians were killed and around 300 people detained, most of them children, when protests erupted after Robow's arrest in the southern city of Baidoa, according to the U.N. letter. 
The government said Robow was arrested on suspicion that he had brought militants and weapons back to Baidoa, the capital of South West region where he tried to contest for president in last month's election. 
His arrest sparked clashes between militiamen loyal to Robow and Somali forces. Ethiopian security forces, who are part of an African Union peacekeeping force, were also involved. 
Al Shabaab has sought for over a decade to topple the central government and implement its strict version of Islamic law. It was driven out of the capital in 2011 but maintains a foothold in some regions including South West.
Robow renounced violence and recognized federal authority in 2017.
In the letter, Haysom asked the minister to explain the legal basis for Robow's arrest. He also asked what action had been taken to investigate the deaths during the demonstrations in Baidoa following the arrest.
The U.N. letter also contained an annexed letter from the European Union, Germany and Britain announcing the suspension of their support to the police in South West state due to their conduct during last month's election.

Haysom also detailed the U.N. support to the Somali police force and the South West regional police which includes the payment of stipends to the police.

Burkina has seen a spike in Islamist attacks in recent months as jihadists seek to increase their influence across the Sahel. On Dec. 31, the government declared a state of emergency in several northern provinces bordering Mali. 
Attacks this week show how that violence may be fuelling ethnic clashes for the first time in Burkina.
After nightfall on Dec. 31, armed men on motorbikes descended on the village of Yirgou, made up largely of people of Mossi ethnicity, and killed six people, including the village chief, government spokesman Jean Paul Badoun said.
The following day, Badoun said, Yirgou residents killed seven Fulani herders in apparent retaliation. The residents blamed the herders for sheltering the men who attacked them the day before.
The ethnic violence echoes problems seen in neighboring Mali where Fulani have been accused of hiding Islamists who have carried out attacks across the region in recent years. Armed men killed 37 Fulani civilians there on Tuesday. 
Ten gendarmes were shot dead near the Malian border last week in an attack claimed by Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), an umbrella group for al Qaeda-linked militants in the Sahara.
JNIM claimed responsibility for other attacks this year, including one in the capital Ouagadougou in March that killed about eight security agents and wounded dozens of others.

Thousands of people have fled their homes due to the attacks and reprisals by security forces.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's new President Jair Bolsonaro set to work quickly on Wednesday, with his administration issuing decrees affecting the economy, agriculture and society, while forging closer political ties with the United States.
Bolsonaro, a former army captain and seven-term congressman, won elections in October and was sworn in on Tuesday as Brazil's first far-right president since a military dictatorship gave way to civilian rule in 1985.
Fulfilling a campaign promise to his staunch supporters in the farm sector, Bolsonaro decreed that indigenous land claims, a source of bloody clashes on Brazil's agricultural frontier, would be decided by the Agriculture Ministry.
The gift to the powerful agribusiness sector enraged environmentalists already worried by Bolsonaro's plans to loosen protections of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest and remove Brazil's support for the Paris Agreement on climate change. 
The new president was elected on a platform to clean up Brazilian politics, and he put the country's top anti-corruption figure, Sergio Moro, in charge of a Justice Ministry beefed up to fight graft and battle organized crime.
Moro, a former federal judge who spearheaded the ""Car Wash"" corruption trials that put former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and other high-profile politicians in jail, said on Wednesday he would help usher in a new era of law-and-order. 
    ""The top mission given to me by the president was clear: end impunity for corruption cases and combat organized crime to reduce violent crimes,"" Moro said after being sworn in.
The administration would propose an ambitious anti-crime bill to Congress next month that would stiffen prison sentences, Moro said.
ALIGNING WITH TRUMP 
Bolsonaro met this week with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, President Donald Trump's envoy to Tuesday's presidential inauguration, who said the United States and Brazil will jointly defend democratic values in the region.
""We have an opportunity to work alongside each other against authoritarian regimes,"" Pompeo said on Wednesday after discussing Venezuela with Brazil's new Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo, who was picked by Bolsonaro for his admiration of Trump's conservative nationalism.
Bolsonaro's rise to power culminates a swing to conservative rule in Latin America that has isolated leftist-ruled countries such as Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua.
While Bolsonaro surprised Brazil's political establishment by surging to victory over a leftist coalition led by Lula's Workers Party, he takes office with the lowest approval rating of any new Brazilian president, according to a Datafolha poll Tuesday.
That suggests he will have an uphill battle to enact his agenda of austerity measures to bring down an unsustainable budget deficit of about 180 billion reais ($47.31 billion) that has investors worried.
Markets, however, are optimistic that Bolsonaro's economic team, led by former investment banker Paulo Guedes, will succeed in passing reforms needed to reduce the deficit and restore confidence and growth to a slow-moving economy.
One of Bolsonaro's first steps was to decree a less-than-expected increase to the minimum wage for this year, to 998 reais ($260) a month from 954 reais.
The real currency strengthened 1 percent by midday Wednesday and the Sao Paulo Bovespa stock index rose 2 percent.
Preferred shares in the country's largest utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA jumped over 10 pct after new Energy & Mines Minister Bento Albuquerque said the company would be partially privatized.
Doing even better was gun manufacturer Forjas Taurus SA whose shares rose 27 percent to 5.1 reais on Bolsonaro's plan to ease gun controls, to help Brazilians arm themselves in self defense against crime.
In his inauguration address on Tuesday, Bolsonaro said his election had freed Latin America's largest nation from ""socialism and political correctness.""

Some 30 km (20 miles) from the Turkish border, the town occupies a critical spot on the map of the Syrian conflict, near the junction of three separate blocks of territory that form spheres of Russian, Turkish and - for now - U.S. influence.
""According to information, approximately 400 Kurdish fighters have left Manbij so far,"" the Syrian defense ministry said. Their departure was in line with an agreement ""for the return of normal life to the area of northern Syria,"" it said. 
The ministry showed online a video of dozens of vehicles traveling along an unmade road carrying armed fighters, some waving the flags of the Kurdish-led People's Protection Units (YPG) militia and its female counterpart the YPJ. 
The YPG is the strongest element in the Syrian Defense Forces (SDF), a coalition of militias that the United States has backed in its campaign against Islamic State, helping it capture swathes of north and east Syria. 
Fearing an attack by Turkey after a U.S. pull-out from Syria, the YPG asked Syrian government forces to deploy in the area around Manbij. 
There was no immediate comment from the YPG or the SDF on the withdrawal or on how many fighters might remain in Manbij. 
Turkey regards the YPG as a terrorist group tied to the PKK inside its own borders, and has staged incursions into Syria in support of Syrian rebels to push it from the Turkish frontier. 
As a result of one of those incursions, Turkish-backed forces have held an area bordering Manbij since 2016, and Ankara has repeatedly demanded that the YPG leave the area and cross to the east bank of the Euphrates. 
The YPG previously announced it had pulled its forces out of Manbij and has said fighters still in the area belonged to a local militia allied to the SDF. 
U.S. forces have underpinned stability in Manbij since Islamic State's defeat there in 2016, and have conducted joint patrols with Turkish forces since November in an effort to allay Ankara's security concerns.

But last month Yemeni security forces briefly detained the five members of the WaxOn band, broke their equipment and only released the dancers after they had signed a document saying they would stop dancing hip-hop in public.
""The police said it was a religious sin,"" band member Salman Basuad said. 
Another band member, Mohammed Al Ameeri, said: ""The officers were very violent.. They treated us as if we were terrorists.""
Local security forces did not respond immediately to Reuters' request for comment.
WaxOn band leader Mohammed Basaud said the ban reminded him of the ""al Qaeda era"" when the dancers were also barred from performing in public.
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) ran a mini-state in the southern port city of Mukalla in 2015-16 before being defeated by forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition, which intervened in Yemen's civil war to restore its ousted president, Abd-Rabu Mansour Hadi. 
Since AQAP was driven out, Mukalla has been largely peaceful compared to the rest of Yemen, which has been devastated by nearly four years of fighting between the Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthis.
WaxOn, formed in 2014, resumed their public performances in 2016, dancing at graduation and birthday parties among other events.
Yemenis like coming to the main square of Mukalla to watch the street performers for free. 
Basaud, said Mukalla's residents accepted WaxOn and would offer them money to perform, allowing them sometimes to make as much as 40,000 Yemen rials ($160) for a 10-minute performance.
He said the security forces had not moved against other bands performing traditional Yemeni dances on the square.
""We just want the security forces to accept our position.. Our equipment and other things were damaged and lost. If they will not compensate us, at least they should cancel those unnecessary pledges they took from us (not to dance),"" he said.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Six people were killed on a bridge linking Denmark's two main islands on Wednesday when a passenger train hit a trailer that had blown off a freight wagon coming the other way, officials said.
The train with 131 passengers on board was heading toward the capital, Copenhagen, when it hit the trailer. Apart from the dead, 16 people were injured but were not in critical condition, police said.
The accident happened shortly before 7.35 a.m. (0635 GMT) during a severe storm that hampered the rescue operation on the 18-km (11-mile) Great Belt Bridge between Zealand and Funen, Denmark's two major islands. 
""This morning's tragic accident on the Great Belt Bridge with many killed and wounded has shaken us all,"" Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen tweeted. 
""Ordinary Danes on their way to work or on the way home from Christmas holidays have had their lives shattered.""
GRAPHIC: Location map of crash site - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Au4Hex 
A preliminary investigation by the Danish Accident Investigation Board showed a trailer had blown off a freight wagon onto the oncoming tracks, a spokesman said. 
""There was a very, very loud bang and then the train stopped,"" a witness who had been onboard the train with his daughter told broadcaster TV2.
Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven blamed the weather. ""Terrible train accident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark as a result of the storm Alfrida. Our thoughts are with the injured and with the families and relatives of the dead,"" he tweeted.
TV footage showed a severely damaged freight trailer adorned with the logo of Danish beer maker Carlsberg (CO:CARLb). Crates of beer could be seen inside.
A train operated by DB Cargo, the logistics arm of Germany's Deutsche Bahn (UL:DBN) which carries goods from Carlsberg's Fredericia brewery to Copenhagen, was involved in the accident, a Carlsberg spokesman said.
The bridge remained closed for trains while car traffic in both directions resumed. Danish rail operator Banedanmark said it did not expect rail traffic by to resume before Thursday.

The Great Belt, part of a route that links Denmark and Sweden to Germany, carries around 21,000 train passengers and more than 27,000 vehicles each day.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Election monitors from the Southern (NYSE:SO) African Development Community (SADC) said on Wednesday that Democratic Republic of Congo's presidential election ""went relatively well"" despite chaotic scenes that prevented many from voting.
The SADC's qualified endorsement countered allegations by opposition candidates that the Dec. 30 vote was marred by widespread irregularities and criticism by a senior U.S. lawmaker that the election was ""neither free nor fair"".
Approval of the election's results by SADC powers like South Africa and Angola will be critical for the legitimacy of the administration of the next president, who will succeed veteran incumbent Joseph Kabila on Jan. 18. 
Angola and South Africa have been important allies of Kabila over the years, but relations were strained by his refusal to step down when his mandate officially expired in 2016. 
Pre-election polling showed Kabila's preferred candidate, ex-interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, trailing the main opposition candidates, Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi, but both sides say they expect to win. Provisional results are expected on Jan. 6, with the final outcome on Jan. 15.
Sunday's vote is meant to lead to Congo's first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence. But more than a million Congolese in opposition strongholds were prevented from voting due to an Ebola outbreak, local factional conflict and various logistical problems.
""Taking into account the range of challenges posed by these elections, the (mission) observed that the elections ... were relatively well-managed,"" the SADC mission said in a statement.
The election allowed ""the majority of the Congolese population to exercise its right to vote"". 
The statement said that 59 percent of polling places it observed opened on time, vote counting was transparent and police securing the polls behaved professionally. 
An African Union observer mission said in a separate statement on Wednesday that election day, which also included votes for national and provincial assembly members, was peaceful yet blighted by a number of logistical problems.
""The holding of these elections constitutes, in itself, a first great victory for the Congolese people,"" it said. ""The mission strongly wishes that the results that will be declared are true to the vote of the Congolese people.""
Kabila's government refused to accredit election monitors from the European Union and the U.S.-based Carter Center, which said there were widespread irregularities in the 2011 election. 
Contested election results in 2006 and 2011 led to violent street protests, and a disputed outcome this time could also destabilize Congo's volatile eastern borderlands with Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, where dozens of militia groups are active.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Hindu nationalists linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party urged him on Wednesday to push through laws to allow the building of a temple on the ruins of a 16th century mosque, a flashpoint in tensions with minority Muslims.
A long-running dispute over the site in the northern town of Ayodhya has flared back into life in recent months in the build-up to national elections due before May.
The Supreme Court is weighing petitions from both communities on what should be built there and Modi told Reuters partner ANI on Tuesday that the judicial process should take its course. 
A day later, Alok Kumar, the international working president of Vishva Hindu Parishad, responded: ""The Supreme Court is taking its own sweet time and Hindus can't wait endlessly to see a temple there.""
""We'll persuade the government of Prime Minister Modi to issue legislation to start the process of a grand temple in Ayodhya,"" he told journalists. He wanted the legislation in place before the government's term ends, he added.
A Hindu crowd tore down the mosque in 1992, triggering riots that killed about 2,000 people across India, in one of the worst instances of communal violence since the partition of the country in 1947.
Vishva Hindu Parishad, also known as the World Hindu Council, has been spearheading a campaign over the past three decades to build a temple on the site of what Hindus say is the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities.
Over the past few months, the group allied to Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has organized rallies of tens of thousands of activists, monks and other supporters, at a time of growing political and cultural tensions.

At the other end of the country from Ayodhya, in the southern state of Kerala, two women defied a centuries-old ban on entering a Hindu temple on Wednesday, sparking protests and calls for a strike by conservative Hindu groups outraged by their visit.

Speaking to reporters after meeting with Brazil's new Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo, Pompeo named Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua as countries that do not have shared democratic values. 
""We have an opportunity to work alongside each other against authoritarian regimes,"" he said of the United States and Brazil, a day after the inauguration of far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
In response, Venezuela's foreign ministry said in a statement it ""categorically rejected"" Pompeo's ""interventionist attitude,"" accusing him of seeking to rally support among Latin American countries for ""forcible regime change"" in Venezuela. 
More than three million Venezuelans have fled hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine in the OPEC nation, with most of them having left since 2015, according to the United Nations. Nearby South American countries like Brazil and Colombia have received the bulk of the migrants.

The United States has placed sanctions on Venezuela's debt and on some officials in socialist President Nicolas Maduro's government, which it accuses of corruption and human rights violations. Maduro frequently blames a U.S.-led ""economic war"" for the country's woes.

Should Philippine Airlines get an overflight permit, which would save on flight time and costs, it could launch direct service to Tel Aviv within six months, airline president Jaime Bautista said on Wednesday.
""The Civil Aeronautics Board wrote to Saudi authorities asking for overflight (rights),"" Bautista told Reuters. ""A letter was sent in October.""
Last March, Saudi Arabia opened its airspace for the first time to a commercial flight to Israel for an Air India route between New Delhi and Tel Aviv.
Saudi Arabia does not recognize Israel and the move ended a 70-year-old ban, marking a diplomatic shift as Israel attempts to reach out to Gulf Arab states that share its concern over Iran's regional activities. 
There is no indication any Israeli airline will be granted similar rights.
Israel’s flag carrier El Al, which must take more circuitous paths to avoid Saudi Arabia, has asked the International Air Transport Association, an airline industry lobby group, to help it gain access to Saudi airspace.
Direct Philippines-Israel flights would be welcomed by the thousands of Filipinos employed as careworkers in Israel, and tourists heading in either direction. The number of tourists visiting Israel from the Philippines rose by 61 percent in 2017, and tourism in the other direction rose by 42 percent in 2016.
Philippines' Department of Transportation Undersecretary Antonio Tamayo told reporters last month that his country has landing rights as far as Israel is concerned.
""This is the result of the visit of the (Philippines) president to Israel (in September),"" he said.
Failure to secure a permit from Saudi Arabia would add more than an hour to the flight time, he said.

Officials at Israel's Tourism and Transportation ministries were not immediately available for comment.

The 100,000 square meter complex will be developed by the Saudi Entertainment Ventures Company (SEVEN), a wholly owned subsidiary of the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, according to a statement carried by state news agency SPA.
The project will feature sports activities, live performances, restaurants and cinemas, it said. It did not specify the value of the investment. 
The Public Investment Fund established SEVEN last year with initial funding of 10 billion riyals ($2.67 billion) and hired former Disney executive Bill Ernest to run it.
The company aims to set up about 20 entertainment centers around the country over the next several years, as Saudi Arabia tries to use the leisure sector to create jobs, liberalize social norms and diversify the economy beyond oil exports.
SEVEN has already opened the kingdom's first cinema in nearly four decades, in partnership with U.S. based AMC Group, and hopes to attract private companies to invest alongside it at all of its projects.
Those plans could be complicated by fallout from the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate in October, which has led some foreign media and technology companies to distance themselves from the kingdom.
Since the murder, British billionaire Richard Branson has suspended his directorship in two PIF-backed tourism projects along the Red Sea coast. No investors have yet been announced for the ventures.
Hollywood talent agency Endeavor is close to terminating an agreed $400 million investment from PIF over reputational concerns, while Legendary Entertainment said in November it had ""no interest"" in conducting a proposed transaction with the fund.
However, theme park operator Six Flags is going ahead with plans to open one of its facilities at Qiddiya, a huge resort area the PIF is planning to build outside Riyadh which will also feature water parks, motor sports and cultural events.

CAIRO/DUBAI (Reuters) - Sudanese authorities are blocking access to popular social media platforms used to organize and broadcast nationwide anti-government protests triggered by an economic crisis, internet users say.
Sudan has been rocked by near-daily demonstrations over the past two weeks. Protesters have set alight ruling party buildings and have called on President Omar al-Bashir, who took power in 1989, to step down.
In a country where the state tightly controls traditional media, the internet has become a key information battleground. Of Sudan's 40 million people, some 13 million use the internet and more than 28 million own mobile phones, local media say.
Authorities have not repeated the internet blackout they imposed during deadly protests in 2013. But the head of Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Service, Salah Abdallah, told a rare news conference on Dec. 21: ""There was a discussion in the government about blocking social media sites and in the end it was decided to block them."" 
Users of the three main telecommunications operators in the country -- Zain, MTN and Sudani -- said access to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and WhatsApp has only been possible through use of a virtual private network (VPN).
Though VPNs can bring their own connection problems and some Sudanese are unaware of their existence, activists have used them widely to organize and document the demonstrations. 
Hashtags in Arabic such as ""Sudan's_cities_revolt"" have been widely circulated from Sudan and abroad. Hashtags in English such as #SudanRevolts have also been used.
""Social media has a really big impact, and it helps with forming public opinion and transmitting what's happening in Sudan to the outside,"" said Mujtaba Musa, a Sudanese Twitter user with over 50,000 followers who has been active in documenting the protests.
NetBlocks, a digital rights NGO, said data it collected, including from thousands of Sudanese volunteers, provided evidence of ""an extensive internet censorship regime"".
Bader al-Kharafi, CEO of parent company Zain Group, told Reuters: ""Some websites may be blocked for technical reasons beyond the company's specialization.""
Neither the National Telecommunications Corporation, which oversees the sector in Sudan, nor MTN or Sudani could be reached for comment. Twitter and Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp, declined to comment.
""While Sudan has a long history of systematically censoring print and broadcast media, online media has been relatively untouched despite its exponential growth... in recent years,"" said Mai Truong of U.S.-based advocacy group Freedom House.

""The authorities have only now started to follow the playbook of other authoritarian governments.""

KOCHI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Two women defied a centuries-old ban on entering a Hindu temple in the Indian state of Kerala on Wednesday, sparking protests and calls for a strike by conservative Hindu groups outraged by their visit.
Police fired teargas and used water cannons to disperse a large crowd of protesters in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram, television news channels showed. 
There were protests in several other cities in the state, media reported.
India's Supreme Court in September ordered the lifting of the ban on women or girls of menstruating age from entering the Sabarimala temple, which draws millions of worshippers a year. 
But the temple refused to abide by the ruling and subsequent attempts by women to visit it had been blocked by thousands of devotees.
The Kerala state government is run by left-wing parties and it has sought to allow women into the temple - a position that has drawn the criticism of both of India's main political parties, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The uproar has put the issue of religion, which can be highly contentious in India, squarely on the political agenda months before a general election, which is due by May.
The possibility of more confrontations was raised by a call from an umbrella group of right-wing Hindu groups in Kerala, the Sabarimala Karma Samithi, which is supported by the BJP, for a state-wide protest strike on Thursday.
The BJP called for protesters to be peaceful.
COMMUNISTS BLAMED
Earlier, the Kerala state president of the BJP described the women's visit as ""a conspiracy by the atheist rulers to destroy the Hindu temples"".
The party's state president, P.S Sreedharan Pillai, told TV channels the BJP would ""support the struggles against the destruction of faith by the Communists"".
""Let all the devotees come forward and protest this,"" he said.
Officials from the main opposition Congress party in the state, in a rare alignment with their main rival for power at the national level, the BJP, also called for protests. 
""This is treachery ... The government will have to pay the price for the violation of the custom,"" K. Sudhakaran, vice-president of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, said in a statement. 
Conservative Hindu groups say they believe women of menstruating age would defile the temple's inner shrine. The ban was imposed on all females between the ages of 10 and 50.
News channels reported the chief priest briefly shut the temple for ""purification"" rituals after the women visited. 
Later, media reported it had re-opened. 
The two women, identified by police as Bindu Ammini, 42, and Kanaka Durga, 44, had tried to go in on Dec. 24, and later approached police for help, an officer said.
""There was an elaborate arrangement for them to come just after the temple was opened early morning,"" said the officer, who declined to be identified fearing reprisals from protesters.
""The darkness gave them, and us, cover.""
Police were guarding the homes of the women after they left the temple and were prepared to let more women enter the temple, he said.
WALL OF WOMEN
A video from a police official posted online by ANI showed two women in the temple with their heads covered.
Ammini told a television channel about their stealthy trek to the temple in the middle of the night.
“We reached Pampa, the main entry point to the temple at 1.30 a.m. and sought police protection ... We walked two hours, entered the temple around 3.30 a.m. and did the darshan,"" the woman said, referring to a ritual of standing in front of the temple's Hindu image.
The state government defended its decision to protect the women as they went into the temple, saying it was a matter of civil rights. 
""I had earlier made it clear that the government will provide protection if any women come forward to enter the temple,"" said Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.
Vijayan told a news conference the women faced no obstruction on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear how they managed to avoid devotees guarding the temple. 
On Tuesday, the state government backed a protest by thousands of women, who formed a 620 km (385 mile) human chain, termed the ""women's wall"", in support of ""gender equality"" and access to the temple. 
Modi, in an interview with ANI on Tuesday, indicated he felt that the temple issue was more about a religious tradition than gender equality.

Modi said there were temples where men were barred from entering.

Michael Spavor was shown as being ""active"" on Viber, an instant messaging app blocked in China, as recently as early on Wednesday, a screenshot of his online status viewed by Reuters showed. 
Spavor was also shown as being on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram in late December, after his arrest, according to screenshots shared by a person on his social media network on condition of anonymity.
Although Spavor's accounts showed he was logged on, he did not post anything. It was not possible to tell if it was Spavor who logged on or someone else.
None of his friends have had any direct contact with him, despite the accounts being active, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
China's Ministry of State Security has no publicly available contact details, and could not be reached for comment.
Facebook and Instagram are also banned in China, making Spavor's access to those accounts particularly unusual while he is being detained on suspicion of being a threat to state security.
To circumvent bans on various social media platforms, many foreigners in China log on to virtual private networks (VPNs) or sign up for a data-roaming service before leaving home.
Spavor and another Canadian, Michael Kovrig, were detained after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co's [HWT.UL] chief financial officer on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States. 
China has given only vague details of why they have detained the two Canadians, saying they are suspected of engaging in activities that endangered security. The government has not drawn a direct link to Meng's arrest.
Canada has said the detentions are unacceptable. Canadian diplomats have seen both men at least once since they were detained. 
It is not known when Spavor was arrested. China disclosed his detention on Dec. 13.

SEOUL (Reuters) - In his New Year address on Tuesday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned he might take a ""new path"" if Washington maintains sanctions amid his country's push for economic development, but experts say it may be too late to change the trajectory of negotiations.
Kim did not specify what the new approach might be. His warning may sound similar to the bellicose rhetoric that Pyongyang often deployed before last year's summit, but he cannot jeopardize the hard-won thaw and has few options beyond appealing directly to U.S. President Donald Trump, experts say.
State media have in recent weeks accused the State Department of risking returning to ""exchanges of fire"" of the past by ramping up sanctions, while crediting Trump for his efforts to continue talks.
As both sides struggle to find a breakthrough in stalled talks, the speech shows Kim shifting the focus from calls for complete dismantlement of its nuclear arsenal and hinting at including countries other than the United States. 
Q: IS THIS A SIGN OF FRUSTRATION?
A: Kim vowed to work towards denuclearization at a summit with Trump in Singapore in June. But since then there has been little progress, with a high-level meeting between the two sides canceled abruptly in November.
Pyongyang has demanded Washington lift sanctions and declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War in response to the dismantlement of its Punggye-ri nuclear testing site and a key missile engine facility.
Despite goodwill responses from Washington, such as a halt of some major military exercises with South Korea, U.S. officials have said North Korea's initial steps were not confirmed and could be easily reversed.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said North Korea would not be forced to provide a list of nuclear weapons and locations, and a U.S. nuclear envoy offered to facilitate humanitarian aid. 
But Kim's speech on Tuesday called for a ""complete end"" to all joint exercises and slammed the sanctions campaign. 
""His message was 'we have done what we said we would at Singapore, but the United States has done very little in return,'"" said Vipin Narang, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
Q: WHAT DOES 'NEW PATH' MEAN?
A: North Korea's state media has stepped up criticism of the United States, warning of a return to the era of confrontation if sanctions and pressure continued. But that indicates Pyongyang's frustration rather than the ""new path"" Kim suggested, experts say.
""His speech chiefly emphasized the need for a fair deal, and it's extremely unlikely for them to go back,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at South Korea's Sejong Institute. 
Instead, ""new path"" may refer to focusing on concessions that don't involve broad denuclearization in favor of action-for-action commitments.
South Korea's Unification Ministry said on Wednesday it could not speculate on what the alternative path might be, but Kim showed his ""clear resolve"" to abandon the weapons program and improve U.S. ties by mentioning ""complete denuclearization"" himself for the first time. 
Kim Joon-hyung, a professor of international politics at Handong Global University, said one possible scenario was the North's dismantling of the Yongbyon nuclear complex, as offered at an inter-Korean summit in September in Pyongyang, and acknowledging some facilities in return for eased sanctions, such as a partial restart of inter-Korean economic projects. 
Kim Jong Un said in the speech he was willing to reopen the Kaesong factory park and allow access to the North's Mount Kumgang resort ""without conditions.""
Yet there remains an opportunity to limit Kim's arsenal, Narang said.
""The United States should find out what the price for a cap on North Korea's nuclear program would be, as it would be an important and realistic objective,"" he said.
Q: DOES NORTH KOREA WANT TO SHIFT ITS FOCUS FROM AMERICA? 
A: The New Year address called for a launch of multilateral talks to officially declare an end to the Korean War, an idea also floated previously by South Korea.
That could mean working with China, South Korea and others in pressing Washington, professor Kim said. But other experts, including former South Korean nuclear envoy Lee Soo-hyuk, were skeptical that would happen given the deadlocked bilateral talks, the Sino-U.S. trade war and Trump's dislike for multinational mechanisms.
""This will not be easy, and neither side will achieve outright success, but diplomacy is possible,"" said Patrick Cronin, chair for Asia-Pacific security at the Hudson Institute in New York. ""China and others may also be invited to play a role.""

The blast, initially thought to have been caused by a gas leak, damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk in the early hours on Monday, 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow.
A baby boy was found alive on Tuesday after 35 hours spent in freezing cold in the rubble, in what emergency officials described as a miracle.
In a separate incident late on Tuesday, three people died on the same street where the building collapsed, when a minibus became engulfed in flames, TASS news agency reported citing the local government office. 
Video footage purporting to show the incident, posted on social media sites, shows a burning vehicle and some bangs are heard. A police spokesman declined to comment when contacted by phone.
The reason behind the collapse of the apartment block is still being investigated, the Investigative Committee, which probes into major cries, said on its website. 
It said no trace of explosives materials had been found so far on the site. The initial reports put a possible gas leak behind the collapse.
There have been several similar incidents in the country in recent years due to ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations about gas usage.

Lebanese politicians have been unable to agree a new government since a general election in May as rival parties have competed over the allocation of cabinet positions, further unsettling the country's fragile economy. 
Hezbollah, a heavily armed, Iran-backed movement set up in the 1980s to combat Israeli occupation, started taking part in electoral politics in the 1990s and is the most powerful group in the country. 
""We believe the solution is very close,"" said Mahmoud Qamati, deputy head of the group's political council, and suggested it could happen in time to be considered ""a holiday gift"". ""The intentions held by everybody are positive and for the benefit of the country,"" he added. 
On Tuesday, Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri said he and President Michel Aoun had met and were ""determined to form a government"", state news agency NNA reported. 
A breakthrough to create a national unity government in line with Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system seemed close last month, but it did not work out and the deadlock resumed. However, Hariri said on Sunday he still believed the government would form early in the new year.
The lack of a government has caused particular concern because Lebanon faces both structural economic problems and regional instability. 
Lebanon has the world's third-highest level of debt to GDP and Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil said on Sunday it faces an economic crisis that he warned could turn into a financial one.
Hariri has pledged to carry out economic reforms that could unlock billions of dollars of international investment in Lebanese power, transport and data infrastructure, aimed at boosting the economy after years of weak growth. 
The International Monetary Fund has stressed the importance of Lebanon putting its debt on a sustainable footing, while bond yields and the cost of insuring against Lebanese sovereign debt have shown signs of stress in recent months.
Last month, Israel uncovered several tunnels it said Hezbollah had dug under the border, adding to tensions between the countries some 12 years after Israel and Hezbollah fought a war on Lebanese soil. 
Qamati said the government formation was beneficial ""particularly in light of the Israeli dangers"". 
The latest hitch in efforts to form a government came over Sunni Muslim representation in the cabinet. Hariri said on Tuesday that only one difficulty remained and that he and Aoun were working to solve it.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 05:37AM ET</span>",Cuba's Castro blasts United States on 60th anniversary of revolution,"By Sarah Marsh and Nelson Acosta
HAVANA (Reuters) - On the 60th anniversary of Cuba's revolution, ruling Communist Party leader Raul Castro blasted the Trump administration for returning to an outdated path of confrontation with the island nation and of intervening in Latin America.
Castro and his late, elder brother Fidel Castro led the rebel band that in 1959 overthrew a U.S.-backed dictator and installed a Communist-run country on the doorstep of the United States, setting the scene for decades of Cold War hostility.
At the time, their revolution inspired leftist movements throughout Latin America, but the celebrations on Tuesday came as the region is shifting rightwards, coinciding with the inauguration of Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. 
Some of Cuba's closest allies, Venezuela and Nicaragua, are mired in political crises, and U.S. President Donald Trump has tightened the decades-old U.S. embargo on the island, after his predecessor, Barack Obama, had sought to normalize relations.
""Once again, the North American government is taking on the path of confrontation with Cuba,"" Castro said in the southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba where Fidel Castro proclaimed victory six decades ago.
The speech by Castro, who stepped down as president in April but remains head of the Communist Party until 2021, was part of a solemn, sunset ceremony in a cemetery where both Fidel Castro and independence hero Jose Marti are buried.
""Increasingly, high-ranking officials of this administration are ... trying to blame Cuba for all the region's ills,"" he said, adding that they stemmed instead from ""ruthless neoliberal policies"".
Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said in November that Washington would take a tougher line against Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, calling them a “troika of tyranny.” 
Clad in military fatigues and cap, the 87-year old Castro said on Tuesday that Cuba had proven throughout six decades of revolution it could not be intimidated by threats. Instead it remained open, he said, to a peaceful and respectful coexistence.
Cuba's true battle this year was an economic one, he added, reiterating comments made at the national assembly in late December by his successor, President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who announced increased austerity for the fourth year running in 2019 in the face of a cash crunch.
""We need first of all to reduce all non-necessary expenses and to save more,"" said Castro.
A decade ago, as president, he introduced a series of reforms to liberalize and boost the centrally planned economy, yet it remains heavily state-dominated and bound in red tape.
A series of external shocks such as a decline in aid from Venezuela and devastation wrought by hurricanes have also dented growth, which is sluggish at best.
Nonetheless, the Cuban revolution is on a secure footing thanks to the transition to a competent younger generation of leaders such as the 58-year old Diaz-Canel, Castro said.
""It is opportune to express the fact that the Cuban Communist Party decidedly backs the words and actions of Diaz-Canel since he took office,"" Castro said.

""The revolution has not aged, it remains young,"" he said.

The Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP)'s Kerala state president P.S. Sreedharan Pillai called it ""a conspiracy by the atheist rulers to destroy the Hindu temples,"" and said his party will ""support the struggles against the destruction of faith by the Communists."" 
""Let all the devotees come forward and protest this,"" Pillai told local television news channels. 
Two women, reported by Reuters partner ANI to be in their 40s, entered the Sabarimala hill temple in India's southern state of Kerala in the early hours of Wednesday, the state's chief minister said, raising fears of a backlash from conservative Hindu groups.
India's Supreme Court in September had ruled that the ban be lifted but Hindu devotees at the temple had defied the court and blocked attempts by women to go to the temple since then. It is unclear how the women managed to get into the temple and avoid devotees who were guarding it.

The United Nations said about 2,500 people had been driven from their homes since early December when clashes broke out with the Arakan Army, one of several groups fighting Myanmar's army that want more autonomy for ethnic minorities.
The Myanmar military last month announced a four-month halt in fighting in the north and northeast of the country in order to kick-start stalled peace talks with the armed groups.
Rakhine, in the west, was excluded from the pause, stoking doubts about the military's willingness to bring an end to all the country's conflicts.
Rakhine was where the military launched a campaign in 2017 that has driven more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims into bordering Bangladesh. Recent fighting has involved the Arakan Army, which claims to represent the Rakhine, the Buddhist ethnic group who make up the majority in the state of the same name.
The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said one policeman was critically injured when border guard police were attacked by about 30 men carrying ""small and heavy arms"" on Tuesday near Saytaung, a village in the Buthidaung area.
Khine Thu Kha, a spokesman for the Arakan Army, denied that the group attacked the police, but said the group did clash with government security forces in Saytaung on Tuesday.
Hundreds of border guard police had been deployed in areas far from the border with Bangladesh as part of a broader military offensive against the group, Khine Thu Kha told Reuters on Wednesday.
""Today the fighting started at 8 a.m."" in another location, he said.
Major General Tun Tun Nyi, a military spokesman, declined to comment.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Monday that 1,500 people were newly displaced by fighting last week in Rakhine, in addition to about 1,000 people displaced since clashes broke out on Dec. 8.
Authorities, along with local and foreign aid groups, were providing aid to the displaced, the U.N. agency said in an update.

The casualties, including young children, were mostly killed when their homes collapsed in landslides after days of heavy rain in several provinces in the central Philippines, said Ricardo Jalad, executive director of the national disaster agency.
""If we don't recover the missing or we recover them dead, that is 105 deaths, which we hope not,"" Jalad said.
The tropical depression, which weakened into a low pressure system before leaving the Philippines on Sunday, brought heavy rain that triggered landslides and flooding in the Bicol and eastern Visayas regions.
Officials put three provinces under a ""state of calamity"" to give them access to emergency funds.
Bicol, with a population of 5.8 million, was the hardest hit, with 68 killed in intense rains and landslides. Damage to agriculture in Bicol, which produces rice and corn, was estimated at 342 million pesos ($6.5 million).
Rescuers, including the police and military, used heavy-lifting equipment to clear roads leading to landslide sites and entered flooded communities using rubber boats.
""The sun is already out, with occasional light rains. We hope floods will subside,"" Ronna Monzon, a member of the operations personnel at the disaster agency in Bicol, told Reuters.

396,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 01:33AM ET</span>",Australia stands by canceling citizenship of Islamic State recruiter despite Fiji challenge,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's government is confident it has grounds to strip an alleged Islamic State recruiter of citizenship, a minister said on Wednesday, as questions arose over whether doing so could be illegal and leave the man stateless.
The case highlights the problems many governments face as they consider what action to take against people who have traveled abroad, often to the Middle East, to join militant groups.
Under Australian law, a person can only be stripped of their citizenship if they are dual citizens, thereby preventing people from being made stateless.
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said Melbourne-born Neil Prakash, who is imprisoned in Turkey, was a dual citizen as he also has Fijian citizenship,.
Prakash ceased to be an Australian ""by virtue of his actions in fighting for Islamic State from May 2016"", and he had been notified of the decision in December, Dutton said.
""The advice to the government based on all the intricate detail and fact of this particular matter is that Mr Prakash is, by operation of law, a citizen of Fiji,"" Dutton told reporters in Brisbane.
""The other point to make is that Mr Prakash is sitting in a Turkish jail at the moment ... Prakash is not coming anywhere near our part of the world any time soon."" 
Prakash has been in Turkey on trial for charges relating to being a member of the Islamic State militant group since being caught there in October 2016.
Australia believes Prakash is a dual national because his father was Fijian. 
However, Fiji's director of immigration, Nemani Vuniwaqa, told Reuters in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) message that Prakash was not Fijian, which could complicate the Australian government's bid to strip him of his citizenship. 
Prakash can challenge the Australian government's decision, Dutton said, and he could be entitled to retain his citizenship if he does not hold dual-citizenship status. 
The government wrongly reported in 2016, based on U.S. intelligence, that Prakash had been killed in an air strike in Mosul, Iraq. 
The government said he had appeared in Islamic State videos and magazines and had actively recruited Australian men, women and children, and encouraged acts of terrorism 
He is also wanted in Australia over terrorism-related activities including a suspected plot to behead a police officer, though an Australian push for his extradition was rejected by Turkey in July.
A spokesman for the Fijian prime minister could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control but will strive to achieve peaceful ""reunification"" with the self-ruled island that has a bright future under Chinese rule, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday.
Taiwan is China's most sensitive issue and is claimed by Beijing as its sacred territory. Xi has stepped up pressure on the proudly democratic island since Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party became president in 2016.
Xi has set great personal store in resolving what the Communist Party calls the ""Taiwan issue"", holding a landmark meeting with then Taiwan president Ma Ying-jeou in Singapore in late 2015, just before Tsai was elected.
Xi spoke at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on the 40th anniversary of a key Taiwan policy statement. He said ""reunification"" must come under a one-China principle that accepts Taiwan as part of China, anathema to supporters of Taiwan independence.
The vast majority of Taiwan's people are clearly aware that Taiwan independence would lead to a ""grave disaster"", Xi told an audience that included Taiwanese business people and senior party officials.
""China won't attack Chinese people. We are willing to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification,"" Xi said. 
""We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures"" to achieve this goal and prevent Taiwan independence, he said.
This, though, was aimed at foreign forces who seek to interfere and the tiny minority of Taiwan independence forces and their activities, Xi said without elaborating in what was likely a reference to the United States, Taiwan's strongest backer.
There was no immediate reaction from Taiwan's government. 
Xi reiterated that China was willing to talk with any party in Taiwan to push the political process - stalled by China since Tsai took office - as long as they accept the ""one China"" principle.
'LASTING PEACE'
He sought to reassure people in Taiwan that there was nothing to fear from Chinese rule, even though most people there have shown no interest in being run by autocratic Beijing.
""After peaceful reunification, Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives. With the great motherland's support, Taiwan compatriots' welfare will be even better, their development space will be even greater,"" Xi said.
Tsai, who says she wants to maintain the status quo with China, said on Tuesday China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect its democratic values.
Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years and has heaped pressure on the island internationally, including whittling down its few remaining diplomatic allies.
Taiwan is gearing up for presidential elections in a year. Tsai's party suffered stinging losses to the China-friendly Kuomintang in mayoral and local elections in November.
Xi was speaking on the anniversary of the ""Message to Compatriots in Taiwan"" on Jan. 1, 1979, when China declared an end to what had been routine artillery bombardment of Taiwan-controlled offshore islands and offered to open up communication between the two sides.
However, the offer was rebuffed by Taiwan's then-president Chiang Ching-kuo, who in April that year came out with a ""three nos"" policy of no contact, no compromise and no negotiation with China.

Chiang only relaxed that in 1987, allowing people in Taiwan to visit China for family reunions. His father, Chiang Kai-shek, fled with defeated Nationalist forces to Taiwan in December 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists.

U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez held a meeting in the Brazilian capital on the sidelines of the inauguration of right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro
The three agreed to hold meetings in the capitals of each country ""to advance the decision process to open embassies in both Tegucigalpa and Jerusalem,"" as well as ""strengthen political relations and coordinate development cooperation in Honduras,"" the countries said in a joint statement.
The right-leaning Hernandez is the latest leader to consider following Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to the contested city of Jerusalem, which infuriated Palestinians and drew international condemnation.
Hernandez told reporters the trilateral talks represented ""an important political alliance."" 
Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, a poor nation of less than 10 million people, over caravans of migrants crossing Mexico heading for the U.S. border. 
Guatemala, another country seeking closer U.S. ties, quickly joined Trump's decision and moved its embassy to Jerusalem just two days after the U.S. opened offices in May. Paraguay also followed, but a new government backtracked in September. 

Netanyahu said on Sunday that Bolsonaro told him it was a question of ""when, not if"" Brazil would move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Western powers on Tuesday condemned election day violence in Bangladesh and described a range of other irregularities that marred a vote in which Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's alliance secured more than 90 percent of parliamentary seats.
The strongly-worded assessments from the UK, European Union, and United States could hit the image of Hasina, who won a third straight term to power following Sunday's election. 
Hasina's opponents have rejected the election result, citing what they describe as widespread rigging and voter intimidation. She has denied impropriety, calling it a peaceful vote that saw enthusiastic participation from her supporters.
The capital Dhaka was quiet on Tuesday, but the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said its workers were being attacked in several areas elsewhere in the country by activists of the Awami League - charges the party denied.
""Violence has marred the election day, and significant obstacles to a level playing field remained in place throughout the process and have tainted the electoral campaign and the vote,"" the EU said in a statement, calling for ""a proper examination of allegations of irregularities"".
The United States, Bangladesh’s largest foreign investor, expressed concern about ""credible reports of harassment, intimidation, and violence in the pre-election period that made it difficult for many opposition candidates and their supporters to meet, hold rallies, and campaign freely.""
""We are also concerned that election-day irregularities prevented some people from voting, which undermined faith in the electoral process,"" it said.
The UK's Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field echoed the concerns, saying he was ""aware of credible accounts of obstacles, including arrests, that constrained or prevented campaigning by opposition parties. ""I urge a full, credible and transparent resolution of all complaints related to the conduct of the elections,"" he said. 
Police say at least 17 people were killed in election day clashes between supporters and opponents of Hasina's Awami League. The two sides, which have competed for power often violently for decades, traded blame for the election day unrest.
Opposition BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam said he was collecting reports of rigging to submit to the Election Commission to demand a fresh vote. The commission already rejected that plea, but Islam said: “What is our alternative?”
JOURNALIST ARRESTED
One journalist was arrested and another was on the run after a local government official filed a case against them for publishing ""false information"" about election irregularities, under a new law journalists say could be used to stifle dissent.
Hedayet Hussain Mollah and Rashidul Islam published reports saying more votes had been cast at one constituency in the southeastern Khulna region than the total number of registered voters there.
They were accused under the Digital Security Act enacted in September. Mollah was picked up by police on Tuesday afternoon while Islam was on the run, police said.
""This is false information that was made intentionally to make the election result look questionable and controversial,"" a police report said. 
The deadly clashes on voting day marked the end of a violent campaign. The opposition said its workers faced arbitrary arrests and candidates were attacked by ruling party activists. The ruling party denied being behind any violence.
“People have shared experiences of being physically assaulted and manhandled at polling stations,” said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International's regional campaigner for South Asia, calling for an impartial probe into incidents of violence.

Hasina, whose father, state founder Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated in a coup in 1975, has alternated in and out of power for nearly three decades with her main rival, BNP leader Zia Khaleda. Khaleda was jailed in February for corruption.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra said on Tuesday he would ask Congress to declare the public prosecutor's office in a state of emergency after the agency's top official removed two investigators at the heart of the probe into a massive graft scandal triggered by Brazilian builder Odebrecht.
Vizcarra, who had been attending the inauguration of President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, cut short his trip to deal with the surprise twist in the Odebrecht case, saying he would return home to fight against ""corruption and impunity.""
Vizcarra said he would personally present a bill to Peru's Congress at 1 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) on Wednesday seeking the state of emergency, and asked for legislative support to usher it through quickly and without conflict.
""We will use all the tools our Constitution contemplates to overturn this decision, and we ask that all branches of government do the same,"" Vizcarra told reporters after meeting with his cabinet and advisers in Lima.
A state of emergency would allow Vizcarra to quickly and efficiently make changes to personnel he deems necessary to advance the investigation.
His move came just hours after Peru's top prosecutor, Pedro Chavarry, removed prosecutors Jose Perez and Rafael Vela, saying the duo had failed to respect authority at Peru's public prosecutor's office, which has overseen the investigation. 
Chavarry's move prompted a public outcry in Peru, where there is strong support for Vizcarra's anti-corruption crusade.
The two deposed investigators earlier this month announced they would seek fines of about $180 million from local companies, politicians and businessmen for taking part in kickback schemes involving Odebrecht construction projects in Peru.
Odebrecht in 2016 admitted in a plea deal with U.S., Brazilian and Swiss authorities that it had bribed officials in a dozen countries, including Peru. 
The team Perez and Vela helped lead has targeted people at the highest levels of power in the Andean nation. Four former Peruvian presidents, the current opposition leader and several local construction companies are all under investigation in connection with Odebrecht. All have denied wrongdoing. 
Chavarry's decision to remove Perez and Vela was announced days after Perez accused Chavarry of allegedly obstructing justice in a separate case involving several judges accused of corruption.
Perez and Vela had also targeted former Peruvian presidents Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Ollanta Humala y Alejandro Toledo, all of whom are under investigation in connection with the Odebrecht scandal.

Vizcarra said on Monday that Odebrecht should not be able to continue working in Peru because the Brazilian construction company had ""contaminated private activity"" and admitted bribing public officials.

Violence between Fulani and rival communities has compounded an already dire security situation in Mali's semi-arid and desert regions, which are used as a base by jihadist groups with ties to al Qaeda and Islamic State.
The government said in a statement that the attackers, who were dressed as traditional Donzo hunters, raided the village of Koulogon in the central Mopti region and that some of the victims were children.
Moulage Guindo, the mayor of Bankass, the nearest town, said the attack occurred around the time of the first call to prayer of the new year and targeted the Fulani part of Koulogon. 
He said another part of Koulogon is mostly inhabited by Dogon, an ethnic group to which the Donzos are linked, less than 1 km (half a mile) away. 
Mali has been in turmoil since Tuareg rebels and loosely allied Islamists took over its north in 2012, prompting French forces to intervene to push them back the following year.
Islamists have since regained a foothold in the north and center, tapping into ethnic rivalries to recruit new members.

Police said the man, who was not named, made racist comments when he was stopped and arrested in the nearby city of Essen after fleeing the scene of the attack.
""A German man deliberately drove into crowds of people ... that were largely made up of foreigners. There was a clear intention by this man to kill foreigners,"" Herbert Reul, interior minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where Bottrop is located, told reporters on Tuesday.
Earlier, police and prosecutors said they suspected the attack, which took place at a crowded plaza, was deliberate and ""linked to the xenophobic views of the driver."" 
They said there was also preliminary information that the man was mentally ill but he had no prior police record.
A police spokeswoman said Syrian and Afghan citizens were among those injured, but gave no further details. She said one of the four people injured remained in hospital.
Earlier the driver had steered his car at another pedestrian, who escaped unharmed, Reul said. He also targeted people at a bus stop after fleeing the scene of the Bottrop attack, but they were not injured, police said.
Horst Seehofer, Germany's federal interior minister, told Bild newspaper the Bottrop case would be carefully investigated, along with an incident that occurred in Bavaria on Saturday in which four asylum-seekers were arrested on suspicion of attacking a dozen people.
""It is a matter of political credibility to pursue both cases decisively and aggressively,"" he told the paper.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that the United States would continue to cooperate with Israel over Syria and in countering Iran in the Middle East, even as President Donald Trump plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said as he met with Pompeo in the Brazilian capital that he planned to discuss how to intensify intelligence and operations cooperation in Syria and elsewhere to block Iranian ""aggression.""
In his first public comments on Trump's decision, Pompeo said it ""in no way changes anything that this administration is working on alongside Israel.""
""The counter-ISIS campaign continues, our efforts to counter Iranian aggression continue and our commitment to Middle East stability and the protection of Israel continues in the same way it did before that decision was made,"" he said.
Trump announced last month that he planned to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, declaring that they had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State and were no longer needed in the country.
In making the announcement, Trump ignored the advice of top national security aides and did so without consulting lawmakers or U.S. allies participating in anti-Islamic State operations. The decision prompted Jim Mattis to resign as defense secretary.
""We have a lot to discuss,"" said Netanyahu, who like Pompeo was in the Brazilian capital for the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil's new president.
""We’re going to be discussing our, the intense cooperation between Israel and the United States which will also deal with the questions following the decision, the American decision, on Syria and how to intensify even further our intelligence and operational cooperation in Syria and elsewhere to block Iranian aggression in the Middle East.""Netanyahu said Israel was very appreciative of the ""strong ... unequivocal support"" Pompeo gave Israel's ""efforts at self defense against Syria"" in the past few days.
State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said Pompeo and Netanyahu “discussed the unacceptable threat that regional aggression and provocation by Iran and its agents poses to Israeli and regional security” and Pompeo reiterated the U.S. commitment to Israel’s security and right to self-defense.
Netanyahu said last month after Trump's announcement that Israel would escalate its fight against Iranian-aligned forces in Syria after the withdrawal of U.S. troops.

Israel sees the spread of Iran's influence in the Middle East as a growing threat, and has carried out scores of air strikes in civil war-torn Syria against suspected military deployments and arms deliveries by Iranian forces supporting Damascus.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2019 08:52AM ET</span>",Baby boy found alive after 35 hours under rubble after Russia blast,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A baby boy has been found alive after 35 hours spent in freezing cold in the rubble of a Russian apartment block that partially collapsed in an explosion, emergency officials reported, calling it a miracle.
The blast, thought to have been caused by a gas leak, damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk on Monday, killing at least seven people with 36 people still missing.
Video footage from the local emergency ministry showed a rescuer worker removing the baby dressed in pink socks and putting a blanket around it before he starts running toward an ambulance.
The current temperature in the city of Magnitogorsk, home to one of Russia's largest steel plants in the Urals some 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow, is -17 Celsius (1.4 Fahrenheit).
The fact that the 11-month-old infant, currently diagnosed with a serious freezer burn and a closed-head injury, was lying in his bed and was wrapped up in layers saved his life, TASS news agency reported, citing a regional emergency center.
The baby was found when a rescuer heard him crying and ""a large-scale operation was immediately organized,"" Interfax news agency reported, citing emergency officials. His removal was difficult because of unstable debris which posed risks for rescuers.
""Hundreds of people were waiting for the appearance of the injured child from under the rubble like a miracle. And the miracle happened...,"" the officials were quoted as saying by Interfax. ""Tears drew in the eyes of the weatherbeaten rescuers.""
The boy's mother is alive and has already arrived to the hospital, Interfax added.
The blast tore through the building in the city of Magnitogorsk, home of one of Russia's largest steel plants, early on Monday morning, a public holiday in Russia, when many residents were asleep. Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said on Monday that the chances of finding survivors were fading.

There have been several similar incidents in the country in recent years due to aging infrastructure and poor safety regulations about gas usage.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is confident of doing well at this year's general election despite the party's recent losses in state polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an interview with Reuters partner ANI on Tuesday. 
""No reason for morale down. We are confident and are moving ahead. In 2019, if there is one party which the country trusts and is connected with the people, it is the BJP,"" Modi said.
India's ruling party lost power in three key states in December, handing Modi his biggest defeat since he took office in 2014 and boosting the Congress party opposition and its allies ahead of national polls due by May.
Modi said it was more important to focus on his government's achievements, including the introduction in September of a new healthcare scheme for the poor.
""In such big numbers people suffering, today they have got treatment, how can I consider this a failure. It is my biggest achievement,"" Modi said. 
He said party has been discussing what it lacked at the state elections but winning or losing was not the only yardstick. The Hindu nationalist BJP was willing to work with regional parties in the run-up to the general election, he said.
""Our effort is to take everyone along, and listen to everyone. I am committed to give importance to regional aspirations. The country cannot be run by ignoring regional aspirations."" 
FARMER RELIEF
Modi said farm loan waivers should be ""definitely done"" if it helps but that was not a long-term solution to the problem of farmer distress.
""What is lacking in our system, that farmer becomes debt-ridden and the governments have to repeat vicious cycle of elections and loan waivers. So solution is to empower the farmers. From seed to market, give all facilities to the farmers,"" he said.
Farmers' anger about low crop prices and their sense that the government has done far too little to address them contributed to the state election defeats. 
The government is now considering three options for a relief package to help farmers suffering because of low crop prices at a cost of as much as 3 trillion rupees ($43.20 billion), three government sources told Reuters last week.
PATEL RESIGNATION
Former Reserve Bank of India governor Urjit Patel had personally written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about wanting to resign, citing personal reasons, several months before stepping down from the office in December, Modi said.
""The governor himself requested (to resign) because of personal reasons. I am revealing for the first time, he was telling me about this for the past 6-7 months before his resignation. He gave it even in writing. He wrote to me personally"".
Patel resigned after a months-long tussle over policy with the government that raised concerns about the bank's independence as the next general election nears.
When asked if there was any political pressure on the governor to resign, Modi denied that was the case.

""No such question arises. I acknowledge that Patel did a good job as RBI Governor.""

408,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2019 08:28AM ET</span>",Former Israeli FM Livni out in cold as left-wing opposition splits,"By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's main left-wing opposition split on Tuesday, leaving one of the country's most prominent politicians, former foreign minister Tzipi Livni, out in the cold ahead of an April general election.
The Zionist Union, the second-biggest faction in parliament, was formed as a partnership between the Labour Party, which is led by Avi Gabbay, and the smaller Hatnua party headed by Livni. The alliance has fared poorly in recent opinion polls.
With a stone-faced Livni sitting next to him at a Zionist Union meeting, Gabbay unceremoniously dumped her.
The shakeup added more drama to the nascent national election campaign, coming just days after a split in Jewish Home, a far-right party in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's current Likud-led coalition.
""I hoped and believed this alliance would bring about our blossoming, a real connection and we would complement each other. But the public is smart, saw this is not the situation and distanced itself from us,"" Gabbay said.
""Tzipi, I wish you success in the election - in any party you're in,"" he said, announcing the split on live television.
The move appeared to catch Livni, a former peace negotiator with the Palestinians and current leader of the opposition in parliament, by surprise.
""I'm not responding. I will make my decisions. Thank you,"" she said, and then left the room.
At a news conference later in the day, Livni said she would soldier on and lead Hatnua into the election, although the party has just five lawmakers in the 120-member parliament, compared with Labour's 19 and Likud's 30.
""What is more important than Labour parting ways with Hatnua is to leave the path on which this government is leading us, so we will be able to separate from the Palestinians,"" she said, referring to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict of which she is a leading advocate. 
Opinion polls predict Likud will win the snap election Netanyahu called for April 9, taking between 27 to 31 seats - enough to lead a right-wing coalition, despite three corruption investigations against him.
Zionist Union was lagging behind Likud and centrist parties, with polls predicting it would capture only eight to nine seats compared with the 24 it holds in the outgoing parliament.

Livni, now 60, served as foreign minister from 2006 to 2009. A former junior officer in the Mossad intelligence agency, she has been a member of several parties and coalition governments since entering politics in 1999.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2019 08:06AM ET</span>",Top U.S. commander in Afghanistan sees peace opportunity in 2019,"By Rupam Jain
KABUL (Reuters) - The top U.S general in Afghanistan told NATO troops on Tuesday to prepare themselves to deal with ""positive processes or negative consequences"" as peace talks between the U.S. and the Taliban to end a 17-year war gain momentum.
General Scott Miller, who commands U.S. forces and the NATO-led non-combat Resolution Support (RS) mission in Afghanistan reiterated the need for a political settlement to end the conflict.
""Peace talks (are) out there, regional players pressing for peace, the Taliban talking about peace, the Afghan government is talking about peace,"" Miller told dozens of NATO soldiers who had gathered at RS headquarters in Kabul for an exercise session.
Dressed in gym gear, Miller participated in a 60-minute open-air morning workout of sprints, squats, burpees and push-ups. 
He did not comment on reports that the United States was considering pulling out almost half of the 14,000-strong force currently deployed in Afghanistan.
A White House spokesman said last week that U.S. President Donald Trump had not issued orders to withdraw the troops. However, the administration has not denied the reports, which have also prompted fears of a fresh refugee crisis.
""Are (the RS) able to adapt? Are we able to adjust? Are we able to be in the right place to support positive processes and negative consequences, that's what I ask you guys to think about in 2019,"" Miller said.
With the help of its allies, the U.S. launched a military campaign in Afghanistan 17 years ago to topple the Taliban government following the September 2001 strikes on American cities.
The longest American war effort has since killed nearly 140,000 people, including security forces, insurgents and civilians, and has cost Washington close to a trillion dollars.
Officials from the warring sides have met at least three times to discuss the withdrawal of international forces and a ceasefire in 2019. However, fighting has not subsided even as diplomatic efforts intensify.
""As long as the Taliban want to fight we are going to fight,"" said Colonel David Butler, spokesman for U.S. Forces in Afghanistan.
He added that 2019 would bring a unique opportunity for peace in the country that has been at war on and off for almost 40 years, since U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas fought to repel Soviet Union forces in the late 1970s.
""Think of this -- 40 years of war has a possibility of coming to an end,"" Butler said.
In their 2018 annual report, the Taliban said they had successfully forced the U.S. to invite them to the negotiating table.

""The Mujahideen defended valiantly...the invaders were forced to review their war strategy,"" the hardline Islamic militant group said in a statement.

410,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2019 08:04AM ET</span>",Afghanistan's neighbors fear refugee crisis if U.S. pulls out,"By Rupam Jain
KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's neighbors, caught off-guard by reports of U.S. plans to withdraw thousands of troops, have begun preparing for the risk that a pullout could send hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing across their borders, diplomats say.
Alarmed by the possibly of a chaotic withdrawal, diplomats from neighboring countries who have been in talks with U.S. officials in Kabul said they were reassessing policies and would ramp up border preparations.
""At this point there is no clarity about the withdrawal, but we have to keep a clear action plan ready,"" said a senior Asian diplomat based in Kabul. ""The situation can turn from bad to worse very quickly."" 
A White House spokesman last week said U.S. President Donald Trump had not issued orders to the Pentagon to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. But the administration has not denied reports that the United States plans to pull out almost half of the 14,000-strong force currently deployed.
The reports come amid an intensification of moves toward peace negotiations in Afghanistan. U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad met Taliban representatives last month and discussed issues around a future troop withdrawal as well as proposals for a ceasefire.
But even among regional powers such as Iran, Pakistan or Russia that have long been suspicious that the United States wants permanent military bases in South Asia, there is no appetite for a sudden U.S. withdrawal, say analysts.
""While the news of a potential U.S. drawdown may be a reason for cautious optimism in the region, they don't want an abrupt withdrawal,"" said Graeme Smith, a consultant for the International Crisis Group.
""All sides recognize that a precipitous pullout could spark a new civil war that destabilizes the region. The neighbors do not enjoy surprises, and the uncertain signals from Washington are causing anxiety.""
The United States, which sent troops to Afghanistan in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington and at the peak of the deployment had more than 100,000 troops in the country, withdrew most of its forces in 2014, but still keeps around 14,000 troops there as part of a NATO-led mission aiding the Afghan security forces and hunting militants.
The top U.S. general in Afghanistan said 2019 was going to be an interesting year.
""The policy review is going on in multiple capitals, peace talks out there, regional players pressing for peace, the Taliban talking about peace, the Afghan government talking about peace,"" said General Scott Miller, the U.S. commander of Afghanistan's NATO-led force, at the Resolute Support mission headquarters in Kabul.
BORDER SECURITY
Pakistan, which was already working to fence its 1,400 km (870 miles) frontier with Afghanistan and deploy a 50,000-strong paramilitary force along the border, is preparing for a fresh influx of refugees in the event of disorder.
""Camps will be set up near the border to manage a fresh wave of Afghan refugees and illegal migrants and Afghans will not be allowed to set up illegal homes in Pakistan,"" said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Afghanistan, which shares borders with Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and China, is already the world's second biggest source of refugees, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that approximately 1.4 million undocumented Afghans live in Pakistan and possibly 1.2 million in Iran.
While thousands of undocumented Afghans were driven out of Iran by recent political and economic turbulence, Iranian officials in Kabul said they fear a sudden U.S. troop withdrawal could reverse that trend.
""We are working closely with the Afghan government to stop Afghans from entering our country. We don't want to use violence to stop them, but a sudden U.S. pullout will lead to a crisis,"" said an Iranian official.
Afghanistan does not share a land border with Turkey, but Afghans enter Turkey from Iran to work as shepherds, farmers or in the construction sector. Many use it as a transit point to try to enter Europe.
""We have not closed our door but the number of illegal migrants is increasing on a daily basis,"" said Mehmet Ozgur Sak, the second secretary at the Turkish embassy in Kabul. 
In 2018, Turkish police say they intercepted 90,000 Afghans who were trying to enter the country with fake documents or with the help of traffickers, double the number in 2017.
As negotiations over the future of the country gather momentum, the Taliban have been trying to reassure Afghans that they have nothing to fear after foreign forces leave.
But there are Afghans who refuse to trust the Taliban's new stance. Sayed Rafi Sadat, a student in western Herat province, said the Taliban would impose harsh laws to destroy democracy.

""If U.S. troops withdraw then there is no hope for the future and we will have to leave the country,"" he said.

""How much dispersion and solitude there is all around us. The world is completely connected, yet seems increasingly disjointed,"" the pope said in his traditional New Year's Mass in St. Peter's Basilica.
In his homily he paid homage to motherhood, saying a world that looked to the future while forgetting ""a mother's gaze"" was shortsighted.
""It may well increase its profits, but it will no longer see others as children. It will make money, but not for everyone. We will all dwell in the same house, but not as brothers and sisters,"" he said.
The New Year's address followed a turbulent 2018 for the pope, whose Church was battered by a torrent of sex scandals across the world that Francis has repeatedly failed to contain.
The sense of crisis was underscored on Monday when the Vatican spokesman and his deputy abruptly and unexpectedly resigned following disagreements on communications strategy.
Pope Francis made no overt reference to the tumult, but called for Roman Catholics to remain rooted to the Church, saying: ""Unity counts more than diversity."" 

He also warned that Church risked becoming ""a beautiful museum of the past"" if people lost ""the amazement of faith"".

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Thousands of demonstrators marched in Hong Kong on Tuesday to demand full democracy, fundamental rights, and even independence from China in the face of what many see as a marked clampdown by the Communist Party on local freedoms.
Over the past year, countries such as the United States and Britain have expressed concerns about a number of incidents they say have undermined confidence in Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy under Chinese rule.
These include the jailing of activists, a ban on a pro-independence political party, the de facto expulsion of a Western journalist and barring democracy activists from contesting local elections.
The New Year's day march included calls to restart stalled democratic reforms and to fight ""political repression"" from Beijing.
""Looking back at the year that passed, it was a very bad year ... The rule of law in Hong Kong is falling backwards,"" said Jimmy Sham, one of the organizers.
Organizers said the march drew 5,500 people, revised down from an earlier estimate of 5,800, while police said 3,200 people were on the streets at the march's peak. 
The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, with the promise of a high degree of autonomy and universal suffrage as an ""ultimate aim"".
While authorities have clamped down hard on the city's fringe, pro-independence movement, that didn't deter around 100 independence activists from joining the march, holding up banners and chanting for the city to split from China.
China considers Hong Kong to be an inalienable part of its territory, and denounces ""separatists"" as a threat to national sovereignty, even though the movement has not garnered much popular backing in the city.
""There will be continuous suppression on the Hong Kong independence movement, but the movement will grow stronger and stronger,"" said Baggio Leung, an independence leader who said several of his members had been harassed by purported ""triads"" or gangsters, before the march.
Last year, in an unprecedented move, Hong Kong authorities banned a political group, the Hong Kong National Party, for its pro-independence stance on national security grounds.
A western journalist, Victor Mallet, was also effectively expelled from Hong Kong, soon after he hosted a talk at a press club by the head of the National Party.
Mallet's visa denial, which the government has so far refused to explain, was criticized by some foreign governments and the American Chamber of Commerce. 
Some protesters carried ""wanted"" posters of Hong Kong's top legal official, Theresa Cheng, criticizing a decision to drop a corruption investigation into Hong Kong's former pro-Beijing leader Leung Chun-ying, without a satisfactory explanation.
""I'm afraid the pressure will continue,"" said Joseph Cheng, a veteran rights campaigner and retired professor who was raising money for a ""justice"" fund for activists facing hefty legal fees for several trials.

""We're going to face a few difficult years, but we must stand firm ... Unlike in mainland China, at least we can still protest.""

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's government cut internet connections and SMS services across the country for a second straight day on Tuesday as the country nervously awaited the first results from the weekend's chaotic presidential election. 
Both the opposition and ruling coalition said on Monday they were on track to win after a turbulent election day on Sunday in which many Congolese were unable to vote due to an Ebola outbreak, conflict and logistical problems. 
Barnabe Kikaya bin Karubi, a senior adviser to President Joseph Kabila, said internet and SMS services were cut to preserve public order after ""fictitious results"" began circulating on social media. 
""That could lead us straight toward chaos,"" Kikaya told Reuters, adding the connections would remain cut until the publication of complete results on Jan. 6. 
The signal to Radio France Internationale (RFI), one of the most popular news sources in Congo, was also down, and the government withdrew the accreditation of RFI's main correspondent in Congo late on Monday for having aired unofficial results from the opposition. 
The various moves reflected high tensions in Congo, where the long-delayed election was meant to choose a successor to Kabila, who is due to step down next month after 18 years in power - and two years after the official end of his mandate. 
Congo has never seen a democratic transfer of power, and any disputed outcome could lead to a repeat of the violence that followed the 2006 and 2011 elections and a wider security breakdown in its volatile eastern provinces.
The opposition says the election was marred by fraud and accused Kabila of planning to rule from the sidelines through his preferred candidate, former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. The government said the election was fair.
In the eastern city of Goma, residents were on edge as they awaited the first partial results, which could come as soon as later on Tuesday.
""If the results during the publication of the presidential results don't reflect the truth ... trouble will break out across the city,"" said Fabrice Shweka, a Goma resident. 
In Sunday's poll, Shadary faced off against two main opposition challengers, Felix Tshisekedi and Martin Fayulu. 
In a statement late on Monday, Fayulu complained about irregularities during Sunday's vote but said he was encouraged by the determination of Congolese to vote despite long queues and voting machines that broke down. 

""I call for vigilance across the board and the general mobilization of all Congolese so that the truth of the ballot box, the sole witness to the will of the Congolese people, can reward their efforts and sacrifices,"" he said.

Thailand has a high rate of gun ownership and gun-related death, but mass shootings are rare.
According to 2016 data from the University of Washington, Thailand had the highest reported rate of gun-related deaths out of 10 countries in Asia. It was about 50 percent higher than the Philippines, which was second on the list.

The $500 million Ramon Airport in the Negev desert will start operations gradually, initially with domestic flights and then likely allowing international flights beginning in March, Liza Dvir, an IAA spokeswoman, said.
She noted that the opening of the airstrip took a bit longer than planned in order to double the amount of parking spaces to 60 planes and to lengthen the runway to 3.6 km to accommodate large aircraft.
""Israel didn't have a second international airport,"" she said, referring to the 2014 conflict with Hamas militants in Gaza where missiles targeted Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion Airport, leading some carriers to cancel flights for a few days.
Israel is hoping the new airport will help boost tourism to Eilat. A number of foreign carriers have already launched winter flights to the Ovda military airfield 60 km from Eilat for Europeans seeking a warmer climate.

Initially, Ramon will accommodate more than 2 million passengers a year with plans for an expansion to 4.5 million.

A witness, a BBC producer who was at the station, said the man was armed with a large knife who linked his actions to ""bombings in other countries"". The suspect was arrested ""within minutes"", police said, and was being questioned in custody. 
Those injured, a woman and a man in their 50s, were in a serious but not life-threatening condition, police said. A male police officer in his 30s who sustained a stab wound to his shoulder was released from hospital early on Tuesday morning. 
Police said they would step up their presence in the city where a suicide bomb attack in May 2017 killed 22 people as they left an Ariana Grande concert.
""Tonight's events will have understandably worried people but I need to stress that the incident is not ongoing, a man is in custody and there is currently no intelligence to suggest there is any wider threat at this time,"" Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said in a statement.
Britain is on its second-highest threat level of severe, meaning an attack is considered highly likely. Security officials say they are facing record levels of work in countering Islamist militants as well as far-right extremists after four major attacks last year.
Sam Clack, the BBC producer, told BBC 5 Live radio: ""I heard the man say, 'As long as you keep bombing these countries this is going to keep happening.'""
""It was very, very scary.""

The cordon at Victoria Station, closed after the attack, will be lifted shortly, the police said on Twitter.

A police spokesman said the driver had been detained and national broadcaster NHK said the man had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. 
He was identified as Kazuhiro Kusakabe, 21, from Osaka, a major city about 400 km (250 miles) southwest of Tokyo, NHK said.
NHK said the suspect had initially described the incident as an ""act of terror"" but later said the attack was in retaliation for capital punishment.
The incident happened shortly after midnight local time on Monday in the popular tourist area of Harajuku, near Meiji Shrine, in central Tokyo.
""I can't believe it, this is a place I'm familiar with, so it's very shocking,"" said Tatsuhiro Yaegashi, a 27-year-old worker in the area.
The street was closed to vehicles at the time of the incident to accommodate the large number of pedestrians making their way to the shrine for New Year's prayers.
TV pictures of the scene on Tuesday showed a gray colored light vehicle used in the attack, positioned across the street. The front of the vehicle was badly damaged and dozens of police and rescue officials were at the scene.
The suspect fled from the scene and assaulted a passerby before he was captured 20 minutes later, NHK said. About 20 liters of kerosene were found in the vehicle.
""I learned about the incident later. But I shudder to think. If the incident had happened five minutes later, I would've been involved,"" a woman who walked past the scene shortly after the incident told NHK.

In a similar attack in 2008, a man who said he was tired of life drove a rental truck into a crowd of pedestrians in Tokyo before jumping out and stabbing several people. At least seven people were killed and a dozen injured.

King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 66, has been serving since shortly after his father died in 2016 following a 70-year reign.
""His Majesty deems it fit to hold the coronation ceremony per royal traditions for the good fortune of the nation and the kingdom, to be enjoyed by the hopeful people,"" a palace statement said.
In the three-day coronation, the king will be officially crowned on May 4 and a celebration procession will be held on May 5. The king will meet the public and foreign dignitaries on May 6, the palace said.
Vajiralongkorn, also known by the title King Rama X, became Thailand's constitutional monarch two years ago following the death of his revered father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, on Oct. 13, 2016.
His official coronation has been delayed until after a year-long mourning period for Bhumibol, who was cremated in October 2017 in a grand royal funeral in Bangkok.
King Bhumibol was revered by Thais during his seven decades on the throne and the deep relationship between the monarchy and the military helped facilitate a smooth royal transition following his death.
Since then, Vajiralongkorn has overseen sweeping changes to royal affairs, including the running of palace finances, which were formerly managed by the government.
Thailand has been a constitutional monarchy since 1932, but the king remains supremely regarded as the spiritual protector of its people and culture.
The kingdom is due to hold elections on Feb. 24, and the current election timeline means the coronation will likely take place before a new government is formed.

The elections are meant to restore democracy after a 2014 military coup ousted an elected prime minister, though changes to the constitution in the interim ensure the military will retain a great deal of control.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2019 12:37AM ET</span>",Taiwan tells China to use peaceful means to resolve differences,"By Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect its democratic values, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Tuesday, ahead of a major speech about the island by Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.
China has heaped pressure on Tsai since she took office in 2016, cutting off dialogue, whittling down Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies and forcing foreign airlines to list Taiwan as part of China on their websites.
China fears Tsai wishes to push for Taiwan's formal independence, though Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo. Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills.
Taiwan is gearing up for presidential elections in a year's time. Tsai's pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party suffered stinging losses to the China-friendly Kuomintang in mayoral and local elections in November.
In a new year's address at the presidential office in Taipei, Tsai said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait needed a pragmatic understanding of the basic differences that exist between them in terms of values and political systems.
""Here, I would like to call on China to face squarely the reality of the existence of the Republic of China on Taiwan,"" Tsai said, referring to the island's formal name.
China ""must respect the insistence of 23 million people on freedom and democracy, and must use peaceful, on parity means to handle our differences"", she added.
China's interference in the island's political and social development is ""Taiwan's biggest challenge at the moment"", Tsai said. China denies any interference in Taiwan's internal affairs.
China views Taiwan as a wayward province, to be brought under its control by force if needed, with no right to international recognition as a separate political entity.
Democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China.
Liu Jieyi, head of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said in his new year's message they had not wavered last year in the face of ""deliberate provocations"" from Taiwan's government.
""Although the way ahead won't all be plain sailing, we have the confidence and the ability to vanquish risks and challenges,"" he said in a statement on the office's website.
On Wednesday, Xi will give a speech to mark 40 years since a key policy statement that eventually led to a thaw in relations with Taiwan, the ""Message to Compatriots in Taiwan"".
On Jan. 1, 1979, China declared an end to what had been routine artillery bombardment of Taiwan-controlled offshore islands close to China and offered to open up communications between the two sides, after decades of hostility.

Chiang Kai-shek fled with defeated Nationalist forces to Taiwan in December 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists.Despite the deep business, cultural and personal links which exist today, no peace treaty or formal end to hostilities has been signed.

421,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2018 11:11PM ET</span>",Brazil to inaugurate far-right firebrand Bolsonaro president,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Right-wing nationalist Jair Bolsonaro, who has vowed to crack down on political corruption, violent crime and ignite a moribund economy with deregulation and fiscal discipline, will be sworn in as Brazil's president on Tuesday. 
The former Army captain and seven-term fringe congressman rode a wave of anti-establishment anger to became Brazil's first far-right president since a military dictatorship gave way to civilian rule three decades ago.
Bolsonaro plans to realign Brazil internationally, moving away from developing nation allies and closer to the policies of Western leaders, particularly U.S. President Donald Trump, who sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to his inauguration.
As a clear sign of that diplomatic shift, Bolsonaro plans to move the Brazilian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, breaking with Brazil's traditional support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian issue.
Backed massively by conservative sectors of Brazil, including Christian evangelical churches, Bolsonaro would block moves to legalize abortion beyond even the current limited exceptions and remove sex education from public schools, opposing what he calls ""cultural Marxism"" introduced by recent leftist governments.
One- of his cabinet are former army officers, mostly fellow cadets at the Black Needles academy, Brazil's West Point, all outspoken backers of the country's 1964-1985 military regime.
Bolsonaro, 63, has faced charges of inciting rape and for hate crimes because of comments about women, gays and racial minorities. Yet his law-and-order rhetoric and plans to ease gun controls have resonated with many voters, especially in Brazil's booming farm country.
His vow to follow Trump's example and pull Brazil out of the Paris Agreement on climate change has worried environmentalists. So have his plans to build hydroelectric dams in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and open up to mining the reservations of indigenous peoples who are seen as the last custodians of the world's biggest forest.
Brazilian businesses are eager to see Bolsonaro take office and install a team of orthodox economists led by investment banker Paulo Guedes, who has promised quick action in bringing Brazil's unsustainable budget deficit under control.
Guedes plans to sell as many state companies as possible in a privatization drive that he forecasts could eventually bring in up to 1 trillion reais ($257 billion).
That would help restore order to government finances. The key measure, however, for reducing the deficit and stopping a dangerous rise of Brazil's public debt will be the overhaul of the country's costly social security pension system.
Pension reform will be Bolsonaro's biggest challenge since he has yet to build a base in Congress, where he has eschewed the political horse-trading that has traditionally helped Brazilian presidents govern the nation of nearly 210 million people.
Bolsonaro may find that lax protection of the environment and human rights could have negative economic effects, more so than those faced by other far-right leaders, given the spotlight on Brazil's Amazon jungle as a protection against global warming and because the country has more murders than any other nation.
""I think they will be good on the economy and they will probably be bad for human rights and the environment,"" said Brian Winter, vice president for policy at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas in New York.

""The key question is whether those things can be separated. Most of Wall Street says 'Yes.' I have my doubts.""

The two countries agreed last month to a 90-day temporary ceasefire in their bitter trade war to give them time to hold fresh talks to try and end a dispute that has seen them level increasingly severe tariffs on each others' goods.
In his message to Trump, Xi said China-U.S. relations have experienced ups and downs but have made historic progress over the past four decades, state news agency Xinhua said.
This has brought huge benefits to the two peoples and has contributed greatly to world peace, stability and prosperity, Xi added.
""History has proved that cooperation is the best choice for both sides,"" Xi said.
Sino-U.S. relations are in an important stage, he added.
""I attach great importance to the development of China-U.S. relations and am willing to work with President Trump to summarize the experience of the development of China-U.S. relations and implement the consensus we have reached in a joint effort to advance China-U.S. relations featuring coordination, cooperation and stability so as to better benefit the two peoples as well as the people of the rest of the world,"" he said.
Trump sent his own congratulatory message in return, saying it was his priority to promote cooperative and constructive U.S.-China relations, Xinhua added.
Xi and Trump also spoke by telephone over the weekend. Trump said he had a ""long and very good call"" with Xi and that a possible trade deal between the United States and China was progressing well.
China and the United States have made plans for face-to-face consultations over trade in January, China's Commerce Ministry said last week.
Xinhua, in a commentary, said it was only natural the two countries would have disagreements and encounter problems, considering their ""different social systems, development paths and historical and cultural backgrounds"".
""At a time when the world is undergoing unprecedentedly profound changes and is fraught with risks and uncertainties, the global community expects even closer collaboration between the two largest economies,"" it said.
This year marks a series of sensitive anniversaries for China, including, in June, 30 years since the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ).

On Wednesday, Xi will make his first public appearance at an anniversary-related event, giving a speech about self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its sacred territory, on the 40th anniversary of a key policy statement that led to a thaw in relations with the island.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May urged lawmakers on Monday to back her Brexit deal, promising that it would allow the country to ""turn a corner"" and let the government focus on solving domestic problems such as housing and a skill shortage.
May made the appeal in a New Year's message little more than two weeks before a make-or-break vote in parliament on her plan for Britain's exit from the European Union which is due to happen on March 29.
The vote, which May postponed in December to avoid defeat, will be a pivotal moment for the world's fifth-largest economy: it will determine whether Britain follows her plan for a managed exit and relatively close economic ties, or faces massive uncertainty about the country's next step.
""New Year is a time to look ahead and in 2019 the UK will start a new chapter. The Brexit deal I have negotiated delivers on the vote of the British people and in the next few weeks MPs (members of parliament) will have an important decision to make,"" May said in a video released by her office. 
""If parliament backs a deal, Britain can turn a corner.""
Attempting to appeal to those within her Conservative Party who have criticized her leadership, and responding to criticism from opponents that Brexit has stalled her domestic agenda, May stressed her desire to move beyond the EU exit debate.
“Important though Brexit is, it is not the only issue that counts,"" she said, highlighting policies to address a lack of housing, skills shortages and strengthen the economy. ""Together I believe we can start a new chapter with optimism and hope.""
The vote on May's Brexit deal with the EU is scheduled to take place in the week beginning Jan. 14. 
May is still seeking reassurances from Brussels that a deeply unpopular fallback arrangement within her proposed deal, over the Northern Irish border, would only be temporary. 
It seeks to prevent the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland if a better solution to keep trade flowing freely cannot be agreed.
The so-called backstop is the main obstacle between May and a victory in parliament, costing her the support of dozens of members of her own party and the small Northern Irish party that props up her minority government. 

The government and businesses are ramping up preparations in case a deal cannot be reached to smooth Britain's exit from the bloc, amid warnings of delays at borders and disruption to supplies of medicines, food and components.

Cutter Rogers, 36, of Carlsbad, and his three children, aged 11 to 14, got stuck in snow in their pickup truck and hunkered down in the vehicle, police said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's FSB state security service said on Monday it has detained an American citizen suspected of spying in Moscow and has opened a criminal case against him.
The FSB said the American had been detained on Friday, but it gave no details of the nature of his alleged espionage activities. Under Russian law, espionage can carry between 10 and 20 years in prison.
A U.S. State Department representative said Russia had notified it that a U.S. citizen had been detained and it expected Moscow to provide consular access to see him.
""We have requested this access and expect Russian authorities to provide it,"" the representative said, without providing details of the identity of the American or the reasons behind his detention.
The English-language service of TASS news agency named him as Paul Whelan. 
David Whelan said in an email that he was Paul Whelan's brother and said that his brother had been arrested. He declined to comment on how he learned of his brother’s detention, his work status at the time of his arrest and whether his brother lived in Novi, Michigan, as address records indicate.
There was online speculation that Paul Whelan had worked for global staffing firm Kelly Services, which is headquartered about a 40 minute-drive from Novi in Troy, Michigan.
A spokeswoman for Kelly said a Paul Whelan had worked for the company until February 2016.
“Kelly has yet to confirm whether this former employee is the same individual reported upon in the news stories,” said Kelly spokeswoman Heather Klee.
Russia's relations with the United States plummeted when Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, and Washington and Western allies have imposed a broad range of sanctions on Russian officials, companies and banks. 

Earlier this month, Russian national Maria Butina pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to a conspiracy charge in a deal with prosecutors, and admitted to working with a top Russian official to infiltrate American conservative activist groups and politicians as an agent for Moscow.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Jim Mattis gave his farewell message to the U.S. armed forces on Monday, telling them to ""keep the faith in our country"" and stand firm alongside allies after he resigned over policy differences with President Donald Trump.
Mattis, who had been seen as a stabilizing factor in U.S. defense policy, is due to transfer authority near midnight to his deputy, Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co executive. 
Mattis, a retired Marine general who has often shied from the spotlight, did not have any sort of departure ceremony when he left the Pentagon, leaving his farewell memo as his final public remarks as defense secretary. Historically, departing secretaries have had a major ceremony. 
In his brief message, Mattis acknowledged the political turbulence in Washington but called on the U.S. military to stay firm in its mission ""to support and defend the Constitution while protecting our way of life."" 
""Our department is proven to be at its best when the times are most difficult. So keep the faith in our country and hold fast, alongside our allies, aligned against our foes,"" Mattis said.
Last week Trump said he was replacing Mattis two months earlier than had been expected, a move officials said was driven by Trump's anger at Mattis' resignation letter and its rebuke of the president's foreign policy.
Mattis had abruptly quit after falling out with Trump, including over surprise decisions to withdraw all troops from Syria and start planning a drawdown in Afghanistan.
Mattis' resignation letter laid bare the growing divide between them, and implicitly criticized the president for failing to value America's closest allies, who fought alongside the United States in both conflicts.
Shanahan, best known for his focus on internal Pentagon reform and his private-sector experience, will take over as acting defense secretary on Tuesday. Trump has suggested Shanahan could stay in the role as acting secretary for a considerable amount of time.
Shanahan has served as the deputy secretary of defense since July 2017. Before joining the Pentagon last year, he spent three decades at Boeing and was the general manager for the 787 Dreamliner passenger jet.
Shanahan is not expected to break from major Pentagon policies, including a new focus on the military threats from China and Russia, which were outlined in the U.S. National Defense Strategy.

""Mr. Shanahan was instrumental in crafting the National Defense Strategy. His ideas, priorities and philosophy are in that document,"" his spokesman, Army Lieutenant Colonel Joe Buccino, said. That document can be seen at https://

PARIS (Reuters) - France's embattled president, Emmanuel Macron, vowed on Monday to press on with his reform agenda in 2019 despite a spate of ""yellow vest"" protests that have challenged his government and extended a plunge in his approval ratings.
Promised overhauls of France's unemployment benefits, civil service and public pensions will be undertaken in the coming year, Macron said in his televised New Year message.
Confounding some expectations of a more contrite message, Macron struck an unapologetic note as he urged voters to face up to economic realities underpinning recently enacted reforms of French labor rules, and others yet to come.
""In recent years, we've engaged in a blatant denial of reality,"" Macron said in the address, delivered - unusually - from a standing position in his Elysee Palace office. ""We can't work less, earn more, cut taxes and increase spending.""
In a veiled attack on the far-left and hard-right groupings active on the fringes of the often violent protests, Macron also decried self-appointed ""spokespeople for a hateful mob"" who he said had targeted foreigners, Jews, gays and the press.
Almost 20 months after he became France's youngest president, Macron's popularity is at the lowest level recorded in modern French history.
It stood at just 24 percent in late December compared to 47 percent a year earlier, according to a Journal du Dimanche aggregate of polls, as he struggled to draw a line under numerous setbacks.
The current wave of demonstrations, which have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major cities, has yet to abate despite fiscal giveaways and a increase in the wage for the poorest workers.
Protesters were expected to join the New Year crowds thronging Paris's Champs-Elysees Avenue overnight, amid a heavy police presence.
A scandal over Macron's former bodyguard Alexandre Benalla, who was eventually fired after video emerged of him beating protesters, has resurfaced with the revelation that he continued to travel on diplomatic passports and exchange messages with Macron long after his dismissal.
Macron said efforts to bolster international controls on immigration and tax evasion would be at the heart of European Union proposals he plans to announce in ""coming weeks"" - to be pursued in parallel with a domestic agenda reconciling ambitious reform with France's commitment to social solidarity.

""This is the line I have followed since the first day of my mandate, and which I plan to keep following,"" he said. ""This coming year, 2019, is in my view a decisive one.""

Netanyahu last week announced a snap election would be held in April, seeking a fresh political mandate that could help him weather possible charges in corruption investigations.
The Israeli leader is enmeshed in three graft cases and denies any wrongdoing. 
Should Israel’s attorney-general decide to press charges against Netanyahu, he would announce the indictment pending a hearing, after which charges could be filed in court.
Asked at a news conference in Rio de Janeiro whether he would bow out of the election race should that happen, Netanyahu said: ""I don't intend to resign.""
""According to the law, the prime minister does not have to resign during the hearing process ... The hearing doesn't end until my side is heard,"" he said.
""Imagine what would happen if a prime minister is ousted before the hearing is finished, and then after the hearing they decide to close the case. It's absurd. It's a terrible blow to democracy.""
The indictment decision had been expected within weeks, but some analysts say the attorney general could opt to delay the move out of concern he might influence the outcome of the election. The Justice Ministry has promised to continue its work ""independent of political events"".
Opinion polls show Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party easily winning the April 9 vote, which was originally scheduled for November.

Netanyahu held the news conference during a trip to Brazil for the inauguration of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday. He is the first Israeli prime minister to visit Brazil.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is recalling two patrol boats from overseas deployments to help deal with an increase in the number of migrants trying to reach the country from France, interior minister Sajid Javid said on Monday. 
Javid said there had been an increase in the number of migrants crossing the English Channel from France and last week he declared the situation a ""major incident"". 
On Monday, following a meeting of officials in London, he said two the additional ships would join three other vessels already working in the channel.
He said 230 migrants had attempted to cross one of the world's busiest shipping lanes in December, although almost half were prevented from leaving France. 
The number is a tiny fraction of those regularly attempting to reach European Union territory by crossing the Mediterranean from northern Africa and Turkey, many of whom are fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
But, their attempts to cross into Britain have attracted extensive domestic scrutiny amid a febrile political atmosphere less than three months before Britain leaves the European Union after a referendum in which immigration was a major theme. 
""This will help both with the human side of this situation but also to better protect our borders,"" Javid said of the deployment.
The last three months accounted for around 80 percent of all attempts in 2018, Javid said, adding crossings were up in 2018 compared to 2017.
The interior ministry said the majority of those who had arrived in Britain in the recent period were Iranian but said it did not routinely publish data and would not be providing a running tally or exact comparisons with previous years. 
Local media reported that 12 people arrived at a beach in southeast England by small boat on Monday.
Javid cut short a holiday to oversee the response to the situation and is seen as one of those jostling to replace Prime Minister Theresa May after she said earlier this month she would step down before the next scheduled nation election in 2022.
Concern over both legal migration and illegal immigration was seen as an important driver of the 2016 vote to leave the European Union.

""I don't want people to think that if they leave a safe country like France, that they can get to Britain and just get to stay,"" Javid said, outlining a desire to work with France to return as many of the migrants as possible.

Officers made dozens of arrests as others looked on from rooftops and armored vehicles with machine guns parked up in surrounding streets. Some in the crowd chanted: ""The people want the fall of the regime,"" a slogan widely used during the 2011 ""Arab Spring"" uprisings that shook countries across the region. 
A stony-faced Bashir later appeared on national television, acknowledging the country was facing challenges and promising to address them - but he stopped short of referring to the unrest.
""Our country is going through difficult economic circumstances that have hurt a large sector in our society due to internal and external causes that you know,"" the 74-year-old leader said.
""We are confident that we are close to overcoming this difficult and temporary period,"" he added in the address, made on the eve of Tuesday's Independence Day celebrations.
The main rally broke up into smaller demonstrations across the downtown area. Later in the evening, police fired teargas at around 200 people in the city's northern al-Shambat district, witnesses said.
Anger over rising prices, shortages of commodities and a cash crisis has fueled protests across Sudan over the past two weeks. According to official figures, 19 people including two military personnel have died in clashes though Amnesty International has said the number may be almost double that.
Activists and rights groups have accused Bashir and his security services of using excessive violence. But Interior Minister Ahmed Bilal Othman said Monday's demonstrations were ""limited"" and handled ""in accordance with the law"".
""While the demonstrations about fuel and bread shortages can be justified, there are entities trying to use them for chaos ... We see that protests are retreating,"" he told Reuters. 
He said 125 policemen had been injured since the unrest began.
ECONOMIC CRISIS
""The opposition's main demand at this stage is the complete change of the regime and the creation of an interim government that achieves political and economic stability in Sudan,"" said Ibrahim al-Lameen, vice-president of the opposition Umma Party.
Zeinab al-Mahdi, the daughter of Umma Party Chairman Sadiq al-Mahdi, was among the protesters detained downtown on Monday, a family member said.
Authorities have shut schools, declared states of emergency in several regions, and detained some senior opposition figures since protests first broke out in the northeastern city of Atbara on Dec. 19. 
Security forces have repeatedly used tear gas, stun grenades and live ammunition against demonstrations, witnesses say.
Sudan has been gripped by a deep economic crisis that began in 2011 after the southern half of the country voted to secede, taking with it three-quarters of the country's oil output.
Opposition groups have accused Bashir, who has ruled Sudan since 1989, of mismanaging the economy and squandering resources. A series of measures, including a sharp devaluation of the Sudanese pound in October, have failed to provide immediate relief.
Members of parliament this month backed a constitutional amendment to extend term limits that would have required Bashir to step down in 2020.
""We are committed to holding free and fair elections in 2020, and we ask that all political powers prepare to participate,"" Bashir said on Monday.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2018 02:12PM ET</span>",New York's Times Square ready for New Year's close-up,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of revelers will jam into New York's Times Square (NYSE:SQ) on Monday to await the midnight descent of the glowing crystal ball that has marked the arrival of the new year in the famed Manhattan crossroads for more than century.
Christina Aguilera, New Kids on the Block and Sting are among the musical performers who will entertain throngs filling the streets ahead of the ball drop, the focal point of New Year's Eve celebrations across the United States. 
This year, the Times Square Alliance, which promotes local businesses and organizes the event, has chosen to honor press freedom after a year in which media has come under attack around the world. 
The nonprofit has designated the Committee to Protect Journalists as this year's official charity honoree, and several journalists will join New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to push the button 60 seconds before midnight, initiating the ball drop.
The tradition of watching a giant ball drop from a pole on top of the narrow building at the crossroads of Broadway, Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan began in 1907.
The current ball, in use since 2008, is a glittering, LED-studded sphere made by Waterford Crystal and Philips Lighting. Weighing 11,875 pounds (5,386 kg) and measuring 12 feet (3.7 meters) in diameter, it sits year-round on the roof of One Times Square, the one-time headquarters of the New York Times at the head of the blocks-long plaza.
Revelers will have hours to contemplate the passage of time. By 7 a.m. police had already lined Seventh Avenue with barricades, assembling the temporary corrals where revelers will be confined for the festivities. Organizers are encouraging to people to show up early, meaning that many will have been standing for hours before the ball drops. The National Weather Service is forecasting a low of 45 Fahrenheit (7 Celsius) and heavy rain.
Umbrellas are banned amid tight security, police say, reflecting concern over the possibility of random attacks.
The New York Police Department will screen people entering the corrals, deploy sharpshooters on rooftops and use radiation detectors throughout the event. It will also use an aerial drone for the first time to monitor the crowds. Manhole covers will be sealed up lest anyone is tempted to use the sewers to sidestep security.

Soon after midnight, sanitation workers will begin clearing away more than a ton of confetti.

434,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2018 02:06PM ET</span>",Turkish TV shows purported transfer of Khashoggi remains,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish pro-government television channel has broadcast video showing men carrying suitcases purportedly containing the remains of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi into the residence of his country's consul general in Istanbul.
The footage broadcast by A Haber shows men carrying what it says were a total of five cases through the main entrance of the residence, a short distance from the consulate where Khashoggi, a leading critic of Saudi policies, was killed in early October.
A Turkish official said the media report, also carried by the pro-government Sabah newspaper on its website, appeared to be accurate, without giving further details.
There was no immediate reply from Saudi authorities to a Reuters request for comment on the footage.
Khashoggi was a royal insider who became a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and began writing for the Washington Post after moving to the United States last year. 
Saudi officials have rejected accusations that the crown prince ordered his death. The murder has sparked global outrage and damaged the international reputation of 33-year-old prince, the kingdom's de facto leader.
Sabah said the cases had been brought to the residence in a black minibus at 3:09 pm (1209 GMT).
After offering numerous contradictory explanations regarding the fate of Khashoggi, Riyadh later said he had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
Khashoggi's remains have not been found and Turkey has repeatedly asked Saudi Arabia where they are. Last month, Turkish police searched a remote villa in a coastal area southeast of Istanbul as part of the investigation.
Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor's office said last month it is seeking the death penalty for five individuals, and that 11 of 21 suspects have been indicted and will be referred to court in Saudi Arabia.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week Ankara was working with other countries to take the investigation into Khashoggi's killing to the United Nations.

PARIS (Reuters) - Emmanuel Macron's former security advisor said he had been in regular touch with the president and top officials since losing his job, contradicting official denials of continued contacts with an aide at the center of a damaging political firestorm.
Alexandre Benalla was fired in July after a video emerged of him beating a May Day protester but Macron was sharply criticized for failing to sack his former bodyguard immediately.
The handling of the case triggered the first major political crisis for Macron, crystallizing the public's view of Macron as a remote figure who favored his rich and powerful friends to the detriment of ordinary people.
Benalla told the investigative journalism website Mediapart that he had been in touch with the president and other top officials via the messaging app Telegram since losing his job.
""It will be hard for them to deny, since all these exchanges are on my mobile telephone,"" Benalla said in an interview published on Monday.
French officials have said there have been no contacts between Benalla and the presidency since the former bodyguard was sacked. A presidency official, who did not wish to be named, on Monday rejected Benalla's version of events.
The official dismissed Benalla's comments as ""a bundle of untruths and approximations"". Benalla's lawyers did not return phone calls seeking comment.
Separately, the French Foreign Ministry said Benalla had illegally kept and used diplomatic passports, despite being asked to return them at least twice. Paris prosecutors have opened a preliminary inquiry into the case. 
Benalla on Monday acknowledged using the passports while doing consultancy work in African countries. He said he had originally handed them in when he was fired but said they had been returned to him through the president's staff in October.
The Elysee official rejected Benalla's account, adding the presidency did not know he had used the passports until media reports last week. 
Benalla's interview comes at a sensitive time for Macron, who was due to give a nationwide New Year's address later on Monday.

Macron is struggling to end a wave of street protests which began as a response to fuel tax increases but which have since grown into a wider backlash against Macron's reform policies.

The army said a patrol boat picked up 28 migrants from a dinghy 71 miles (114 km) south-west of Malta and another 152 packed onboard a wooden vessel close by -- the largest such rescue mission for many months.
On Sunday, a Maltese patrol boat rescued 69 migrants from another wooden boat in distress south-west of the small Mediterranean island.
However, a further 49 migrants remained blocked at sea days after they were picked up by two NGO rescue ships, with both Malta and Italy refusing to take them in as part of a concerted European effort to halt migration flows from Africa.
The Sea-Watch 3 rescued 32 people on December 22 while the Sea-Eye's Professor Albrecht Penck rescued 17 people on Saturday. Both boats are operated by German NGOs.
Jan Ribbeck, head of mission on the Professor Albrecht Penck vessel, said maritime law stated that rescued people had to be moved to land as soon as possible. 
""It is utterly unscrupulous that no single European state is taking this responsibility,"" he said in a statement, urging nearby Malta to take in the migrants for eventual redistribution among several EU countries, as has happened in the past.
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) also called for the migrants to be allowed into a safe port before forecast bad weather arrived.
""States need to implement a regional arrangement that provides shipmasters with clarity and predictability on where to disembark refugees and migrants rescued in the Mediterranean,” the U.N. refugee body said in a statement.
Italy this year led the way into clamping down on migrants seeking to come to Europe in search of a better life. It has barred NGO rescue boats from docking in Italian ports and offered more help to Libya to prevent people from leaving.
According to latest data provided by the Italian government on Dec. 28, some 12,977 migrants entered Italy this year via boats from Libya, down 87.9 percent on 2017 levels and 92.8 percent on 2016.

437,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2018 11:34AM ET</span>",Iran's Revolutionary Guards plan to upgrade speed boats with stealth technology,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran's Revolutionary Guards said on Monday they plan to upgrade their speed boats in the Gulf with radar-evading stealth technology and new missile launchers as tensions rise between Tehran and Washington in the vital oil shipping route. 
Ending a long absence of U.S. aircraft carriers in the region, the USS John C. Stennis entered the Gulf last week, and was shadowed by the Revolutionary Guards' speed boats.
There have been periodic confrontations between the Revolutionary Guards vessels and U.S. military in the Gulf, although the number of incidents has dropped in recent months.
""We are trying to increase the agility of the Guards' speed boats and equip them with stealth technology to facilitate their operations,"" Alireza Tangsiri, the Revolutionary Guards' navy chief, was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.
Tangsiri also said the speed boats will be equipped with new missiles, and their speed will reach 80 knots per hour. 
He did not elaborate on whether Iran had already mastered these technologies or if they were still in the study phase.
Iran says it has been developing its own stealth technology for fighter jets and vessels, but the prototypes it has unveiled in recent years have mostly been met with derision by defense experts.
The Revolutionary Guards last week launched war games in the Gulf, where third of the world’s sea-borne oil passes through, and warned that its forces were ready to respond to any hostile U.S. action.
In an indirect threat to Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the region, the head of the Iranian armed forces warned that any Iranian confrontation with U.S. forces might also target Gulf nations that he said had invited them into the region.
""Iran’s regional enemies should know that alongside a pacifist doctrine, Iran has a powerful military force that are ready to protect Iran’s territorial integrity, and also hold accountable countries that proposed (the U.S. presence),"" Major General Mohammad Bagheri was quoted as saying by Fars news agency.
A U.S.-Iranian war of words has escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump took Washington out of a world powers’ nuclear deal with Iran in May, and reimposed sanctions on its banking and energy sectors.
Iran has warned that if it cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressure, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf.

The Guards’ naval arm lacks a strong conventional fleet. However, it has many speed boats and portable anti-ship missile launchers, and can lay mines.

Arab states, including some that once backed rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, are seeking to reconcile with him after decisive gains by his forces in the war, aiming to expand their clout in Syria at the expense of non-Arab Turkey and Iran.
The United Arab Emirates re-opened its embassy in Damascus last Thursday and Bahrain said the next day that its embassy there and the Syrian diplomatic mission in Manama had been operating ""without interruption"".
Kuwait's Deputy foreign minister Khaled Al-Jarallah said the Gulf state remained committed to the Arab League's decision and would reopen its embassy in Damascus once the organization allowed it.
Jarallah expected a ""thaw in relations between Syria and Arab Gulf states in the coming days as more nations look to reopen their embassies in Damascus,"" state news agency KUNA reported.
Arab League's permanent representatives are due to meet in Cairo on Jan. 6.
U.S-allied Gulf Arab states were the main regional backers of armed groups opposed to Assad, providing finance or weapons or both, acting largely as part of a program of support for the armed opposition coordinated by Washington.
Unlike its other neighbors, Kuwait kept Syria's embassy in Kuwait City open and opposed arming the rebels, although private donors in Kuwait sent funds to anti-Assad forces. Kuwait has led a humanitarian fundraising campaign for Syria through the United Nations.
An Arab diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters last week he believed a majority of members wanted Syria to be readmitted.
Syria's membership of the Arab League was suspended in 2011 in response to the government's violent crackdown on ""Arab Spring"" protests. For Syria to be reinstated, the Arab League must reach a consensus.

The 20-year-old, who is unbeaten in professional kickboxing and mixed martial arts, was sent crashing to the canvas three times in the first round by Mayweather, leading the Japanese fighter's corner to throw in the towel. 
The fight topped the bill for the prestigious New Year's Eve event promoted by Rizin, one of Asia's fast-growing mixed martial arts organizations, at the Saitama Super Arena, and though it has drawn international attention, it was little more than a shrewd branding move for all concerned.
But for Mayweather, it was about more than just entertainment - the 41-year-old American intimated on Instagram that he would be paid nine million dollars for the fight, which was scheduled for three rounds. 
Fought at a weight limit of 147 pounds, there were no judges in attendance and the fight does not count toward the professional record of either fighter. 
Mayweather's August 2017 knockout victory in a boxing match against brash Irish mixed martial artist Conor McGregor ignited speculation that he would cross over into the world of MMA, but the Rizin bout was strictly limited to punches. 
There was less than an hour left in 2018 as first Tenshin and then Mayweather made their way down the long ramp to the ring just after 11 pm local time, accompanied by their entourages and with loud music booming around the arena.
Prowling the ring and smiling for the cameras as the American national anthem was sung, Mayweather continued grinning after the bout began.
Although Tenshin connected with one early shot, he offered no real resistance as Mayweather used all his guile and enormous power to rip shots to the body and head at will.
""It was all about entertainment - we had fun,"" Mayweather said in the ring following his win. 

""The fans in Japan, they wanted this to happen, so I said why not. Once again, I'm still retired, I'm still 50-0, Tenshin is a great champion,"" he added.

ROME (Reuters) - The ruling 5-Star Movement expelled four parliamentarians from the party on Monday, including a former coast guard official who once famously ordered the captain of a sinking cruise liner to return to his doomed ship.
The announcement underscored 5-Star's determination to instill discipline in its ranks, even if it means weakening its fragile majority in the upper house Senate.
The party said in a statement that senators Gregorio De Falco and Saverio De Bonis, along with European parliamentarians Giulia Moi and Marco Valli, had violated various internal 5-Star rules and had to leave the group immediately.
""Everyone is important, nobody is indispensable,"" 5-Star leader and Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Twitter. ""Whoever does not support the government contract is out of the Movement. Respect for the electorate comes first.""
The decision means the ruling coalition, made up of 5-Star and the League, has just 167 seats in the 320-seat Senate.
De Falco signed up to the 5-Star cause earlier this year in what was seen as a major catch for the anti-establishment party, He subsequently won a Senate seat in a March national election.
A former coast guard officer, De Falco was hailed as a hero in January 2012 when he confronted Francesco Schettino, who had sailed his cruise liner the Costa Concordia onto rocks off an Italian island and then abandoned the sinking ship.
""Go back on board, damn it!"" De Falco yelled at Schettino during a radio exchange that was made public. Schettino was subsequently sentenced to 16 years in jail for his role in the maritime disaster that killed 32 people.
Since entering the Senate, De Falco has struggled to bow to party diktat.
He voted against a bill promoted by 5-Star's partner, the League, which clamped down on asylum rights. He voiced opposition to other government measures, and this week criticized the coalition for ramming its 2019 budget through parliament with only very limited debate.
""I am very sorry and did not expect this,"" De Falco said on Monday after hearing of his expulsion.
Speaking to Reuters in November, De Falco dismissed suggestions he was too outspoken to remain within 5-Star. ""This is a democracy. It would be unthinkable to remove someone simply for speaking their mind.""
De Bonis was also opposed to the League's security law and skipped the parliamentary vote. He additionally fell foul of the party leadership when it was revealed that a court had found him guilty of an administrative error in 2004 and ordered him to pay 2,775 euros ($3,170) in damages.

Critics said the conviction should have prevented him from running for the party, which has sought to present a squeaky clean image to the electorate. De Bonis denied this, arguing it was not a criminal case and not a final verdict.

German media reported that Adnan Sutcu, 56, was detained shortly after arriving in Ankara on Dec. 27 to attend his mother's funeral. 
According to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and other outlets, the authorities accused Sutcu of writing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts calling for an independent Kurdistan, which is illegal in Turkey. 
Sutcu was questioned by police and then released, but told to report to authorities daily and not to leave the country before a court reviews his case next year, the reports said.
""We are aware of the case and the embassy is providing consular aid,"" a source at the German foreign ministry said.
The ministry source said 49 Germans are currently jailed in Turkey, including five held for ""apparently political reasons"".
Reuters could not reach officials at the Turkey's justice ministry for comment.
Sutcu, who has lived in Germany for decades, told the media outlets he had never supported a terrorist organization, and it was unclear which group he was accused of backing.
According to a summary of Sutcu's interrogation, he told Turkish officials he could not remember if he had posted the messages on Facebook and said he rejected violence. 
The Turkish state has been waging a war for decades against the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast, a conflict that has intensified since a ceasefire collapsed in 2015. The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and the European Union.

Senior government officials said the main reasons for the surge in the amount of toxic smog trapped over New Delhi were unusually cold air, including fog, and slow wind speeds.
Click here for an interactive Reuters graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/2GORiU9 on the link between Delhi's pollution and falling temperatures and wind speeds.
The World Health Organization said this year India was home to the world's 14 most polluted cities. New Delhi was ranked the sixth most polluted.
In the city on Sunday, levels of PM 2.5, the amount of tiny particulate matter under 2.5 micrograms found in every cubic meter of air, were at 415, well above ""hazardous"" levels, as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency says any level above 35 can be unhealthy.
Pollution levels were exacerbated because of fumes from vehicles, pollutants from coal-fired power plants and industries, as well as smoke from fires being burned to keep people warm.
In October and November, crop residue burning in the neighboring states of Haryana and Punjab also contributed to air pollution.

In India, air pollution claimed 1.24 million lives in 2017, or 12.5 percent of total deaths, according to a study published in Lancet Planetary Health this month.

With less than three months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU on March 29, May plans to hold a vote on her deal in mid-January, after pulling it from parliament this month after admitting its ratification would be defeated. 
She is first seeking ""assurances"" from EU leaders over the so-called Irish backstop, an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between the British province and EU-member Ireland that her Northern Irish allies and members of her own party oppose.

President Hassan Rouhani has ordered an investigation into the accident at Tehran's Azad University that killed 10 students last week. Students have protested over the aging transport fleet and lack of accountability from the authorities.
A video on Twitter showed students at a campus in Tehran chanting slogans and demanding the resignation of the chairman of the university's board of trustees, Ali Akbar Velayati, an aide to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the videos.
Tehran's deputy governor, Abdolazim Rezaie, was quoted as saying by the ISNA news agency that the protests were illegal as no permit had been issued for any gathering. He said the police had full control of the streets and no arrests had been made.
In recent months, Iran has experienced demonstrations in different cities as factory workers, teachers, truck drivers and farmers protested against economic hardship and corruption.
Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, the chief of Iran's hardline judiciary, warned on Monday of a possible repeat of the 2009 protests, Iran's biggest unrest in the last two decades.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican spokesman and his deputy resigned on Monday over disagreements on strategy, ending a year of upheaval in the Holy See's communications structure.
A brief Vatican statement gave no reason for the resignations. Spokesman Greg Burke, an American, tweeted that he and his Spanish deputy, Paloma Garcia Ovejero, had quit to let Pope Francis appoint a new team in what was a ""time of transition"". 
A Vatican source said both Burke and Ovejero had wanted more autonomy from the Vatican department that oversees all communications, known as the Dicastery for Communications.
They quit two weeks after Pope Francis appointed a personal friend, Italian journalist Andrea Tornielli, to become editorial director of all Vatican communications.
The source said it was believed to be the first time both posts had changed hands simultaneously, underscoring the differences of opinion.
""Paloma and I have resigned, effective Jan. 1. At this time of transition in Vatican communications, we think it’s best the Holy Father is completely free to assemble a new team,"" Burke tweeted.
The 59-year-old former Rome-based reporter for Fox News joined the Vatican in 2012 as an advisor in its Secretariat of State and become spokesman in 2016. He is a member of the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei.
Ovejero, 43, a former reporter for the Spanish radio network COPE, was one of the few high-ranking women in the Vatican.
During Burke and Ovejero's tenure, the top two jobs in the Vatican press room were, unusually, held by non-Italians.
Tornielli is now the third-ranking person in the communications department but his closeness to the pope, whom he has known since before the pontiff's election in 2013, will likely make him particularly influential.
Monday's resignations capped a year of tensions in Vatican communications. 
Monsignor Dario Vigano resigned as overall head in March after a scandal over a doctored letter, a public relations fiasco two months after the pope warned of the dangers of fake news.
Vigano released part of a letter by former Pope Benedict that was to have remained private, using it to promote a book on the theology of Pope Francis.
A promotional photo for the book released by Vigano blurred a part of the letter in which Benedict declined to write an introduction, saying he was unhappy with one of its contributors.
Vigano was replaced in July by Paolo Ruffini, ex-head of a Catholic television station.

The Vatican said Alessandro Gisotti, an Italian journalist who has handled the Vatican's social media, would be interim spokesman.

The Houthis control most towns and cities including the capital Sanaa, from where they ousted Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government in 2014. A Saudi-led coalition intervened against the Houthis in 2015 with the aim of restoring his government. 
After hearing that humanitarian food was being sold on the open market in Sanaa, WFP said it found many people had not received the food rations to which they are entitled, and that at least one local partner organization affiliated with the Houthi Ministry of Education was committing fraud.
""This conduct amounts to the stealing of food from the mouths of hungry people,"" WFP Executive Director David Beasley said. ""At a time when children are dying in Yemen because they haven’t enough food to eat, that is an outrage. This criminal behavior must stop immediately."" 
Houthi officials contacted by Reuters did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Yemen's war and the ensuing economic collapse have left 15.9 million people, 53 percent of the population, facing ""severe acute food insecurity"" and famine was a danger if immediate action was not taken, a survey said this month.
WFP is trying to get food aid to as many as 12 million severely hungry people. 
It said its monitors had gathered photographic and other evidence of trucks illicitly removing food from designated food distribution centers and local officials falsifying records and manipulating the selection of beneficiaries. 
""It was discovered that some food relief is being given to people not entitled to it and some is being sold for gain in the markets of the capital,"" the WFP statement said.
Beasley said he was asking the Houthi authorities to stop food being diverted and make sure it reaches the people who need it. 
Herve Verhoosel, WFP spokesman in Geneva, said WFP was looking at the possibility of distributing cash to needy people, if a biometric identification system could be introduced, using personal data including iris scans and finger prints.
He said Beasley had written to the Houthi leadership about the WFP findings several days ago.

Security has deteriorated in the West African country as jihadists seek to increase their influence across the poorly policed scrublands of the Sahel region just south of the Sahara Desert.
Burkinabe authorities are facing security problems from ""the diffuse, cross-border nature of the terrorist threat"", government spokesman Remy Fulgance Dandjinou said following a special meeting of the cabinet.
Last week, ten gendarmes were killed in an attack near the Malian border claimed by Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), an umbrella group for al Qaeda-linked militants in the Sahara.
JNIM claimed responsibility for other attacks this year, including one in the capital Ouagadougou in March that killed about eight security agents and wounded dozens of others.
Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) claimed responsibility for a raid on a restaurant and hotel in Ouagadougou in January 2016 in which 30 people were killed. AQIM merged with other local jihadist groups last year to form JNIM.
Thousands of people have fled their homes as a result of the attacks and reprisals by Burkinabe security forces, Human Rights Watch reported in May.

The group ""Justice for David"" protested on Sunday for the 280th day in a row, demanding the resignations of the Bosnian Serb interior minister and other police officials who they believe covered up the alleged murder of David Dragicevic in March. 
During Sunday's march, which lasted several hours, demonstrators prevented a regional folk star from performing. Special police dispersed the crowd, detaining several people.
""There will be no concerts,"" Mayor Igor Radojicic told a news conference. ""Banja Luka will be mute at midnight for the first time since the war,"" he said, referring to 1992-1995 Bosnian war.
""Those who need to resolve Dragicevic's case should understand this silence,"" Radojicic added, calling on the police and judicial authorities to solve the case and allow life in the town to return to normal. 
Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, who is the chairman of Bosnia's three-man inter-ethnic presidency said the protesters had ""crossed all lines"", adding that he supported a police ban on unapproved protests. 
Residents of Banja Luka were expected to gather in the central square later on Monday for concerts by regional pop stars and a fireworks display, as well as events for children. 
Dragicevic's father Davor has led a daily protest since his son's body was found in a creek in the town after he was missing for six days. He believes David was murdered and that the police were involved in covering up the killing.
His quest has grown into a larger movement of citizens fed up with corruption and what they say is Bosnia's poor rule of law. Smaller-scale protests in solidarity with the grieving father have taken place across ethnically divided Bosnia but also in neighboring Croatia and Serbia.
Police initially said David Dragicevic had committed suicide but later said there was a possibility he had been killed. The prosecution team handling the case have not presented any evidence of murder. 
Bosnian Serb interior minister Dragan Lukac has previously said that the police carried out their investigation professionally. 
The police detained Davor Dragicevic last week over alleged threats to Lukac, later releasing him. 
On Monday, police issued a warrant for his arrest, along with several other protesters who they said caused incidents on Sunday.

Ngaissona, who has been described by prosecutors as the ""senior leader"" of the anti-balaka militia that carried out systematic attacks on the Muslim population in 2013-2014, was arrested in France on Dec. 12.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) says Ngaissona is suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, extermination, deportation, persecution, torture, attacking civilians, and recruiting child soldiers.
Ngaissona, who was elected as a top executive of Africa's football governing body CAF, has denied the charges.
A search was carried out at his French home after he was detained at Charles de Gaulle airport and the investigating chamber of the Paris appeal court has now ordered him to be handed over to the war crimes tribunal, the source said.
The decision is subject to appeal, the source added.
The ICC said on Dec. 12 it had made a request to French authorities for Ngaïssona to be handed over to the court once national procedure had been completed.
Central African Republic has been mired by inter-communal violence since 2013 after a coalition of mostly northern rebels known as Seleka, seized power in March 2013. Their brutal rule gave rise to the mostly Christian anti-balaka militia.
Despite the presence of thousands United Nations peacekeepers and a presidential election, tit-for-tat violence has continued and thousands have died due to the conflict. 
The ICC has said it is investigating crimes committed by all parties in the conflict including the Seleka rebels. 
In November, another leader of the anti-balaka militia Alfred Yekatom, a sitting member of the country's parliament once nicknamed ""Rambo"", was arrested and handed to The Hague court.

GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - Relatives of at least 15 Indian miners trapped in a ""rat-hole"" mine for 18 days said on Monday they have given up hope that any of them would be found alive, even as rescue operations were stepped up. 
""We want his body back so that we can give him a decent burial,"" said the uncle of 26-year old Omar Ali, who is among those trapped in the mine.
The miners were trapped on Dec. 13, when an illegal mine in India's northeastern Meghalaya state, was flooded.
Thousands of workers, including children, have been killed in so-called rat-hole mining, which involves miners crawling into narrow shafts on bamboo ladders to mine for low-quality coal, in Meghalaya.
The state banned such unregulated mining in 2014 but it still goes on in some places.
A survivor of the disaster, Sayeb Ali, 24, said he too thought there was little chance of anyone coming out alive.
He said 17 miners were trapped in the accident. It was not clear why his figure differed from the government account of 15 miners.
Sayeb Ali said he has survived as he was not deep inside the very narrow mine shaft when disaster struck.
""The people who were digging coal went deep inside and cart-pullers like me and the other four who survived were about eight to 10 feet inside,"" Sayeb Ali, who is not related to Omar Ali, told Reuters by telephone.
India is one of the world's most dangerous countries to be a coal miner, with one miner dying every six days on average in 2017, according to government data.
Government officials said on Monday rescuers have only been able to find three helmets and two axes underground. 
Officials said the navy on Sunday sent 15 divers with cameras and specialist equipment into the mine in an attempt to reach the bottom of the pit, but they had found nothing.

""The problem is there is murky water that entered the rat-hole pit from a nearby river,"" Santosh Kumar Singh, an official with the National Disaster Response Force, told Reuters.

Israel sees the spread of Tehran's influence in the region as a growing threat, and has carried out scores of air strikes in civil war-torn Syria against suspected military deployments and arms deliveries by Iranian forces supporting Damascus. 
Iraq, which does not share a border with Israel, is technically its enemy but was last an open threat in the 1991 Gulf war. After a U.S.-led invasion in 2003 toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim, Israel has worried that the country's Shi'ite majority could tilt to Tehran. 
""Iraq is under growing influence of the (covert Iranian foreign operations unit) Qods Force and Iran,"" Major-General Tamir Hayman, the chief of Israeli military intelligence chief, told a conference in Tel Aviv.
With U.S. President Donald Trump signaling he sought to disengage from the region, Hayman said, the Iranians may ""see Iraq as a convenient theater for entrenchment, similar to what they did in Syria, and to use it as a platform for a force build-up that could also threaten the State of Israel"".
Citing Iranian, Iraqi and Western sources, Reuters reported in August that Iran had transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Shi'ite allies in Iraq. Baghdad denied the findings.
The following week, Israel said it might attack such sites in Iraq, effectively expanding a campaign now focused in Syria.
Hayman predicted 2019 would bring ""significant change"" to Syria, whose President Bashar al-Assad has beaten back rebels with the help of Russia, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah reinforcements, and where Trump this month ordered a pullout of U.S. troops.
""This presence of Iran, with Syria's return to stabilization under a Russian umbrella, is something we are watching closely,"" he said.
Israel has also been monitoring Iranian conduct since Trump quit the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran in May and reimposed U.S. sanctions. The deal placed caps on nuclear projects with bomb-making potential, though Iran denied having such designs. Trump, with Israeli support, deemed the caps insufficient.
""We assess that Iran will strive to stay within the deal but will do everything in order to find ways of circumventing the American sanctions,"" Hayman said.

The U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, called in November for dual national Issam Akel to be released, saying his suspected crime was ""selling land to a Jew"" and his incarceration violated American values. 
Akel was accused of attempting to sell a property in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem without the permission of his business partners or Palestinian authorities. Palestinian officials have not publicly identified the intended buyer.
The Higher Offences Court in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, convicted Akel of ""attempting to sever parts of Palestinian land and annex it to a foreign state,"" the judiciary media office said.
""In light of the conviction, the court handed down a life sentence with hard labor,"" it said. Akel can appeal, a judiciary official said.
The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem declined to comment. Akel's family, which denied the allegations against him, said it was unaware of the verdict or sentence.
Akel was detained on Oct. 10 in Ramallah, an Israeli security official said. 
Palestinian law bars selling land to ""a hostile state or any of its citizens"". It requires the permission of the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, for all land sales in East Jerusalem.
Israel captured the eastern part of Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move that has not won international recognition.
Land sales in the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, are fraught for Palestinians, who see Israeli efforts to buy up land as part of a plot to cement control of occupied areas they seek for a state of their own.
Around 500,000 Israelis live in settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which most countries consider a violation of international law against settling occupied land.

A trade and tourism hub, the UAE is an absolute monarchy which tolerates little public criticism. Mansoor, an electrical engineer and poet, was among five activists convicted and later pardoned for insulting the UAE's rulers in 2011.
He was arrested again in March 2017 at his home in Ajman on charges of publishing false information and rumors, and of promoting a sectarian and hate-incited agenda. 
Mansoor was also charged with using social media to ""harm national unity and social harmony and damage the country's reputation.""
In May 2018 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and handed a fine of 1 million dirhams ($270,000). 
An appeals court in Abu Dhabi upheld both the jail sentence and fine on Monday, the two sources said on condition of anonymity.
Rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW), have urged the UAE to release Mansoor, calling his detention a violation of freedom of expression and opinion.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's opposition said on Monday it expected one of its candidates to win the presidential election based on early vote tallies, but the ruling coalition said it was confident its candidate had won the chaotic contest. 
The competing claims followed a disorderly election day on Sunday in which many Congolese were unable to vote due to an Ebola outbreak, conflict and logistical problems.
After unofficial tallies started to circulate on social media on Monday, most mobile internet connections in the capital Kinshasa went down, residents said, in a possible move by authorities to stop the information from circulating.
Connections were also slow or down in the eastern city of Goma.
Government officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Authorities have cut the internet in the past, saying they sought to stop rumors from spreading during protests. 
The vote is meant to choose a successor to outgoing President Joseph Kabila after 18 years in power and could lead to the vast central African country's first ever democratic transition.
Any disputed outcome could lead to a repeat of the violence that followed the 2006 and 2011 elections and a wider security breakdown, particularly along Congo's borders with Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, where dozens of armed militia are active.
Vital Kamerhe, the campaign manager to opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi, said early counting showed Tshisekedi and the other main opposition candidate Martin Fayulu neck-and-neck in the lead, both with over 40 percent of the vote. 
He said the ruling coalition candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, who is backed by Kabila, had only about 13 percent, although a significant part of the vote remained to be tabulated.
The election is a first-past-the-post system with no run-off. 
Nehemie Mwilanya, Kabila's chief of staff and a member of Shadary's campaign, told a news conference on Monday morning that he was confident Shadary had won, although he did not provide specific figures. 
""For us, victory is certain,"" Mwilanya said. 
Fayulu's camp has not yet provided specific numbers but Fayulu said late on Sunday that Shadary's camp was ""dreaming"" if it thought it was going to win.
The most recent opinion poll before the election, released by New York University's Congo Research Group on Friday, showed Fayulu, a former  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) manager, leading the race on 47 percent.
Tshisekedi had 24 percent and Shadary 19 percent. 
The first partial results are expected from the national electoral commission (CENI) on Tuesday.
Election day was mostly peaceful despite several violent incidents, including an altercation at a polling place in eastern Congo in which at least three people were killed.
More than 1.2 million Congolese were unable to vote in three opposition strongholds, where the CENI canceled the poll last week, citing an ongoing Ebola outbreak and ethnic violence. 

However, in the Ebola hotspot of Beni, an opposition stronghold, residents staged a mock presidential election to show the authorities a decision to postpone the vote there due to health fears was unfounded.

Asked whether a state visit promised by Prime Minister Theresa May last year could be rescheduled to coincide with a commemoration of the end of World War Two in May, Johnson told BBC radio: ""Between you and me, I think that would be a good time.""
Trump visited Britain in July and although it was not a formal state visit after wide public protests, he met Queen Elizabeth.
Brexit marks a watershed in Britain's diplomatic relations with the world as it tries to reshape ties to Europe and bolster its long-standing ""special relationship"" with the United States under Trump's unpredictable presidency.
Asked if Trump would like to come again for a state visit, Johnson said: ""I would think the President would be in favor of it and looking forward to it because that was mentioned when he was over here, so if we can do that it would be, I think, a big positive.""
He said a deadlock in Britain's parliament, which means that it is unclear what shape Brexit will take, meant a solution was necessary. ""The country is in need of leadership.""
Johnson reiterated Trump's view that the United States was looking forward to a ""quick, very massive bilateral trade deal"" after Brexit, but that did not ""look possible"" under the current terms on which Prime Minister Theresa May has agreed a draft deal to leave the EU.

Trump said in November that May's deal sounded like it would be good for the EU and cast doubt on how that would affect US-UK trading arrangements.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli court sentenced a Palestinian to 18 years imprisonment on Monday for stabbing to death a British woman in Jerusalem last year, under a plea bargain acknowledging he is mentally ill.
Jamil Tamimi, 59, killed 21-year-old exchange student Hannah Bladon on a tram as she was going to the church where she volunteered, the court heard. He targeted her at random when she came within his reach after offering her seat to an older woman, stabbing her at least seven times.
""This was not a terrorist incident ... This was a terrible murder carried out by a mentally ill person,"" the prosecutor said, explaining why a life prison sentence had not been sought, according to a court transcript. 
Tamimi's lawyer said the defendant attacked Bladon in a rage at his sons insisting that he stay in a mental institution rather than with them. ""This drove him to stab a person to death so that he would be shot dead,"" the lawyer said.
In the April 14, 2017 incident, Tamimi was overpowered and arrested. 
Dozens of Palestinians who carried out similar attacks, many of them as a political act against Israel, have been shot by security forces or armed civilians. 
Bladon's relatives said the sentence was too lenient.
""For the family, it makes no difference whether this was a terror attack or just another crazed murderer,"" the family's representative, Israeli lawyer Maurice Hirsch, told Reuters.
""They are outraged by the leniency of the sentence. They expected that Hannah's murderer would spent the rest of his life behind bars.""

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has won a third straight term, sealing a landslide with almost all the seats in parliament, officials said on Monday, while the opposition rejected the result as rigged and called for a fresh vote.
Hasina's win in Sunday's general election follows a decade in power in which she has been credited with improving the economy and promoting development, while being accused of rights abuses, a crackdown on media and suppressing dissent.
The government rejects those accusations. 
An alliance led by Hasina's Awami League won 287 of the 298 seats for which results have been declared, the Election Commission said, though it added it was investigating allegations of vote rigging from ""across the country"".
The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which had boycotted the last general election in 2014 saying it would not be fair, won just six seats this time.
BNP leader Khaleda Zia – Hasina's arch rival and a former prime minister - was jailed in February on corruption charges she says were politically motivated. This was the first election in which the BNP campaigned without her.
The rivalry between the two women - both related to former leaders - has largely defined Bangladeshi politics for decades.
Raising minimum wages for workers in Bangladesh's robust garments industry, the world's second-biggest after China's, could be one of Hasina's first tasks, party leaders have said.
Hasina and opposition parties were due to hold separate news conferences on Monday.
'UNPRECEDENTED'
Opposition leader Kamal Hossain said their alliance, the National Unity Front, led by the BNP, had called on the Election Commission to order a fresh vote under a neutral administration ""as soon as possible"", saying the vote was flawed. 
The government has rejected similar opposition demands in the past, and was likely to dismiss this one too.
At least 17 people were killed during the vote, police said, after a violent campaign in which the opposition alleged the government denied it a level playing field.
""We've had bad elections in the past but I must say that it is unprecedented how bad this particular election was,"" 82-year-old Hossain told Reuters late on Sunday.
Candidates reported witnessing ballot-stuffing and vote-rigging by ruling party activists, who also barred opposition polling agents from voting centers, Hossain said.
""The minimum requirements of free and fair election are absent,"" he said.
Hossain said he would meet opposition alliance members on Monday to decide their next step.
However, Sajeeb Wazed, Hasina's son and an Awami League member, told Reuters no one was intimidated into voting for the party and accused the BNP of pre-election violence.
""Overall, there were long lines at polling stations and voting was peaceful ... democracy is stable and flourishing,"" Wazed said by email.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi telephoned Hasina to pass on his congratulations, his government said.
""India warmly congratulates the people of Bangladesh for reaffirming their faith in democracy, development,"" India said, adding that Hasina had thanked Modi for India's ""consistent and generous"" support on development.
'TOO SUSPICIOUS'
Hasina is the longest-serving leader in the history of the Muslim-majority country of 165 million people.
Most international observers, including some from the United States - which had expressed concern over campaign violence - have not commented on the result.
""Certainly, the Awami League enjoys strong constituencies and has support and it can get votes, but for any party to win more than 90 percent of the seats is simply too suspicious,"" said Michael Kugelman, South Asia senior associate at the Washington-based Wilson Center think-tank.
""I fear that this election result signifies that Bangladesh has really become something very closely approximating a one-party state."" 
Human Rights Watch also expressed concern over the election's credibility, while Amnesty International called for an impartial investigation of ""deeply disturbing"" election violence.
Hundreds of opposition workers were arrested in the months before the election on charges that the opposition said were ""fictitious"". Many said they were attacked by ruling party activists, crippling their ability to campaign.
Hasina's government has denied the accusations and her party says many of its own workers were hurt by the opposition. 
Voter turn-out appeared to be thin. The Election Commission is due to declare figures late on Monday.
The commission has said it would hold a fresh vote for one seat where the poll was marred by violence. Another constituency, where a candidate died days before the vote, will also go to the polls in the next few days.
Wazed said on Saturday the next government would try to lift growth to 10 percent, from 7.8 percent in the 2017/18 financial year.
He also said minimum wages in the garments industry, which with sales of more than $30.6 billion generates about 83 percent of exports, would be raised.
Wazed said the government wanted to diversify into electronics. 

India helped Bangladesh win independence from Pakistan in 1971 but Wazed said China, its other top investor, had been ""very proactive"" about investment.

Bahrain, where a Sunni Muslim royal family rules over a Shi’ite-majority population, has kept a lid on dissent since the Shi’ite opposition staged a failed uprising in 2011. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states sent in troops to help crush that unrest.
Rajab, a leading figure in the 2011 pro-democracy protests, was sentenced to five years in prison in February for criticizing the Saudi air strikes and writing tweets accusing authorities of torture.
He was already serving a two-year term over a news interview in which he said Bahrain tortured political prisoners.

In 2019 China will celebrate 70 years since Communist China's founding. Anniversaries are always touchy events in China, where maintaining stability is the ruling Communist Party's overwhelming priority.
Next year brings at least six that could unsettle the party, from June's 30 years since the bloody Tiananmen crackdown to October's 70 years since Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic at the end of an even bloodier civil war.
But it will be self-ruled Taiwan, proudly democratic and claimed by China as its own, that will be the focus of Xi's first important, pre-announced public event of the year.
State news agency Xinhua said on Monday that Xi will give a major speech in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on the 40th anniversary of a key policy statement that led to a thaw in relations with Taiwan, the ""Message to Compatriots in Taiwan"".
Xinhua gave no other details.
On Jan. 1, 1979, China declared an end to what had been routine artillery bombardment of Taiwan-controlled offshore islands close to China and offered to open up communications between the two sides, after decades of hostility.
However, the offer was rebuffed by Taiwan's then-president Chiang Ching-kuo, who in April that year came out with a ""three noes"" policy of no contact, no compromise and no negotiation with China.
Chiang only relaxed that in 1987, allowing people in Taiwan to visit China for family reunions. His father, Chiang Kai-shek, fled with defeated Nationalist forces to Taiwan in December of 1949 after loosing a civil war to the Communists.
No formal peace treaty or formal end to hostilities has ever been signed. 
Taiwan is gearing up for presidential elections in January 2020. President Tsai Ing-wen's pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party suffered stinging losses to the China-friendly Kuomintang in mayoral and local elections in November.
China has heaped pressure on Tsai since she took office in 2016, cutting off dialogue, whittling down Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies and forcing foreign airlines to list Taiwan as part of China on their websites.
China fears Tsai wishes to push for Taiwan's formal independence, though Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo.

Xi said in March that Taiwan would face the ""punishment of history"" for any attempt at separatism, offering his strongest warning yet to the island claimed by China as its sacred territory.

CIGONDONG/JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - As Indonesia reels from the carnage of yet another natural disaster, authorities around the globe are working on how they can prepare for the kind of freak tsunami that battered coasts west of Jakarta this month.
The Dec. 23 tsunami killed around 430 people along the coastlines of the Sunda Strait, capping a year of earthquakes and tsunamis in the vast archipelago, which straddles the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire.
No sirens were heard in those towns and beaches to alert people before the deadly series of waves hit shore. 
Seismologists and authorities say a perfect storm of factors caused the tsunami and made early detection near impossible given the equipment in place.
But the disaster should be a wake-up call to step up research on tsunami triggers and preparedness, said several of the experts, some of whom have traveled to the Southeast Asian nation to investigate what happened. 
""Indonesia has demonstrated to the rest of the world the huge variety of sources that have the potential to cause tsunamis. More research is needed to understand those less-expected events,"" said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton. 
Most tsunamis on record have been triggered by earthquakes. But this time it was an eruption of Anak Krakatau volcano that caused its crater to partially collapse into the sea at high tide, sending waves up to 5 meters (16 feet) high smashing into densely populated coastal areas on Java and Sumatra islands.
During the eruption, an estimated 180 million cubic meters, or around two-thirds of the less-than-100-year-old volcanic island, collapsed into the sea.
But the eruption didn't rattle seismic monitors significantly, and the absence of seismic signals normally associated with tsunamis led Indonesia's geophysics agency (BMKG) initially to tweet there was no tsunami.
Muhamad Sadly, head of geophysics at BMKG, later told Reuters its tidal monitors were not set up to trigger tsunami warnings from non-seismic events. 
The head of Japan's International Research Institute of Disaster, Fumihiko Imamura, told Reuters he did not believe Japan's current warning system would have detected a tsunami like the one in the Sunda Strait.
""We still have some risks of this in Japan...because there's 111 active volcanoes and low capacity to monitor eruptions generating a tsunami,"" he said in Jakarta. 
Scientists have long flagged the collapse of Anak Krakatau, around 155 km (100 miles) west of the capital, as a concern. A 2012 study published by the Geological Society of London deemed it a ""tsunami hazard."" 
Anak Krakatau has emerged from the Krakatoa volcano, which in 1883 erupted in one of the biggest explosions in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunamis and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash.
BROKEN WARNING SYSTEM 
Some experts believe there was enough time for at least a partial detection of last week's tsunami in the 24 minutes it took waves to hit land after the landslide on Anak Krakatau.
But a country-wide tsunami warning system of buoys connected to seabed sensors has been out of order since 2012 due to vandalism, neglect and a lack of public funds, authorities say. 
""The lack of an early warning system is why Saturday's tsunami was not detected,"" said disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho, adding that of 1,000 tsunami sirens needed across Indonesia, only 56 are in place. 
""Signs that a tsunami was coming weren't detected and so people did not have time to evacuate.""
President Joko Widodo this week ordered BMKG to purchase new early warning systems, and the agency later said it planned to install three tsunami buoys on the islands surrounding Anak Krakatau. 
The cost of covering the country is estimated at 7 trillion rupiah ($481.10 million). That is roughly equivalent to Indonesia's total disaster response budget of 7.19 trillion rupiah for 2018, according to Nugroho.
But other experts say even if this network had been working, averting disaster would have been difficult.
""The tsunami was very much a worst-case scenario for any hope of a clear tsunami warning: a lack of an obvious earthquake to trigger a warning, shallow water, rough seabed, and the close proximity to nearby coastlines,"" said seismologist Hicks.
In the Philippines, Renato Solidum, undersecretary for disaster risk reduction, said eruptions from the country's Taal volcano had caused tsunami waves before in the surrounding Taal Lake.
He told Reuters that what happened in Indonesia showed the need to ""re-emphasize awareness and preparedness"" regarding volcanic activity and its potential to trigger tsunamis in the Philippines.
The United States has also suffered several tsunamis caused by volcanic activity, including in Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington, according to the national weather service.
MORE EDUCATION
In Indonesia earlier this year, a double quake-and-tsunami disaster killed over 2,000 people on Sulawesi island, while at least 500 died when an earthquake flattened much of the northern coastline of the holiday island of Lombok. 
In a country where, according to government data, 62.4 percent of the population is at risk of being struck by earthquakes and 1.6 percent by tsunamis, attention is now focused on a continued lack of preparedness.
""Given the potential for disasters in the country, it's time to have disaster education be part of the national curriculum,"" Widodo told reporters after the latest tsunami.
For Ramdi Tualfredi, a high school teacher who survived last week's waves, these improvements cannot come soon enough. 
He told Reuters that people in his village of Cigondong on the west coast of Java and close to Krakatau had never received any safety drills or evacuation training.
""I've never received education on safety steps,"" he said. 
""The system...totally failed.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sent a ""conciliatory message"" to U.S. President Donald Trump amid stalled nuclear negotiations, South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported on Monday.
Kim's ""letter-like"" message to Trump was delivered on Friday through an unspecified channel, the newspaper reported, citing an unnamed diplomatic source. 
The report did not include details about the message but said it related to U.S.-North Korea talks, and was conciliatory in tone.
On Sunday, the office of South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said Kim had sent a letter to his counterpart in Seoul saying he wants to hold more inter-Korean summits next year to achieve denuclearization of the peninsula.
Neither the U.S. State Department nor the U.S. Embassy in Seoul had an immediate comment about the report of Kim's message to Trump when contacted by Reuters. 
Moon's office could not confirm the Chosun Ilbo report. 
""There is a dialogue channel between North Korea and the United States through which they exchange active communication, but I cannot know whether it took the form of letter or something else,"" Moon's spokesman told a news briefing on Monday. 
At a summit with Trump in Singapore in June, Kim vowed to work towards denuclearization.
However, both sides have struggled to make progress on this matter. They are also yet to reschedule a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol after an abrupt cancellation in November.
Pyongyang's state media has credited Trump for his willingness to continue dialogue but has also slammed the U.S. State Department for tightening sanctions.
The stalled negotiations have had an impact on inter-Korean ties, with Kim failing to visit Seoul this year as agreed to at an inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang in September.
The Chosun Ilbo report said Kim wrote in the letter to Moon that he would come to the South ""in the near future"" after giving a New Year address on Tuesday.
Kim's New Year address provides a rare public appearance for the young leader and is closely watched by neighboring countries as it is seen setting the tone for his domestic and foreign policies. 

According to Moon's spokesman, Kim said in the letter to the South Korean president that he was sorry his previously planned trip to Seoul did not take place, expressing his ""strong resolve"" to make it happen while monitoring the situation.

The sheriff's office in Caswell County, North Carolina, said Alexandra Black, who started her job as an intern at the facility two weeks ago, was part of a team doing routine cleaning of an enclosure when she was attacked, local media reported.
One of several lions at the sanctuary, the Conservators Center, ""somehow left a locked space and entered the space the humans were in and quickly killed one person,"" the Center said in an emailed statement.
""It is unclear at this time how the lion left the locked enclosure,"" the Center said, adding that the incident is being investigated.
A sheriff's deputy shot and killed the lion so that Black's body could be retrieved, the Center said.
The sheriff's office said its deputies tried and failed to tranquilize the lion before resorting to deadly force, local media said.
The Center, located on 45 acres (18 hectares) in Burlington, about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Raleigh, said it is home to more than 80 animals, including many large cats. It said it will be closed to visitors until further notice.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 08:21PM ET</span>",Graham more upbeat on Syria troop withdrawal after Trump meeting,"By Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Republican U.S. senator said he emerged from a White House meeting with President Donald Trump on Sunday reassured that Trump is committed to defeating Islamic State even as he plans to withdraw American troops from Syria.
Senator Lindsey Graham had warned that removing all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria would hurt national security by allowing Islamic State to rebuild, betraying U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters of the YPG militia battling remnants of the militant group, and enhancing Iran's ability to threaten Israel.
During a morning television interview, Graham said he would ask Trump to slow down the troop withdrawal, which was announced earlier this month and drew widespread criticism.
An ally of Trump, although he has opposed some of his foreign policy decisions, Graham was more upbeat after the meeting.
""We talked about Syria. He told me some things I didn't know that made me feel a lot better about where we're headed in Syria,"" Graham, an influential voice on national security
policy who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters at the White House. 
""We still have some differences but I will tell you that the president is thinking long and hard about Syria - how to withdraw our forces but at the same time achieve our national security interests,"" Graham said.
Asked if Trump had agreed to any slowing down of the troop withdrawal, Graham said: ""I think the president's very committed to making sure that when we leave Syria, that ISIS is completely defeated."" 
He said Trump's trip to Iraq last week was an eye-opener and he understood the need to ""finish the job"" with Islamic State, also known as ISIS. 
""I think the president has come up with a plan with his generals that makes sense to me,"" Graham said.
Graham said later on Twitter that Trump would make sure that any withdrawal from Syria ""will be done in a fashion to ensure: 1)ISIS is permanently destroyed 2)Iran doesn't fill in the back end. And 3)our Kurdish allies are protected.""
The Pentagon says it is considering plans for a ""deliberate and controlled withdrawal."" One option, according to a person familiar with the discussions, is for a 120-day pullout period.
KURDISH FORCES
Graham told reporters that Trump was committed to making sure Turkey did not clash with the Kurdish YPG forces once U.S. troops leave Syria, and was assuring the NATO ally that it would have a buffer zone in the region to help protect its own interests.
Turkey views the YPG as a branch of its own Kurdish separatist movement and is threatening to launch an offensive against the group, igniting fears of significant civilian casualties.
U.S. commanders planning the U.S. withdrawal are recommending that YPG fighters battling Islamic State be allowed to keep U.S.-supplied weapons, according to U.S. officials. 
That proposal would likely anger Turkey, where Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, holds talks this week.

Trump decided on the Syria withdrawal in a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, ignoring the advice of top national security aides and without consulting lawmakers or U.S. allies participating in anti-Islamic State operations. The decision prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign.

Almost 100,000 eligible Britons sought to hang onto their EU citizenship via a passport from their nearest neighbor this year, up from 81,000 last year and 46,000 in 2015, the year before the Brexit vote led to a sharp rise in applications. 
Anybody born in the Irish Republic or Northern Ireland, or with an Irish parent or grandparent, is entitled to an Irish passport - a total of about 6 million British citizens. They are able to hold dual citizenship.
Registrations for Irish passports in Northern Ireland, whose citizens can hold both an Irish and British passport as the province is part of the United Kingdom, rose by 2 percent in the year to the end of December.
With three months left until the UK is due to leave the EU on March 29, the draft divorce deal reached between both sides is floundering ahead of a planned vote in the British parliament next month, opening up a range of possibilities from a Brexit without a trade deal to calling it off entirely.

In her New Year speech, Merkel said she recognized that many Germans ""bemoaned"" the ruling coalition that took office in March, an alliance of her conservative bloc and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), which has been blighted by infighting.
But she added: ""We will only master the challenges of our times if we stick together and collaborate with others across borders.""
Germany is still feeling the impact of Merkel's 2015 decision to leave open the country's borders to more than 1 million refugees, mainly fleeing war in the Middle East.
Resentment at that decision helped feed the rise of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD), which surged into the Bundestag for the first time at last year's federal election, fracturing the country's political landscape.
Merkel has given up the leadership of her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), but wants to remain chancellor for the remainder of the current legislative period through to 2021 - a goal she referenced again in her New Year's speech.
A poll on Sunday showed a majority of those surveyed Germans who expressed an opinion supported her staying on as chancellor for the full term.
Merkel stressed what she called Germany's values of ""openness, tolerance, respect"" and said the country would work towards ""global solutions"" when it starts a two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council from Jan. 1.
Merkel has sought to defend the Western order on which Germany depends and which U.S. President Donald Trump has destabilized by pulling out of international agreements on climate change and Iran's nuclear program, and with tariffs.
She said she was committed to making the European Union more robust and capable of taking decisions.
""And with Britain, we want to maintain a close partnership despite the withdrawal from the European Union,"" she added.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>",Tough South China Sea talks ahead as Vietnam seeks to curb China's actions,"By Greg Torode
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tough negotiations lie ahead over a new pact between China and Southeast Asian nations aimed at easing tensions in the South China Sea, as Vietnam pushes for provisions likely to prove unpalatable to Beijing, documents reviewed by Reuters suggest. 
Hanoi wants the pact to outlaw many of the actions China has carried out across the hotly disputed waterway in recent years, including artificial island building, blockades and offensive weaponry such as missile deployments, according to a negotiating draft of the ASEAN Code of Conduct (COC) seen by Reuters.
The draft also shows Hanoi is pushing for a ban on any new Air Defence Identification Zone - something Beijing unilaterally announced over the East China Sea in 2013. Chinese officials have not ruled out a similar move, in which all aircraft are supposed to identify themselves to Chinese authorities, over the South China Sea.
Hanoi is also demanding states clarify their maritime claims in the vital trade route according to international law – an apparent attempt to shatter the controversial ""nine-dash line"" by which China claims and patrols much of the South China Sea, the draft shows.
""Going forward, there will be some very testy exchanges between the Vietnamese and China in particular over the text of this agreement,"" said Singapore-based Ian Storey, a veteran South China Sea expert, who has seen the draft. 
""Vietnam is including those points or activities that they want forbidden by the Code of Conduct precisely because China has been carrying these out for the last 10 years."" 
Le Thi Thu Hang, a spokeswoman at the Vietnam Foreign Ministry, said negotiations on the Code of Conduct had made some progress recently, with Vietnam actively participating and other countries showing ""their constructive and cooperative spirit"".
""Vietnam wishes related countries to continue their efforts and make a positive contribution to the negotiation process in order to achieve a substantive and effective COC in accordance with international law, especially the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, contributing to the maintenance of peace, stability and security in the East Sea (South China Sea) in particular and in the region in general,"" she said.
Singapore’s Foreign Ministry, the chair of the 10-nation ASEAN bloc for 2018, did not respond to a request for comment.
“We cannot comment right now but Thailand certainly supports discussion on the single negotiating draft,” said Busadee Santipitaks, a spokeswoman for Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which takes over as ASEAN chair in the new year.
CHINA SEEKS BAN ON OUTSIDER DRILLS
The draft also confirms earlier reports that China wants military drills with outside powers in the South China Sea to be blocked unless all signatories agree. 
In addition, Beijing wants to exclude foreign oil firms by limiting joint development deals to China and South East Asia. Experts expect both elements to be strongly resisted by some ASEAN countries.
""That is unacceptable,"" one Southeast Asian diplomat told Reuters, referring specifically to the suggested ban on military drills with countries outside the region. 
In a statement sent to Reuters, China's Foreign Ministry said negotiations on the code were confidential, and it could not comment on their content. 
The next round of working level talks is expected to take place in Myanmar in the first quarter of next year, the Southeast Asian diplomat said.
In August, Chinese and ASEAN officials hailed the initial negotiating text as a milestone and a breakthrough when it was endorsed by the foreign ministers of ASEAN and China. 
It will be negotiated over the coming year by senior ASEAN and Chinese officials and has not yet been released publicly.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last month called for the pact to be sealed by 2021, a timetable some envoys and analysts are skeptical can be reached.
""There's a lot of tough work ahead - that figure seems to have just been plucked from the air,"" one senior Asian diplomat said.
DEAD LETTER?
The code builds on an earlier declaration on the South China Sea signed between ASEAN and China in 2002.
That document did not prevent the vital international trade route emerging as a regional flashpoint amid China's military rise and its extensive program of island building on disputed reefs since 2014.
The United States and other regional powers including Japan and India are not part of the negotiations, but take a strong interest in the waterway that links Northeast Asia with the Middle East and Europe.  
Several countries, including Japan, India, Britain and Australia, have joined the United States in gradually increasing naval deployments through the South China Sea. They are often shadowed by Chinese naval ships.
Carl Thayer, an expert on Vietnam's military and diplomacy at Australia's Defence Force Academy, said Hanoi was expected to prove a tough negotiator but would need support among other ASEAN members to hold a firm line against China.
The Philippines successfully challenged Beijing's South China Sea claims in an international arbitration case in 2016, but has reversed policy under President Rodrigo Duterte, who has avoided confronting China as he seeks to secure billions of dollars of loans and investments for his infrastructure program.
The 19-page draft remains vague in key areas including its precise geographic scope, whether it will be legally binding and how disputes will be resolved.
Bonnie Glaser, a regional security expert at the Centre for International and Strategic Studies in Washington, said she believed China's more controversial proposals would prove unacceptable to several key ASEAN members, as well the United States and its allies.

""People I have spoken to in the U.S. government say that it is clearest evidence yet that China wants to push the U.S. out of the region,"" she said.

474,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 06:12PM ET</span>",Bosnians demand resignation of interior minister over student's death,"BANJA LUKA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Special police forces dispersed protesters demanding the resignation of Bosnian Serb Interior Minister Dragan Lukac on Sunday over a student's death, detaining several people in the northwestern town of Banja Luka. 
Thousands of protesters accused Lukac and police officials of covering up the truth behind the death of 21-year-old David Dragicevic. During a march lasting several hours in the town's center, the demonstrators prevented a regional folk star's concert from taking place, before the event was canceled.
In the nine months since Dragicevic was found dead in March in a creek in Banja Luka, after being missing for six days, his father, Davor Dragicevic, has held a daily protest in the town square to demand the truth.
His quest has developed into a larger movement of citizens fed up with corruption and with what they say is Bosnia's poor rule of law. Smaller-scale protests in solidarity with the grieving father took place in Croatia and Serbia last week.
The police first said David Dragicevic had committed suicide but later said there was a possibility he had been killed. No evidence of murder had been found by the prosecution team handling the case.
It was not immediately clear why campaigners suspected police involvement, or if the student had been known to officers, but they pointed to the length of time without any resolution to the investigation as reason for suspicion.
""If some ordinary guy killed my child, he would have been arrested a long time ago. It has to be someone very powerful,"" Suzana Radanovic, David Dragicevic's mother, said.
The protesters, who gathered around a heart-shaped shrine raised again in the square on Sunday after it was cleared by police, chanted: ""Resignation"", ""Lukac the killer"", ""Justice for David"".
They said they would block the staging of public concerts scheduled on Monday in celebration of the New Year.
Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik said on Sunday that Davor Dragicevic's demands could not be met because there was no evidence of police involvement in the death. He also said the protests were manipulated by opposition politicians.
""The street will not model political decisions in Republika Srpska,"" Dodik said during his annual news conference, referring to Bosnia's autonomous Serb-dominated region.
Some opposition politicians have been joining protests but have said they were doing so as citizens, not as politicians. Several, including a regional parliament deputy, were briefly detained last week during a scuffle with police who detained Davor Dragicevic over alleged threats to Lukac. 
Police searched Dragicevic's house for weapons and released him after they found no evidence. Lukac said any future unregistered protests would be prevented.
The European Union delegation and the office of Bosnia's international peace overseer expressed concerns about his arrest and urged all sides to refrain from violence.
Bosnian Serb news agency Srna reported that Dragicevic was on the run and that police were searching for him.
A solidarity protest was also held in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, on Sunday, where another father is demanding the truth about what he says is his son's murder.

""This issue has a lot of complications,"" Adel Abdul Mahdi told reporters, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise announcement this month that he will withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq's neighbor.
""If any negative development takes place in Syria it will affect us. We have a 600 km (400 mile) border with Syria and Daesh (Islamic State) is there,"" Abdul Mahdi said.
The premier said the Iraqi delegation had visited Damascus to ""gain the initiative, not just deal with the consequences"" of any future Islamic State (IS) activity emboldened by the U.S. withdrawal. Iraqi news websites said the visit took place on Saturday.
Abdul Mahdi said Iraq sought to move beyond its current arrangement with Syria - under which it launches air strikes against Islamic State militants in Syrian territory - but did not got into more details.
""There are groups operating in Syria, and Iraq is the best way to deal with this,"" he said, responding to a question about the possibility of increased involvement of Iraqi forces in Syria.
Iraqi Shi'ite Muslim paramilitary groups backed by Iran already operate inside Syrian territory against the Sunni Muslim militants of Islamic State. 
Abdul Mahdi has previously said that about 2,000 Islamic State fighters are operating near the border in Syria and trying to cross into Iraq. 
Islamic State was militarily defeated in Iraq in 2017, but has continued to launch guerilla-style attacks on security forces in the north of the country.

Jumana Ghunaimat, Jordan's minister for media affairs and communications and the government spokeswoman, on Thursday walked over an Israeli flag painted on the floor of the headquarters of Jordan's professional unions in Amman.
She was on her way to attend a meeting between Jordanian Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz and union representatives. Razzaz, however, entered the building through a rear door, avoiding having to walk over the flag.
Israel's Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sunday deploring the flag ""desecration"", and said it had summoned acting Jordanian ambassador Mohammed Hmaid for a reprimand and that the Israeli embassy in Amman had also issued a ""sharp protest"". 
The flag was painted on the floor of the building several years ago to encourage passers by to tread on it, a mark of disrespect, unions said at the time.
Despite the neighbors' 1994 peace deal and commercial and security ties, many Jordanians resent Israel and identify with the Palestinian struggle against it. 
Jordan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Qatarneh confirmed in a statement issued via state media that the Israeli embassy in Amman had asked for clarifications over the incident and that Israel had called in the Jordanian charge d'affaires in Tel Aviv to ""discuss"" the matter.
Qatarneh said that Jordan respects its peace treaty with Israel and that Ghunaimat had entered a private building by its main entrance to attend an official meeting.
The flag had been painted at a time when the unions were controlled by Jordan's mainly Islamist opposition, fierce ideological foes of Israel. They have since lost influence and Jordan's professional unions are mostly now run by nationalist and secular parties that avoid party activism.
Still, some union members were unhappy that union leaders had allowed Razzaz to avoid the flag.
""The unions took a cowardly stance by allowing the prime minister to enter from a back door and his aides no doubt told him of the presence of the flag at the entrance,"" Masira Malaas, a leading union activist, said.

On Saturday, the Iranian-aligned movement said it had started to leave the port of the Red Sea city as part of a U.N.-sponsored ceasefire signed in Sweden this month with the Saudi-backed government.
The group said its fighters were withdrawing as specified in the agreement, handing control to local units of Yemeni coastguards who were in charge of protecting ports before the war. These will be under U.N. supervision.
But the Saudi-led military coalition, which intervened in Yemen in 2015 to restore President Abd-Rabu Mansour Hadi, dismissed the move as it fears that the coastguards may remain loyal to the Houthi-controlled Sanaa government after the withdrawal.
""Any redeployment would only be credible if all parties and the United Nations are able to observe and verify that it is in line with the Stockholm Agreement,"" the United Nations said in a statement.
The United Nations said on Friday both parties had agreed to begin opening humanitarian corridors, starting with the key coastal road between Hodeidah and the Houthi-held capital, Sanaa.
However, it said in Sunday's statement that the opening did not take place. Retired Dutch general Patrick Cammaert, the head of a U.N. advance team charged with monitoring the ceasefire, ""expressed his disappointment"" in a meeting with the Houthis at the port of Hodeidah on Saturday.
Houthi spokesmen could not be reached immediately for a comment.
The international community has been trying for months to avert an all-out government assault on Hodeidah, the entry point for most of Yemen’s commercial goods and aid supplies, and a lifeline for millions of Yemenis on the verge of starvation.
Under the Stockholm agreement, both parties agreed on a ceasfire in Hodeidah province and to withdraw their respective forces. 
International monitors are to be deployed in Hodeidah and a Redeployment Coordination Committee (RCC) including both sides, chaired by Cammaert, will oversee implementation. The committee started its meetings this week.
Both parties are due to present detailed plans for a full redeployment to Cammaert at the next RCC meeting on Jan. 1, the United Nations said in a statement.

The alleged assassination attempt comes amid tense relations between the two neighboring South American countries. Duque has been a strong critic of the socialist government of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, who he calls a ""dictator,"" and Maduro regularly accuses Duque of plotting to overthrow him.
In a late Saturday night statement, Arreaza said Venezuela was willing to provide ""the necessary police and intelligence cooperation"" and had asked Colombian authorities for more information on the three Venezuelans arrested. 
Earlier Saturday, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo had said in a video message that there was intelligence indicating ""credible"" plans to target the right-wing Duque, who took office in August. Three Venezuelans were arrested in recent days with ""weapons of war,"" he added.
Colombian authorities are trying to establish any connection between the alleged plan to assassinate Duque and the presence in Colombia of the three armed men. 
Colombia's defense minister Guillermo Botero told journalists on Sunday that two of the men - arrested on a bus in the northern city of Valledupar on Dec. 21 and found carrying two 5.56 caliber rifles - are Jose Vicente Gomez Rios and Pedro Jose Acosta Ovalle, both 22.
A third man arrested days later in coastal Barranquilla was armed with a submachine gun and a grenade, Botero said.
""What's really worrying it they weren't just any guns,"" Botero said. ""The president's security has been strengthened with intelligence and eventually with some additional measures.""
On Sunday Arreaza said on Twitter he was still attempting to get in contact with Trujillo and that Colombian authorities should lose no time in sharing information with Venezuela.

Maduro in September accused the governments of Chile, Colombia and Mexico of helping ""terrorists"" who Venezuela said tried to kill him during a drone attack in early August. The three countries rejected the accusation they were linked to the attack.

The latest ruling means Amal Fathy could be arrested at ""any time"", pending an appeal to Egypt's court of cassation, her husband Mohamed Lotfy said.
She had been detained in May days after she posted a 12-minute video expressing her anger at poor service at a bank, heavy traffic, sexual harassment by a taxi driver and a deterioration in living conditions.
Charged with spreading false news, undermining national security and publishing an indecent video, Fathy was handed a two-year jail sentence and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($557) in September -- though the sentence was suspended pending an appeal. 
Lotfy, the director of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, said authorities had never told Fathy what the charges in the second case - in which she was accused of being a ""member of a terrorist group"" and other offences - related to. 
She was released from pre-trial detention in that case on Thursday on condition she checked into a police station once a week and only left her home for medical reasons, Lotfy said.
Amnesty International called the latest ruling an ""outrageous injustice"".
""The fact that a survivor of sexual harassment is being punished with a two-year prison sentence simply for speaking out about her experience is utterly disgraceful,"" the rights group said in a statement.
Fathy, who has a three-year old-child, is a member of the now banned April 6 youth movement, which played a role in 2011 mass protests that forced President Hosni Mubarak from office.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Brazil's President-elect Jair Bolsonaro told him that it was a matter of ""when, not if"" he moves his country's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. 
The far-right Bolsonaro, who takes office on Tuesday and is hosting Netanyahu and the leaders of other countries for his inauguration, has said he would like to follow the lead of U.S. President Donald Trump and move the embassy. 
But he has come under intense pressure from Brazil's powerful agriculture sector not to do so, as it could hurt Brazilian exports to Arab nations. Despite Netanyahu's comments, a senior official from Brazil's incoming government told Reuters on Sunday no decision had yet been made on the issue.
Such a move by Bolsonaro would be a sharp shift in Brazilian foreign policy, which has traditionally backed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
The Arab League had told Bolsonaro that moving the embassy to Jerusalem would be a setback for relations with Arab countries, according to a letter seen by Reuters earlier in December.
""Bolsonaro told me it was 'when, not if' he moves the embassy to Jerusalem,"" Netanyahu said on Sunday during a meeting with leaders of Brazil's Jewish community in Rio de Janeiro. 
""We attach enormous importance to Brazil, and Brazil in the context of Latin America,"" he added. ""This heralds a historic change."" 
Netanyahu, who met with Bolsonaro on Friday, said that the Brazilian accepted his invitation to visit Israel, a trip that is likely to take place in March.
Netanyahu is the first Israeli prime minister to visit Brazil. 

After he met the Israeli leader, Bolsonaro said that ""we need good allies, good friends, good brothers, like Benjamin Netanyahu.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Sunday defended his agents' handling of two sick children who died in their custody, saying they did everything they could to get medical help for them in difficult circumstances.
The deaths have intensified the debate over U.S. immigration policy as President Donald Trump holds onto his demand that lawmakers give him $5 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. 
The impasse over Trump's border wall resulted in a partial government shutdown that entered its ninth day on Sunday.
CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told ABC's ""This Week"" it had been a decade since a child had died in the agency's custody and that the loss of two Guatemalan children in three weeks was ""just absolutely devastating for us on every level.""
Felipe Gomez Alonzo, 8, died on Christmas Day. In early December, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal died after being detained along with her father by U.S. border agents in a remote part of New Mexico.
On Saturday, Trump blamed Democrats for the deaths of the two children in a Twitter post, drawing criticism that he was politicizing the tragedies.
The standoff over his demand for wall funding will be a test for Congress when it returns this week with Democrats in control of the House of Representatives.
Trump sees the wall as vital to stemming illegal immigration, while Democrats and some Republicans see it as impractical and costly. 
After the death of the second child, the CBP said it will conduct secondary medical checks on all children in its custody, with a focus on those under 10.
Caal was 94 miles (150 km) from a Border Patrol station when she began vomiting on a bus ride to the station, McAleenan said on ABC. He said a Border Patrol agent who was a paramedic revived her there and she was taken to a children's hospital in El Paso, where she died.
In the boy's case, McAleenan said, it was a Border Patrol agent who first noticed he was ill and sent him and his father to a hospital. State officials in New Mexico said on Friday that Felipe had the flu before he passed away. 
""Our agents did everything they could, as soon as these children manifested symptoms of illness, to save their lives,"" McAleenan said.
'VULNERABLE POPULATIONS'
McAleenan said the number of families and children crossing the border illegal has increased steadily in recent months and made up 65 percent of crossings in December. Those families and children are entering a system set up for adults.
""We don't want them in border patrol stations. We want them in a better scenario for these vulnerable populations that we are seeing,"" he said.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, the incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would hold hearings on the deaths and ""the policies that entice people to come.""
A border wall was the last measure listed by McAleenan as necessary to address what he called a crisis at the southern border - after new legislation in Congress, investing in Central American nations to help improve life there, and working with Mexico on a joint plan for handling migrants.
""We need a sober-minded nonpartisan look at our immigration laws to really confront and grapple with the fact that children and families are coming into this cycle,"" he said. ""That's first and foremost.""
Before it can hope to tackle complex immigration legislation, Congress must reach a deal on the critical spending measure.
Graham on Sunday proposed enticing Democrats into supporting Trump's border wall by offering in return a measure providing legal status for 700,000 so-called Dreamers, children who were brought to the United States illegally.
""So to my Democratic friends, there will never be a deal without wall funding and many Republicans are going to offer something as an incentive to vote for wall funding that you have supported in the past,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
However, fellow Republican Senator Richard Shelby warned on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that negotiations were at an impasse and the shutdown ""could last a long, long time.""
Democratic U.S. Representative Hakeem Jeffries said the country needs comprehensive immigration reform and border security.

""But we are not willing to pay $2.5 billion or $5 billion and wasting taxpayer dollars on a ransom note because Donald Trump decided that he was going to shut down the government and hold the American people hostage,"" Jeffries said on ABC.

The council is intended to resolve disputes between parliament and a watchdog body, the Guardian Council. 
Larijani, 57, was appointed by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who also made him a member of the Guardian Council, which vets laws and elections for compliance with Iran’s Islamic constitution, state television reported.
Larijani, seen as one of Khamenei's close allies, will replace former Expediency Council head Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, who died this week at the age of 70.
Washington imposed sanctions on Larijani and 13 other individuals and entities in January over alleged human rights abuses in Iran and support for Iranian weapons programs.
Iran rejects Western criticism of its human rights record as politically motivated and based on a lack of understanding of its Islamic laws.

A judge said on Wednesday that Belgium had to bring back Tatiana Wielandt, 26, Bouchra Abouallal, 25, and the children they had with militants, from the Al-Hol camp where they were being held in a Kurdish-dominated part of Syria.
Maggie De Block, the minister in charge of migration policy, told broadcaster VTM that a distinction had to be made between the mothers and the children.
""The children have not chosen to be born in such circumstances ... Four of the six are Belgian children, they have grandparents here, one child is reportedly very ill. We are responsible for seeing what we can do,"" she told VTM.
She did not specify what the country might do about the other two children.
""The mothers, that's a different story. They have been convicted here. They have contributed to the planning of terrorist attacks here. I think we have to assess the risks and not just willingly accept them.""
Both women were convicted in absentia of being members of Islamic State, and each sentenced to five years in jail by an Antwerp court in March.
Hundreds of European citizens, many of them babies, are being held by U.S.-backed Kurdish militias in three camps since Islamic State was ousted from almost all its territory last year, according to Kurdish sources. 
European nations have been wrestling with how to handle suspected militants and their families seeking to return from combat zones in Iraq and Syria.
France is working to bring back children held by Syrian Kurdish forces, but will leave their mothers to be prosecuted by local authorities, French officials have said.
Paris is concerned that if these minors are left in Syria, they could eventually also become militants.
The Kurds say it is not their job to prosecute or hold them indefinitely, leaving the women and children in legal limbo.
The judge said on Wednesday that Belgium must organize the travel within 40 days after being notified of the decision or pay a daily penalty of 5,000 euros ($5,718) for each child, up to a maximum 1 million euros.

486,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 10:08AM ET</span>",Afghanistan to delay presidential election to July: election body,"By Hamid Shalizi
KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's presidential election will be postponed by three months to July 20 to give authorities more time to organize the ballot, election authorities announced on Sunday, following mounting speculation of a delay.
The announcement follows heavy criticism of October's chaotic parliamentary election, which saw problems ranging from roadside bomb attacks to malfunctioning biometric voter verification equipment, incomplete voter lists and huge delays at polling sites. 
The timing of the election has also been complicated by talks under way between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and representatives of the Taliban aimed at launching a full peace process to end the war in Afghanistan.
The election was originally scheduled for April 20 but Gula Jan Abdul Bade Sayad, chairman of the Independent Election Commission (IEC) said mounting problems had forced a delay.
""April will be very difficult because of the harsh winter and transporting election materials, security, and the budget issues"", Sayad told a news conference in Kabul.
""To better prepare for the vote, we have decided to hold the election in July next year,"" he added.
President Ashraf Ghani had previously insisted that the election would go ahead on time but Shahhussain Murtazawi, a spokesman for the presidential palace said the government welcomed the decision by the IEC.
The delay adds to the troubled history of elections in Afghanistan. Before last October's tumultuous parliamentary election, for which complete results have still not been announced, the 2014 presidential election was tainted by accusations of massive cheating on both sides.
Political maneuvering has intensified in Kabul in recent months with the approach of the election, in which Ghani is expected to seek a second five-year term. He is expected to be running against candidates including his former national security adviser Hanif Atmar and current government Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah.
According to Afghan media reports last week, Khalilzad was considering asking the Kabul government to delay the election by several months and prioritize the peace process.
Ghani's government has so far been shut out of the process by the Taliban's refusal to talk to what they consider an illegitimate, foreign-imposed regime, a position they reaffirmed ahead of the next round of talks expected to take place in Saudi Arabia in January.
Observers close to the Taliban have also said they saw little point in talking to a government that could be replaced in April although it remains unclear whether the change in date will lead to any change in their attitude.
The IEC has announced only partial results of the parliamentary election as recounting continues in some provinces, caused by the large number of complaints about the fairness of the process.
Sayad said parliamentary election for central Ghazni province that could were not able to take place due to a dispute over representation between different ethnic groups, would be held on the same day as the presidential election along with district and provincial council elections.

The survey by pollster Emnid for weekly newspaper Bild am Sonntag showed 45 percent of 507 voters surveyed wanted Kramp-Karrenbauer to play a leading role among Germany's top politicians in the coming year, ahead of Merkel on 40 percent.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, the continuity candidate favored by the party elite, won a tight victory over the more conservative Friedrich Merz in a run-off vote earlier this month to decide the new leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). 
The victory put her in poll position to succeed Merkel as chancellor. 
The Emnid poll showed 33 percent of those surveyed wanted Merz to have as much impact as possible in 2019. 
Merz, who returned from a decade in the political wilderness to seek the CDU leadership, has said he is ready to go back into politics full time and could even serve as a minister.
His narrow loss to Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel's protege, highlighted deep divisions in the CDU that the party is eager to heal ahead of four regional elections next year.
Merkel, German chancellor for the last 13 years, decided in October to step down as party leader after the CDU haemorrhaged support in another regional vote.
A separate survey, by pollster YouGov, showed 43 percent of those questioned wanted Merkel to remain chancellor until the end of this legislative period in 2021, as she would like, with 38 percent wanting her to go early and 18 percent undecided.
Merkel's fate partly depends on her coalition partner, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), whose leaders are under pressure from some in their ranks to pull out of the government and rebuild in opposition.
SPD leader Andrea Nahles said she was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the coalition, which formed in March, but that it had performed better in the last two months. She also sounded positive when asked about working with Kramp-Karrenbauer.
""In the new generation, we can concentrate on the essentials and do good work,"" Nahles told newspaper Welt am Sonntag.

Uttar Pradesh is notorious for communal tensions and crime, and has been plagued by incidents of mob violence in recent weeks.

MANBIJ, Syria (Reuters) - The city of Manbij has switched control more than most places in Syria's civil war.
    With U.S. troops set to leave after President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw them, residents fear others will rush to fill the vacuum, causing more upheaval: Syrian government forces have deployed nearby while Turkey is threatening its own assault on the city.
U.S. forces have underpinned stability in Manbij since Islamic State's defeat here in 2016.
Some 30 km (20 miles) from the Turkish border, it occupies a critical spot in the map of the Syrian conflict, near the junction of three separate blocks of territory that form spheres of Russian, Turkish and - for now - U.S. influence.
While U.S. forces have yet to leave, the consequences of Trump's decision are already playing out in Manbij.
Russian-backed Syrian government forces entered the outskirts on Friday for the first time in years at the invitation of Kurdish YPG militia who fear the U.S. departure could open the way for a Turkish attack.
""We have been living in fear for the past few days and we don't know what is happening and who will enter the city,"" said Ismail Shaalan, 41, who has lived in Manbij since fleeing fighting in the Aleppo area two years ago. 
""Is it the Turks or the Syrians?""
Trump has said the withdrawal will be slow. U.S.-led coalition jets and attack helicopters could still be seen in the skies over Manbij on Saturday. 
Local fighters with the U.S.-backed militia that has held the city since 2016, the Manbij Military Council, were conducting their normal patrols on Saturday wearing red berets and armed with AK-47 assault rifles.
""We survived the war. We will never see worse than Daesh,"" he said, referring to Islamic State, said Abu Hamze, 43, a father of five. But he too is worried: ""We are scared. The situation is confusing."" 
Manbij has changed hands three times since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. Free Syrian Army rebels seized it from President Bashar al-Assad's government early in the conflict. Then it fell to Islamic State which declared it part of its ""caliphate"".
Islamic State was dislodged from Manbij in 2016 by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a militia force spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG and backed by the U.S.-led coalition.
Manbij has been held by SDF-allied forces since then, angering neighboring Turkey which views the influence wielded by the YPG in northern Syria as a national security threat.
Turkish and U.S. forces have been conducting joint patrols near Manbij since November, agreed as part of U.S. efforts to satisfy Turkish concerns.
""PARTIAL"" SYRIAN ARMY DEPLOYMENT
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday Turkey would have nothing left to do in Manbij once the ""terrorists"" leave, a reference to the YPG, which says its forces have already withdrawn from the city.
Turkey says the YPG is indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a 34-year insurgency in Turkey. It has vowed to crush the YPG with help from Syrian rebel allies, some of whom come from places now held by the SDF and are fiercely hostile to the Kurdish fighters. 
Turkey-backed rebels have been mobilizing for an attack on Manbij in nearby areas that have been under Turkey's control since it swept into northern Syria in 2016, part of its effort to roll back the YPG. Erdogan signaled on Friday that Turkey was not in a hurry to carry out the operation.
The YPG, taken aback by Trump's withdrawal decision, called on Damascus on Friday to protect Manbij.
Shortly afterwards, the Syrian army said it had deployed to Manbij where it would guarantee security ""for all Syrian citizens and others present"". 
The Syrian troops did not enter the city but nearby frontlines with the hostile Turkey-backed rebels. 
A military source in Manbij Military Council said discussions with the Syrian government had yielded agreement on the need to halt ""the Turkish occupation of Manbij"". 
The Syrian army's deployment in the Manbij area was so far ""partial"", the source said, adding that further Syrian army deployment into the area would take into account the U.S. presence.
As to whether the Syrian state was poised to restore its authority over Manbij, the source said: ""Committees will be formed later on about how to administer the city.""
The question of whether the Syrian government will return to rule Manbij is of critical importance to many in the city. One primary concern is fear of being enlisted to the army. Yet the return of Assad's rule is seen by some as preferable to the prospect of a Turkish offensive.
""People are scared. They disappeared since rumors started circulating that the Syrian army will enter,"" said Hussein Khalaf, 30, a fruit seller from Manbij with six children.
""I will not stay here if the SDF left. I will go with them wherever they go. We have adapted to them and we found safety under their rule."" 
Yasser Abdulaziz, 31, who fled to Manbij from nearby areas of Aleppo two years ago, said he was tired of war and did not want to be uprooted again with his four children.

""If I have to choose between the Turkish army and the Syrian army I will certainly choose the Syrian army. At the end of the day, they are our fellow citizens ... whereas Turkey is an occupying force,"" he said.

490,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 07:33AM ET</span>",Bangladesh probes vote rigging allegations in election hit by violence,"By Serajul Quadir, Krishna N. Das and Zeba Siddiqui
DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's Election Commission is investigating allegations of vote rigging coming from across the country on Sunday, a spokesman told Reuters, as polling for a general election marred by violence ended and counting began.
Clashes between supporters of the ruling Awami League and its opponents killed at least 10 and wounded more than 20, police said, amid reports that more than three dozen opposition candidates complaining of alleged vote rigging had pulled out of the first competitive poll in the country in a decade.
The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said one of its candidates from Dhaka was stabbed while he was moving around in his constituency. Police said the circumstances of the attack on Salahuddin Ahmed were not yet clear.
The Election Commission said it would act if rigging was confirmed, even as at least three voters in southeast Bangladesh, including a journalist, said they were barred from entering polling booths or were told their ballot papers had already been filled in.
""Allegations are coming from across the country and those are under investigation,"" commission spokesman S.M. Asaduzzaman said. ""If we get any confirmation from our own channels then measures will be taken as per rules.""
Reuters reporters across the country of 165 million people saw sparse turnout at polling booths during the election, widely expected to be won by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, giving her a third straight term in office.
Mobile internet was blocked and the streets of the capital were largely deserted as many had left to vote in their home towns. In nine polling centers Reuters reporters visited in Dhaka, posters bearing the Awami League's ""boat"" symbol far outnumbered those of the opposition.
Mahbub Talukdar, one of the five election commissioners who stirred a controversy last week by saying there was no level-playing field for the parties, told Reuters he did not see any opposition polling agents near the Dhaka booth where he voted, suggesting they had been kept away.
The clashes in the Muslim-majority country broke out between workers of the Awami League and its opponents, led by the BNP of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. At least one of the victims was attacked by a machete-carrying group, police said, adding a man from a paramilitary auxiliary force also died.
Alleging vote manipulation, at least six candidates fighting against the Awami League withdrew from the contest in Khulna, a divisional headquarters 300 km (186 miles) southwest of Dhaka. Media reports said across the country more than 40 out of 287 opposition candidates in fray pulled out alleging vote rigging.
There are 300 parliamentary constituencies in the country.
Rasel, a 34-year-old voter in the southeastern district of Chittagong, said he saw police and some Awami League workers he knew stopping people from entering one polling center.
""They told me that 'voting is going on nicely, you don’t need to go inside'. If you try to enter, you will be in trouble',"" Rasel, who declined to give his second name fearing reprisals, told Reuters by phone.
The local electoral officer said he had investigated the incident and ""found long queue in these centers and people were casting votes with a festive mood"". The Awami League said opposition supporters were wrongly accusing the party.
HASINA CONFIDENT
Soon after voting finished at 4 pm (1000 GMT), Reuters saw polling officials unsealing see-through ballot boxes and pouring the contents onto a blue plastic sheet on the floor of an election booth in Dhaka. TV channels have already started showing election trends and final results will be clear early on Monday.
The BNP boycotted the last election in 2014 claiming it wouldn't be free and fair. The party has been hobbled by the absence of its chairperson Khaleda, 74, who has been in jail since February on corruption charges which she says are politically motivated.
Hasina and Khaleda have alternated in power for most of the last three decades and this is the first election the BNP has contested without its leader.
It stitched together the National Unity Front alliance with smaller parties, but has alleged its supporters and candidates faced attacks and intimidation, including shootings and arrests, at the hands of ruling party activists during campaigning. Some BNP leaders and a European diplomat said they feared the election would be rigged.
Hasina's party dismissed the opposition charges, citing ""one false allegation after another for months prior to election as polls show a landslide victory"" for the ruling party.
""I believe that people will cast their votes in favor of Awami League to continue the pace of development,"" Hasina told reporters in Dhaka. ""The 'boat' will surely win. I believe in democracy and I have confidence in the people of my country.""
But opposition leader Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said a win for his side was ""inevitable if the election is free and fair"".
Hasina has already invited foreign journalists and poll observers to her official residence on Monday.
Under Hasina, the country's $280 billion economy grew 7.8 percent in the 2017/18 financial year that ended on June 30, compared with 5.1 percent when Hasina took over in 2008/09.
Over the same period, annual sales of its economic mainstay, the garment industry, nearly tripled, with garment exports worth $30.6 billion in 2017/18, making up 83.5 percent of total exports. One of Hasina's top jobs if she retains power will be to address demands by garment workers for a higher minimum wage.
At a polling booth in old Dhaka on Sunday, some were afraid to comment on the polls, describing an atmosphere of fear.
A middle-aged businessman who declined to be named said: ""I am here to vote, but my family says, 'what's the point?' The ruling party will come back in power in any case.""
Hasina has been praised internationally for providing refuge to Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar, but her government is accused of suppressing dissent and jailing critics.
Hasina has faced accusations in the West of increasing authoritarianism. Her son, Wazed, told Reuters Hasina regarded such accusations as a ""badge of honor"".

After he was fired when a video emerged of his beating a May Day protester, Alexandre Benalla returned to the spotlight in France this week, under scrutiny over his recent consultancy work and unauthorized use of diplomatic passports.
The original Benalla scandal became a major headache for Macron just over a year into his tenure, after the president, whose popularity ratings have since slipped, was criticized for acting too slowly in dealing with a member of his inner circle. 
Benalla said in an interview with France's Journal du Dimanche (JDD) on Sunday that he would return the diplomatic passports in the coming days, and rejected that he was somehow trying to profit from his status as a former insider by using them or in his work as a consultant. 
""Maybe I was wrong to use these passports,"" Benalla said, in a telephone conversation from overseas according to the JDD. ""But I want to make it clear that I only did it for my own ease, to facilitate my passage through airports.""
The French presidency has sought to distance itself from the former bodyguard, and the government said it had formally requested the passports be returned on at least two occasions.
Paris prosecutors on Saturday opened a preliminary inquiry into Benalla's usage of the passports. 
Benalla maintained in the JDD, however, that he had initially returned the two ID documents in August, and that they were returned to him along with other personal items by a member of the president's staff in October. 

Scrutiny over Benalla comes at a sensitive time for Macron, who is grappling with a wave of ""yellow vest"" street protests by disgruntled voters calling for more measures to help lift household incomes.

Nearly eight months since parliamentary elections, Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri has been unable to bring Lebanon's rival parties together into a national unity government that can deliver fiscal reform. 
""The repercussions and consequences of the economic crisis today are at their highest. The crisis started to turn into a financial one,"" said Ali Hassan Khalil late on Saturday according to the state news agency NNA. 
""We hope it will not become a monetary crisis,"" he said.
With the world's third-highest ratio of debt to GDP, Lebanon has endured years of weak economic growth and was urged by the International Monetary Fund this year to carry out ""urgent"" measures to put public finances back on a sustainable footing.
Efforts to finalise a government hit new snags last week after having looked close to a resolution. The parties are jostling over how many seats each faction will get in the cabinet and the distribution of the main portfolios.
The banking system is the lynchpin of its economy and holds much of the government's debt.

The ministry also said that the Russian military had deployed Pantsir-S and S-400 complexes in 2018 in Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in 2014, as well as in its Arctic region, the Kaliningrad exclave on the Baltic Sea, and in its easternmost Khabarovsk region.
Russia has been flexing its military muscles abroad in recent years, and its involvement in the Syrian conflict and Ukraine has soured relations with the West. 
In a dispute over a separate, longer range missile system, Washington has threatened to pull out of the landmark 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), alleging that a new Russian missile, the Novator 9M729 (called SSC-8 by NATO), violates the pact.
The landmark arms control treaty bans either side from stationing short and intermediate-range, land-based missiles in Europe. Russia says denies the missile violates the INF and accuses the United States of inventing a false pretext to exit the treaty in order to develop new missiles. 
President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would deploy its first regiment of hypersonic nuclear-capable missiles next year, saying the move meant his country now had a new type of strategic weapon.
Vityaz (Knight) is a short-to-mid range surface-to-air defence missile system, developed by Almaz-Antey Air and Space Defence Corporation.

The Kremlin said in March Russia would cut its defence budget to less than 3 percent of gross domestic product within the next five years.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he wants to hold more summits with South Korea's Moon Jae-in next year to achieve the goal of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, Moon's office said on Sunday.
Kim sent a letter to Moon on Sunday to commemorate the dramatic detente they engineered this year, including three summits, after years of confrontation marked by a series of the North's nuclear and missile tests.
But stalled nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington had an impact on inter-Korean ties, with the South's plan to host Kim in Seoul this year - as agreed at his summit with President Moon Jae-in in Pyongyang in September - going unanswered by the North.
Kim vowed to work towards denuclearization at his landmark summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June but the two sides have since made little progress, struggling to reschedule a high-level meeting abruptly called off in November.
Kim said in the letter that he was sorry his visit to Seoul did not take place, expressing his ""strong resolve"" to make it happen in the future while monitoring the situation, Moon's office said.

""Chairman Kim said he is willing to meet often with President Moon next year to move forward discussions on peace and prosperity and resolve the issue of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,"" Moon's spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said in a statement.

KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Taliban have rejected Kabul's offer of talks next month in Saudi Arabia where the militants, fighting to restore strict Islamic law in Afghanistan, will meet U.S. officials to further peace efforts, a Taliban leader said on Sunday.
Representatives from the Taliban, the United States and regional countries met this month in the United Arab Emirates for talks to end the 17-year war in Afghanistan.
But the Taliban have refused to hold formal talks with the Western-backed Afghan government.
""We will meet the U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia in January next year and we will start our talks that remained incomplete in Abu Dhabi,"" a member of the Taliban’s decision-making Leadership Council told Reuters. ""However, we have made it clear to all the stakeholders that we will not talk to the Afghan government.""
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid also said the leaders of the group would not talk to the Afghan government.
The militants have insisted on first reaching an agreement with the United States, which the group sees as the main force in Afghanistan since U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001. 
Diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have intensified after Taliban representatives started meeting U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad this year. Officials from the warring sides have met at least three times to discuss the withdrawal of international forces and a ceasefire in 2019. 
But the United States has insisted that any final settlement must be led by the Afghans.
According to data from the NATO-led Resolute Support mission published in November, the government of President Ashraf Ghani has control or influence over 65 percent of the population but only 55.5 percent of Afghanistan’s 407 districts, less than at any time since 2001. The Taliban say they control 70 percent of the country.
A close aide to Ghani said the government would keep trying to establish a direct line of diplomatic communication with the Taliban.
""Talks should be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned,"" the aide said on condition of anonymity. ""It is important that the Taliban acknowledge this fact."" 

U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a pullout of American troops from Syria, a decision that prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis, and there have been reports that he is considering a partial pullout from Afghanistan.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Voting in Democratic Republic of Congo's long-anticipated presidential election got off to a shaky start on Sunday due to torrential rain in the capital and long delays at some polling stations in the east.
President Joseph Kabila, in power since his father's assassination in 2001, is due to step down after the vote in a milestone for a country plagued by authoritarian rule, coups and civil wars since independence from Belgium in 1960.
A Reuters witness in the eastern city of Goma saw residents casting their votes, but another polling station in the city was still closed 90 minutes after polls opened at 6 a.m (0400 GMT).
""The majority of voters here are stressed,"" said Kayembe Mvita Dido, first in a line of dozens waiting to vote at a polling station in the shadows of the towering Nyiragongo volcano. 
""Some do not even know how to use the voting machine,"" he said, referring to a new electronic voting system, criticized by the opposition as vulnerable to fraud.
Early voters in the capital faced a violent storm that appeared to have knocked out the power in two polling stations visited by Reuters. Another station was not able to open on time due to a lack of electoral witnesses.
Despite repeated delays to the election, which was originally meant to take place in 2016, diplomats and poll observers have said authorities are ill-prepared, raising fears of a repeat of the violence that followed elections in 2006 and 2011.
Kabila's agreement to stick to constitutional term limits should represent progress for the mineral-rich central African country.
Critics, however, say the vote will be tarnished by fraud, and that Kabila could continue to rule from the sidelines. He has not ruled out running again for president in 2023.
Violent protests erupted this week after authorities announced that three opposition strongholds, accounting for more than 1.2 million out of 40 million voters nationwide, would not be able to vote due to health risks from an ongoing Ebola outbreak and ethnic violence.
At one polling station in the Ebola-hit city of Beni, dozens of voters nevertheless lined up to write their choices on sheets of paper, even though the vote had been canceled, said Teddy Kataliko, a local civil society leader. 
Foreign diplomats told Reuters on Friday that only about 60 percent of voting materials across the country were in place, and election observers said polling stations in the capital Kinshasa would struggle to accommodate all voters during voting hours. 
OPPONENTS FEAR VOTE RIGGING
Opponents of Kabila say the government is trying to tip the election in favor of his preferred successor, former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, whom opinion polls show trailing two opposition candidates. 
The most recent poll released by New York University's Congo Research Group on Friday showed former  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) manager and opposition lawmaker Martin Fayulu leading the race on 47 percent. 
Another opposition leader, Felix Tshisekedi, trailed with 24 percent, while Shadary got 19 percent. 
Both Fayulu and Tshisekedi have spoken confidently of victory, but Shadary has big institutional advantages, including round-the-clock coverage on state media. Kabila appointees also dominate national institutions.
""Tomorrow I will be president,"" Shadary told Reuters on Saturday by phone. 
His opponents accuse the ruling coalition of preparing outright vote rigging, with much of their scepticism focused on largely untested electronic voting machines that are being used for the first time. 
The national electoral commission (CENI) has tried to reassure the opposition by saying that only print-outs from the machines counted by hand will be factored into the official results. 
But any disputed outcome could lead to a wider security breakdown across Congo, particularly along its eastern borders with Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, where dozens of armed militia are active.

The last polls close at 5 p.m., although voting will continue for those still in line.

Without providing details, Trujillo said in a video message that there was intelligence indicating the existence of ""credible"" plans to target the right-wing Duque, who took office in August.
Three Venezuelans were arrested in recent days with heavy weapons, he said.
""Intelligence investigations into possible attacks have been going on for several months,"" Trujillo said. ""Added to that is the recent capture of three Venezuelan citizens found in possession of weapons of war, which further increases concerns.""
Police and military sources told Reuters that on Dec. 21, two Venezuelan men were captured on a bus in the northern city of Valledupar carrying two 5.56 caliber rifles, and a third arrested days later was also armed. 
Authorities are trying to establish any connection between the alleged plan to attack Duque and the presence in Colombia of the three armed men, the sources said. 
Duque's security has been increased with the help of the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel, they added.
Duque, a 42-year-old economist, has been a strong critic of the socialist government of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, who he calls a ""dictator.""
Maduro has accused Colombia of helping ""terrorists,"" after an attempted armed drone attack in early August. Colombia has refuted the accusations.
The two neighboring countries have had tense relations for years, with soldiers and helicopters from the Bolivarian National Guard regularly crossing the porous border into Colombia.

Colombia is also the top destination for Venezuelans fleeing food and medicine shortages amid the country's economic crisis.

The medic, who is not exhibiting symptoms of Ebola, will remain under observation for up to two weeks at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) in Omaha, Nebraska Medicine said in a statement. 
The individual's name was not released for privacy reasons.
Symptoms such as fever and abdominal pain may appear up to three weeks after contact with the deadly virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Should symptoms develop, the healthcare worker would be moved to the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit, one of only a few in the United States for treating infectious diseases.
The Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo is the second worst ever and has killed 356 of the 585 people infected since it began six months ago, according to the World Health Organization. 
Nebraska Medicine, a network of hospitals, clinics and healthcare colleges, together with academic partner UNMC, are among world leaders in the treatment of Ebola, which spreads through contact with bodily fluids and causes hemorrhagic fever with severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding. 
Nebraska Medicine cared for three patients with the virus in 2014 and monitored several others for exposure during a 2013-16 outbreak in West Africa that was the worst on record, with more than 28,000 cases confirmed.

Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway were found dead early on Dec. 17 near the village of Imlil in the Atlas Mountains.
The man arrested is also suspected of “involvement in recruiting Moroccan and sub-Saharan nationals to carry out terrorist plots in Morocco against foreign targets and security forces in order to take hold of their service weapons"", the Central Bureau for Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) said.
It said he also held Spanish nationality with residence in Morocco.
Nineteen other men have been arrested in connection with the case, including four main suspects who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a video made three days before the tourists' bodies were found.
Police and domestic intelligence spokesman Boubker Sabik this week described the four men as ""lone wolves"", and said ""the crime was not coordinated with Islamic State"".
Compared with other countries in North Africa, Morocco has been largely insulated from militant attacks. 
The most recent took place in April 2011, when 17 people were killed in the bombing of a restaurant in Marrakech. In 2017 and 2018, Morocco said it dismantled 20 militant cells planning attacks in the country.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbians protested against President Aleksandar Vucic and his ruling Serbian Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party in downtown Belgrade on Saturday.
Thousands of people chanted ""Vucic thief"" as they marched peacefully through the city center in the fourth such protest in as many weeks. They demanded media freedoms, an end to attacks on journalists and opposition politicians.
Backers of the Alliance for Serbia, an opposition grouping of 30 parties and organizations, say Vucic is an autocrat and his party is corrupt, something its leaders vehemently deny.
In an interview with the pro-government Studio B TV during the protest, Vucic said he was ready to discuss the opposition demands. 
""I am ready to look at what causes dissent of the people,"" he said, after being jeered by a group of protesters as he entered the television station building.
Vucic earlier suggested he was willing to test his party's popularity in a snap vote, although Vuk Jeremic, a former foreign minister and the head of the small People's Party, part of the alliance, said the opposition would boycott any election. 
""There will be no legitimate elections in Serbia with the participation of the opposition until after normal conditions for elections and living are created,"" Jeremic said.
According to a poll by the Belgrade-based CESID election watchdog in October, Vucic's SNS enjoys the backing of 53.3 percent of electorate while other parties are trailing far behind. 
If the opposition ran as an alliance, rather than individual parties, they could count on around 15 percent of the vote. Their joint participation in a vote has yet to be agreed and so far they are only united in their animosity to Vucic and his party.
The SNS-led ruling coalition has a comfortable majority of 160 deputies in the 250-seat parliament. The next national election is due in 2020. 
Major opposition protests have been relatively rare in Serbia since the popular unrest that ousted former strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. 
Most of current opposition leaders served in successive pro-Western coalitions that led Serbia between 2000 and 2012 when SNS forged a coalition with Milosevic's Socialists and came to power.

A nationalist firebrand during the violent collapse of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Vucic later embraced pro-European values and set Serbia's membership in the European Union as the country's strategic goal. He also maintains close ties with Russia and China.

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Hundreds of people in northeast Nigeria who fled a town targeted by militants linked with Islamic State have sought refuge in capital of Borno state, Reuters witnesses said on Saturday.
An uptick in attacks by Islamists and the resulting upheaval in the region comes in the run up to an election in which President Muhammadu Buhari will seek a second term. Security has become a campaign issue following a series of attacks.
A faction of Boko Haram, Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA), which split from the insurgency in 2016 claimed responsibility for an attack on a military base in Baga, a town in eastern Borno state, which the Nigerian army said took place on Wednesday evening.
The fight to control Baga - a strategic town as it borders Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon - forced hundreds to seek safety in Maiduguri, some 200 km (124 miles) to the south. 
Reuters witnesses saw hundreds of people arriving in Maiduguri and gathering at a bus terminus on the outskirts of the city. 
""In Baga, we are in Boko Haram hands because yesterday they were going around with their machine [guns] and motor [vehicles],"" Baga resident Abdul Kami said on Saturday, describing the attack on the town.
Residents on Friday said at least 10 people were killed in the attack on Baga.
The Boko Haram insurgency, which Buhari vowed to end when he took office in 2015, aims to create an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria. It has forced about 2.7 million people to flee their homes since 2009 and killed around 30,000. 
The military and insurgents also clashed in Monguno, a town in the adjacent local government authority to Baga. 
But Islamic State, in a statement issued through its news agency Amaq, said its fighters ""killed and injured dozens, took four apostates as captives, burned many barracks, and seized weapons and ammunition"".    
Critics of Buhari have pointed to attacks in the last few weeks to criticize the former general's security record. In particular, they highlighted the attack on an army base in Metele, Borno state in which about 100 soldiers were killed.
Attacks by Boko Haram in the run-up to the last election in 2015 weakened then-president Goodluck Jonathan and helped Buhari to defeat him at the polls.

PARIS/BORDEAUX (Reuters) - France's ""yellow vest"" demonstrators kept numerous roads across the country blocked on Saturday as groups of protesters marched in city centers, but the anti-government backlash was more dispersed and muted than in previous weeks.
Driven by anger over a perceived squeeze on household income, the movement has shaken Emmanuel Macron's presidency and hurt retailers and other businesses after the spontaneous protest against fuel taxes gave way to riots in early December. 
Sporadic clashes with police broke out as protesters in several cities including Bordeaux and Nantes were pushed back by teargas and stun grenades, though the turnout across France dwindled on the seventh Saturday of demonstrations. 
Official estimates were not yet available, though French TV channel LCI, citing unnamed sources, put the turnout at 12,000, well below the nearly 40,000 last week. 
In Paris, where protests turned violent in early December, police said by early evening that they had detained some 57 people after 800 demonstrators took to the streets, down from at least 109 arrests last week with a similar number of protesters. 
People wearing high-visibility vests mingled among shoppers and tourists and chanted ""Macron, resign!"" on the Champs Elysees avenue, home to boutiques that were smashed and bore the brunt of lootings at the height of the violence.
Major stores, including some that were boarded up on recent weekends, opened their doors. 
Other demonstrators converged west of the capital near the headquarters of 24-hour news channel BFM TV, where scuffles ensued; and several cars were set on fire outside the offices of the Parisien newspaper in the evening, though it was initially unclear who had torched them and whether it was directly linked to the protests. 
In Toulouse, where like in Bordeaux crowds exceeded 2,000 people, protesters set bins on fire and some hurled yellow paint at police.
Several highway tolls and motorway slip-roads across France were blocked, operator Vinci said, and traffic on some of the roads leading to Spain was severely backed up. 
SIT-INS
The protests -- 18 months into Macron's tenure, and his bid to reshape the economy -- are expected to rumble on into January despite his attempts to defuse them, including by backtracking on planned fuel tax hikes and signaling wage rises for the poorest workers.
""We will continue until we win, until Macron backs down and gives us what we deserve: more purchasing power, less taxes, a healthy life without having to tighten and tighten and tighten the belt at the end of every single month,"" a protester in Nantes who only gave her name as Virginie told Reuters. 
""My son asks me for something and (I say) no I can't, but I work so it is not normal.""
Stemming in part from a feeling of disconnect between more provincial and rural areas and an urban elite Macron has come to represent for his critics, the protest has spawned sit-ins at roundabouts and roadsides as people dig their heels in, demanding more measures to help household incomes. 
The ""yellow vest"" protests -- named after the garments that drivers have to carry in their cars in case of emergency -- have been concentrated on Saturdays, after first erupting on Nov. 17 following a campaign spread on social media.
But protesters were also being urged to turn out on Dec. 31, including for a show of force on the Champs Elysee, where revelers tend to gather for New Year's celebrations and a firework display.
The city council has said festivities, usually boxed in by a heavy police presence, would go ahead as planned.

Macron is expected to address voters in a traditional New Year's Eve televised message.

The Jewish Home party's schism posed no immediate threat to Netanyahu, for whom polls predict an easy win to a fifth term. But it suggested his fellow rightists were interested in poaching votes from a center-left opposition energized by the candidacy of an Israeli ex-general, Benny Gantz.
The Jewish Home leader, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, told reporters that he and his deputy, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, were leaving to form ""a new party, of religious and secular together ... in true partnership"".
The party, ""New Right"", would, like Jewish Home, pursue hawkish security policies including opposition to a Palestinian state, Bennett said.
It was not immediately clear whether Jewish Home was also continuing as a party. 
Jewish Home, which has drawn on support from Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, had eight of parliament's 120 seats. 
Prior to Bennett's announcement, polls had predicted the party would take around the same number in the April 9 vote, trailing Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and at least three center-left parties.
Bennett has frequently locked horns with Netanyahu, accusing the prime minister of being too restrained in Gaza fighting.

After Bennett's announcement, Likud issued a statement saying that only by voting for it would right wingers ""guarantee that the next government ... will not be a left-wing government"".

Eight protesters were detained for disturbing the peace after clashing with police, the statement said. 
Around 150-200 demonstrators took part in the protest march near government offices, wearing the hi-vis jackets also worn by anti-government protesters in France. 
Dutch TV showed footage of the protesters in front of parliament waving Dutch flags, shouting anti-government slogans and later trying to break through a police cordon. Several mounted police and dozens of officers on foot could be seen. 
There were no injuries, police said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Reporters will be the guests of honor at the New Year's Eve party in New York's Times Square (NYSE:SQ) on Monday, in what organizers said was a celebration of press freedom after an unusually deadly year for journalists at U.S. news outlets.
Two attacks in particular weighed on organizers as they discussed in autumn whom to give the honor of initiating the ceremonial ball drop just before midnight, according to Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance.
One was the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi columnist for the Washington Post and U.S. resident, inside a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey. The other was the mass shooting in June in the newsroom of The Capital, a newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, in which five employees were killed.
""Throughout the year it's been a big issue,"" Tompkins said in an interview. ""Times Square itself is the ultimate agora and public space,"" noting that the area was named after the New York Times, and that it was a Times publisher, Adolf Ochs, who began the tradition of the ball drop in 1907. 
Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the Times Square Alliance approached his group because of ""the perception that the journalism and journalists in particular are under threat and their role is being questioned.""
Simon, who said he usually spends New Year's Eve playing Scrabble with his wife in New Hampshire's White Mountains, will be in the spotlight at the Times Square festivities, joining Mayor Bill de Blasio to launch the ball drop a minute before midnight.
Simon will be joined onstage by journalists from U.S. and international news outlets, including NBC Nightly News and Dateline NBC anchor Lester Holt, ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz, and Karen Attiah, global opinions editor at The Washington Post.
A year ago Attiah recruited Khashoggi to work at the newspaper. Since the writer was killed, she has been among those leading calls for answers about his fate.
The button-pressing honor has in previous years gone to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, an Iraq War veteran, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor and the singer Lady Gaga.
The Times Square Alliance contacted Simon in November, Simon said, several weeks before Time magazine would devote their annual ""Person of the Year"" issue to several prominent journalists who have faced attacks and hostility.
Among those journalists were Khashoggi, and Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, two Reuters reporters imprisoned by Myanmar for investigating how the country's security forces killed members of the country's Muslim Rohingya minority.
U.S. President Donald Trump has become a vociferous critic of parts of the press, routinely chiding reporters and outlets he views as publishing ""fake news,"" calling them ""the enemy of the people.""
Simon said this was in the background of his discussions with the Times Square Alliance.

""Unavoidably, Trump was the subtext, but not front and center,"" he said. ""We wanted to have a unifying message.""

512,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2018 12:45PM ET</span>","Exclusive: For Bangladesh PM, authoritarian tag is 'badge of honor', son says on poll eve","By Ruma Paul, Krishna N. Das and Zeba Siddiqui
DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina considers being called authoritarian by the western media a ""badge of honor"", the leader's son told Reuters on the eve of a national election on Sunday.
Hasina, who is widely expected to win a third straight term in office, has been hailed domestically for fast economic growth in the past decade and internationally for providing refuge to Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in neighboring Myanmar.
But her government has been accused of suppressing dissent and jailing critics, including many supporters of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Many journalists say she has intimidated the media by using vaguely worded laws against them.
Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed, however, told Reuters there was space for dissent in the Muslim-majority country of 165 million people, and that the Western media was unfair in its portrayal of his mother.
""You know what my mother told me this morning? 'Branded authoritarian by the Western media now is a badge of honor'"" Wazed, who lives in Washington D.C. and runs an IT business in the United States, said in the prime minister's official residence in Dhaka.
""Don't you see anti-government posts on Facebook? Do you not see that? You are free to write whatever you want but you are not free to hurt someone. If you write something false and that causes an attack on someone, should there be no consequences?""
He said the ruling party would reconsider a tough new media law it introduced and another it has tightened if it retains power.
The 47-year-old, who entered politics reluctantly and has declined to take a senior position in the ruling Awami League, said he was not keen on becoming prime minister.
""Anything is possible, but interested? No. Possible perhaps, but only time will tell,"" said Wazed, who is also the information and communication technology adviser to the prime minister.
OPPOSITION, INDUSTRIES
The BNP, which is fighting this election as part of an alliance after boycotting the last one in 2014, says more than 8,200 leaders and activists of the alliance have been arrested since the election schedule was announced early last month. It added four workers had been killed and more than 12,300 injured in various assaults in that period.
The Awami League has denied any role in the violence.
Wazed dismissed accusations that the ruling party had ""manipulated"" police and the judiciary to get BNP chief and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia jailed in February on corruption charges to weaken the opposition before the election.
Khaleda's son and acting BNP chief Tarique Rahman, who lives in exile in London, faces imprisonment if he returns home after a court in October sentenced him to life in jail over an alleged plot to assassinate Hasina in 2004, when she was in the opposition. He denies any such plot. 
""If courts and police are manipulated why did it take a decade to convict Khaleda Zia and her son? Why did it take us so long?"" said Wazed, who speaks with a U.S. accent.
He said if the Awami League formed another government, it would look at raising the minimum wage for workers in the garments industry, which generates sales of more than $30 billion a year and is the biggest after China's. It only recently raised the level for the first time in five years, though workers have asked for more.
But he said the ultimate goal was to divert some of the garment workers to mobile phone and electronics manufacturing. He said South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) had already started a mobile phone assembly plant in Bangladesh and its South Korean rival LG had acquired land to open an electronics assembly plant.

""Our goal is to move up the value chain,"" he said. ""We don't want to stay stuck on the garments sector.""

513,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2018 12:43PM ET</span>",China court orders retrial for Canadian jailed for drug smuggling,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese court ordered a retrial of a Canadian citizen on drug smuggling charges on Saturday after prosecutors said his sentence of 15 years was too light - a case that could further test relations between Beijing and Ottawa.
Tensions between the two governments have been high since Canada's arrest of a high-ranking Chinese executive at the request of the United States this month, followed by China's detention of two Canadian citizens on suspicion of endangering state security.
Robert Lloyd Schellenberg had lodged an appeal after being handed a 15-year sentence on Nov. 20 in the northeastern city of Dalian, the high court for the province of Liaoning said in a statement, adding that he was to have been deported after serving his sentence.
At the appeal hearing, prosecutors said the sentence was too light and improper, arguing Schellenberg was highly likely to have been part of a international drugs smuggling operation and had played a major role in smuggling the drugs, the statement said.
The court said it accepted this argument and ordered a retrial. It added that Canadian diplomats were in court for the appeal.
In Ottawa, the foreign ministry said in a statement that it has been aware of the case for several years and would continue providing consular assistance to Schellenberg and his family. It gave no more details.
It was not immediately clear who Schellenberg's lawyer was or when the retrial may take place. 
A Dalian government news portal said this week Schellenberg had smuggled ""an enormous amount of drugs"" into China. Drugs offences are routinely punished severely in China.
A Briton caught smuggling heroin was executed in 2009, prompting a British outcry over what it said was the lack of any mental health assessment.
In one development that could lessen tensions, Ottawa said on Friday that a citizen who was detained in China this month had returned to Canada after being released.
A Canadian government source identified the citizen as teacher Sarah McIver. China's Foreign Ministry said this month that McIver was undergoing ""administrative punishment"" for working illegally.
McIver was the third Canadian to be detained by China following the Dec. 1 arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. Canada had said there was no reason to believe that McIver's detention was linked to the earlier arrests. 
Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland did not mention McIver last week in calling for the release of the other two Canadians detained on suspicion of endangering state security. They have each only been allowed to see Canadian diplomats once since being detained.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement it was aware of reports McIver had been released, and referred further questions to the ""relevant authority"".
Neither China nor Canada has drawn a direct connection between Meng and the cases of the two other Canadians.

China has demanded Canada free Meng, who is fighting extradition to the United States, where she would face fraud charges that carry a maximum sentence of 30 years jail for each charge. Meng has said she is innocent.

Throughout his campaign, Bolsonaro had pledged to dismantle Brazil's current gun legislation, which presents various bureaucratic and legal obstacles for people seeking to purchase firearms. That message appealed to many Brazilians who want to use guns for self-defense amid sky-high levels of violent crime.
""By decree, we plan to guarantee the ownership of firearms by citizens without criminal records,"" Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, wrote on Twitter on Saturday. 
He did not provide additional details and it was not immediately clear what mechanisms Bolsonaro would have at his disposal to carry out such a decree, or what specific measures the decree would contain. Brazil's Congress is already discussing measures to loosen gun control laws.
Gun manufacturers are among those that stand to benefit from such moves. Shares in Brazilian gun maker Taurus Armas SA have climbed some 88 percent year-to-date amid expectations that Bolsonaro would win the election and follow through on promises to liberalize gun laws.

HODEIDAH, Yemen (Reuters) - Yemen's Houthi forces have started to redeploy from the port of the Red Sea city of Hodeidah as part of a U.N.-sponsored peace agreement signed in Sweden earlier this month, a U.N. source and a spokesman for the group said on Saturday.
The Iranian-aligned Houthis have agreed with the Saudi-backed government to implement a ceasefire in Hodeidah province and withdraw their respective forces.
Retired Dutch general Patrick Cammaert, the head of a United Nations advance team charged with monitoring the ceasefire, arrived in Hodeidah this week. 
Under the deal, international monitors are to be deployed in Hodeidah and a Redeployment Coordination Committee (RCC) including both sides, chaired by Cammaert, will oversee implementation. The committee started its meetings this week.
A U.N. source said the Houthi forces, which control the city and its strategic port, had started to redeploy overnight.
Hodeidah's Houthi governor, Mohammed Ayash Qaheem, told Reuters that the group's fighters had withdrawn from the port as specified in the peace agreement, handing control to local units of Yemeni coast guards who were in charge of protecting ports before the war. These will be under U.N. supervision.
A Reuters camera operator saw the U.N. team led by Cammaert witnessing the fighters' withdrawal.
The Houthis' withdrawal from the three ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Rass Issa is intended to be the first step in the implementation of the agreement, to be followed by both sides pulling their forces out of the city and the surrounding province.
BUILDING CONFIDENCE
Military officials from the government forces, which control some southern parts of the city of Hodeidah, said they needed time to establish if the Houthi forces had really withdrawn from the ports. 
The government fears that the coast guards may remain loyal to the Houthi-controlled Sanaa government after the withdrawal.
It is still unclear how far the forces will withdraw and who will eventually control the three ports and the city, or if the two sides will share control with U.N. monitors positioned between the two fronts.
Cammaert’s team will not be uniformed or armed, the United Nations has said, but it will provide support for the management of and inspections at the ports, and strengthen the U.N. presence in the city.
The agreement, the first significant breakthrough in peace efforts in five years, was part of confidence-building measures intended to pave the way for a wider truce and a framework for political negotiations.
The international community has been trying for months to avert an all-out government assault on Hodeidah, the entry point for most of Yemen’s commercial goods and aid supplies, and a lifeline for millions of Yemenis on the verge of starvation.
The truce came into force on Dec. 18.
On Friday, the United Nations said both parties had agreed to begin opening humanitarian corridors, starting with the key coastal road between Hodeidah and the Houthi-held capital, Sanaa.

The parties are due to present detailed plans for a full redeployment to Cammaert at the next RCC meeting on Jan. 1, the United Nations said in a statement.

The bombing, less than 4 km from the pyramids, on the outskirts of Cairo, is the first deadly attack against foreign tourists in Egypt for more than a year and comes as the tourism sector, a vital source of foreign currency, recovers from a sharp drop in visitor numbers since the country's 2011 uprising.
A spokesman for Britain’s Thomas Cook travel group said it had canceled day trips to Cairo from the Red Sea resort of Hurghada following the attack and it would continue to review the security situation.
The ministry did not say whether the suspected militants were connected to Friday's attack, but said its forces killed 30 people during raids on their hideouts in Giza where it said ""terrorist elements"" were planning a series of attacks targeting state institutions and the tourism industry.
Security forces also killed 10 suspected militants in North Sinai, where the country is fighting an insurgency led by Islamic State.
State news agency MENA said that the suspects were killed in a gun battle.
The ministry did not give any details about the suspects' identity or whether there had been any casualties or injuries among the security forces. The statement said the three raids took place simultaneously.
The ministry published photos of bloodied bodies with their faces concealed and assault rifles and shotguns lying on the floor beside them.
Three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian guide were killed and at least 10 others injured when the roadside bomb hit their tour bus on Friday. 
Events such as the bombing of a Russian airliner shortly after it took off from Sharm el Sheikh in 2015, killing all 224 people on board, caused tourist numbers to Egypt to plunge.
There are still no direct flights from major tourist markets such as Britain and Russia to the country's biggest Red Sea resort, Sharm el Sheikh, since that attack.
The government says fighting Islamist militants is a priority as it works to restore stability after the years of turmoil that followed the ""Arab Spring"" protests of 2011.
Egypt's military and police launched a major campaign against militant groups in February, targeting the Sinai Peninsula as well as southern areas and the border with Libya.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government will spend more than 100 million pounds ($130 million) chartering extra sea ferries to ease cross-Channel congestion if the United Kingdom fails to secure a trade deal before leaving the European Union next year.
Just three months before the United Kingdom is due to leave the world's largest bloc, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is rising -- the nightmare scenario for many businesses, which are now planning for an economic shock.
Extra ships will be needed to work new routes across the Channel in the event that the main French terminal of Calais and Britain’s Dover and Folkestone are clogged up by customs checks.
Currently, Britain's membership of the EU means that trucks drive smoothly through border checks within the bloc. But in a no-deal Brexit, even a few minutes' delay at customs for each truck would be likely to mean vehicles backing up at ports and queuing on feeder roads on both sides of the Channel.
To ease a potential backlog, the government has awarded three contracts to provide additional freight capacity on routes from English south-coast ports including Poole, Portsmouth and Plymouth.
They comprise one worth 47 million pounds with the French firm Brittany Ferries, a 47 million pound deal with the Danish shipping company DFDS and a 14 million pound contract with Seaborne Freight.
The leader of the opposition Liberal Democrat party, Vince Cable, called the move ""complete madness"" and said public money was being spent recklessly in a last-minute bid to prepare for a no-deal outcome.
The contracts were not put out to tender. The Department for Transport said it was responding to a ""situation of extreme urgency"" brought about by ""unforeseeable events"".
About 16,000 trucks pass between Dover and Calais every day, transporting everything from perishable food to medicines and the industrial goods needed to keep factories running.
""This extra capacity is a small but important element of the DfT's no-deal planning,"" the Department for Transport said in a statement. ""While remaining committed to working to ensure a deal is reached, the department is helping ensure the rest of government are fully prepared for a range of scenarios.""
Earlier this month, the government announced that all government departments must step up planning for a no-deal Brexit, including putting 3,500 armed forces personnel on standby to deal with any disruption.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian guide were killed and at least 10 others injured when a roadside bomb blast hit their tour bus on Friday less than 4 km (2.5 miles) from Egypt's world-famous Giza pyramids, authorities said.
The bombing is the first deadly attack against foreign tourists in Egypt for over a year and comes as the tourism sector, a vital source of foreign currency revenue, recovers from a sharp drop in visitor numbers since the country's 2011 uprising.
No immediate claim of responsibility was reported. 
Islamist extremists, including militants linked to Islamic State, are active in Egypt and have targeted foreign visitors in the past.
At least nine Vietnamese tourists were wounded, as well as the Egyptian driver, according to official statements.
The tourists were heading to a sound and light show at the pyramids, which they had visited earlier in the day, said Lan Le, 41, who was also aboard the bus but unhurt. 
""We were going to the sound and light show and then suddenly we heard a bomb. It was terrible, people screaming,"" she told Reuters, speaking at Al Haram hospital, where the injured were taken. ""I don't remember anything after.""
Egypt's interior ministry said the bus was hit by an explosion from an improvised device hidden near a wall at around 6.15 p.m. (1615 GMT).
About two hours later, the vehicle could be seen behind a police cordon with one of its sides badly damaged and the windows blown out, a Reuters reporter said. 
Dozens of police, military and firefighters were at the site, on a narrow side street close to the ring road, where traffic was moving normally.
Shortly afterward, workers brought a pick-up truck to tow the bus away.
An investigator at the scene said the device had likely been planted near the wall. 
The interior ministry confirmed the death of two of the tourists, and the state prosecutor's office later said a third had died. In total, 14 Vietnamese tourists had been traveling on the bus, it said.
WRONG ROUTE?
Vietnam called on Egypt to find those behind the attack.
""Vietnam is extremely angered by and strongly condemns this act of terrorism that killed and injured innocent Vietnamese people,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman, Le Thi Thu Hang, said in a statement.
""Vietnam requests that Egypt promptly launch an investigation into the case and track down those responsible.”
Egypt's prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, told media from Al Haram hospital that the bus had taken an unexpected route.
""The bus deviated from the route secured by the security forces,"" Madbouly told Extra News channel, an assertion also made by the owner of the company that organized the bus tour.
""We have been in contact with the embassy of Vietnam to contain the impact of the incident, and what is important now is to take care of the injured,"" the prime minister said.
The bus driver later told media he had not deviated from the route.
Egypt's army and police launched a major campaign against militant groups in February, targeting the Sinai Peninsula as well as southern areas and the border with Libya.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian government has stripped citizenship from a man it believes is a top recruiter for Islamic State, Australia's home affairs minister said on Saturday.
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said Melbourne-born Neil Prakash had been central to Islamic State's efforts in the Middle East, was ""a very dangerous individual"" and had his citizenship stripped.
""If given the opportunity Mr Prakash would harm or kill Australians and our country is a safer place for him having lost his Australian citizenship,"" Dutton said in a televised news conference.
Prakash has been in Turkey on trial for terrorism-related activities since being caught there in October 2016 after leaving Islamic State-controlled territory.
He is wanted in Australia over terrorism-related activities including an alleged plot to behead a police officer.
Under Australia's citizenship laws, a dual national can lose their Australian citizenship if they act contrary to their allegiance to Australia by choosing to be involved in terrorism.
Islamic State was declared a terrorist organization in May 2016 for this purpose, the Home Affairs Office said in a statement, and Prakash is the 12th person to be stripped of citizenship so far.
Dutton said the law prevents the government from rendering somebody stateless so they must have Australian citizenship and citizenship of another country.
Prakash, whose mother was Cambodian and father was Fijian, held both Australian and Fijian citizenship through his father.
Dutton said Australia's internal spy agency the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) had thwarted 14 attempted attacks including a plan to smuggle explosives onto an A380 flight to the Middle East.
""The threat is very real,"" he said.
""The priority for us is to make sure that people like Neil Prakash don’t come back to Australia. We don’t want them here."" 
Prakash has been notified of the decision by letter, and the Fijian government has also been notified, according to a source close to the Australian government.
Prakash has been linked to several Australia-based attack plans and has appeared in Islamic State videos and magazines. Australia says he actively recruited Australian men, women and children and encouraged acts of militancy.
Australia has been pressing Turkey to extradite Prakash since he was first detained, but the request was rejected in July. It will remain in place until the conclusion of his case and any custodial sentence, The Australian newspaper reported.
Canberra canceled Prakash's passport in 2014 and announced financial sanctions in 2015, which cover anyone giving him financial assistance, with punishment of up to 10 years in jail.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday and while both pledged to deepen ties, there was no announcement as some anticipated of Brazil moving its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. 
Netanyahu, the first Israeli prime minister to visit Brazil, flew in to Rio de Janeiro to meet with Bolsonaro, an ideological ally who takes office on Jan. 1 after his election victory in October. The two men had lunch in a fort on Copacabana beach before delivering statements.
""Israel is the promised land. Brazil is the land of promise,"" said Netanyahu, adding that Israel could help in areas such as economics, security, agriculture and water resources.
Bolsonaro pledged he would visit Israel by March as a way to thank Netanyahu for the gesture.
""We will be starting a difficult government from January, but Brazil has potential,"" Bolsonaro said. ""So that we can overcome obstacles, we need good allies, good friends, good brothers, like Benjamin Netanyahu.""
The two also visited a synagogue among tight security including snipers on nearby roofs, where Netanyahu emphasized his hopes the two countries could operate in a more aligned and friendly manner in the future. 
Bolsonaro and top aides have repeatedly said he would move Brazil's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but since his election he has come under pressure to ditch the idea from powerful backers in the agricultural sector, who fear the decision would hurt their halal meat sales in Arab countries.
The Arab League had told Bolsonaro that moving the embassy to Jerusalem would be a setback for relations with Arab countries, according to a letter seen by Reuters earlier in December.
Such a move by Bolsonaro would be a sharp shift in Brazilian foreign policy as it was for the United States when President Donald Trump relocated the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem in May. Brazil has traditionally backed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Some political observers had speculated that Bolsonaro would use Netanyahu's visit as the perfect way to make the announcement.
Bolsonaro discussed Israel during a meeting in Rio with Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, late last month.
Although Bolsonaro could well make the announcement at a later stage, a senior U.S. State Department official said on Friday the U.S. government expected him to eventually make the move. 
""We also welcome President-elect Bolsonaro's comments regarding moving the Brazilian embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in support of Israel's sovereign right to have its capital of Jerusalem recognized by nations around the world. We look forward to welcoming many more of our friends and allies in Jerusalem,"" the official said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A suspected illegal immigrant accused of shooting to death a California police officer was arrested on Friday after a two-day manhunt that President Donald Trump cited in his push for building a wall on the border with Mexico, officials said.
Gustavo Perez Arriaga, 32, a Mexican national, was arrested in Bakersfield, a city less than 200 miles (320 km) south of Newman where the officer was shot on Wednesday, Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson said at a news conference.
The shooting and manhunt in California's agricultural Central Valley entered the national debate over immigration, after Trump tweeted about it in his advocacy for a border wall and Christianson criticized California's sanctuary law for immigrants.
Arriaga is accused of shooting to death Newman police corporal Sonil Singh after Singh pulled him over on suspicion of driving under the influence.
The suspect, who exchanged fire with Singh, has claimed to be involved with a criminal gang called the Sureños and was trying to escape to Mexico, Christianson said. 
On Friday, heavily armed police officers surrounded the Bakersfield home where they believed Arriaga was hiding and he walked out with his hands up, Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood told reporters.
It was not immediately clear if Arriaga, who was transported in Singh's handcuffs from Bakersfield to Stanislaus County, had an attorney. He was expected to be formally charged next week.
Christianson said the case highlighted the dangers of a California law passed in 2017 that placed limits on how closely law enforcement can cooperate with federal agents seeking to deport illegal immigrants arrested for crimes.
Christianson had initially given Arriaga's age as 33, but authorities later said he was 32.
Arriaga, a farm laborer who had been in the United States for a number of years after illegally crossing the border into Arizona, had prior arrests for driving under the influence, Christianson said.
""Why are we providing sanctuary for criminals, gang members?"" Christianson said at the news conference. ""It's a conversation we need to have."" 
California Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, in signing the bill into law said it provided reassurance to undocumented immigrants without sacrificing public safety. State law ""fully permits the sharing of information on dangerous gang members,"" Brown's spokesman Evan Westrup said in an email on Friday.
Trump tweeted about the shooting on Thursday, days after the Dec. 22 partial shutdown of the federal government. The ongoing shutdown was triggered by Trump's $5 billion demand, opposed by Democrats and some lawmakers in his own Republican party, for the wall.
Trump, during his campaign for president and in the White House, has denounced a number of crimes by illegal immigrants to press for stricter immigration enforcement. 
Ahead of the congressional elections in November, a TV campaign ad endorsed by Trump focused on an undocumented Mexican immigrant convicted of killing two sheriff's deputies in California. 
However, multiple studies have found immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than U.S.-born Americans.
Stanislaus County law enforcement officials have highlighted Singh's own background as a legal immigrant. The 33-year-old native of Fiji came to the United States to become a police officer, they said.

At least five people were arrested on suspicion of lying to investigators about Arriaga or helping him evade law enforcement, including some people at the Bakersfield home where he was arrested, authorities said.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 06:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. commanders recommend letting Kurdish fighters in Syria keep weapons,"By Idrees Ali, Lesley Wroughton and Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. commanders planning for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria are recommending that Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State be allowed to keep U.S.-supplied weapons, four U.S. officials said, a move that would likely anger NATO ally Turkey.
Three of the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the recommendations were part of discussions on a draft plan by the U.S. military. It is unclear what the Pentagon will ultimately recommend to the White House. 
Discussions are still at an early stage inside the Pentagon and no decision has yet been made, the officials said. The plan will then be presented to the White House in the coming days with U.S. President Donald Trump making the final decision.
The Pentagon said it would be ""inappropriate"" and premature to comment on what will happen with the weapons. 
""Planning is ongoing, and focused on executing a deliberate and controlled withdrawal of forces while taking all measures possible to ensure our troops' safety,"" said Commander Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman.The White House did not comment. 
Trump last week abruptly ordered a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, drawing widespread criticism and prompting Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' resignation.
The U.S. officials said Trump's announcement has upset U.S. commanders, who view his decision as a betrayal of the Kurdish YPG militia, which has led the fight to eradicate Islamic State from northeastern Syria.
Ankara views the YPG as an extension of a Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey. Turkey has threatened to launch an offensive against the YPG, raising fears of a surge in violence that could harm hundreds of thousands of civilians. 
The United States told the YPG that they would be armed by Washington until the fight against Islamic State was completed, one of the U.S. officials said.
""The fight isn't over. We can't simply start asking for the weapons back,"" said the official.
The proposal to leave U.S.-supplied weapons with the YPG, which could include anti-tank missiles, armored vehicles and mortars, would reassure Kurdish allies that they were not being abandoned.
But Turkey wants the United States to take the weapons back, so the commanders' recommendation, if confirmed, could complicate Trump's plan to allow Turkey to finish off the fight against Islamic State inside Syria.
The Pentagon keeps records of the weapons it has supplied to the YPG and their chain of custody. But, the U.S. officials said, it would be nearly impossible to locate all of the equipment.
""How are we going to get them back and who is going to take them back?"" one of the officials asked.
The debate over whether to leave weapons with the YPG coincides with Trump's national security adviser John Bolton's visit to Turkey and Israel next week for talks on Syria.
In May 2017, the United States started distributing arms and equipment to the YPG for an offensive against Raqqa, the de facto capital of the self-declared caliphate that Islamic State overran in Iraq and Syria in 2014.
The United States told Turkey that it would take back the weapons after the defeat of Islamic State, which has lost all but a few slivers of territory in northeastern Syria.
""The idea that we'd be able to recover them is asinine. So we leave them where they are,"" said a U.S. official.
A person familiar with the discussions of the U.S. withdrawal plan said the White House and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan would oppose the proposal to allow the YPG to keep its U.S.-supplied weapons.
The recommendation ""is a rejection of Trump's policy to withdraw from Syria,"" said the person, who asked not to be further identified.
Turkey has said weapons supplied to the YPG have in the past ended up in the hands of its Kurdish separatists, and described any weapon given to the insurgents as a threat to Turkey's security.
A phone call between Trump and Erdogan led to the decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Syria. 
In the call two weeks ago, Trump had been expected to deliver a standard warning to the Turkish president over his plan to launch a crossborder attack targeting U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeast Syria, U.S. officials said.

Instead, in the course of the conversation, Trump reshaped U.S. policy in the Middle East, abandoning a quarter of Syrian territory and handing Turkey the job of finishing off Islamic State in Syria.

João Teixeira de Faria, known as ""John of God,"" was arrested earlier this month and has been imprisoned since.
He became a celebrity after his healing methods were featured on Oprah Winfrey's television show in 2013 and drew thousands of Brazilians and foreigners to his spiritual center in the small town of Abadiânia, in the central Brazilian state of Goiás.
His fame has been boosted by supposedly miraculous surgeries he claims to have performed with his hands and without anesthesia.
Goiás prosecutors charged Faria on Friday on four counts of rape and sexual assault, a spokesman said in a statement. Farias has repeatedly said he is innocent. 

The accusers are not just Brazilian citizens, according to prosecutors, and include four women from the United States, three from Australia and three from different parts of Europe.

Uyo, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigeria's ruling party held a rally to mark the launch of President Muhammadu Buhari's re-election bid on Friday in the southern city of Uyo, hours after naming a campaign team which includes Africa's richest man. 
A presidential election is scheduled to take place on Feb. 16 to determine who will lead Africa's biggest crude oil producer and the continent's most populous country.
At the launch of the campaign, Buhari told an audience in the southern city - capital of Akwa Ibom state - that his government was winning the fight against Islamists who have stepped up attacks in the northeast aimed at creating a state adhering to a strict interpretation of Sharia law.
Buhari addressed his audience in the wake of an attack by militants in the town of Baga, in eastern Borno state - the latest in a string of strikes in the last few months by militants allied with Islamic State that has turned security into a campaign issue in the run-up to the poll.
""Many local governments were held by the Boko Haram insurgents when we assumed office but none, presently, is physically controlled by the group,"" said Buhari. 
""We are going to secure this country, we are going to manage it properly. We will continue to improve the situation, security, economy and fighting corruption,"" said Buhari, a 76-year-old former military ruler who took office in 2015.
Buhari, a Muslim from the predominantly Muslim north, typically has not had support from voters in the largely Christian southern states. 
Earlier, Buhari's ruling party - the All Progressives Congress (APC) - named members of the ""presidential campaign council"", members of Buhari's core re-election team. 

Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man who primarily made his money through a cement business, was named as a member of Buhari's special advisory committee. Billionaire oil magnate Femi Otedola was also named as a member of the committee.

Protests over rising prices, shortages of basic commodities and a cash crunch erupted in the city of Atbara over a week ago and quickly spread to cities across Sudan. Authorities have shuttered schools and declared curfews and states of emergency in several regions. 
Residents say police have used tear gas and sometimes live ammunition against demonstrators. Protesters have repeatedly targeted and burned the offices of President Omar al-Bashir's party and called for an end to his 29-year rule.
Earlier on Friday, security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades at 300-400 worshippers as they left a mosque near the capital Khartoum after Friday prayers, a Reuters witness said.
The group in Omdurman, across the River Nile from Khartoum, was fired upon as people exited the mosque chanting ""peaceful, peaceful"". Around 30 SUVs belonging to the security forces had surrounded the square outside the building before noon prayers.
Protests were also held in Khartoum and other cities including Port Sudan and Dongola, witnesses said. 
According to official figures, at least 19 people have been killed, including two military personnel, but Amnesty International on Tuesday estimated the death toll to be nearly double that.
The Sudanese Congress Party, one of the opposition parties which have been calling for protests, said security forces had detained its leader Omar al-Degair on Friday.
""We affirm that the path of the December revolution will continue and will not be affected by arrest or repression,"" the party said in a statement. 
Civil society groups said the authorities raided a meeting of opposition leaders in Khartoum on Thursday evening and arrested nine people, including members of Sudan's Communist Party and the pan-Arab Ba'ath and Nasserist parties.
Sudan has been gripped by a deep economic crisis that began in 2011 after the southern half of the country voted to secede, taking with it three-quarters of the country's oil output, and has been aggravated by years of overspending and mismanagement. 
Opposition groups blame Bashir, who has governed Sudan since 1989, for the mismanagement. A series of measures, including a sharp devaluation of the Sudanese pound in October, have failed to shore up the economy. 
Members of parliament this month backed a constitutional amendment to extend term limits that would have required Bashir to step down in 2020.
SUNA cited a police spokesman as saying the situation across Sudan was calm on Friday ""except for some scattered gatherings in some parts of Khartoum state"" which he said were dispersed professionally and without financial or human losses.
Two U.N. human rights experts expressed alarm at the escalating violence and urged the government to exercise restraint.
""The Government should respond to legitimate grievances of the Sudanese people,"" Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, who reports to the U.N. Human Rights Council on the right to free assembly in Sudan, said in a statement.

Aristide Nononsi, who reports to the council on human rights in Sudan, said governments had a duty to tolerate dissent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City police will use an aerial drone for the first time to monitor the crowds gathered in Times Square (NYSE:SQ) on Monday for the New Year's Eve ball-drop celebrations, officials said on Friday, adding there was no known threat to the night's festivities.
The camera-carrying drone will be tethered to the roof of a building and will not fly directly over the hundreds of thousands of revelers in the area, but it will add an additional vantage-point alongside the 1,225 fixed video cameras that police will deploy.
Using counter-drone technology, the New York Police Department will also work with federal agents to thwart any civilians tempted to fly their own drones through Manhattan's canyons as 2019 dawns.
""Don't fly a drone that night,"" Police Commissioner James O'Neill told reporters at a news conference. ""If you fly one, there's a good chance you're going to end up getting arrested.""
Rogue drone operators recently crippled London's Gatwick Airport for three days by sending the flying machines repeatedly into the airfield.
The security plan includes closing off the blocks around Times Square to traffic and deploying thousands of police officers, uniformed and plainclothed, in the crossroads and the surrounding streets. 
Sharpshooters will take up positions on rooftops, and officers with long guns will stand guard at pedestrian checkpoints. Revelers will be screened before being admitted into security corrals for viewing the ball drop. Large bags and lawn chairs are banned.
Crews have even sealed shut manholes to prevent the sewers being used as a means of bypassing the checkpoints.
Police have also taken special precautions at high-rise hotels around Times Square, aiming to prevent any would-be attacker from using a hotel room as a sniper's nest.

In October 2017, a man spent days amassing an arsenal in a hotel suite in Las Vegas before breaking a window and shooting into a crowd at a music festival, killing 58 people.

GUATEMALA CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 8-year-old Guatemalan boy who died in the custody of U.S. border agents this week had the flu before he passed away but the cause of his death is still unknown, state officials said on Friday.
Felipe Gomez Alonzo was the second Guatemalan child to die this month while being held by U.S. authorities, sparking outrage from immigration advocates. 
In the wake of the deaths, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was traveling to the border to observe medical screenings and conditions at Border Patrol stations while Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate have called for a full investigation.
Gomez fell ill after being detained near the U.S. border with Mexico with his father. The two had traveled to the United States from their remote village of Yalambojoch in Guatemala. 
New Mexico's Medical Investigator's office said in a statement that nasal and lung swabs during an autopsy found Gomez had influenza B, but said ""determining an accurate cause of death requires further evaluation."" 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the flu diagnosis.
Marta Larra, a spokeswoman from the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry, said the government expected to receive the official results of the autopsy in roughly a month, and that Gomez's body would probably be returned to the country in about two weeks.
Gomez and his father were detained on Dec. 18 in El Paso, Texas, for illegally entering the country, but several days later they were moved to the Alamogordo Border Patrol Station in New Mexico.
After a border agent noticed the boy looked sick, Gomez was transferred to a nearby hospital but he was released with a prescription for an antibiotic and Ibuprofen. After the boy began to vomit and had a fever, he was taken back to the hospital in the evening, where he died just before midnight on Dec. 24. [L1N1YV0OM] 
Antibiotics do not work as treatment for viruses like the flu, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Kathryn Hampton, who coordinates the Asylum Network Program of the New York-based advocacy organization Physicians for Human Rights, said in a statement that border facilities are not well equipped to handle the increasing number of children and families migrating mostly from Central America to the United States.

U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to close the southern U.S. border unless Congress agrees to provide $5 billion in taxpayer funds for a border wall with Mexico, blaming Democrats for a partial government shutdown over the spending issue.

TIRANA (Reuters) - Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama replaced eight cabinet ministers on Friday amid a wave of student and anti-corruption protests, and urged his year-old government to think harder about how to make its term ""one of achievements"".
Students seeking a halving of fees and a doubling of the university education budget have been protesting in their thousands since early December and have said they will not even talk unless the government accepts their demands in full.
And since late November, residents whose houses are slated for demolition to make way for a ring road around the capital Tirana have also been protesting, angered still further by an illegal bid in the construction tender.
The opposition Democratic Party joined those protests and, although the government accepted that the bid had been illegal and canceled the tender, it called for the government to resign.
Announcing his reshuffle, Rama urged his Socialist Party to see the changes as ""part of a necessary reflection to turn this mandate into one of achievements that will lead us to win a third"".
One of the triggers for the student protests is alleged corruption in the education bureaucracy.
The education minister will be replaced by her deputy, whose first task will be to quell the student protests, due to resume on Jan. 7, which Rama said were ""still hurting"" the government.
Rama urged his party to engage with those who were angry, to ""boost capacities"" and to banish nepotism from public administration.
Unimpressed with the changes, the students left a broken steering wheel and a copy of the constitution at Rama's office.
Rama campaigned for a second term a year ago by asking Albanians to enable him to be ""alone at the wheel"", without the encumbrance of coalition allies.
""The wheel is a symbol of the accidents Rama had as a prime minister while the constitution is to remind him of the violations of the right of every Albanian to (higher) education,"" the organizers of the student protests said.
Among the cabinet changes was the appointment of Anila Denaj, a former Finance Ministry official and commercial bank executive who now heads the fund for obligatory medical insurance, to replace Arben Ahmetaj as Finance and Economy minister.

Belinda Balluku becomes energy minister, replacing Damian Gjiknuri; and Gent Caka, the deputy foreign minister, will step up to become minister, succeeding Ditmir Bushati.

""Troops resorted to live fire after confronting 5,000 rioters, some of who threw rocks and grenades,"" said an Israeli military spokeswoman.
She added that two Palestinian protesters briefly crossed the fence before returning into Gaza.
Health officials in Gaza, which is run by the Islamist Hamas movement, say more than 220 Palestinians have been killed since they began weekly border protests on March 30 to demand the easing of Israel’s blockade on the territory and the right to return to land lost in the 1948 war of Israel’s founding.
Israel has ruled out any such right, concerned that the country would lose its Jewish majority.
Alarmed at the bloodshed, Egypt, the United Nations and Qatar have sought ways to improve conditions in the enclave.
Israel withdrew settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains tight control of its land, air and sea borders. The wider Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled for several years.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo's government on Friday raised tariffs on a second layer of imports from Serbia, stepping up pressure on Belgrade to end a campaign to persuade other countries to withdraw recognition from its former province.
Kosovo, whose mostly ethnic Albanian population declared independence from Serbia in 2008, is recognised by around 110 nations but not by Serbia, Russia or five EU states. 
The government in Pristina last month raised customs tariffs on imports of locally-made products from Serbia and Bosnia, which also does not recognise Kosovo, to 100 percent from 10 percent. 
On Friday, in a move that Serbia called ""insane"", it did the same for imports of foreign-manufactured goods from the two countries.
Justifying the step, Kosovo's Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said Serbia's derecognition drive was an ""act of aggression"". 
Kosovar officials told Reuters a handful of countries had withdrawn their decision to recognise Kosovo.
Serbia, which has also been active in preventing Kosovo from joining the United Nations, criticised the tariff move.
""We are for a free trade, normal relation and equal chances for all. What they are doing is insane,"" Marko Djuric, head of the Serbian government's Office for Kosovo, said on state-run RTS TV. ""Pristina has declared war on major global brands.""
The foreign goods affected by Friday's move include Coca Cola and products by Nestle and Austrian juice maker Rauch.
In the month since the first 100 percent tariffs were introduced, imports from Serbia and Bosnia imports fell to a combined 290,000 euros from 35 million euros a year ago.
In 2017, Serbia’s exports to Kosovo totalled 450 million euros ($515 million) and Bosnia’s 80 million euros.
Bosnia, Kosovo and Serbia - along with Albania, Montenegro and Moldova - are part of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) set up to help ex-communist states harmonise their economic and legal systems with EU demands.
The EU said Kosovo's move was a clear violation of the CEFTA agreement.

Kosovo declared independence a decade after a NATO bombing campaign to end the killing of Albanian civilians by Serb forces during a two-year insurgency.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Amos Oz, Israel's best-known author and an outspoken supporter of a two-state solution to its conflict with the Palestinians, died of cancer at the age of 79 on Friday, his daughter said.
Over a 50-year career, Oz chronicled his country's rise from the ashes of the Holocaust and its struggles - among Jews and Arabs, secularists and zealots, conservatives and liberals. 
His writing - witty, scholarly, and often moody and erotic - won international plaudits, and he was a frequent bookies' favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature. But his political views sometimes stirred up rancor at home. 
""To those who loved him, thank you,"" his daughter Fania Oz-Salzberger said in a Twitter post announcing his death. 
Born Amos Klausner in Jerusalem to Eastern European immigrants, Oz moved to a kibbutz at 15 after his mother's suicide. He changed his surname to the Hebrew for ""might"".
Oz fought in the 1967 and 1973 Middle East wars, experiences that tinged his advocacy for territorial compromise with the Palestinians - though he was more circumspect about prospects for accommodation with Islamist group Hamas ruling Gaza. 
""We cannot become one happy family because we are not one, we are not happy, we are not family. We are two unhappy families. We have to divide the house into two smaller next-door apartments,"" he told Deutsche Welle in an interview marking Israel's 70th anniversary this year.
""There is no point in even fantasizing that after 100 years of bloodshed and anger and conflict Jews and Arabs will jump into a honeymoon bed and start making love not war.""
Oz studied philosophy and Hebrew literature at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. ""Elsewhere, Perhaps"", his first novel and an examination of relationships on a fictional kibbutz, was published in 1966. 
In his later years, he taught Hebrew literature at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev while living in the nearby desert town of Arad, where he had moved to salve his son's asthma.
Among his dozens of books, widely translated abroad from Hebrew, was ""A Tale of Love and Darkness,"" a memoir that actress and director Natalie Portman adapted for the screen in 2016.

""It was a tale of love and light, and now, a great darkness,"" Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said in a statement eulogizing Oz. ""Rest in peace, dear Amos. You gave us great pleasure.""

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army deployed forces near Manbij in northern Syria on Friday, a war monitor and a U.S. official said, after the Kurdish YPG militia urged Damascus to protect the town, where U.S. forces operate, from the threat of a Turkish offensive.
Manbij, which U.S.-backed forces captured from Islamic State in 2016, has emerged as a focal point of new tensions after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces whose presence has effectively deterred Turkey.
After a Syrian army announcement declaring government troops had entered Manbij, Turkey-backed Syrian rebels stationed in nearby territory said they had begun moving together with Turkish forces toward the town in readiness for ""the start of military operations to liberate"" it.
A witness said convoys of Turkey-backed insurgents, with armored vehicles and machine guns, were moving toward the frontline with the town.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said the Syrian government forces had entered a strip of territory at the edge of Manbij, not inside the town itself, creating a barrier with Turkey-backed fighters nearby.
Manbij, where U.S. troops have a military base, is held by a local militia allied to the YPG which Turkey deems a security threat. 
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that U.S. troops had not changed their positions in Manbij and dozens still remained. The official said they had not seen Syrian military forces inside Manbij but rather on the outskirts of the city.
The U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State said that ""despite incorrect information about changes to military forces in the city of Manbij, Syria, (the coalition) has seen no indication that these claims are true"". 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has vowed to crush the YPG, said Turkish officials would visit Russia - Assad's most powerful ally - on Saturday and discuss Syria. He indicated Turkey was not in a hurry to launch an offensive. 
Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw troops from Syria has alarmed the Kurdish-led fighters who have fought Islamic State alongside them for years. 
Kurdish leaders are scrambling for a strategy to protect their region stretching across the north and east, where the presence of some 2,000 U.S. troops has so far deterred Turkey.
A deployment of Syrian government forces, backed by Russia, would complicate any offensive by Turkey and its Syrian rebel proxies. 
U.S. military support for the Kurdish fighters has infuriated Turkey, which sees the YPG as an extension of the PKK movement that has been waging an insurgency inside Turkey for decades. 
Syrian state media circulated a video showing dozens of soldiers marching on a countryside road, chanting for President Bashar al-Assad. The military statement said troops had raised the national flag in Manbij on Friday and would guarantee security ""for all Syrian citizens and others present."" 
A resident inside the town said nothing had changed and he had not seen any such flags.
The YPG said on Friday its fighters had withdrawn from Manbij before to fight Islamic State elsewhere. 
""We invite the Syrian government, to which we belong, as people, land and borders, to send its armed forces to take over these positions and protect Manbij in the face of Turkish threats,"" it said.

In November, Turkish and U.S. troops began joint patrols near Manbij after reaching a deal that includes the YPG exiting the town.

It was not clear why Ethiopians were being prevented from entering at the Zalambessa crossing, which was shut on Thursday morning and remained closed on Friday, said Solomon Desta, a minibus driver on the Ethiopian side, speaking by phone. 
The crossing opened in September, after the countries agreed to remove their troops as part of a reconciliation process.
Thousands of people have crossed since. Trade has flourished and families separated since war broke out between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 1998 have reunited. 
A spokesman for Ethiopia's Foreign Ministry told reporters on Thursday that he had no information about any border restrictions. Eritrea's information minister, Yemane Ghebremeskel, did not respond to phone calls on Friday.
Tsegaye Kassaye, a tire fixer on the Ethiopian side of the frontier, said by phone that Eritreans were being permitted to enter Eritrea, and Ethiopians were being allowed to leave.

The British Foreign Office and the Russian Foreign Ministry were not immediately available for comment.
""We have reached a general agreement that we will start to restore diplomatic staff in Moscow and in London some time in January,"" the TASS news agency earlier quoted Russia's ambassador to London Alexander Yakovenko as saying in a television interview. 
""I am not sure that this would happen to all employees but at least half the staff would be in place,"" 
An embassy spokesman confirmed the remarks.
Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats over accusations the Kremlin was behind a nerve toxin attack in March on former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury. 

Russia, which denies any involvement in the poisoning, sent home the same number of British embassy workers in retaliation.

543,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Italy PM defends budget as tempers fray in parliament,"By Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Friday vigorously defended the government's 2019 budget as parliament held an acrimonious debate on the package, which needs to be approved by the end of the year to take effect on Jan. 1.
An amended budget was presented to the Chamber of Deputies on Thursday after the government reached a last-minute deal with the European Commission to avoid a disciplinary procedure against Rome that could have led to fines.
Opposition lawmakers said they had no time to discuss the package, and the sitting was suspended after a deputy from the center-left Democratic Party (PD) hurled the budget documents at a junior minister.
Speaking at the prime minister's year-end news conference, Conte acknowledged that parliament's role had been diminished, but said the deal with Brussels was ""a great result which will benefit the whole country.""
Italy last week re-drafted the budget and lowered its deficit goal for next year to 2.04 percent of gross domestic product after the Commission rejected its original target of 2.4 percent, saying it broke EU fiscal rules.
Conte called the budget ""the first step of a broad and ambitious plan of reform"" which would ""turn Italy inside out like a sock,"" and finally boost its chronically sluggish economic growth.
The government is expected to call a confidence vote in the Chamber to approve the budget on Saturday or Sunday, in time to avoid emergency provisional financing kicking in after the end of the year.
The PD on Friday lodged an appeal with the Constitutional Court, saying its democratic rights had been trampled on because there had been no time for parliament to debate or amend the package following the changes agreed with Brussels.
Italian financial markets have welcomed the end of hostilities with the Commission, and Italian benchmark bond yields hit a three-and-a-half month low on Friday after a successful debt auction.
Conte, 54, leads a coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League, former rivals which formed a government in June following an inconclusive March election. He is close to 5-Star but is not a member of either party.
The formerly unknown lawyer is now Italy's most popular active politician, according to many opinion polls. But he said on Friday he would not seek re-election at the end of the government's 5-year term of office.

He called the coalition ""a perfect amalgam"" despite reports of internal tensions, and set out an ambitious agenda of tax cuts, bureaucratic simplification and infrastructure investments.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Polling stations in Democratic Republic of Congo are ill-prepared for Sunday's presidential election, diplomats and an observer mission said, as new polling showed opposition candidate Martin Fayulu favored to win.
Frustration has mounted across the vast, shakily governed Central African country after repeated election delays and blunders as well as a decision this week to shelve voting in several opposition strongholds. 
Protests flared for a second straight day in eastern cities in response to the decision to cancel voting in Beni and Butembo in the east and Yumbi in the west. Demonstrators see it as a maneuver by the government to suppress the vote, rather than a precaution due to an Ebola outbreak and militia violence. 
In the eastern city of Goma, police fired tear gas during a standoff with protesters and demonstrators in Butembo barricaded streets and set fires at crossroads, according to local police. 
Activist group Lucha said police had arrested 18 of its members during the protest in Butembo. The police confirmed arrests had been made but did not say how many. 
The election is meant to bring about the first democratic transition of power in mineral-rich Congo, where regional wars around the turn of the century resulted in millions of deaths. 
But a chaotic election day could ignite new violence, as was the case after the 2006 and 2011 elections. 
Last week the election was pushed back to Dec. 30 due to a lack of ballot papers in the capital Kinshasa. At the time, the national electoral commission (CENI) said preparations would be complete by the new date.
But two days ahead of the ballot, only about 60 percent of election materials - including sheets to tabulate the vote - have been delivered to balloting stations across the country, three foreign diplomats told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Opposition leaders have accused authorities of trying to rig the vote in favor of outgoing President Joseph Kabila's preferred candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, using electronic voting machines. The government denies this. 
""If the results sheets don't arrive on time then it means that the vote results will be transferred via the voting machine, and that is going to inflame suspicions of fraud,"" said one of these diplomats, who has been in recent contact with CENI officials. 
CENI spokespeople could not be immediately reached for comment, but have said that the announced results will be based on hand counts of print-outs from the machines - as the opposition has demanded. 
20-HOUR QUEUES
According to an internal U.N. document seen by Reuters, the CENI has increased the number of voters per polling station in Kinshasa to 700 from the promised 600 by removing 1,094 polling stations.
As a result, the capital could face daunting 20-hour queues to vote, based on the average time it takes to use the voting machines, said Sylvain Lumu, of SYMOCEL, a domestic election observation mission. 
Polls are scheduled to remain open for 11 hours. 
""All these measures aim to decrease Kinshasa's voting power, since as you know Kinshasa is a city whose heart goes to the left,"" he said, adding that 5,000 of his roughly 20,000 observers were still waiting for accreditation. 
CENI has acknowledged that polling stations were reorganized, but said it was necessary after a warehouse fire two weeks ago burned 80 percent of voting machines in Kinshasa.
Observers from the Catholic Church, African Union and Southern (NYSE:SO) African Development will be present for the vote. But the government has refused to accept election monitors from the European Union and U.S.-based Carter Center, which said Kabila's re-election in 2011 was marred by widespread fraud.
EASTERN PROTESTS 
Public support for Kabila's preferred successor, Shadary, has remained flat in recent weeks even as the popularity of Fayulu, the joint opposition candidate, has soared.
The latest poll by the New York University-affiliated Congo Research Group (CRG) showed Fayulu leapfrogging from third place in October to the top spot with 47 percent support. He was ahead of the former frontrunner, opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi, on 24 percent, and Shadary on 19 percent.
CRG updated those figures slightly from earlier on Friday so as not to take into account non-respondents. 
Fayulu, a former  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) company manager, was little known when he was picked as the joint candidate of an opposition coalition in November, but extensive campaigning, including in Ebola-hit Beni, has since heightened his profile.
The unrest seen over the past week could spread depending on the outcome of the election, according to the poll, which found that 48 percent of respondents would certainly or probably protest if the vote appeared to be rigged.
That would also affect the response to the ongoing Ebola virus outbreak - the second-deadliest history - which is believed to have killed more than 350 people this year. 

International relief group Oxfam said on Friday it was suspending its response near Beni and Butembo due to the past days' street protests.

The stamp, part of a series of 11 to mark the 75th anniversary of the June 1944 landings, was part of a special program for 2019 to showcase the ""Best of British"". 
""The stamp issue will be a timely commemoration of all those who participated and will use images from the day itself,"" the Royal Mail said before the blunder was revealed.
However, after a preview of the stamp was put on the Royal Mail's Twitter feed, historians and others noticed that it actually showed U.S. troops wading ashore in May 1944 in Dutch New Guinea, now Indonesia, from a landing craft that was not involved in the D-Day landings. 
""We sincerely apologise that our 2019 Special Stamp preview included a design which had been incorrectly associated with the D-Day landings,"" Royal Mail said on Twitter.
""This stamp design has not been printed. We would like to reassure our customers that this image will not be part of the final set.""

KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - As moves toward peace pick up in Afghanistan, the Taliban are trying to show they have changed since the brutal days of the 1990s when they banned music and girls' education and carried out public executions in Kabul's football stadium. 
""If peace comes and the Taliban return, then our return will not be in the same harsh way as it was in 1996,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told Reuters, referring to the year they took over in Kabul before their ouster by U.S.-led troops in 2001.
""We want to assure Afghan nationals that there will be no threat to anyone from our side.""
The comments come as moves toward peace negotiations have intensified, following a series of meetings between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives over the past three months.
Expectations of a decisive shift have been heightened by reports that more than 5,000 U.S. troops may be withdrawn from Afghanistan, in an abrupt about-turn from the previous U.S. strategy of stepping up military pressure on the insurgents.
""Our opposition is with the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan. Once they are out and a peace deal is reached, then a nationwide amnesty will be announced,"" said Mujahid.
""No one, police, army, government employees or anyone, will face revenge behavior from our side."" 
Reports of the withdrawal are unconfirmed but they have triggered alarm among many Afghans with bitter memories of the Taliban's ultra-hardline regime. 
""I don't think their mindset has changed but they have realized that without respecting human rights, they cannot be accepted by the international community,"" said Bilal Sediqi, spokesman for the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.
With Afghanistan likely to remain dependent on foreign aid for years, the Taliban know they cannot return to the past when fighters swept into Kabul after the chaos of the 1990s civil war.
But they insist that as well as the withdrawal of foreign forces, there will be a return to their strict version of Islamic rule and many Afghans doubt their claims to have softened, even while yearning for an end to the war.
In June, Taliban leaders were angry at their fighters swapping selfies with soldiers and government officials and eating ice cream with civilians during a three-day ceasefire. Soon afterwards, they launched complex attacks on strategic provinces to try to oust Afghan forces and used civilians as human shields.
""TIRED OF WAR""
""I know there is no place for me if the Taliban return in their old style,"" said Abdul, a 12-year police veteran currently working in the western province of Farah.
""...I will stand by the government side whatever it decides. But still I have not lost my hope in the future. The Taliban are not the old ones. We see changes among them. They are also tired of war.""
The Taliban, a predominantly ethnic Pashtun movement, strongest in the south and east of the country, now control large stretches of the countryside, where they levy taxes, run courts and control education.
For many conservative rural Afghans, Taliban rule provides welcome stability and the merciless punishments and rigid controls on women's rights fit well with traditional practices in many areas.
In the Aqtash district of northern Kunduz province, a hotbed of Taliban insurgents, some women said they are allowed to walk freely and do not have to cover their faces in all-enveloping burqas.
Mujahid said the Taliban were not against women's education or employment but wanted to maintain cultural and religious codes. 
""We are not against women working in government organizations or against their outdoor activities, but we will be against the alien culture clothes worn by women, brought to our country,"" Mujahid said.
Omaid Maisam, the deputy spokesman for Afghan Chief Executive officer Abdullah Abdullah, said the government protects human rights and the Taliban must accept the national constitution to shed their hardline image.
""We have seen some signs of changes among them, but they have to show it in their actions that they have really changed,"" he said.
Many believe the return on the Taliban would threaten the gains the country has made since 2001. Much work remains to be done to convince women in work or education and skeptical groups of ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras from northern and central Afghanistan. 
""I think that these statements that the Taliban have changed are only excuses that are being used by the Taliban to gain acceptance,"" said Malina Hamidi, a teacher at a school in the Chamtal district of Balkh province.

""I am 100 percent confident that once they come back to power, they will be the same Taliban that ruled Afghanistan in the nineties.""

547,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Islamists kill at least 10 in bid to capture northeast Nigerian lake town: residents,"By Ahmed Kingimi and Lanre Ola
MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Islamist militants and Nigerian troops have been fighting around a fishing town on Lake Chad as the insurgents step up attacks in the run-up to a presidential election in which security is a campaign issue, the army and residents said.
The Nigerian army said in a statement the militants attacked a military base in Baga, in eastern Borno state, on Wednesday evening. The borders of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon meet on the lake. 
Residents said 10 people had been killed and clashes were still going on as the militants tried to capture the town.
But Nigerian army spokesman Sani Usman said: ""We are clearing and mopping up."" 
The only military death was a member of the navy, which supported army troops along with the air force, Usman said. 
Baga was the scene of mass killings by Boko Haram militants in 2015 when hundreds, possibly thousands, of people died and much of the town was destroyed. At the time Boko Haram held territory around the size of Belgium in northeast Nigeria but were later beaten back.
This attack, however, was the latest in a string of strikes on military bases in the northeast. President Muhammadu Buhari's security record has become a campaign issue ahead of an election in February in which he will seek a second term.
The Boko Haram insurgency, which Buhari promised to end when he took office in 2015, aims to create an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria. It has killed about 30,000 people and forced about 2.7 million to flee their homes since 2009. 
A faction of the group - Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) - split from Boko Haram in 2016 and is now considered by security experts to be the stronger group.
Two military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said ISWA carried out the attack on Baga. 
Two residents who fled the fighting in Baga said they saw the bodies of at least 10 people. Eight of the dead wore military uniforms, one said. 
The Nigerian army said the military base attacked housed a unit of the Multinational Joint Task Force, which comprises of soldiers from Nigeria and neighboring Niger, Chad and Cameroon. 
About 100 soldiers were killed in November by ISWA militants who attacked an army base in Metele, Borno state. That was the biggest loss of military life in the last few months. 
Buhari's opponents used the attack to question the former general's handling of the insurgency.

The assailants attacked and set fire to a school on Wednesday night in Loroni, a village about 250 km (155 miles) northwest of the capital Ouagadougou, the ministry said in a statement late on Thursday.
Two patrols of gendarmes, or military police, were sent to arrest the attackers but ran into an ambush on Thursday morning that killed 10 of them and wounded an unknown number of others, it said.
Security has worsened in Burkina Faso in recent months, primarily due to Islamist militant attacks near the landlocked country's porous border with Mali. Ouagadougou has also been hit by several major attacks over the past three years. 
Thousands of people have fled their home as a result of the attacks and reprisals by Burkinabe security forces, Human Rights Watch reported in May.
Violence in West Africa's semi-arid Sahel region continues to mount five years after France intervened in Mali, a former French colony, to drive back Islamist militants who had seized the country’s desert north. 
France retains about 4,000 troops deployed across its former colonies in the arid Sahel region as part of the anti-terror Operation Barkhane.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 07:55AM ET</span>",Congo cartoonist prepares to sketch a new president,"By Alessandra Prentice and Aaron Ross
KINSHASA (Reuters) - Thembo Kashauri has sketched some of the most scathing parodies of Joseph Kabila, yet Congo's best-known political cartoonist has mixed feelings about the taciturn president's impending departure after nearly two decades in power.
""He had an atypical personality for a head of state but he inspired a lot of my drawings,"" the cartoonist known as Kash said in his cramped studio cluttered with old computer equipment in the capital Kinshasa.
""His silences were so eloquent that the fact he didn't speak much said a lot,"" he said of Kabila, who has governed Democratic Republic of Congo since his father's assassination in 2001. 
After Kabila finally agreed not to defy presidential term limits by standing in Sunday's election, Kash drew a weeping Joseph with his signature salt-and-pepper beard and thick head of hair being comforted by South Africa's president.
""Power is life,"" sobs Kabila as Cyril Ramaphosa reassures him there is life after the presidency.
The election, which has turned into a race between Kabila's favored candidate and two main opposition challengers, could lead to Congo's first democratic transfer of power after decades marked by armed conflicts. 
But the poll, which is already two years late because Kabila refused to go when his mandate expired, has been marred by killings on the campaign trail and opposition outcry after the electoral commission canceled the vote in several of their strongholds, citing security and health concerns.
'TURN THE PAGE'
Kash, 53, is well-accustomed to finding ways to make light of Congo's grim realities, but he hopes the outcome of Sunday's vote could lighten the dark mood that permeates his sketches. 
""If one of the opposition candidates took power, I think ... we could turn the page,"" he said. 
Kash, who draws for Le Potentiel, an opposition-leaning daily in Kinshasa, and the news site actualite.cd, has found plenty to poke fun at during a topsy-turvy campaign. 
After the electoral commission announced last week yet another seven-day delay to the vote, Kash sketched commission president Corneille Nangaa on an A4 sheet of paper in chef's whites in a smoke-filled kitchen. 
While Nangaa stirs a big pot labeled ""December 30 cassoulet"", an anxious waitress asks if the food is ready as the diners are on the verge of rioting.
""I'm trying to portray Congolese people's anxiety about December 30,"" Kash told Reuters after filling in an initial pencil sketch with bold strokes of thick black marker.
Kash, who hails from the eastern city of Beni, began his career as a painter but learned to draw cartoons from a Belgian artist and started to sketch for magazines in the 1980s. 
At first, he stuck to cartoons about music and culture but he started depicting veteran Congolese autocrat Mobutu Sese Seko in 1990 after his forces massacred dozens of students in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi.
""We couldn't caricature politics,"" he said. ""In 1990, I was just about the first to caricature Mobutu."" 
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Often heavy-handed repression of journalists and activists has continued since the Mobutu era through the administrations of Laurent Kabila and his son, Joseph. 
But Kash says he rarely faces official pressure to tone down his drawings - even if his newspaper occasionally won't run cartoons it deems too provocative. 
On several occasions, he has drawn Congo as an open-air prison hemmed in by high walls and barbed wire. In 2014, he drew Kabila trying on Mobutu's trademark leopard-skin hat as the old dictator tells him he'll be able to hold on to power if he just adds a cane and glasses to his repertoire. 
Kash's ability to mock the rich and powerful in Congo reflects in part a country that has long proved too big and too unruly for any leader to muzzle its famed sense of humor, unlike its more tightly controlled neighbors. 
""The freedom of expression we have in Congo is the result of a long struggle. In Brazzaville and Rwanda, you don't mess around. You'll get yourself killed,"" he said. 
Even so, there are few other cartoonists who have his fearless style. ""They're too timid,"" said Kash.
Despite his self-avowed fondness for drawing Kabila, Kash said his would-be successors have some potential too.
One of the frontrunners, Felix Tshisekedi, has the same bulk as his father, the late opposition icon Etienne, and sports the same distinctive flat cap. Kash said he also enjoys drawing Kabila's preferred successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. 

""Since he was picked as the heir apparent, I've been able to draw him fairly easily because he has quite fine features - the nose, the body. He's an interesting subject to draw.""

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cash-strapped Cuba plans fresh austerity measures and will pressure the sluggish bureaucracy to tighten its belt and cut red tape to address weak growth, falling export earnings and rising debt.
The economy has averaged 1 percent annual growth over the last three years, compared with a 5 percent to 7 percent rate economists say is needed to recover fully from a 1990s depression caused by the fall of its former benefactor, the Soviet Union.
The communist-run country has more recently been hit by the economic collapse of its new sponsor and strategic ally, Venezuela, which began to send fuel and cash its way in exchange for doctors and medicine 18 years ago. 
Other external shocks, such as Hurricane Irma in late 2017 and the Trump administration's tightening of U.S. sanctions, have also weighed on the Caribbean island nation's economy.
""The 2019 plan is one of adjustment to current realities. We cannot spend more than we earn,"" Economy Minister Alejandro Gil Fernandez said at a session of the National Assembly last week.
State-run companies account for and control most economic activity, including finances and foreign trade, through a planned economy.
Cuba last reported its foreign debt at $15.8 billion in 2015. It began delaying payments to some suppliers and investors in 2016, with western diplomats and businessmen estimating the short-term debt accumulated since then at more than $1.5 billion.
President Miguel Diaz-Canel told the Assembly that next year the country would slightly reduce the backlog of overdue payments through austerity measures and by drawing on a glut of inventory and emergency reserves.
Diaz-Canel and Gil said plans for the economy to grow 1.5 percent, after an anemic 1.2 percent this year, were based in part on doing away with bureaucratic habits and cutting waste and theft.
""The plan must be executed immediately. We have to review the system to insure there is no room for bureaucrats to maneuver,"" Diaz-Canel said, threatening to replace them if they stuck to their old ways.
CRISIS TO CONTINUE
Venezuelan oil deliveries have fallen at least 40 percent since 2014, forcing Cuba to import from Russia and Algeria.
Cuba imports more than half the fuel it consumes.
Gil said fuel consumption would be cut from 91 metric tons per million pesos in gross domestic product this year to 84 tons in 2019.
Foreign trade fell around 25 percent from 2013 through 2017, with annual imports dropping to $11.3 billion from $15.6 billion, according to the government.
Gil said trade declined further in 2018, without providing figures.
The minister said exports would increase 6 percent next year while imports would be slashed 11 percent compared with the 2018 plan, in an economy heavily dependent on raw materials and machinery from abroad for nearly everything it produces.
Economist Pavel Vidal, a former central bank analyst who teaches at the Universidad Javeriana Cali in Colombia, called the 1.5 percent growth target ""reasonable"" as sugar, agriculture and tourism had a particularly bad 2018 due to Hurricane Irma, meaning that growth would come from a low starting point.
""What is most worrisome is the payment crisis, which continues to grow, and creditors are losing patience,"" said Vidal, who has authored various reports on Cuba in conjunction with international lending institutions.
Western diplomats who met with top officials recently said the Cubans said little about how they planned to surmount the crisis and gave no indication they would allow more private initiative and capital accumulation by citizens.

""Obtaining inputs and credit on the international market will be more difficult in 2019,"" Vidal said.

ALGECIRAS, Spain (Reuters) - A Spanish charity rescue ship docked in Algeciras port in southern Spain on Friday, bringing ashore more than 300 migrants rescued in the Mediterranean Sea one week ago.
Several European countries, including Malta and Italy, had refused entry to the Proactiva Open Arms vessel although a mother and her newborn baby were taken by helicopter to Malta. Most of the 308 migrants are African and had been picked up off the coast of Libya.
Men lined up on the deck of the ship as it entered the port early on Friday, a few wearing Santa hats.
Spanish police and Red Cross staff helped the migrants to disembark. The Red Cross had set up tents on the dock to administer medical checks.
Illegal immigration to Europe by sea has fallen sharply overall since 2016 but arrivals in Spain have more than doubled annually to the rate of more than 1,000 people per week this year.
Spain's minority Socialist government has accepted hundreds rescued by Proactiva Open Arms this year.

The Socialists lost power in the southern region of Andalusia in local elections this month, with the Vox party who campaigned on an anti-immigration ticket winning seats in the first electoral success for the far right since Spain's return to democracy in the late 1970s.

TIJUANA (Reuters) - Since setting out from Honduras in the hope of reaching the United States, Nicolas Alonso Sanchez has worn a simple wooden cross around his neck – a quiet reminder of the Roman Catholic faith that propels him forward.
""God gave me the strength to get all the way here,"" Sanchez, 47, says at a temporary shelter where he is staying in the Mexican border city of Tijuana.
On the long journey from Central America to U.S. soil, many migrants have taken solace in their religion.
Several 'caravans' of mostly Honduran migrants who made the trek this year faced arduous conditions, braving fierce heat by day and searching for a safe place to sleep at night.
Many regard their faith as their compass.
For migrants far from home, the street often becomes their place of worship. On a warm afternoon in late November, pastor Jose Murcia, a Salvadoran who lives in the United States, preaches outside a temporary shelter in Tijuana to a cluster of men.
Later, Murcia joins a pair of men kneeling in the middle of the road, their heads bowed in prayer. 
On their way to the U.S. border, the migrants walked the length of Mexico. Here, the Virgin of Guadalupe - an image of the Virgin Mary who devotees believe appeared to an indigenous man in the 16th century - looms large. As if seeking her protection, a man drapes himself with a banner depicting her as he crouches before a phalanx of riot police in Tijuana. 
The migrants face a future of uncertainty. The United States said this month that many asylum seekers may be forced to stay in Mexico while their claims are processed. Some Mexican border towns are perilous places to wait, plagued with crime and violence.
But many migrants, bolstered by their faith, say they are undaunted.
""God always takes care of me,"" says Osmel Efraim, an 18-year-old Honduran migrant in Tijuana. ""Thanks to God, I am here, safe and healthy.""

ANKARA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's declaration in a phone call with Tayyip Erdogan that he was pulling U.S. troops from Syria has stunned Turkey and left it scrambling to respond to the changing battlefield on its southern border.
In the phone call two weeks ago, Trump had been expected to deliver a standard warning to the Turkish president over his plan to launch a crossborder attack targeting U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeast Syria, U.S. officials say.
Instead, in the course of the conversation Trump reshaped U.S. policy in the Middle East, abandoning a quarter of Syrian territory and handing Ankara the job of finishing off Islamic State in Syria.
""Trump asked: 'If we withdraw our soldiers, can you clean up ISIS?'"", a Turkish official told Reuters. He said Erdogan replied that Turkish forces were up to the task.
""Then you do it,"" Trump told him abruptly. To his national security adviser John Bolton, also on the call, Trump said: ""Start work for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.""
""I have to say it was an unexpected decision. The word 'surprise' is too weak to describe the situation,"" said the official, one of five Turkish sources who spoke to Reuters about the Dec. 14 call between the two leaders.
Trump's decision was also a shock in Washington, where senior administration officials, including Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, tried for days to change the president's mind, U.S. officials said. When Trump made clear he would not back down, Mattis and a senior official coordinating the fight against Islamic State, Brett McGurk, both resigned.
On a visit to a U.S. air base in Iraq this week, Trump said that military commanders had repeatedly requested extensions for the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria - requests that he finally turned down because he said Islamic State was largely beaten.
""We've knocked them silly. I will tell you I've had some very good talks with President Erdogan who wants to knock them out also, and he'll do it,"" he told American troops. 
RISK FOR TURKEY
For Turkey, Trump's decision offers opportunity and risk.
Ankara has complained bitterly for years that the United States, a NATO ally, had chosen the Kurdish YPG militia as its main partner on the ground in Syria against Islamic State.
Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist group, inseparable from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey in which 40,000 people have been killed.
The U.S. withdrawal potentially frees Turkey's military to push the YPG back from 500 km of border without risking a confrontation with American forces. It also removes a main cause of this year's diplomatic crisis between the two countries.
But it also opens up an area of Syria far larger than anything Turkey had expected to fill, potentially pitting it against not just Kurdish forces but also the Damascus government - which is committed to regaining control of all of Syria - and its Russian and Iranian backers.
The YPG on Friday asked the Syrian government to take over the town of Manbij, which the Kurdish militia currently controls with U.S. support, to protect it from Turkish attack.
And if Turkish forces are to take on Islamic State in its last pocket of Syrian territory near the Iraqi border, they would first have to cross 250 km of territory controlled by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces. 
""Erdogan got more than he bargained for,"" said Soner Cagaptay, Director of the Turkish Program at the Washington Institute. ""He had asked the U.S. to drop the YPG, but not withdraw from Syria"".
Erdogan has for years backed rebels who once hoped to topple Bashar al-Assad, but the Syrian president's survival has been assured by support from Tehran and Moscow even though the north and east - including Syrian oilfields - remain beyond Assad's control for now.
As it takes stock of the new challenge, Turkey is launching intensive talks with Washington and Moscow. Ankara expects U.S. military officials to visit within days, as well as Bolton and possibly the U.S. special Syria envoy, James Jeffrey.
Turkey's intelligence chief and defense and foreign ministers are also due in Moscow on Saturday, the spokesman for Erdogan's AK Party said.
""Of course it will be difficult. The whole issue needs to be planned again from the start,"" a Turkish security official said.
A U.S. official said military planners were drafting plans that could see a withdrawal over the course of several months. One of the proposals under consideration is a 120-day withdrawal period, according a person familiar with discussions.
Washington is also grappling with what to do with weapons it provided to the YPG militia and promised to take back after the campaign against Islamic State ended. 
Turkey says the weapons must be collected so they are not used against Turkish troops, but U.S. officials say they cannot disarm their own allies when the fight is not yet over.
Erdogan announced last week Turkey is postponing its planned military operation against the YPG in light of Trump's decision.
The Turkish military has already carried out two incursions into north Syria, backed by pro-Turkey Syrian rebels. In 2016 they targeted Islamic State and Kurdish fighters, and earlier this year took control of the YPG-held Afrin region.
But Ankara and its Syrian rebel allies alone do not have the capacity to take over the whole region which the United States is abandoning, Cagaptay said. Turkey's priority therefore may be to secure its southern frontier.
""Distancing the YPG from the border and wiping out these elements is of critical importance,"" the security official said.
He stressed the need for careful coordination over who should fill other areas which departing U.S. forces will leave, and warned of problems ahead if agreement could not be reached.

""Is it a big victory for Turkey?"" another official said. ""I'm not sure right now.""

557,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Watchdog clears Thai junta deputy over luxury watches,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said on Friday he was never worried about an anti-corruption investigation that this week cleared him of any wrongdoing over two dozen luxury watches that he did not claim as assets.
The National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) ruled on Thursday there was ""insufficient evidence"" the junta's second-in-command purposely filed a false declaration of assets or intentionally hid required information, a statement said.
""This matter has never crossed my mind,"" Prawit told reporters on Friday when asked about the NACC decision.
Prawit faced fierce criticism on social media after he appeared in a Cabinet photograph last December sporting a diamond ring and an expensive watch because neither item appeared on his public asset declaration.
Thais later identified online 25 other luxury watches the former general has worn but not declared in various photographs since taking public office, prompting calls for his resignation.
The NACC decision, which backs Prawit's account that all the luxury items were borrowed, sparked a fresh outcry on social media, with some questioning the impartiality of the anti-graft agency.
""Corruption scandals in Thailand have been clouded by political polarization,"" said Titipol Phakdeewanich, dean of the faculty of political science at Ubon Ratchathani University.
NACC secretary-general Worawit Sukboon would not comment on the allegations when contacted by Reuters.
The military government has taken several steps to remain influential after upcoming elections, scheduled to take place on February 24.
The race is expected to pit parties favored by the junta against the populist political movement linked to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, which the military ousted in a 2014 coup.

""While many people have been outraged by the watch scandal, there are some who purposely turn a blind eye on alleged wrongdoings of this government because they support the military and fear the Shinawatras,"" Titipol said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese police detained a group of students on Friday who were protesting against a crackdown on a campus Marxist society, whose former head was held by police on the 125th birthday of the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong.China has an awkward relationship with the legacy of Mao, who died in 1976 and is still officially venerated by the ruling Communist Party. 
But far leftists in recent years have latched onto Mao's message of equality, posing awkward questions at a time of unprecedented economic boom that has seen a rapidly widening gap between the rich and the poor.
In particular, students and recent graduates have teamed up with labor activists to support factory workers fighting for the right to set up their own union. Dozens of activists have been detained in a government crackdown that followed.
Qiu Zhanxuan, head of the Peking University Marxist Society, said he was approached on Wednesday morning at a subway station by plainclothes police who said they wanted him to answer questions about an event he was organizing to celebrate Mao's birthday. Mao was born on Dec. 26, 1893.
When Qiu refused, the men took his phone, forced him into a car and drove him to a police station where he was questioned for 24 hours before being released with a warning, Qiu said, according to accounts provided by fellow students, who declined to be identified.
Late on Thursday, the university's extracurricular activities guidance office released a notice saying police had penalized Qiu and he ""did not have the qualifications"" to continue as head of the society. 
The teachers in charge of guiding the group had determined its members had deviated from promises made to teachers when the group was registered and so had ""restructured"" the group, the office said.
The ""restructuring"" was an attempt to ""scatter"" the group after weeks of continuous harassment by campus police and attempts to cast its members as being involved in a ""conspiracy"", Qiu said, according to the accounts of his comments. 
Qiu declined additional comment to Reuters.
'PICKING QUARRELS'
None of the people on the new list of student leaders released by university authorities were previous members of the group, and many of them are members of the official Student Association that had been involved in harassing the group, Qiu said.
""We don't recognize this,"" he added, according to the accounts of his comments.
Later on Friday, a small group of students staged a protest against the action by the authorities, but were themselves detained by police, according to video footage sent to Reuters by one of the students. 
The university referred Reuters to the statement issued by its extracurricular activities guidance office on why the Marxist group had been restructured.
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to requests for comment.
Student unrest is highly sensitive, especially as next year marks 30 years since the bloody suppression of student-led pro-democracy protests in and around Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ). 
Qiu said his non-academic school adviser, a deputy secretary of the Social Sciences party committee, Shi Changyi, was with him while police questioned him and had advised him not to be ""extreme"" or ""impulsive"", according to the accounts of his comments. 
Reuters was unable to reach Shi for comment. 
Police gave Qiu a subpoena saying he was suspected of ""picking quarrels and stirring up trouble"", which is a crime, but they declined to elaborate, he said, according to the accounts of his comments.

""This was, plain and simple, a plan to restrict my personal freedom and to use these inhuman and illegal means to stop me from going to commemorate Chairman Mao.""

559,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 04:26AM ET</span>",May's Brexit deal can get through parliament: UK foreign minister,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal can be passed by the British parliament if the European Union provides clarification that the Northern Irish ""backstop"" will be temporary, foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said on Friday.
The backstop is an insurance policy designed to prevent the return of border checks between Ireland, an EU member, and British-ruled Northern Ireland. It is proving the biggest obstacle to a divorce deal between Britain and the EU. 
May pulled a vote on her divorce deal earlier this month after admitting that parliament would reject it. Lawmakers are set to discuss the agreement again next month, with a vote in the week starting Jan. 14.
Parliament is deeply divided, with both supporters and opponents of Brexit opposed to May's deal, which seeks to maintain close ties with the EU.
Britain is due to leave the bloc on March 29 and the impasse has increased the chances of a no deal Brexit and led to growing calls for a second referendum.
Hunt said May's withdrawal agreement could be passed by lawmakers if the EU made clear that the Irish ""backstop"" would be time-limited.
Critics fear the backstop will trap Britain in a customs union with the EU indefinitely, while European leaders have said they would not renegotiate the treaty.
""If it is temporary, then parliament can live with that,"" Hunt told BBC radio. ""We can get this (the deal) through, absolutely can."" 
If May's deal fails, senior ministers are themselves split on what should happen. Some suggest that another referendum should be considered, while others, including Hunt, favor a ""managed"" no-deal Brexit. May herself has said neither option is viable.
Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said May should recall parliament early to allow a vote on her Brexit deal, and warned it was a matter of ""when, not if"" his party tried to force an election by proposing a vote of no-confidence in the government.
Lawmakers (MPs) are not due to return until Jan. 7 and Corbyn said the government was using the delay as a ploy to put pressure on parliament to accept her deal or risk a no-deal Brexit. 

""What I suspect is that it's a completely cynical maneuver to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea,"" Corbyn said in an interview with the Independent newspaper.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>","Ahead of Bangladesh vote, opposition says it has been silenced","By Zeba Siddiqui, Krishna N. Das and Ruma Paul
DHAKA/NOAKHALI, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladesh has a general election this weekend, but opposition candidate Abdul Moyeen Khan says he has yet to hold a single public meeting in his constituency about 30 miles (50 km) northeast of Dhaka, the capital.
Thousands of campaign fliers bearing photographs of the nuclear physicist with flowing gray hair lie in piles at his home because his supporters are too frightened to put them up in public places, the 72-year-old said.
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the Muslim majority nation's biggest opposition group, is fighting Sunday's election as part of an alliance cobbled together three months ago. But its leaders, candidates such as Khan, and workers say they are facing violent attacks and intimidation, including shootings and arrests, that have stunted their ability to campaign.
Posters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League are plastered and hung up from utility poles across the country. But barely visible are those of its opponents, many of whom, including BNP chairperson and three-time premier Khaleda Zia, have been jailed on what the BNP calls trumped-up charges. 
Not trusting Hasina to hold a fair election, the BNP boycotted the last vote in 2014. This time, it stayed in the race by banding together with smaller parties, but several BNP leaders say they are regretting that decision.
With over 100 million registered voters and 300 seats in parliament, this is one of the largest national elections anywhere in the world this year. But as campaigning came to an end on Friday, opposition leaders said they had barely stirred out of their homes.
""I am not even allowed to campaign, and they are threatening voters to stay away,"" Khan said at his home in Dhaka earlier this week, where he was visiting an assistant hospitalized after being assaulted.
In the first two days of this week, opposition workers in 88 constituencies had been attacked, Khan said. One candidate has sued police for shooting him eight times with pellet bullets while he was out seeking votes.
Hasina's Awami League, seeking a third straight term in power, has denied the allegations and blames the opposition for attacks that killed at least five of its workers and injured more than 300 in the past three weeks.
In a recent interview, Awami League leader H.T. Imam handed Reuters photographs of people he called opposition ""thugs"" vandalizing shops, setting fire to vehicles, and burning Awami League posters in Dhaka in November.
Imam also listed steps Hasina had taken since coming to power to ensure free and fair elections, including strengthening the Election Commission, introducing see-through ballot boxes and empowering the police to act against political parties' use of money and muscle.
DIVIDED ELECTION COMMISSION
Yet a rift has developed in the Election Commission, with Mahbub Talukdar, one of the five commissioners, saying last week there was no level playing field. 
""It is not enough to hold a participatory election, it should also be free, fair and as per the law,"" Talukdar said in a statement on Wednesday.
His boss, Chief Election Commissioner K.M. Nurul Huda, has said Talukdar was lying and also rejected the opposition's allegations of bias. He did not respond to calls from Reuters seeking further comment. Police say they have been working under the orders of the Election Commission since last month.
More than 61 percent of the opposition alliance's 287 candidates face criminal cases, compared with only around 7 percent of the ruling party's 299, according to affidavits filed by candidates at the Election Commission that were analyzed by the Dhaka-based civil society group Shujan.
Most cases against the opposition are ""politically motivated"", Shujan's Secretary Badiul Alam Majumdar said.
BNP says more than 8,200 leaders and activists of the opposition alliance, comprising around 20 parties, have been arrested since the election schedule was announced early last month. It added four workers had been killed and more than 12,300 injured in various assaults in that period.
Sohel Rana, a spokesman for the Bangladesh police, declined to give figures of arrests or attacks on political leaders and activists, but said his department took allegations of mistakes in filing charges seriously and would take action against any officers found responsible.
Street politics has always been violent in Bangladesh, which won freedom from Pakistan in 1971 under the leadership of Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Khaleda, who has served as prime minister for 10 years, is the widow of former president Ziaur Rahman.
A bitter decades-long rivalry between Hasina and Khaleda - often called ""the two begums"", or noblewomen - has frequently manifested itself in violence by their parties' student and youth wings.
Ataur Rahman, who chairs the bipartisan think-tank Centre for Governance Studies (CGS), said the dominance of the party in power, violence across the country, and police cases against the opposition were all concerns.
HASINA TIPPED TO WIN
A Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) poll by CGS this week showed nearly 80 percent of 4,500 respondents were in favor of the opposition. Still, Rahman predicts Hasina will retain power. And other polls show her party remains popular.
Results released in September of a survey by the U.S.-based nonprofit International Republican Institute showed 62 percent of Bangladeshis said they thought the country was headed in the right direction, citing an improving economy. The country's garments industry that generates sales of $30 billion a year, is booming.
But the survey of 5,000 respondents also found that Bangladeshis were losing confidence in democratic institutions and processes, with only 32 percent saying they believed this election would be free and fair. 
Hasina has been lauded internationally for providing refuge to Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in Myanmar, but her government is accused of suppressing dissent and jailing critics. Many journalists say she has intimidated the media by using vaguely worded laws, which she denies.
U.S. funded political observers who were scheduled to visit to monitor elections have been forced to cancel plans due to what Washington said was Bangladesh's ""inability to grant credentials and issue visas within the timeframe necessary"". Bangladesh's foreign ministry said it was following due process.
WHERE ARE THE POSTERS?
When a group of daily wage laborers gathered in Dhaka this week, supporters of both political groups said no other prime minister had helped build more roads and culverts than Hasina.
But they said they should be free to elect their leader, and that a lack of campaigning by the opposition was not helping them decide.
""Opposition people can't even put up election posters, can’t open election offices,"" said Musharraf Hussain Sharafat, 50, who works as a decorator at tents put up for weddings. ""We think we won’t even be allowed to vote.""
In Noakhali district, about 100 miles (160 km) south of Dhaka, opposition posters in two key constituencies are hardly visible. 
In one of them, the Awami League’s General Secretary and Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, was seen out seeking votes last weekend with a cavalcade of black SUVs and his area's top police officer for security. 
Quader smiled down from posters hung from trees, electrical wires, and plastered on walls, as loudspeakers perched atop rickshaws blared Hasina’s praises. 
His opponent Modud Ahmed, a former prime minister, said he had stayed in his home for most of this month out of fear of attacks. He said his supporters face assaults and threats from stick and gun-wielding Awami League student and youth wing activists. 
""We don't call them students,"" said Ahmed, Bangladesh's first postmaster-general. ""We call them Hasina's armed cadres. There is a reign of terror."" 
Quader declined to meet with Reuters despite repeated requests. 

Nizam Uddin, local leader of the Awami League’s student wing, rubbished Ahmed's allegations, saying instead that his own members had been attacked by BNP workers.

561,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Collapse in India's onion prices could leave Modi smarting in election,"By Rajendra Jadhav and Mayank Bhardwaj
HIVARGAON/MUJAHIDPUR, India (Reuters) - A spike in the price of onions has led to the ouster of governments in Indian elections in the past. Now, prices of the staple have collapsed, and many impoverished farmers are saying they will make Prime Minister Narendra Modi pay in next year's general election.
Steep drops in recent weeks in the prices of onions and potatoes, both staple foods for India's 1.3 billion people, have badly hit the rural economy in large states. 
In interviews with dozens of farmers last week, Reuters reporters found resentment welling against Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for not helping support incomes in the countryside, where a majority of the population lives.
""Whatever they do in the coming months, I will vote against the BJP. I won't repeat the 2014 mistake,"" said Madhukar Nagare, an onion grower from Nashik in Maharashtra state, referring to his backing the BJP at the last general election.
In the 1998 state elections, a sharp spike in onion prices led to the fall of the BJP government in the capital New Delhi.
In the 1980 general election, sky-high onion prices helped former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi dislodge a coalition government that had included politicians who later formed the BJP.
In recent weeks, loss-stricken farmers have staged protests, blocked highways and dumped onions on the road after prices plunged to as low as one rupee (1.4 U.S. cents) per kg for a crop that costs about 8 rupees a kg to produce. 
But because of large cuts taken by middlemen, consumers have not benefited from the low prices.
In Maharashtra, the top onion producing state, farm prices have fallen 83 percent, dragged down by surplus supplies from the previous season's crop and lower export orders from the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
And in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, which was crucial in Modi's election win in 2014, there is a similar problem with low potato prices. 
Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh are both dominated by rural voters and together send 128 lawmakers to the 545-member lower house of parliament. It means that big losses in these two states could either see Modi lose the next election which is due by May or his party be forced to form a coalition government. Farmers say shortcomings in a government crop support program, and weak overseas demand have combined to produce the current glut of onions. And as prices have plunged, fertilizer and crop nutrient costs have risen, thanks in part to a weak rupee.
Perhaps most important of all, the BJP came into office in 2014 determined to shift away from subsidies. That may have been fine when crop prices were relatively high but as they crashed it has exposed the party in farm areas.
The prime minister's office did not respond to a request for comment on this story.
NOT ""GOOD DAYS""
Many farmers blame Modi for not fixing a price protection program which barely covers 7 percent of India's 263 million farmers, leaving most growers at the mercy of middlemen.
They also criticize him for not setting up more food processing and cold storage facilities, which would allow them to store their crops without having to sell immediately after the harvest.
""Expecting good days, as promised by Modi, we voted for the BJP, but now we are going through the worst phase,"" onion farmer Madhav Pawase said, pointing to his rotting crop stocked in a temporary shed in Hivargaon village, about 230 km (140 miles) northeast of Mumbai, India's financial hub.
""I've spent more than 80,000 rupees to produce 15 tonnes of onions from my two acres of land, but I won't recover more than 3,000 rupees at the current market price,"" he said.
Some farmers have decided to let onions rot in the field, saying that harvesting and transporting the produce to wholesale markets would only add to their losses.
The BJP was defeated by the opposition Congress party in three major states in local elections this month because of rural anger, and Modi's government is under pressure to come up with measures to placate farmers.
Congress wrote off farmers' loans in the three states which it won and has demanded the federal government do the same across the country.
Although the BJP has so far not commented on the issue of farm loan waivers, Rajiv Kumar, the head of government think-tank NITI Aayog, has said that writing off debt is not the solution for the problems of the farm sector.
Syed Zafar Islam, a spokesman for the BJP, said the government had initiated a number of steps to help farmers get remunerative prices, including a project to electronically provide farmers with real-time market prices and help them directly sell to buyers, eliminating middlemen.
""It's an ongoing process and the results will not just start reflecting in four years,"" he said.
POTATO PRICES
In Mujahidpur village of Uttar Pradesh, India's biggest potato growing state, farmers lamented that prices have dropped by 86 percent to 2,500 rupees a tonne.
""I lost my entire investment of 100,000 rupees to grow potatoes on one hectare,"" said Gopi Chand, 55, sitting next to bright yellow mustard fields.
He said he and some other farmers in the area had dumped potatoes in favor of growing mustard.
Farmers in the two states also complained of rising operating costs.
Prices of crop nutrient diammonium phosphate, popularly called DAP, have gone up by 400 rupees to 1,450 rupees for a bag of 50 kg, said Babloo Singh in Mujahidpur village. DAP rates have gone up because of higher overseas prices and India's weaker currency. 
""Higher input costs and record low potato prices have left us in deep debt,"" said Singh. ""The situation would have been different had there been more cold storage facilities and food processing plants in our state.""
The crash in vegetable prices hasn't helped consumers either thanks to the chain of middlemen.

In Lasalgaon, the country's largest onion trading hub, most farmers are selling their produce at 2 rupees a kg. But consumers in Mumbai are still shelling out 20 rupees. Between Lasalgaon and Mumbai, a distance of 220 km (135 miles), traders say onions pass through at least four layers of middlemen, adding a hefty margin at every stage.

The reopening of the UAE's mission was a diplomatic boost for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as it and other U.S.-allied Arab states had once backed rebels fighting him. The embassy had been shut since the early months of Syria's conflict nearly eight years ago.
Other Gulf and Arab states are expected to shift their positions and normalize ties with Assad's government as concerns grow about Iran's influence in the region. Syria's membership of the Arab League was suspended seven years ago. 
""The Kingdom of Bahrain has announced that work is continuing at its embassy in the brotherly Arab Republic of Syria,"" a statement carried by the state news agency BNA said.
It was not clear whether that meant the embassy had continued operating throughout the war, when most Gulf Arab states -- including Saudi Arabia, with which Bahrain is closely aligned -- broke off diplomatic ties. 
The statement said it was important that Arab states work to prevent any regional interference in Syria's internal affairs, to help consolidate security and stability in the country.
BNA said flights had been operating between Bahrain and Syria without interruption, although again it did not say whether that had been the case throughout the war. 
Gulf Arab states were the main backers of armed groups opposed to Assad, but Saudi Arabia and Qatar had the most prominent roles in the Syrian war. Emirati support has been associated with groups opposed to Islamist domination of the uprising, rebel sources in the region have said.
Unlike its neighbors, Oman maintained diplomatic ties with Damascus while Kuwait opposed arming rebels fighting to topple Assad and has led a humanitarian fundraising campaign for Syria through the United Nations.
After nearly eight years of war, Assad has recovered control of most of Syria with support from Russia, Iran, and Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim groups such as Lebanon's Hezbollah.
His military advances gathered pace this year with the defeat of the last big rebel enclaves near Damascus and recovery of the southwestern region.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Campaigning for Bangladesh's general election ended on Friday after weeks of violence, mainly against workers and officials from an opposition alliance, that has drawn criticism from the United States and others.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League is seeking its third straight term in Sunday's election against the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which boycotted the last vote in 2014. 
(Graphic: Bangladesh general elections - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SnmoDo)
The Awami League is promoting its economic record over the past decade but a BNP-led opposition alliance, many of whose leaders have been jailed, has vowed to remove curbs on the media, increase wages and freeze energy prices.
""The government has lost moral support,"" BNP Secretary-General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told reporters on Thursday, urging voters to ""restore democracy"".
""But the people are with us. They want change,"" he said.
The BNP's preparations have been hamstrung by the February jailing of its chairwoman, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, on what the party called trumped-up corruption charges.
Leaders of the ruling Awami League deny any misuse of power and say they will return to government with an overwhelming majority.
Hasina told supporters on Thursday they must ""ensure victory of pro-liberation forces"", a reference to Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 led by her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects her party to win a third term.
The BNP said on Thursday more than 8,200 opposition leaders and activists from a coalition of about 20 parties had been arrested since the election schedule was announced early last month. 
Four workers were killed and more than 12,300 injured, it said.
The Awami League has in turn said the BNP and its partners were behind attacks that killed at least six of its workers over the past three weeks.
Police declined to confirm the figures.
Mahbub Talukdar, one of five election commissioners, has said there has not been a level playing field, although other commissioners have said they expected the election to be free and fair.
Earl Miller, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh, said all parties had been victims of violence, including women and minority candidates.
""However, it appears opposition party candidates have borne the brunt of most violence,"" he said in a statement after meeting Election Commission officials on Thursday. 
Miller said all candidates and voters must be able to take part without ""harassment, intimidation, or violence"" and that an independent media must be allowed to cover the election.
The Telecommunication Regulatory Commission ordered the shutdown of high-speed mobile internet services in a bid to curb the spread of ""confusing content"", spokesman Zakir Hussain Khan told Reuters.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter said last week they had removed accounts and fake news pages linked to the government that had posted anti-opposition content.

The United Nations has called for a ""peaceful, credible and inclusive poll"".

The crews searched for about 83 hours, covering 3,707 square miles, the U.S. Coast Guard said, adding it has been in touch with the family of the man. 
The search was suspended on Thursday afternoon. 
""Suspending a search is one of the most difficult decisions we have to make as first responders, and it is never made lightly,"" the Coast Guard said in a statement.
Arron Hough, 20, went overboard 267 miles (430 km) off the northwest of Puerto Rico on Tuesday, a Coast Guard spokesman said on Tuesday.

YALAMBOJOCH, Guatemala (Reuters) - Between heavy sobs, Catarina Alonzo explained that when her husband left Guatemala to try to reach the United States, they hoped taking their 8-year-old son would make it easier for the pair to get in. Instead, the boy fell ill and died.
Detained on the U.S. border, Felipe Gomez Alonzo died late on Christmas Eve in a New Mexico hospital a few weeks after setting off with his father, becoming the second Guatemalan child to die this month while in U.S. custody.
The two deaths have led to increased criticism of the Trump administration's hardline stance on illegal immigration, as well as fresh scrutiny of why some migrants from Central America travel with children on the long, dangerous road north.
Speaking at her home in a mountainous region of western Guatemala, Catarina Alonzo said neighbors had told the family that taking a child would provide her husband with a way in.
""Lots of them have gone with children and managed to cross, even if they're held for a month or two. But they always manage to get across easily,"" she told Reuters in an interview.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has yet to give an official cause of death for the boy, prompting Democratic lawmakers to intensify calls for an investigation.
The Department of Homeland Security, which says that Felipe Gomez Alonzo and 7-year-old Jakelin Caal, who died on Dec. 8, were the first children to die in CBP custody in a decade, this week said it would step up medical checks of migrant children to try to prevent any more deaths.
Alonzo, an indigenous Maya and native speaker of Chuj, has little Spanish and communicated through a translator. Wearing a sweatshirt and a purple dress, she spoke outside her hut in Yalambojoch, a village of about 1,000 people near the Mexican border.
She related how her son and his father, Agustin, an agricultural worker, had left in early December to find work in the United States to pay off debts. The two also hoped the boy would get a better education in the United States, she said.
Still, Alonzo said her husband had doubts and at one point decided he did not want to take the boy. But that upset the boy, so they resolved he should go.
Alonzo's sobs could be heard for minutes outside the house before she came out to be interviewed. Afterwards she went back inside to a tiny altar she had adorned with three photos of the boy that a local school teacher had printed out for her.
The altar stood to one side of a room with cement walls that serves as a bedroom and living area for Alonzo and her three surviving children. Adjoining it was a kitchen with a dirt floor and wooden walls.
Her husband remains in U.S. custody.
""NOW OR NEVER""
Marta Larra, a spokeswoman for Guatemala's Foreign Ministry, said smugglers known as ""coyotes"" often encourage migrants to take children as a form of ""visa."" Many coyotes, she noted, are trusted by migrant families, so their word carries weight.
But Lucas Perez, the mayor of Yalambojoch, said some coyotes are only interested in ripping off people. Still, for many migrants trying to cross the U.S. border, taking a child along was the ""only option,"" he told Reuters.
Describing migration from the area as ""constant,"" Perez estimated about 200 people from the tiny village live in the United States. 
Agustin Gomez, the boy's father, has two brothers in the United States he hoped to meet, his wife said.
Next to her hut, laborers worked on a two-story concrete house with a twin-gabled, tiled roof - evidence of the money coming back from the United States, the mayor said.
Under U.S. law, families from countries that do not border the United States cannot be immediately deported, and because of a longstanding legal settlement, there are restrictions on how long U.S. authorities can detain migrant children.
As a result, families with children are often released to await an immigration court hearing, which can be scheduled well into the future due to ballooning backlogs.
U.S. President Donald Trump has tried to reverse the policy, which he calls ""catch and release,"" but has been blocked by lawsuits in federal court.
His Democratic opponents have seized on the deaths of the two Guatemalan children to attack his policies. On Thursday, Senator Dianne Feinstein urged the Senate to hold a hearing in the new year on how children are treated in U.S. custody.
In the meantime, Trump's insistence on building a southern border wall has given coyotes a fresh argument to promote migration, Larra said.

""According to interviews (with migrants), the coyotes are saying 'it's now or never' because the wall is going to be built, and it won't be possible to cross,"" she said.

A new election is not due until 2022 but one could be called if May fails to get her primary policy through parliament.
Corbyn also urged May to recall parliament early during the new year to bring forward a critical vote on the Brexit deal. 
Late last week, Corbyn said he would push ahead with Brexit and seek to renegotiate the terms if he won a snap election next year.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A lingering financial scandal involving Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro's son has soured his inauguration next week and tarnished the reputation of a far-right maverick who surged to victory on a vow to end years of political horsetrading. 
Bolsonaro, who spent nearly 30 years in Congress, takes office on Jan. 1 after an electoral win that gave him a mandate to hobble violent drug gangs, cut through red tape to kick-start Brazil's economy and go after the corrupt political class. 
But a regulator's questions about a bank account of the former driver of his son, Rio de Janeiro state lawmaker and Senator-elect Flavio Bolsonaro, has clouded his big day, leading critics to doubt the president-elect's graft-busting credentials and his ability to deliver a new type of politics.
Jair Bolsonaro, Flavio Bolsonaro and the former driver, Fabricio Queiroz, have denied any wrongdoing.
""Ever since this case came to light, there has been a spectacle of evasions and unconvincing explanations on the part of the Bolsonaros ... (about) an episode with relevant implications for national politics,"" Brazil's biggest newspaper Folha de S.Paulo said in an editorial on Thursday.
The scandal arose after Brazil's Council for Financial Activities Control (COAF) identified 1.2 million reais ($305,033) that in 2016-17 flowed through the bank account of Queiroz, who for years was on Flavio Bolsonaro's payroll as a driver and adviser. Some payments were made to the president-elect's wife, Michelle Bolsonaro.
Rio state prosecutors said in a statement on Thursday that Queiroz's lawyers told them he was willing to cooperate with investigators, but also handed over documents from a doctor indicating that he had to undergo an urgent surgery. 
On Wednesday, Queiroz sought to explain himself in an interview with a Bolsonaro-friendly TV network.
After citing a health crisis as his reason for failing to attend two previous appointments with prosecutors to explain the provenance of the money, Queiroz said in the SBT network interview that money in his account was from a side-business of buying and selling cars. 
""I'm a businessman,"" he said. ""I make money.""
Queiroz's legal team did not clarify why he agreed to the TV interview instead of talking directly with prosecutors. The investigators also said they want to question Flavio Bolsonaro on Jan. 10.
Jair Bolsonaro has said the payment to his wife was Queiroz repaying a personal loan. He added that if he made a mistake by not declaring the money from Queiroz, he would rectify it with tax authorities.
Flavio Bolsonaro, who has now been called by investigators to explain the money after his former driver's no-show last week, has said that Queiroz gave him a ""plausible"" explanation, and that the accusations were intended to destabilize the Bolsonaro family.
In the interview, Queiroz said the money to Michelle Bolsonaro had been explained by her husband, and was to repay a loan. He denied he had been dodging investigators, and said he had failed to turn up to appointments with prosecutors because of a malignant cancer that requires immediate surgical removal.
Michelle Bolsonaro has not commented publicly on the case.
According to the COAF, some of the payments to Queiroz' bank account were made by other employees on Flavio Bolsonaro's payroll when he served as a Rio de Janeiro state lawmaker, including by Queiroz's own daughter. Many of the deposits were made on or around the same day that the state Congress paid employees, the COAF found.
It passed on the suspicious financial flows in Queiroz's account to Rio state prosecutors, who have so far failed to get the former driver to come in and explain the funds. 
Queiroz declined to explain why his colleagues were depositing money into his account, saying he would tell investigators. 
Not all were convinced by that line of argument.
""So this is how it works: He didn't go to investigators, because he preferred to go on TV. But, once he was on TV, he said he would rather explain to investigators?"" prominent journalist Malu Gaspar wrote on Twitter.

568,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 04:55PM ET</span>",Former Macron bodyguard in spotlight over consultancy work,"PARIS (Reuters) - A sacked security aide to French President Emmanuel Macron who was at the center of a scandal that shook the government this summer is under fresh scrutiny over the nature of his recent work as a consultant. 
The presidency confirmed on Thursday it had written to Alexandre Benalla in the last few days demanding more details of business trips to several African countries and telling him not to claim any links to the government. 
The Benalla scandal marked a turning point for Macron's presidency and popularity from which he has found it hard to recover as other problems have piled up, including a stream of anti-government marches and riots by ""yellow vest"" protesters. 
The affair erupted in July after a video surfaced of Benalla beating a May Day protester. Macron fired him, but was accused by political rivals of acting too slowly and being out of touch. 
Macron's cabinet chief, Patrick Strzoda, asked the former bodyguard to provide ""all relevant information"" about his consultancy work, according to extracts from a letter published in the newspaper Le Monde.
He also asked Benalla to adhere ""strictly to protocol on secrecy ... linked to your former responsibilities"".
The president's office confirmed the content of the letter.
Benalla made a trip to Chad several weeks before Macron visited on Dec. 22 and 23, raising questions over whether he still had links to the president. 
Benalla, who is subject to a judicial investigation, has been quoted in several French news sites in recent days saying he was ""shocked and scandalized"" by suggestions that he had acted inappropriately. 
""Today I'm a consultant. I've been to around 10 countries in Africa,"" he told Le Monde. ""I'm not going to stop doing what I'm doing.""
The news site Mediapart said Benalla was still traveling on a diplomatic passport received as part of his former job. 
The Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it had asked Benalla in July to hand in two diplomatic passports, and was considering further steps. 

Macron's approval ratings fell below 20 percent in early December, even as he responded to the protests with an array of measures including canning an unpopular fuel tax and raising the minimum wage.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>","Boston Marathon bomber appeals conviction, death sentence","By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Thursday asked an appellate court to overturn his conviction and death penalty sentence for helping carry out the 2013 attack, which killed three people and wounded more than 260 others.
Lawyers for Tsarnaev, 25, argued in a brief filed with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston that a lower-court judge's refusal to move the case to another city not traumatized by the bombings deprived him of a fair trial.
The attorneys acknowledged that their client, then 19, carried out the attack along with his now-deceased 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev.
But they argued that wall-to-wall media coverage of the bombings meant that nearly the entire jury pool was exposed to news about the attacks, which included ""heart-wrenching stories about the homicide victims, the wounded and their families.""
""The pre-trial publicity was damning: the more a prospective juror had seen, the more likely she was to believe that Tsarnaev was guilty and deserved the death penalty,"" Tsarnaev's lawyers wrote in a 500-page brief.
They said U.S. District Judge George O'Toole also ignored evidence that two jurors had commented on the case on social media before being picked and prevented the defense from telling jurors about Tsarnaev's brother's ties to a 2011 triple murder.
That evidence, they said, would have supported their sentencing-related argument that Tsarnaev was a junior partner in a scheme run by his older brother, ""an angry and violent man"" who had embraced radical Islam.
The appeal came after a federal jury in 2015 found Tsarnaev guilty of placing a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the world-renowned race on April 15, 2013, as well as fatally shooting a policeman three days later.
The same jury later found that Tsarnaev deserved execution for six of the 17 capital charges of which he was found guilty, which were related to the bomb he personally placed at the marathon's finish line.
That bomb killed 8-year-old Martin Richard, the youngest fatality, and 23-year-old Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu. The bombing was one of the highest-profile attacks on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001.
Tsarnaev's brother died after a gunfight with police four days after the bombing, which ended when Tsarnaev ran him over with a stolen car.

The manhunt for Tsarnaev ended when he was found hiding in a boat dry-docked in Watertown, Massachusetts.

The UAE said the move aimed to normalize ties and to curb risks of regional interference in ""Arab, Syrian affairs"" - an apparent reference to non-Arab Iran, whose support for Assad has been critical to his war effort.
""The UAE decision ... came after a conviction that the next stage requires the Arab presence and communication in the Syrian file,"" tweeted Anwar Gargash, the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs.
The reopening of the embassy is a step towards Syria's rehabilitation by its Arab peers. Its membership in the Arab League was suspended seven years ago. Gargash told Al Arabiya TV that its readmission would require Arab consensus.
The UAE flag was raised at the embassy, shut since the early months of Syria's conflict nearly eight years ago. The UAE Foreign Ministry said its charge d'affaires assumed his duties on Thursday.
Robert Ford, who was serving as the U.S. ambassador to Syria when the uprising against Assad erupted in 2011, said the UAE embassy re-opening indicated that the Sunni Muslim Gulf monarchy seeks to re-exert influence in Syria to blunt that of its Shiite-led foe, Iran.
“I think they are hoping that over time that by financial and diplomatic re-engagement with Damascus, they can reduce Iranian influence,” said Ford, now a fellow with the Middle East Institute think tank who also teaches at Yale University.
Ford noted that the UAE has a “vibrant private sector” that is far better resourced than Iran to participate in the massive reconstruction effort that Syria requires.
The UAE was one of several regional states to back armed groups opposed to Assad, though its role was less prominent than those of Saudi Arabia, Qatar or Turkey, rebel sources in the region have said. Emirati support has been associated with groups opposed to Islamist domination of the uprising.
Nearly eight years into the war, Assad has recovered control of most of Syria with support from Russia, Iran, and Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim groups such as Lebanon's Hezbollah.
His military advances gathered pace this year with the defeat of the last big rebel enclaves near Damascus and recovery of the southwestern region.
Earlier this month, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir became the first Arab head of state to visit Damascus since the start of the Syrian conflict, flying into Damascus airport.
The border crossing between Syria and Jordan, another U.S. ally that backed the rebels, was reopened in October. A Syrian passenger flight flew to Tunisia on Thursday for the first time in nearly eight years.
An Arab diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters last week he believed most Arab states wanted Syria to be readmitted to the Arab League, with only three or four states expected to oppose it.
Arms, training and funds from Arab states were funneled to Syrian rebels through a program overseen by the CIA until U.S. President Donald Trump ordered it shut down last year. In another potential lift for Assad, Trump also last week decided to withdraw U.S. forces deployed in northern and eastern Syria in support of Kurdish-led militia. 
The U.S State Department has not commented on the UAE's move. 
But Ford believes that Washington ""probably just acquiesced” as the Trump administration is ""more and more just washing its hands of Syria.”
The anti-Assad insurgents' last foothold is an arc of northwestern territory abutting Turkey, which still supports them.

Assad has vowed to recapture control of the entire country.

571,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 03:25PM ET</span>","Venezuela murder rate dips, partly due to migration: monitoring group","CARACAS (Reuters) - The murder rate in Venezuela, one of the world's highest-crime countries, dipped in 2018 as some criminals apparently joined millions of law-abiding compatriots in leaving the crisis-stricken country, a local crime monitoring group said in a report on Thursday. 
The South American country is in a fifth year of recession caused by a crash in oil prices and an unraveling socialist economic model. Three million Venezuelans have fled violence, hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods, most since 2015, according to the United Nations.
The Venezuelan Observatory of Violence (OVV) said in its annual report that Venezuela still had the world's highest murder rate, 81.4 per 100,000 inhabitants, but it noted that figure was down from 89 in 2017 and 92 the year before. Director Roberto Briceño attributed the drop in part to migration.
""The majority of the Venezuelans who emigrate are honest people who have been forced to look for work elsewhere, but many criminals are among them,"" he told reporters, citing press reports on crimes in other South American countries. 
Briceño added that some prominent local gangs appeared to no longer be active in Venezuela, while crimes elsewhere in the region have been attributed to those same groups. 
The total number of homicides fell to 23,047 from 26,616 the in 2017, said the OVV, whose researchers have access to police data. 
Venezuela's government has accused non-governmental organizations of inflating crime statistics to create paranoia and undermine President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government. Even the most recent official national murder rate - 58 per 100,000 for 2015 - was among the world's highest. 
World Bank data from 2016 put Venezuela's murder rate at 56 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016, third in the world behind El Salvador and Honduras.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the OVV's report.
The number of robberies of farmers and food distribution trucks increased in 2018, according to the report, a sign of growing desperation and hunger as inflation topped 1 million percent. In January, a video circulated on social media showing a hungry mob slaughtering cattle grazing in western Venezuela.
""They rob corn, coffee, sugar, cocoa and even onions,"" Briceño said.

The airport, which officials say will be one of the world's busiest, was declared open in October by President Tayyip Erdogan but only a handful of flights have been operating from the new site since then. 
Its full operation was first delayed to January, in a setback for the government which has hailed it as a centerpiece of the construction boom that has driven strong economic growth under Erdogan’s 15-year rule.
Citing a letter sent by airport authorities, Milliyet said the date had been pushed back again until early March.
The airport will be able to handle 90 million passengers a year, and can be expanded to accommodate as many as 200 million, Erdogan said at the opening ceremony. 

Videos posted on social media since then have shown rain leaking heavily into a waterlogged passenger terminal, and a flooded car park at the new airport.

The two governments have sparred over the fate of two Canadian citizens detained in China on suspicion of endangering state security, and of Canada's arrest of a high-ranking Chinese executive at the request of the United States.
The high court in the northeastern province of Liaoning said on Wednesday a man it identified as Robert Lloyd Schellenberg would be tried on drugs smuggling charges in Dalian city on Saturday.
A Dalian government news portal said late on Wednesday Schellenberg was a Canadian and that this was an appeal hearing after he was found by an earlier ruling to have smuggled ""an enormous amount of drugs"" into China.
""Global Affairs Canada has been following this case for several years and has been providing consular assistance to the Canadian citizen"" since the person was first detained in Liaoning, Richard Walker, a spokesman for Canada's foreign ministry, known as Global Affairs, said on Thursday.
Citing privacy concerns, Walker said no further information was available.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she did not have a grasp on the situation, but added that China had repeatedly made its ""solemn"" stance clear to Canada.
Drugs offences are routinely punished severely in China.
China executed a Briton caught smuggling heroin in 2009, prompting a British outcry over what it said was the lack of any mental health assessment.
Canada has pressed for the release of the two Canadians who China detained this month.
The two were detained after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Dec. 1. Neither country has drawn a direct connection between the cases.
China has demanded Canada free Meng, who is fighting extradition to the United States.
Canada arrested Meng at the request of the United States, which is engaged in a trade war with China. Meng faces extradition to the United States to face fraud charges that carry a maximum sentence of 30 years jail for each charge.

RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's king put a veteran former finance minister in charge of foreign affairs on Thursday, aiming to improve the kingdom's image after the crisis caused by the killing of a journalist and greater scrutiny of the Yemen war.
The Saudi government has come under intense international criticism over the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.
It has also faced growing scepticism over its intervention in Yemen, where the United Nations says millions of people could starve to death because of supply lines disrupted by a Saudi-led war against the Houthi movement which controls the capital.
The events have gravely harmed the reputation of King Salman's son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed, 33, who is poised to succeed his father in the kingdom's first generational transfer of power for more than 65 years. 
In a cabinet reshuffle, Ibrahim al-Assaf, who served as finance minister for 20 years and has represented Saudi Arabia at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, was named to take over as foreign minister from Adel al-Jubeir.
Experts in Saudi politics said the move reflected a perception that Jubeir, a veteran diplomat, was tainted by having served as Riyadh's chief global defender during the Khashoggi affair.
""(Assaf) will basically follow orders, but is seen as key to rebuilding the kingdom's tarnished image given his own positive international image,"" said Neil Quilliam, a senior research fellow at Britain's Chatham House think tank. ""So this rings in the new for the new year, but no real change.""
Assaf was among scores of senior businessmen, officials and princes who was detained at a luxury hotel during an anti-corruption crackdown launched by the crown prince last year, although he was swiftly exonerated and released.
""TAINTED GOVERNMENT""
A Saudi official said the reshuffle came at the end of the cabinet's four-year term, as required by law.
In other changes, King Salman appointed Prince Abdullah bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz to replace Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf as chief of the National Guard. General Kalid bin Qirar al-Harbi was named general security chief, while Musaed al-Aiban, a Harvard-educated son of Saudi Arabia's first intelligence chief, was named national security adviser.
Turki al-Sheikh, a close adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed, was moved from his position as head of the sports committee to head up an entertainment commission.
""The reappointment of sports czar Turki al-Sheikh as head of the entertainment authority as well as changes in the national economy and security councils are an effort to put a polish on a tainted government,"" said James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. 
""None of this however calls into question the position of the crown prince. On the contrary, it reinforces it.""
Turki al-Shabana, an executive at broadcaster Rotana, was appointed minister of information. Rotana is owned by billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who was also detained at the Ritz last year and later released.

King Salman also ordered the creation of a Saudi Space Agency, chaired by his 62-year-old son Prince Sultan bin Salman, who heads the Saudi tourism agency and flew aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery in the 1980s as the first Arab in space.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Security forces in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo fired live rounds and tear gas on Thursday to scatter demonstrators who burned tyres and ransacked an Ebola center in protest at their exclusion from the presidential election.
The electoral commission (CENI) announced on Wednesday that it was cancelling voting in Sunday's election in the opposition strongholds of Beni, Butembo and their surrounding areas due to an ongoing Ebola outbreak and militia violence.
In another sign of the government's hardening stance in the run-up to the vote, the foreign ministry announced the expulsion of EU ambassador Bart Ouvry after the European Union renewed sanctions against officials including the ruling coalition's presidential candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary.
The EU Commission was not immediately available on Thursday evening to comment on the expulsion.
Sunday's vote is meant to pick a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who has ruled since 2001. If successful, it would mark Congo's first democratic transition after decades marked by authoritarian rule, coups and civil war. 
Politicians in Beni denounced the CENI's decision as an attempt to boost Shadary and they called for protests. 
""There was a group of demonstrators who wanted to enter the CENI office ... to demand the cancellation of the decision,"" said Giscard Yere, a Beni resident. ""But the police officers and soldiers who were there fired to disperse the demonstrators.""
Protesters ransacked an Ebola isolation center in Beni, causing 24 patients to flee, health ministry spokeswoman Jessica Ilunga said.
Demonstrators also attacked the office of the government agency coordinating the response to the Ebola virus in Beni, said Aruna Abedi, the deputy director of the Ebola response.
""Protesters tried to force the door of the center,"" Abedi told Reuters. ""They were chanting songs hostile to the government and demanding elections. They threw projectiles."" 
Colonel Safari Kazingufu, the police commander in Beni, said three policemen were wounded while trying to restore order, including around the Ebola centers. Seventeen protesters were detained in connection with the attack on the center, he said. 
EBOLA OUTBREAK
Beni, Butembo and their rural surroundings have been battling an Ebola outbreak - now the second-deadliest in history - since August. It is believed to have killed more than 350 people so far. 
But health authorities had repeatedly said the outbreak would not prevent the vote from going ahead, and locals say it is being used as a pretext to disenfranchise them.
Returning to eastern Congo on Thursday to a hero's welcome after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, Denis Mukwege, a vocal critic of the government, told a cheering crowd: ""The emergency now is to save the electoral process which is deadlocked. The CENI and authorities of our country must fulfill their responsibilities.""
The CENI has also canceled the vote in the western city of Yumbi because of ethnic violence there last week that killed more than 100 people.
The opposition coalition behind presidential candidate Martin Fayulu has called for a nationwide general strike on Friday to protest over the cities' exclusion from the vote.
""It's too much, the CENI has crossed a red line,"" Fayulu campaign director Pierre Lumbi told journalists, calling on the CENI to cancel the decision.
The campaign of another popular opposition candidate, Felix Tshisekedi, also denounced the CENI's decision but stopped short of calling for it to be revoked.
The election to replace Kabila was meant to take place in 2016 but has been repeatedly delayed. 

This has triggered violent protests in which security forces killed dozens of people. It has also stoked militia violence in Congo's eastern borderlands with Rwanda and Uganda as armed groups moved to exploit a perceived power vacuum.

Details about Benny Gantz's Israel Resilience Party, leaked to local media after it was registered, gave little indication of its ideological tilt. 
Along with preserving Israel as ""a Jewish and democratic country"", the party pledged unspecified changes to priorities in national security and the economy.
Polling has predicted an easy win for Netanyahu in the April 9 election, with his rightist Likud party taking around 30 of parliament's 120 seats and on course to form a right-wing coalition government similar to the current cabinet.
The surveys, published after Netanyahu announced on Monday an election some seven months before one was due by law, gave second place to a then-hypothetical Gantz party. The polls forecast it would take around 15 seats.
Netanyahu is running for a fifth term under the shadow of three corruption investigations in which police have recommended his indictment. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Israel's attorney-general has still to decide whether to charge Netanyahu and it is unclear whether he will make his announcement before the election.
Should Gantz emerge as a center-left candidate, that could work in Netanyahu's favor by further fracturing an already disparate opposition bloc.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Alarmed by a U.S. decision to leave Syria, Kurdish leaders who run much of the north are urging Russia and its ally Damascus to send forces to shield the border from the threat of a Turkish offensive.
Their call for a return of Syrian government forces to the border, which Kurdish fighters have held for years, points to the depth of their crisis in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw forces.
While little has changed on the ground yet - U.S. forces are still deployed and Trump says the pullout will be slow - Kurdish officials are scrambling for a strategy to protect their region from Turkey before the United States leaves.
Talks with Damascus and Moscow appear to be the focus for the Kurdish leadership. Their worst fear is a repeat of a Turkish attack that drove Kurdish residents and the YPG militia out of Afrin city in the northwest earlier this year.
They are also trying to convince other Western countries to fill the vacuum when Washington withdraws some 2,000 troops whose presence in northern and eastern Syria has deterred Turkey so far.
The territory at stake spans about a quarter of Syria, most of it east of the Euphrates River, controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an umbrella group dominated by the Kurdish YPG. The area borders Iraq to the east and includes three major cities - Qamishli, Hasaka and Raqqa.
(Syria areas of control: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RgCxxb) 
The SDF has been Washington's main Syrian partner in the fight with Islamic State, but Turkey views the YPG fighters that form its backbone as a threat and has vowed to crush them.
Officials from northern Syria, who went to Moscow last week, will soon make another trip, hoping Russia will push Damascus to ""fulfill its sovereign duty"", top Kurdish politician Aldar Xelil told Reuters.
""Our contacts with Russia, and the regime, are to look for clear mechanisms to protect the northern border,"" said Xelil, an architect of autonomy plans in northern Syria. ""We want Russia to play an important role to achieve stability.""
ISLAMIC STATE THREAT
President Bashar al-Assad, already in command of most of Syria with help from Iranian and Russian allies, has vowed to recover the SDF territory. The region, rich in oil, water and farmland, is seen as important to Syria's reconstruction. 
Although the autonomy they seek is at odds with Damascus, Kurdish forces have largely avoided direct conflict with the government during the war, at times even fighting common foes. They held political talks this summer that went nowhere.
But with their negotiating position severely weakened by Trump's move, Kurdish authorities may be in a race against time to cut a deal as Turkey threatens to launch its offensive east of the Euphrates River.
Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK movement which has been waging a 34-year-long insurgency in southeastern Turkey. Ankara has drawn on Syrian rebel proxies to help fight the YPG in the north.
Fearing the U.S. announcement could open the way to the Turkish attack, the SDF has been warning of the threat Islamic State still poses. It has cautioned European states that foreign Islamic State jihadists in its prisons could escape and return to mount attacks at home.
""To repel a Turkish attack, we are discussing various options ... We have made contact with Russia, France and European Union countries to help,"" said Badran Jia Kurd, a senior Kurdish official who went to Moscow last week for talks with Russian foreign ministry officials. 
""It is the responsibility of the Syrian government to protect the borders of this region and this is under discussion,"" he told Reuters.
POLITICAL SETTLEMENT
In Turkey's last assault in Afrin earlier this year, the SDF felt let down by Russia, believing it had given assurances that Turkey would not attack the region.
Turkey-backed Syrian rebels say they have been mobilizing to launch the next offensive, with their first target the town of Manbij that borders the territory under their control.
U.S. forces are still patrolling near Manbij and nothing has changed so far, said Sharfan Darwish, spokesman for the SDF-allied Manbij Military Council that holds the town. But in coordination with the council, the government and Russia sent forces near the town on Tuesday, he said.
Top Syrian Kurdish politician Ilham Ahmed, who held talks with Damascus earlier this year, said contacts with the state had never stopped. 

""We are now in the phase of launching a new initiative,"" she told a tribal meeting in Raqqa on Wednesday. ""We will try by all means to put pressure on this regime to carry out a political settlement so that we preserve the dignity of Syrian citizens.""

Israel's Higher Planning Committee approved 2,191 new housing units in Israeli settlements on Dec. 25 and 26, though no building permits have been issued yet. 
""France condemns this decision, which expands settlement activity in the West Bank,"" the French foreign office said in a statement.
The settlements undermined the conditions for a two-state solution, ""the only way to ensure a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and heightens tensions"" it said, calling on the Israeli authorities to reconsider the decisions.
Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War that are also home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians. 
Settlements are one of the thorniest issues in efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, frozen since 2014.
Most countries consider all settlements that Israel has built in captured territory to be illegal. Israel disputes this and says their future should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians.
While Israel's settlement projects have regularly drawn condemnation from the Palestinians and in Europe, the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump has taken a largely uncritical public stand.

581,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 10:05AM ET</span>",German army floats plan to recruit foreigners,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Struggling to fill its ranks, Germany's military is drawing up plans to recruit nationals from other European countries as part of a drive to beef up the armed forces.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen wants to recruit Poles, Italians and Romanians, magazine Der Spiegel said, citing a ministry document.
The German military, or Bundeswehr, has stepped up its recruitment efforts as part of a broader reset following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Last year, Germany said it would increase the size of its armed forces to 198,000 active soldiers by 2024 from 179,000.
Pressure on Berlin mounted again in July when U.S. President Donald Trump told a NATO summit that Washington could withdraw support for the alliance if Europe did not boost military spending.
According to the classified ministry document, some 255,000 Poles, 185,000 Italians and 155,000 Romanians, aged between 18 and 40, live in Germany - about half all foreign EU nationals. If 10 percent of them could be interested in the Bundeswehr, that could generate 50,000 new applicants, it said.
It did not say if they would serve alongside Germans in regular regiments, or would form their on units akin to the French Foreign Legion. 
There was no comment available from the ministry when it was contacted by Reuters.
The Defence Ministry wants to limit the group of potential recruits to those who have already lived in Germany for several years and speak fluent German, Der Spiegel said.
Such limits would aim to minimize concern among other European Union countries about Germany luring their potential soldiers by offering better pay.
The ministry had sounded out defense attaches in other EU countries about the plan in recent months with ""very different results"", Der Spiegel said, with Eastern European countries particularly worried about the impact on their own recruitment.
Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz told the magazine that military service was ""closely tied to nationality"".

To help attract new recruits, the Bundeswehr is also targeting youngsters in Germany, where the army remains a sensitive career choice more than 70 years after World War Two.

The High Constitutional Court has nine days from Thursday to decide whether to confirm the provisional results. Rajoelina's rival Marc Ravalomanana on Sunday alleged fraud.
Rajoelina won 55.66 percent of the vote compared to 44.34 percent for Ravalomanana and turnout was just over 48 percent, the commission said. 
The two ex-presidents — Ravalomanana and the man who ousted him in a 2009 coup, Rajoelina — had previously said they would accept the results, raising hopes of a peaceful outcome and no repeat of the political chaos seen nearly a decade ago.
Rajoelina attended the commission's results announcement on Thursday. Ravalomanana did not.

FORT BRAGG, North Carolina (Reuters) - One set of photographs, posted on Instagram, captures a grand, crimson-colored banquet hall at a 100-acre Irish estate with two 18th Century mansions. The owner has redecorated the residence in gilded mirrors and blue damask wallpaper with the help of a renowned interior designer and is having a personal golf course installed on the verdant grounds.
Another set of pictures, taken by tenants, shows homes across the Atlantic in North Carolina, Maryland and Louisiana, plagued by flooding, bursting pipes, mold blooms, collapsed ceilings, exposed lead paint and tap water as brown as tea.
The same man is behind all these dwellings.
Ireland's historic Capard House is among the vacation properties owned by Rhode Island real estate developer John Picerne. He purchased the estate in 2015 after emerging as one of the largest private landlords on U.S. military bases. The others are the homes of his warrior-tenants, who pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year in rent to live in housing run by Corvias Group, Picerne's closely held company.
Since 2002, Corvias has acquired control of more than 26,000 houses and apartments across 13 military bases. Picerne's company runs this lucrative enterprise in partnership with the Army and Air Force through a program that enlists private-sector operators to build new dwellings, upgrade others, and manage the properties for 50 years.
The Corvias homes are among 206,000 now under private management in the 22-year-old U.S. Military Housing Privatization Initiative, the largest-ever corporate takeover of federal housing. The military says the effort has enhanced the lives of service members and their families.
Some of Corvias' tenants strongly disagree. They accuse Picerne's company of renting them poorly maintained homes riddled with health hazards that can trigger illness or childhood developmental delays.
Reporters visited three of the largest bases where Corvias operates and interviewed 30 current or recent residents who documented their battles with the landlord. At Fort Bragg, the largest military base in the United States, a tenant petition https://www.change.org/p/fort-bragg-hold-corvias-accountable to ""hold Corvias accountable"" for neglecting homes has gained more than 2,000 signatures.
John Picerne declined to comment for this story. His company declined to address questions about its earnings or specific tenant complaints at its Army bases.
""While there are always several sides to a story, out of respect for our residents we will not comment on or communicate with our residents through Reuters,"" William Culton Jr., the company's general counsel, wrote in an email.
After Reuters detailed the findings of this article to the Army and Corvias, the company set up a phone hotline for tenants with complaints and pledged to respond within 24 hours. Kelly Douglas, a Corvias spokeswoman, said the company is launching a ""comprehensive review"" of its service request and resolution process.
""If there's an area where we can improve or an unmet resident need, we want to make it better,"" Douglas said.
CONFIDENTIAL FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Nearly a third of U.S. military families, some 700,000 people, live in rented accommodation on bases. Their living conditions have come into the spotlight since Reuters revealed lead poisoning risks https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-military-housing in Army homes, mold and vermin infestations https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-military-contractors in Navy and Marine Corps housing, and sparse protections for tenants. Those reports have prompted Congress and the Department of Defense to order at least three investigations https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-gao/congress-watchdog-begins-inquiry-into-housing-hazards-at-u-s-military-bases-idUSKCN1NJ2W4 and to take measures https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-cleanup-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-army-forms-plan-to-test-40000-homes-for-lead-following-reuters-report-idUSKCN1LC1ZH to repair https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-benning/u-s-army-mobilizes-against-lead-hazards-at-bases-around-globe-idUSKCN1LT1NI unsafe conditions.
Despite that new scrutiny, the finances of privatized military housing have remained hidden. The Pentagon has never disclosed the precise terms offered to developers and property managers such as Picerne, deeming them confidential business transactions.
Reuters has now learned how the arrangements work for one leading private developer, obtaining thousands of pages of proprietary documents that lay out the fees and responsibilities that Picerne's business negotiated with the Army. These documents show that the landlord received iron-clad assurances of profit, often while putting up little initial cash of his own.
To grow his business, the scion of a wealthy Rhode Island real estate family has cultivated ties with military brass and politicians. Corvias has spent millions on lobbying, and Picerne has enlisted the help of his state's powerful Democratic senator, Jack Reed, an Army veteran and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
The profits have helped afford Picerne, 56, a yacht, private jet travel, and mansions renovated by celebrity decorator Martyn Lawrence Bullard, known for his work with the Kardashian family and fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.
Reporters reviewed the confidential framework agreements between Corvias and the U.S. Army for six of the 13 military bases where the company operates. These agreements – hundreds of pages each, known as Community Development and Management Plans – laid out Corvias' plans, responsibilities and projected earnings at bases.
From those six Army housing partnerships alone, Picerne's business stood to collect more than $254 million in fees for construction, development and management of the homes during the first decade of the deals, a Reuters analysis of the terms showed. Over the projects' 50-year duration, the fees were projected to top $1 billion. Nearly all of those fees are pure profit for Corvias, according to people familiar with the deals, because most of the projects' expenses are covered by rent income from soldiers.
Corvias also stands to earn hundreds of millions more in equity returns, the agreements show: It can share with the Army any cash left over from rental revenues after the projects' expenses have been covered. And Corvias gets additional fees from thousands of other homes it operates on six Air Force bases and one other Army post. Reuters was unable to review the operating agreements needed to analyze the profitability of those contracts.
The company has been able to enjoy these returns without taking on much risk. The government put hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of existing homes into the ventures. In all but one of the six Army projects Reuters reviewed, Corvias didn't have to invest a penny in equity until around a decade later, and the company kicked in less than a fifth of the money the military contributed. The Corvias contributions correspond to about 3 percent of the projects' planned development costs, which were largely funded by loans.
Corvias is shielded from risk in another way: It isn't obligated to repay nearly $1.9 billion in bank loans its military housing projects have received. The loans – like the salaries of most Corvias workers on bases – are paid off from the housing rental stipends soldiers and airmen receive from the federal government.
The Army declined to comment on Corvias, the projects' finances or specific tenant complaints. ""The Army is committed to providing safe and secure housing for our soldiers and their families,"" spokeswoman Colonel Kathleen Turner said in a statement. ""We work daily with the privatized housing companies to ensure that residents' concerns regarding their housing are addressed.""
Corvias said it is committed to quality housing for the troops. ""Our core mission at Corvias is clear: put service members and their families first,"" wrote spokeswoman Douglas. ""That means providing a safe, comfortable home to those in the military who choose our housing.""
'NIRVANA' AT FORT MEADE
Maryland's Fort George G. Meade, home to the secretive National Security Agency, is where Picerne laid the cornerstone of his military housing empire.
Like most of the Army's family housing, the nearly 2,900 homes at Meade had fallen into disrepair under decades of government management. In official project documents from 2002, Corvias promised Meade families a better future. It would replace ""obsolescent housing and catch-as-catch-can maintenance"" with ""a nirvana of planned Neighborhoods."" During a 10-year development phase, from 2002 to 2011, Corvias pledged to demolish all but a few hundred of the existing Meade homes and build 2,799 new ones.
Only 856 new homes were built, a nearly 70 percent reduction, Department of Defense figures show. The Army signed off on the skinnied-down target after the developer said construction costs had surged, revised plans from 2006 show.
The Corvias website features gleaming new homes at Meade and promises military families ""upscale residential communities, all while saving you money.""
Some units fail to meet these promises. During an October visit to Meade, reporters saw some areas of handsome new and historic homes, but also others filled with eyesores and safety hazards.
Reuters interviewed eight Meade families and reviewed photos and documents from several others. Among the problems in the homes were a ceiling that collapsed onto a child's bed, roofs riddled with leaks, peeling lead paint, a wasp infestation, mold blooms, waterlogged drywall and a kitchen gas leak.
By the time she left a $2,500-a-month rental home at Fort Meade this year, Emily Swinarski was chronically ill, medical records show. A physician documented her shortness of breath, chest pain and mold allergies and blamed conditions in the home, built in 1959. When Corvias tested the air quality indoors, according to a copy of the results, it showed mold counts up to 350-fold the levels found outside.
Corvias found a partly rotted wooden roof was the likely source of the fungus, Swinarski said, but told her it wasn't willing to conduct the extensive repairs needed to rid the home of mold.
Following her doctor's written order to ""remove herself"" from the home, she and her Air Force major husband moved off post, throwing out nearly $5,000 in personal belongings – a tainted new bed, a sofa and a closet-full of reeking clothes.
""We chose to just bite the bullet,"" she said.
Corvias' development plan for Fort Meade said residents would be on a ""first name basis"" with maintenance personnel. Last year, citing tight budgets, Corvias reduced housing staff and shuttered at least one of its five neighborhood community centers at Meade. Residents say they are now referred to a call center to submit work requests.
Maintenance crews are pressured to quickly close residents' work orders, a Corvias employee told one Meade family in October. The family made an audio recording of the conversation with the employee. Some staff, the worker is heard saying, refer to Meade as ""Section 8 behind the gate"" – a barbed reference to the U.S. federal system of housing projects for the poor. Corvias declined to comment.
In a Meade neighborhood where Picerne's business pledged to build stylish new housing for officers, debris-strewn concrete foundation pads lie between two schools. An abandoned playground is overgrown with weeds.
The reason: The Army signed off on ""re-scoping"" the Meade project in 2006, scaling back the improvement plans after Corvias cited lower-than-expected occupancy rates, rising construction costs and costly renovation of historic homes. To save costs, the original plans had already deferred building a $1.2 million bridge over a busy thoroughfare – viewed as necessary for children's safety, planning documents say. Children use a crosswalk instead.
Corvias and the Army didn't address questions about conditions at Meade or the re-scoping of the housing ventures.
DESIGNER TOUCH
At his own homes, Picerne has employed British designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard, a star of the cable TV show Million Dollar Decorators.
In Picerne's six-bedroom neo-Georgian brick house in Providence, the designer installed black-and-white marble floors. Bullard told Australia's Belle Magazine the floor design was inspired by Rome's Pantheon. The home features chrome and jade accents, a Murano-glass chandelier and a faux-zebra rug.
Bullard also redecorated a $6 million Rhode Island beach home across Narragansett Bay from Newport, where Picerne docks his 49-foot Italian-made yacht, the Under My Skin. In the living room, the designer hung a gilded chandelier, sheathed the walls in black seagrass and added chairs clad in turquoise-hued leather. ""I took my inspiration from the Victorians,"" he told another magazine. On Instagram, John Picerne lauded Bullard's ""genius design.""
Bullard recounted in an essay that he installed an exotic work of taxidermy for Picerne in a Palm Beach villa: an alligator locked in battle with a snake, mounted on a 20-foot vaulted ceiling. He called the family ""wonderfully adventurous and highly discerning collectors.""
In Ireland, the designer spent months procuring finishes such as petrol-blue damask silk wallpaper and a mix of Regency and William IV antique furniture for the drawing room of Picerne's Capard House. In September, Bullard posted a photo of the banquet hall. The long dining table was set with white linen, white roses, crystal goblets and formal place cards for 33 guests. Bullard tagged the photo '#Mytablesbiggerthanyours.'
Through his agent, Bullard declined to be interviewed, citing his confidentiality agreement with Picerne.
Corvias said it was unfair to draw attention to Picerne's homes. ""In too many instances, Reuters veers from reporting to tabloid-style inference,"" wrote Culton, the general counsel. ""Reuters' use of personal information about someone's private residence is more of a stunt than actual reporting.""
He added, ""We welcome the opportunity to focus on the real issues – like how our nation can provide the best possible home for those who serve in uniform.""
LOW RISK, HIGH REWARD
Picerne once told a Rhode Island TV station that his military housing business is ""recession-resistant."" As civilian real estate markets sputtered a decade ago amid the U.S. financial crisis, the rental revenue streams on military bases kept flowing steadily. Defense Department rent stipends to families are transferred automatically to base landlords.
The Picerne family has been in real estate for nearly a century, building a national portfolio. By the early 2000s, John Picerne struck out on his own. Known in the industry for his intelligence and deft marketing, he turned Corvias into one of the largest private operators of U.S. military homes.
Many of the dozen-plus other real estate firms with military housing contracts partner together on projects, sharing income. Picerne's firm takes on all aspects of development, construction and management, avoiding the need to split fees.
In five of the six projects reviewed for this article, Corvias wasn't required to invest any cash at first. At Fort Polk in Louisiana, for instance, Corvias stood to collect $43 million in fees before having to stump up its share of equity cash, $6 million, and then only 10 years into the venture.
Picerne has also been able to take out cash he hasn't earned yet. In late 2013, according to Corvias financial statements prepared in 2015, Corvias obtained a $127 million loan from an affiliate of investment bank Guggenheim Partners. As collateral, Corvias pledged future fees from military housing.
Corvias, Guggenheim and the Army declined to comment.
GETTING AIRBORNE
Picerne's rise into the first rank of Army landlords followed a pivotal trip he made to North Carolina's Fort Bragg 17 years ago.
Bragg was the crown jewel of the Army's housing privatization program. The country's most populous military base, it includes nearly 6,500 family homes.
Picerne set out to pitch his services to Army brass. He chartered a private jet to visit Bragg in August 2001, and brought along a distinguished guest, Democratic Senator Jack Reed. A family acquaintance and fellow Rhode Islander, Reed sat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which oversees military spending. He is now the committee's ranking member.
Reed was once a Bragg resident himself, as an officer in the base's famed 82nd Airborne Division, before entering politics. A spokesman for the senator, Chip Unruh, confirmed that Reed made the trip. Reed flew to Bragg with Picerne because the senator ""wanted him to understand the importance of serving soldiers and see firsthand what they do, the challenges they face, the sacrifices they make, and the importance of taking good care of them,"" Unruh said.
""Senator Reed respects John Picerne and his work on behalf of military families,"" Unruh said. ""There is no stronger advocate for military families than Senator Reed.""
Reed reimbursed Picerne for the cost of the flight, Corvias said.
At Bragg, Picerne wooed General Dan K. McNeill, at the time one of the base's commanding generals.
One night, the two sat in the back of an Army vehicle on a live-fire shooting range during a field exercise, recalled McNeill, a retired four-star general. McNeill says he was doubtful a private developer could manage the housing better than the military. Picerne's earnest manner and business expertise won him over.
""I was quite the cynic about it, but I basically realized I didn't know what the hell I was talking about"" when it came to managing homes, recalled the general, who retired a decade ago. ""I was fairly certain he knew what he was doing and his intentions were good.""
When McNeill asked what was in it for Picerne, the general recalled, the businessman was frank. Automatic, first-of-the-month rent payments for soldiers by the military would eliminate a landlord's biggest headache: deadbeat tenants.
Over the years, Picerne's businesses have spent $2.8 million on lobbying – mostly of Congress and the Defense Department on issues related to military housing or Corvias contracts. Picerne has given at least another $500,000 in political contributions, mostly to Democratic politicians or committees, including about $10,000 to Reed.
Picerne has been a generous donor to charitable causes. Corvias said its foundation has awarded more than $13 million in scholarships to more than 400 military children and spouses. The foundation, which also supports other charities, from the YMCA to adopt-a-highway programs, was honored in a 2012 White House ceremony.
BIG CONTRACT, MOUNTING PROBLEMS
Corvias won the Bragg contract and took over housing there in 2003.
The company built most of the new homes it pledged to construct at Bragg. Fifteen years into the venture, however, a growing number of tenants are up in arms.
In October, Army Specialist Rachael Kilpatrick started an online petition decrying Corvias' home maintenance. A doctor attributed her husband's worsening health problems to mold in their home, medical documents show.
Corvias, she says, didn't fix the problems despite months of requests, and complained to her commander about her maintenance demands. The petition seeks to ""Hold Corvias accountable"" for serious maintenance lapses in homes base-wide. She hoped it would draw 50 signatures. So far more than 2,000 have signed.
Jennifer Wade says her problems began the day she moved to Fort Bragg in March 2017. Wade, a piano teacher with a soft southern drawl, has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The genetic condition afflicts her body's soft tissue, causing chronic pain. She has needed several major surgeries, spending long periods in a wheelchair.
Corvias had promised Wade a home equipped for her wheelchair, but there was no ramp or bathroom handrails when she moved in, leaving her dependent on her husband, an Army sergeant. ""It was pretty degrading,"" Wade said.
It took Corvias four months to install the fixtures, she said. Wade's husband and two small children soon developed breathing problems, which their doctors attributed to mold. The doctors submitted three reports to Corvias, recommending it clean the air ducts and replace the carpet. Corvias let months go by before cleaning the ducts and declined to replace the carpet, according to notes a maintenance employee marked on Wade's work request.
Wade's husband now requires inhalers and wears a breathing device to assist him when he sleeps, his medical records show. He no longer meets Army fitness requirements, and is in the process of obtaining a medical discharge. Last month, an Army board recommended him for disability, citing his recent asthma, Army records reviewed by Reuters show.
Corvias and the Army declined to comment about the petition and other tenant complaints.
At Louisiana's Fort Polk, Corvias took over operations in 2004. It inherited poor housing stock but pledged to transform the base into ""state-of-the-art Neighborhoods of Excellence.""
Picerne's firm committed to building 1,123 new homes within 11 years. Only 678 have been built, Corvias figures show. Many others were renovated.
Today, some Polk areas feature new housing. Others have worn 1970s and 1980s units. One neighborhood contains fenced-off housing foundations that have sat idle for years. A reporter entered several Polk homes, invited in by tenants, and observed mold growths, rodent-gnawed furniture, leaky roofs and brown bath water.
After Reuters informed Corvias of its findings at Polk, the company sent a December 13 holiday email to residents. Corvias told them it strives to serve tenants, but had ""fallen short of that promise"" in some cases. ""We can do better and will make it happen.""
Leigh Tuttle, a major's wife, said when her family moved into a renovated 1980s duplex in 2016, the place smelled like a ""wet dog."" Corvias told her the stains on the floors and the air ducts were ""just dust,"" she said. After testing confirmed mold, staff replaced carpets but didn't keep the air ducts clean, Tuttle said.
Her son Weston, now 5, developed breathing difficulties, his medical records show. The family moved across the country last year to a new post and live in civilian housing off base. Weston still needs inhalers and frequent nebulizer treatments.
""The mold was the worst in his room,"" Tuttle said. ""He wouldn't have these problems if they'd done things right.""
The family struggles to pay for Weston's visits to respiratory specialists, some of which aren't covered by their military health insurance, Tuttle said. When Reuters showed her pictures of John Picerne's estates, she took a moment to collect herself.

""I find it appalling that he's able to have that lifestyle while service families are suffering in his homes,"" Tuttle said. ""I bet he doesn't have mold growing in those mansions.""

588,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>","China criticizes outgoing U.S. defense secretary, but offers praise too","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Defence Ministry criticized outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis on Thursday for his ""false accusations"" against China, but also offered praise for his efforts to promote Sino-U.S. military ties.
U.S. President Donald Trump said this week he would replace Mattis two months earlier than expected, after he resigned the previous week over policy differences with Trump.
Trump on Monday criticized Mattis and his view of alliances, saying the Pentagon chief failed to recognize the true costs of America's military support around the world.
In his resignation letter, Mattis said he believed the United States ""must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours"". 
He identified Russia and China as countries that ""want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model"".
Speaking at a regular monthly news briefing, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Wu Qian voiced displeasure at Mattis' comments.
""We oppose the false accusations about China in Secretary Mattis' resignation letter,"" Wu said.
""At the same time, while Secretary Mattis was in office he made positive efforts towards making the China-U.S. military relationship a stabilizer in bilateral ties,"" he said.
Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will take over from Mattis on an acting basis from Jan. 1.
Wu said that under Shanahan's leadership, China expected military ties would continue to develop in a healthy and stable way.
Relations between the world's two largest economies have plumbed new depths under Trump amid a bitter trade dispute and disagreements over Chinese-claimed Taiwan, the South China Sea, and other geopolitical flashpoints.
Worried that weak ties between major militaries could lead to misunderstandings that snowball into conflict amid tense relations, U.S. officials had said Mattis was attempting to forge a relationship with Chinese military leaders.
One Chinese official previously told Reuters that Beijing regarded Mattis as a ""wise man"", experienced enough in war to know it is best avoided.
However, as Mattis tried to cultivate ties to contain crises, the Pentagon ramped up activity that irritates the Chinese government, such as ""freedom of navigation"" operations in the disputed South China Sea.

Still, in a sign China wants its military relationship with the United States to progress, Wu said Chinese naval chief Shen Jinlong had spoken last week with Chief of U.S. Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson and invited him to visit.

BENGHAZI (Reuters) - A Chadian armed group attacked a military camp of forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar in southern Libya on Thursday, killing one and injuring 13 others, a local official said.
After the toppling of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in the NATO-backed uprising in 2011, fighters from neighboring Chad and Sudan joined the ensuing turmoil. Competing Libyan armed factions frequently accuse each other of deploying mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa.
The attack took place near Traghen, 902 kilometers (560 miles) south of Tripoli and about 400 kilometers north of the border with Chad. 
A spokesman for the Traghen municipality said the man killed was a fighter loyal to the Haftar-allied, eastern government in Libya.
Since disputed elections and an escalation of fighting in 2014 there have been two governments in Libya, the UN-backed government of national accord (GNA) based in Tripoli and a rival government in the east.
The attack on the military camp on Traghen's outskirts was thwarted by mid-day, the spokesman Khalid Chataoui said, noting that hospitals in the city are underequipped to treat the injured. 
There was no comment from Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) on the attack.
The east-west division has split key institutions and produced a deadlock between the rump parliaments aligned with rival, shifting military factions.

ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Mongolians took to the streets on Thursday to protest against corruption in the top echelons of politics, braving temperatures that dropped below minus 20 degrees Celsius in the capital, Ulaanbaatar.
The protesters - organizers estimated there were 25,000 of them - focused their anger on Mongolia's parliamentary speaker, Enkhbold Miyegombo, and the two main ruling parties, the Mongolian People's Party and the Democratic Party.
There has been rising anger over a long-running corruption case related to allegations that Enkhbold and other political figures had looked to raise 60 billion tugrik ($23 million) by selling off government positions.
Enkhbold has denied the allegations.
A cross-party group of politicians who are boycotting the parliament's plenary sessions has signed a letter demanding Enkhbold's resignation. 
The group, the Mongolian People's Union, opposes the two main parties, together know by the abbreviation MANAN.
""We will not allow the situation where the MANAN faction gets all the wealth and resources, while people ... remain with nothing,"" member of parliament Ayursaikhan Tumurbaatar told media.
""The air pollution, people's poverty, wealth inequality all started with Enkhbold, since he was the mayor of Ulaanbaatar city,"" he said.
Mongolia, for years a satellite of the Soviet Union, transitioned to parliamentary democracy in 1990.
At the Thursday protest, people held up placards with messages such as ""We Demand Enkhbold Resign"".
Protester Dejid Avirmed, 61, told Reuters that people were fed up that in a mineral-rich, democratic country like Mongolia many still lived in poverty.
""Mongolians are very patient, but now we lose our patience,"" she told Reuters at the protest in the central square in front of parliament.
""Enkhbold should resign. A shame on him that he makes this many people protest in this mid-winter cold.""
Thursday's regular session of parliament was delayed, the seventh time it has been, because of the boycott by the members demanding Enkhbold's resignation.
The last scheduled parliament session for 2018 is due on Friday.
""Parliament members should solve the problem not by appealing to protests, but by coming to the parliament session hall. This is the law,"" said Enkh-Amgalan Luvsantseren, deputy speaker of parliament, media reported.

Three days of drone sightings at Britain's second busiest airport lead to about 1,000 flight cancellations and disrupted the travel of 140,000 passengers in what is thought to be the most disruptive incident of its kind.
London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said no police force around the world could be sure of preventing the problem posed by drones at airports.
""I think the whole country and certainly the government will have watched what's gone on and said we need to up our game here,"" Dick told BBC radio.
""You won't find a police service in the world I think who would be sitting complacently thinking: 'well we could always deal with a drone'.""
The drones were first spotted at Gatwick on Dec. 19. Every time the airport sought to reopen the runway, the drones returned and authorities only regained control over the airfield after the army deployed military technology to guard the area.
Security Minister Ben Wallace said on Monday that Britain's security forces now had detection systems that could be deployed across the country to combat the drone threat.
""The drone technology is always changing. We have to keep up with that. There are a whole variety of tactics and technologies that we are now using, can use and in the future they will have to change again I'm sure,"" said Dick. 
""I've been talking to colleagues around the world. I can tell you this is not an easy problem. We are doing our very best here and going into the future I'm sure working closely with others we will get better and better.""
The police investigation into the Gatwick incident is ongoing. Detectives on Sunday released without charge two people they had suspected of flying the drones. 
Flying drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary is punishable by up to five years in prison.

""We need to work even more closely with the private companies, we need to work even more closely with the military, we need to try to be able to prevent the criminal use of drones for whatever motivation near our airports,"" Dick said.

LABUAN, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia on Thursday raised the alert level for the erupting Anak Krakatau volcano to the second-highest, and ordered all flights to steer clear, days after it triggered a tsunami that killed at least 430 people.
A crater collapse on the volcanic island at high tide on Saturday sent waves up to 5 meters (16 feet) high smashing into the coast on the Sunda Strait, between the islands of Java and Sumatra.
Authorities have warned that the crater of Anak Krakatau, or child of Krakatau, remains fragile, raising fears of another collapse and tsunami, and have urged residents to stay away from the coast. 
The volcano has been rumbling on and off since June but has been particularly active since Sunday, spewing lava and rocks, and sending huge clouds of ash up to 3,000 meters into heavily overcast skies.
The national geological agency, in raising the alert level to the second-highest, set a 5-km exclusion zone around the island.
""Since December 23, activity has not stopped ... We anticipate a further escalation,"" said Antonius Ratdomopurbo, secretary of the geological agency.
A thin layer of volcanic ash has been settling on buildings, vehicles and vegetation along the west coast of Java since late on Wednesday, according to images shared by the national disaster mitigation agency. 
Authorities said the ash was not dangerous, but advised residents to wear masks and goggles when outside, while aircraft were ordered away.
""All flights are rerouted due to Krakatau volcano ash on red alert,"" Indonesia's air traffic control agency AirNav said in a release.
AirNav's corporate secretary, Didiet K.S. Radityo, told Reuters there were no disruptions to any international or domestic flights.
The civil aviation authority said no airports would be affected. The capital, Jakarta, is about 155 km east of the volcano.
Indonesia is a vast archipelago that sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"". 
In 1883, the volcano then known as Krakatoa erupted in one of the biggest blasts in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunami and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash.
Anak Krakatau is the island that emerged from the area in 1927 and has been growing ever since.
This year, Indonesia has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade.
'NO PREPARATIONS'
The latest tsunami, coming during the Christmas season, evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. 
Tsunami warning systems were set up after 2004 but they have failed to prevent subsequent disasters, often because apparatus has not been maintained, while public education and disaster preparation efforts have been patchy at best.
Ramdi Tualfredi, a teacher in the village of Cigondong, on Java's west coast, said he had never got any instructions on safety steps and efforts to prepare communities for tsunami had ""totally failed"".
""There were no preparations. I didn’t get information from anywhere,"" he said, adding there had been little help for residents since disaster struck.
Nearly 22,000 people were displaced by the tsunami, while 1,495 were injured and 159 are missing.
Thousands of displaced are staying in tents and crowded into public buildings. 
Hamad Suhaimi, a teacher working as a volunteer at a school being used as an emergency shelter, said the numbers of displaced needing help had surged as authorities expanded the area deemed unsafe.
Volunteers and displaced villagers told Reuters that conditions in the shelters were getting difficult, especially for new mothers and their babies.
""We're breastfeeding. We have to eat in the morning but food only comes at midday and there are no vegetables,"" said Siti Sayaroh, 24.

The government has declared a state of emergency until Jan. 4, to help with the distribution of aid.

ATHENS (Reuters) - An explosive device wounded a police officer and a civilian when it detonated outside a church in central Athens early on Thursday, shortly before liturgy was due to start and without warning, police and state media said.
There was no claim of responsibility for the attack outside the Saint Dionysios church in the heavily policed, wealthy Kolonaki quarter which borders on Exarchia, a district where clashes between police and anarchists are common.
The blast occurred around 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT), just before the church was due to open to the public for a service at 07:30 (0530 GMT). 
The police officer and a second person - identified by state TV as the church caretaker - were taken to hospital and police cordoned off the area. Their injuries were not life threatening, health officials said.
Witnesses cited by state television suggested the caretaker called police after finding the package. There was no warning call that the device would go off. Police were checking footage from surveillance cameras in the area.
""The blast was not powerful, the officer was injured in the face and hands,"" a police official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
Police found remnants of a timing device at the site of the blast but it was unclear if it was remote-controlled, the police official said.
Small-scale attacks on businesses, state buildings, police and politicians are not uncommon in Greece, which has a long history of political violence. 
""Why this attack at a time when people would gather at the church?"" a priest at the church told reporters. ""Why are they attacking the love of Christ, what are they trying to say?"" 

A powerful blast smashed windows and wrecked offices at Greece's SKAI TV in Athens earlier this month in what officials called an attack on democracy. No one was hurt, and no-one has claimed responsibility for that attack.

Ma Jian, once a vice minister at the Ministry of State Security, is one of the most senior security officials to be jailed since the former domestic security tsar Zhou Yongkang was ensnared in a graft scandal and jailed for life in 2015.
Ma's case is linked to that of China's most wanted fugitive, exiled tycoon Guo Wengui, who lives in New York and has courted international attention with his explosive claims about the leadership of the ruling Communist Party.
The Dalian Intermediate People's Court said in a statement on its website that it had reached the verdict on the grounds that Ma had taken a ""particularly enormous"" amount of bribes, and that his collaboration with Guo's company were ""particularly serious"".
Ma had used his position to conspire with Guo and to help businesses Guo controlled by using threats to bring about illegal transactions such as compelling individuals to transfer company shares, the court said.
Ma had received more than 100 million yuan ($14.56 million) in property for his work and earned nearly 5 million yuan from trading stocks based on insider information, the court said.
Ma said that he accepted the ruling and would not appeal, according to the court said. 
It was not possible to contact Ma for comment. Guo could not immediately be reached for comment.
Ma was put under investigation for corruption in 2015 and expelled from the Communist Party the following year after prosecutors accused him of interfering in unspecified law enforcement activities.
Dozens of senior officials have been investigated or jailed since President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, vowing to root out corruption and warning that the problem threatens the Communist Party’s grip on power.
The powerful state security ministry spies on its citizens and foreigners domestically and internationally. It is one of the most opaque agencies in China and does not have a public website or spokesman.

Members of the three-month old cell, which police said had links to an Islamic State-inspired group, were arrested in raids in Delhi and nearby cities on Wednesday, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said.
They have yet to be charged.
It was not immediately clear whether the accused would be represented in court. 
The agency said it had recovered about 25 kg of explosives material, such as potassium nitrate and ammonium nitrate, as well as 12 pistols, a home-made rocket launcher and Islamic State-related literature.
According to media reports, the interior ministry had written to state authorities in June about an all-time high threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the next general election, which must be held by May.
The NIA said the main suspect arrested, a Muslim cleric, and his associates had procured weapons and explosive material to produce bombs and planned to carry out attacks at crowded places in and around Delhi.
The Muslim cleric, 29, was working at a madrasa at Amroha, a town in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
The accused include three Delhi students, three shopkeepers and an auto rickshaw driver. 
""The module was planning to strike very soon. Likely targets included vital installations, security establishments, important persons and crowded places,"" NIA spokesman Alok Mittal told reporters.

597,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 10:22PM ET</span>","In a first, Trump makes surprise visit to U.S. troops in Iraq","By Steve Holland
AL ASAD AIR BASE, Iraq (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made a surprise Christmas visit to U.S. troops in Iraq on Wednesday, his first trip to a conflict zone nearly two years into his presidency and days after announcing a pullout of American troops from neighboring Syria.
Trump was looking for some positive headlines after several days of turmoil over his decisions to withdraw the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, pull out half of the 14,000-strong contingent in Afghanistan, and push out Defense Secretary James Mattis two months earlier than planned for criticizing his policies.
Accompanied by first lady Melania Trump and speaking at the Al Asad Air Base west of Baghdad, Trump defended the withdrawal from Syria and said it was made possible by the defeat of Islamic State militants. 
“Our presence in Syria was not open ended and it was never intended to be permanent,"" he told troops wearing camouflage fatigues in a hangar at the base. He said some troops ""can now return home to their families.""
Many Republican and Democratic lawmakers have heaped scorn on Trump over his Syria policy, saying the fight against Islamic State is far from over and the withdrawal leaves allies in the lurch. 
One of those critics was Mattis, who said in a candid resignation letter last week that his views did not align with Trump's, particularly on the treatment of U.S. allies. 
Mattis had planned to leave at the end of February, but Trump forced him to go on Jan. 1 after his resignation letter was made public. 
Trump has also drawn fire from some in the U.S. military for not having visited U.S. troops in conflict zones since taking office in January 2017, particularly after he canceled a trip to a World War One cemetery in France last month due to rain. 
While there has been no full-scale violence in Iraq since Islamic State suffered a series of defeats last year, some 5,200 U.S. troops train and advise Iraqi forces still waging a campaign against the militant group. 
Trump spent a little more than three hours in Iraq. On his way home, he stopped for about an hour and a half at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where he shook hands and posed for pictures with some of the hundreds of troops lined up inside a hangar. After Ramstein, Trump headed back to Washington. 
Trump was supposed to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi but in the end they only spoke by telephone. 
Abdul Mahdi's office said there was ""a disagreement over how to conduct the meeting."" Iraqi lawmakers said the prime minister declined Trump's request to meet him at the military base. 
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the meeting could not be arranged due to security concerns and the short notice of the trip, but she said they had a ""great call"" and that Abdul Mahdi accepted Trump's invitation to the White House in the New Year.
""TOTAL VICTORY""
The unannounced visit in Iraq followed in the footsteps of two of Trump's predecessors, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, who both made surprise trips to see troops. 
For security reasons, the visits are usually kept secret until after the president arrives. A small group of aides and Secret Service agents, and a pool of reporters, were with Trump and the first lady on the overnight flight from Washington.
Trump said his main security concern was for the first lady.
While in Iraq, Trump also spoke to military commanders and the U.S. ambassador. Sanders said they ""came up with a powerful plan that will allow us to continue our path to total victory"" over Islamic State.
Unlike Syria, Trump said he had no plans to withdraw from Iraq. 
Trump has had an uneven relationship with America's military. He did not have to serve during the Vietnam War after being diagnosed with bone spurs in his heels. 
As president-elect, Trump was drawn to the brawn of the armed forces and stacked his first Cabinet with generals, many of whom have since left his administration. 
Trump has also wanted to end protracted U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts, and to force allies to pay more of the costs that he says fall disproportionately on American taxpayers, a point he made again on Wednesday. 
Trump spoke to troops gathered in a dining hall festooned with holiday decorations and teased soldiers about their favorite football teams.
To reporters, he lamented the wear and tear of overseas conflicts.
“It's time to get our young people out,"" Trump said. ""And I’ve been signing plenty of letters and I don’t like sending those letters home to parents saying that your young man or your young woman has been killed.

“I don’t like doing it. We’ve been doing it long enough.”

Sabah al Saadi, the leader of the Islah parliamentary bloc, called for an emergency session of parliament ""to discuss this blatant violation of Iraq's sovereignty and to stop these aggressive actions by Trump who should know his limits: The U.S. occupation of Iraq is over.""
The Bina bloc, Islah's rival in parliament and led by Iran-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri, also objected to Trump's trip to Iraq.
""Trump's visit is a flagrant and clear violation of diplomatic norms and shows his disdain and hostility in his dealings with the Iraqi government,"" said a statement from Bina.
Abdul Mahdi's office said in a statement that U.S. authorities had informed Iraq's leadership of the president's visit ahead of time. The statement said the Iraqi prime minister and U.S. president talked by telephone due to a ""disagreement over how to conduct the meeting."" 
Iraqi lawmakers told Reuters that the pair had disagreed over where their planned meeting should take place: Trump had asked to meet at the Ain al-Asad military base, an offer which Abdul Mahdi declined.
Trump's visit comes amid a backdrop of escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran, as Washington seeks to counter Iran's sway in the Middle East. The formation of Iraq's government has stalled as well amid intensifying discord between the Islah and Bina blocs.
Falih Khazali, a former militia leader turned politician allied with Bina, accused the United States of wanting to increase its presence in Iraq. ""The American leadership was defeated in Iraq and wants to return again under any pretext, and this is what we will never allow,"" he said.
Bina said Trump's visit ""places many question marks on the nature of the U.S. military presence and its real objectives, and what these objectives could pose to the security of Iraq.""
While there has been no full-scale violence in Iraq since Islamic State suffered a series of defeats last year, some 5,200 U.S. troops train and advise Iraqi forces still waging a campaign against the militant group.
Islah is headed by populist Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr has long opposed the U.S. presence in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. He led two uprisings against U.S. forces in Iraq and is one of the few Shi'ite leaders to also distance himself from Iran. 
Iraq's Shi'ite militias, also known as the PMF, many of which are supported by Iran, oppose the presence of U.S. troops in the region. The PMF was made formally part of the security forces this year after helping the military defeat Islamic State in Iraq in 2017.
Qais al-Khazali, the leader of the powerful Iran-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia said on Twitter, ""Iraqis will respond with a parliamentary decision to oust your (U.S.) military forces. And if they do not leave, we have the experience and the ability to remove them by other means that your forces are familiar with."" 
Some Iraqis, however, were less concerned with the U.S. president's visit. 

""We won’t get anything from America,"" said Baghdad resident Mohammad Abdullah. ""They’ve been in Iraq 16 years, and they haven’t given anything to the country except destruction and devastation.""

NENTON, Guatemala/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Migrant children will receive more thorough medical checks after an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy died in U.S. custody this week, the U.S. government said on Wednesday, and his mother expressed grief and despair over his death.
Felipe Gomez Alonzo, who died on Monday, and his father, Agustin, 47, came from the western municipality of Nenton in Huehuetenango province, Guatemalan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marta Larra said. The pair trekked to the Mexico-U.S. border, joining thousands of others who have left their remote area.
Gomez, belonged to a family of indigenous Maya, was the second child to die this month in U.S. custody after crossing from Mexico, following the Dec. 8 death of Jakelin Caal, a 7-year-old girl also from Guatemala.
""I'm sad and in despair over the death of my son,"" the boy's 32-year-old mother, Catarina Alonzo, told Reuters by phone from her home in the tiny village of Yalambojoch, speaking through a translator because of her limited Spanish.
The latest fatality prompted sharp criticism from some Democrats, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced policy changes on Wednesday aimed at preventing future deaths of children in custody.
All children in Border Patrol custody have been given a ""thorough medical screening,"" and moving forward all children will receive ""a more thorough hands on assessment"" as soon as possible after being apprehended, whether or not the adult with them asks for one, Nielsen said in a statement.
Gomez's parents, who speak a Maya language called Chuj and little Spanish, have requested an autopsy be done as quickly as possible so their son's body can be repatriated to Guatemala, Larra said. The results are expected in about a week, she added.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency has not released an official cause of death. 
Most families in Nenton, a mountainous area near the Mexican border, are of indigenous origin and subsist on corn and beans, as well as money sent back from relatives working in the United States and Mexico, according to a local government report.
Huehuetenango sends the highest number of migrants abroad from Guatemala every year, Larra at the foreign ministry said.
Nielsen said the death of migrant children in U.S. custody is rare, noting that in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, six migrants died under the CBP's auspices, none of whom were children. It had been more than a decade since a child died in CBP custody, she added.
""It is now clear that migrants, particularly children, are increasingly facing medical challenges and harboring illness caused by their long and dangerous journey,"" Nielsen said, noting she would travel to the border later this week to observe the medical screenings and conditions at Border Patrol stations.
She placed some blame for the risks faced by migrant children on their families. ""Smugglers, traffickers, and their own parents put these minors at risk by embarking on the dangerous and arduous journey north,"" Nielsen said.
INVESTIGATION DEMANDED
Gomez and his father were detained on Dec. 18 in El Paso, Texas, for illegally entering the country, the agency said.
They were given hot food, snacks, juice and water, and two days later, were transferred to the El Paso Border Patrol Station, CBP said. On Dec. 23, they were moved to the Alamogordo Border Patrol Station in New Mexico.
On the morning of Dec. 24, an agent noticed Gomez ""was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes,"" CBP said, and the father and son were transferred to a nearby hospital. 
The boy was found to have a fever and cold and was released with a prescription for an antibiotic and Ibuprofen. That evening, Gomez started vomiting, and his father declined medical help because his son had been feeling better, CBP said.
A few hours later, Gomez again began feeling nauseous and was taken back to the hospital, where he died just before midnight. CBP previously said he had died early on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called on Wednesday for the DHS internal watchdog, the Inspector General's office, to investigate Gomez's death.
Other Democrats expressed outrage.
U.S. Representative Raul Ruiz of California said on a conference call that CBP facilities he had visited last week near El Paso were ""dehumanizing"" and not equipped to handle emergencies in remote areas of the Mexico-U.S. border.

""This is under the care and the responsibility and the custody of the United States government, and they do not meet the most minimal basic standards of humanitarian health,"" he said.

Prime Minister Theresa May has struck a withdrawal agreement with Brussels but she was forced to postpone a parliamentary vote on it earlier this month after admitting she would lose by a large margin. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29.
""It is not entirely unlikely that the British parliament will vote for the divorce agreement in January,"" Oettinger told Funke Media Group in an interview. ""There is certainly no majority for a disorderly Brexit or for a new referendum.""

Oettinger said that the likelihood of Britain remaining in the EU had increased slightly over the past few months. ""Nevertheless, I assume that it will come to an exit at the end of March,"" said Oettinger, the EU's budget commissioner.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The number of slums in Chile, one of Latin America's most prosperous and stable economies, has nearly doubled since 2011, the government said on Wednesday, as an influx of migrants increasingly face a lack of low-income housing and rising rents.
Chile's Housing Ministry said it had identified 822 slums in Chile that largely lack access to basic services like water, sewage disposal and electricity, an increase of 78 percent from 2011.
The slums comprise a total of 46,423 homes, the ministry said in a statement, of which only 10 percent had access to potable water.
Chile and other comparatively wealthy Latin American nations are absorbing a wave of mass migration from destitute nations in the region such as Haiti and Venezuela, increasing demands on social services.
Immigration into Chile has increased more than sixfold in around 25 years, from 114,500 in the 1992 census to 746,465 last year.
Chile has the highest GDP (gross domestic product) per capita in South America, low levels of corruption and the lowest murder rate, according to figures from the World Bank and InSight Crime, a foundation that analyses organized crime. 
The government attributes the rise in slums to the high cost of housing in the northern third of the country, where many migrants enter Chile. 
The region is home to many of the world's largest copper mines, and demand for housing in the relatively prosperous mining outposts has driven up prices in recent years.

A talk show on Halk TV will be suspended temporarily by the Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTUK) over comments made by prominent actors Mujdat Gezen and Metin Akpinar, an RTUK official said.
Broadcaster Haberturk reported that a Turkish prosecutor had launched an investigation and asked Akpinar and Gezen to make a statement, in which they denied charges of insulting the president and encouraging disobedience.
Insulting the president is considered a crime in Turkey. 
Three future broadcasts of the prime news program on Turkey's Fox TV were also suspended after comments by a news anchor were interpreted as calling for protests against a hike in natural gas prices, the RTUK official said.
Both channels received administrative fines. 
Turkey remains the world's worst offender against press freedom, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said in an annual study, with at least 68 journalists imprisoned for anti-state charges.

The country's western allies have voiced concern over the continuing crackdown on journalists, academics and rights activists and criticized Erdogan for using it to muzzle dissent and increase his own power.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Two protagonists of Egypt's recent history faced each other in court on Wednesday, with toppled strongman Hosni Mubarak testifying for the first time against the Muslim Brotherhood's jailed former president, Mohammed Mursi. 
Mubarak, 90, gave evidence for an hour and a half at the high-security prison complex in southern Cairo where Mursi is detained. Wearing a dark suit and using a walking stick, he was escorted into the courtroom by his two sons. 
Mursi was dressed in prison overalls and seated in a thick glass and metal cage running down one side of the courtroom, like other senior figures of the Brotherhood who are defendants in the case.
About 30 relatives, mostly women, stood up to mouth and signal messages to the defendants at the beginning and end of the court session.  
The hearing was part of a retrial in which Mursi and others are accused of orchestrating prison breaks and breaches of Egypt's eastern border during the uprising that forced Mubarak from power in February 2011.
A visibly frail Mubarak, who was given a chair at the witness stand due to his age, was asked dozens of questions by the judge about security developments as the uprising against his 30-year rule gathered pace.
Speaking in a gravelly voice that gradually became stronger, he at times appeared impatient, saying he had no information or details.
Quizzed on alleged infiltration by foreign militants, he said his head of general intelligence had told him on Jan. 29, 2011 of hundreds of people crossing Egypt's border from the Gaza Strip to support the Brotherhood. 
""He told me that there are armed groups which have infiltrated the borders with great numbers, around 800 people,"" he told the court.
But he declined to answer questions on the role of militant groups, so as not to discuss state secrets without authorization. ""I want permission to speak about this, I am requesting permission so as not to commit an offense,"" he said.
Mubarak was himself jailed for six years following the revolution, appearing bed-bound in a courtroom cage and receiving a life prison term for conspiring to kill demonstrators. He was freed after the final charges against him were dropped in March last year.  
Mursi, democratically elected after the revolution, has been in prison since being overthrown a year later by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, then chief of the armed forces and now Egypt's president.
After Mursi was ousted, Egypt cracked down on the Brotherhood, its oldest and most organized Islamist movement, throwing thousands of its supporters in jail and labeling the group a terrorist organization. The Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful activism.
Mursi is already serving sentences totaling 45 years after being convicted in separate cases of spying for Qatar and on charges arising from the killing of protesters in 2012.  
He was initially sentenced to death in the prison break case and handed a life sentence on charges of spying for Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, but those verdicts were overturned.
Defendants' relatives said they saw little hope of seeing justice. 
""The court is farcical and the case is farcical,"" said one, who asked not to be named. 

As Mursi and Mubarak met in court, Sisi, who was reelected to his second term as president in March, was inaugurating a large housing project in the coastal city of Alexandria.

Al ASAD AIR BASE, Iraq (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria during an unannounced visit to Iraq, saying that many people will start seeing things on Syria the same way he does.
Trump made the decision on Syria abruptly last week, against the advice of top aides and commanders, including Defense Secretary James Mattis, who resigned the next day. 
Trump said he had told his advisers, ""let's get out of Syria,"" but was persuaded to stay, before deciding last week to bring the 2,000 troops home. 
""I think a lot of people are going to come around to my way of thinking. It's time for us to start using our head,"" the president told reporters at the Al Asad Air Base west of Baghdad where he and first lady Melania Trump spent a little more than three hours on the ground with U.S. troops.
The base, in Anbar province, became one of the most important bases for U.S. Marines after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Since U.S. forces returned to Iraq in 2014, the base has played an important role in the fight against Islamic State because of its location.
Trump said the United States would remain in Iraq, adding, ""In fact, we could use this as the base if we wanted to do something in Syria.""
Reuters reported last week that the Pentagon was considering using special operations teams to target Islamic State militants in Syria, based out of Iraq.
At the time, officials said a final decision had not been made and the option was being considered. 
While in Iraq, Trump indicated he would not rush to nominate a new secretary to replace Mattis, the first defense chief in decades to resign over policy differences with the president.
Trump said Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, whom he named on Sunday to replace Mattis in an acting capacity starting on Jan. 1, ""could be there for a long time."" 
Trump has come under withering criticism from fellow Republicans, Democrats and international allies over his decision to pull out of Syria because he believed Islamic State militants have been defeated.
Critics argue that the decision could undercut U.S. leverage in the region and undermine diplomatic efforts to the end the Syrian civil war, now in its eighth year.
Ankara is threatening a new offensive in Syria. To date, U.S. forces in Syria have been seen as a stabilizing factor and have somewhat restrained Turkey’s actions against Syrian Kurdish forces.
On Sunday, Trump said in a tweet that he had spoken with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan about a ""slow and highly coordinated"" withdrawal of the U.S. troops, suggesting that he might slow down the process after the barrage of criticism.

A complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria would leave a sizeable U.S. military presence in the region, including about 5,200 troops across the border in Iraq. Much of the U.S. campaign in Syria has been waged by warplanes flying out of Qatar and other locations in the Middle East.

Three Syrian soldiers were injured in the strikes, Syrian state media reported.
The Israeli military declined to comment on the reported missile strikes and the Russian allegations.
Addressing a graduation ceremony for new pilots at an Israeli air force base on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made no direct reference to specific attacks or Moscow's criticism.
But he reiterated Israel's intention to prevent ""Iranian military entrenchment, which is directed against us"" in Syria.
""We will act against it, vigorously and continuously, including during the current period,"" Netanyahu said.
During the more than seven-year war in neighboring Syria, Israel has grown deeply alarmed by the expanding clout of arch-enemy Iran, a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Israel's air force has struck scores of targets it describes as Iranian deployments or arms transfers to Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in the Syrian conflict.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - One of the alleged masterminds of an attack by a Pakistani separatist group on the Chinese consulate in Karachi last month has been killed along with five associates, the insurgent group said on Wednesday.
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which opposes projects linked to China's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative in resource-rich Baluchistan, issued a statement on Tuesday confirming the death of Aslam Baloch, one of its leaders.
""The important BLA commander Aslam Baloch, along with five associates in the organization were martyred in an enemy attack on Monday,"" Jiand Baloch, a spokesman for the separatist group said in a statement that gave no further details.
Pakistan's Samaa Television reported that Aslam was killed along with a number of his commanders in a suicide attack in Aino Maina in Kandahar province, Afghanistan, across the border from Baluchistan.
There was no claim of responsibility for the killings and a spokesman for the Pakistani foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Last month, three attackers stormed the Chinese consulate in Karachi, killing four people. Security forces killed the three attackers who were carrying explosives.
Pakistan has long accused its old rival India of supporting insurgents in Baluchistan. India denies helping Baluchistan insurgents and accuses Pakistan of nurturing Islamist militants throughout the region.
China has funded development of a deepwater port at Gwadar in south Baluchistan, and is also investing in other projects as part of the giant China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
Baluchistan, on the borders of Afghanistan and Iran, has rich mineral and natural gas reserves but is Pakistan's poorest province.

Separatists have for decades campaigned against what they see as the unfair exploitation of resources, in particular natural gas and minerals.

607,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 11:39AM ET</span>",U.S. Justice Ginsburg released from hospital after cancer surgery,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, has been released from the hospital after undergoing cancer surgery, a court spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
""Justice Ginsburg was discharged from the hospital yesterday and is recuperating at home,"" spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said in a statement.
The liberal justice underwent surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York on Friday to remove two cancerous nodules in her left lung.
There was no evidence of any remaining disease after the removal of the two nodules, both of which were found to be cancerous, Arberg said on Friday, citing the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Valerie Rusch. No further treatment was planned, she said.
Ginsburg, one of the court's nine justices, broke three ribs in a fall last month. The nodules were found as part of the tests the justice underwent after the fall, Arberg said.
As the oldest justice, Ginsburg is closely watched for any signs of deteriorating health. Ginsburg, appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1993, also is the senior liberal member of the court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority.
If she were unable to continue serving, Republican President Donald Trump could replace her with a conservative, further shifting the court to the right. Trump already has put two conservatives on the court since becoming president in January 2017 and a potentially dominant 6-3 conservative majority would have major consequences for issues including abortion, the death penalty, voting rights, gay rights and religious liberty.
Ginsburg has recovered from previous medical issues. She was treated in 1999 for colon cancer and again in 2009 for pancreatic cancer but did not miss any argument sessions either time. In 2014, doctors placed a stent in her right coronary artery to improve blood flow after she reported discomfort following routine exercise. She was released from a hospital the next day.
The justices are scheduled to hear their next round of arguments on Jan. 7.
In recent years she has become something of a cult figure for liberals and known by the nickname ""Notorious RBG,"" after the late rapper Notorious BIG.

A documentary film, ""RBG,"" was released earlier this year and a feature film about her life, ""On the Basis of Sex,"" made its debut in theaters this week.

The police in Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic arrested Davor Dragicevic and several other people on Tuesday, including his former wife and opposition politicians, during scuffles with police at a protest in the northwestern town of Banja Luka. 
Dragicevic claims that his 21-year-old son David, who was found dead in a creek in Banja Luka in March, was captured, tortured and murdered. The prosecution completed an investigation but no one was charged.
The ""Justice for David"" group, organized by Dragicevic's backers, gained supporters across ethnically-divided Bosnia, growing into a wider movement of citizens fed up with corruption and poor rule of law.
Dragicevic was detained on Tuesday after he failed to show up for questioning over threats he made to the Bosnian Serb interior minister. 
Police raided his house in a search for weapons but after no evidence was found, both Dragicevic and a regional parliamentary deputy who was also detained, were released on Wednesday. 
Dragicevic said that the protests would continue, even as police cleared the central town square where his backers have rallied for nine months, building an improvised memorial and renaming the space ""David's Square"". 
""My David will have justice and everybody in this country will have justice,"" he said.
But Serb Republic Interior Minister Dragan Lukac said that police would prevent any unregistered protest. 
""If he attempts to organize an unauthorized gathering, he will ... get into the conflict with police and be sanctioned,"" Lukac told a news conference.
Protests in solidarity with Dragicevic are planned later on Wednesday in several towns of Bosnia's Bosniak-Croat Federation, including the capital Sarajevo.

Alexander Valov, whose blog had been critical of the authorities in the southern Russian city of Sochi, was charged earlier this year with extorting money from federal lawmaker Yuri Napso. 
Valov was accused of extorting 300,000 rubles ($4,330) from Napso, allegedly in exchange for deleting blog posts about a private swimming pool allegedly built by the lawmaker on a municipal beach in the Black Sea resort city. Valov has denied any wrongdoing.

Most of the substances used by Russia in domestically produced pain medication comes from countries that have imposed sanctions against it, health minister Veronika Skvortsova said. 
""In order not to leave our population without strong painkillers, we must be self-sufficient,"" Skvortsova told reporters. ""We need to produce drugs in a full cycle - from substances to their medicinal form.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A Belgian judge has ordered the government to repatriate six children of Islamic State (IS) militants and their mothers who have been detained in a camp in Kurdish-controlled Syria, the national news agency Belga said on Wednesday.
Tatiana Wielandt, 26, and Bouchra Abouallal, 25, both Belgian citizens, and their children have been held in the Al-Hol camp in since the defeat of IS in nearly all territory it once held in Syria and Iraq.
Belga quoted the court ruling as ordering the Brussels government to take all necessary and possible measures to ensure the six children and their mothers can return to Belgium.
It must do so within 40 days after being notified of the decision or pay a daily penalty of 5,000 euros for each child, up to a maximum 1 million euros, newspaper De Tijd said. The Belgian government can appeal the ruling.
No comment was available from the court on Wednesday due to a public holiday. A lawyer for the two women was not immediately available for comment.
A spokesman for the foreign ministry said it would ""analyze the situation together"" with the justice and interior ministries.
Hundreds of European citizens, many of them babies, are being kept by U.S.-backed Kurdish militias in three camps since IS was ousted last year from almost all the large swathes of territory it seized in 2014-15, according to Kurdish sources.
European nations have been reluctant to take them back, regarding children of jihadists both as victims and threats - difficult to reintegrate into schools and homes. 
European diplomats say they cannot act in a region where Kurdish control is not internationally recognized. Moreover, there is little popular sympathy for militants' families after a spate of deadly IS attacks across western Europe. 
The Kurd say it is not their job to prosecute or hold them indefinitely, leaving the women and children in legal limbo.
However, mounting concern over the apparent abandonment of hundreds of children with a claim to EU citizenship - most of them under six - is pushing governments to quietly explore how to tackle the complexities of bringing them back.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Voters in three Congolese cities known as opposition strongholds will be excluded from presidential elections on security and health grounds, officials said, in a move that looks certain to inflame political tensions before Sunday's ballot.
The national electoral commission (CENI) said an Ebola outbreak - the second-worst in history - was behind the postponement of voting until March in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo cities of Beni and Butembo and surrounding areas. It cited ethnic violence for the same delay in the western city of Yumbi. 
The election is meant to lead to the first democratic transfer of power in DRC, Africa's leading copper producer and whose conflicts have in the past destabilized the entire central part of the continent. 
Kizito Bin Hangi, the president of civil society groups in Beni, told Reuters the state-controlled CENI's decision was unjustified and that residents would start protests on Thursday to demand the vote go ahead there.
Leading opposition candidate Martin Fayulu had earlier on Wednesday warned the CENI against any move to shelve voting in Beni and Butembo. ""The pretext of Ebola is fallacious because there has been campaigning in these areas. It's yet another strategy to hijack the truth of the polls,"" he tweeted.
Paul Tshilumbu, a spokesman for the UDPS party of the other main opposition candidate, Felix Tshisekedi, told Reuters Tshisekedi would participate in Sunday's vote despite the CENI's announcement.
REPEATEDLY POSTPONED
The elections - also incorporating legislative and provincial polls - were originally meant to take place in 2016. They have been repeatedly postponed since then, sparking violence in which security forces have killed dozens of people. 
The CENI pushed the election date back by seven more days last week due to delays deploying voting materials.
Explaining the three exclusions, it said on Wednesday: ""Elections lead to important movements of voters toward polling places, thus leading to concentrations of people ... raising the risk of propagation of this disease and providing the conditions for terrorist attacks."" 
Voting elsewhere in the vast central African nation would go ahead on Sunday as planned. Final results for the presidential vote would be announced on Jan. 15, with the new president sworn in on Jan. 18, the CENI said.
It did not explain how votes in Beni, Butembo and Yumbi would be accounted for in the result. 
The three cities, which account for more than 1.2 million of Congo's roughly 40 million registered voters, are known as bastions of opposition to outgoing President Joseph Kabila, who is supporting his former interior minister, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, in the race. 
Longtime President Kabila, 47, has governed since his father's assassination in 2001. He won elections in 2006 and 2011, although the latter was marred by widespread accusations of fraud.

Besides the Ebola outbreak, Beni and its surrounding areas have suffered repeated militia attacks over the last four years that have killed hundreds of civilians. In Yumbi, more than 100 people died in ethnic violence last week.

No one held the numbers 2, 8, 42, 43, 50 and Mega ball 6 that were picked Christmas night, Mega Millions said. The jackpot increased to $348 million for the next drawing to be held on Friday.
It was the fifth time a Mega Millions drawing was held on Christmas Day, and each one has failed to produce a jackpot winner. 
Mega Millions tickets are sold in convenience stories, news stands, grocery stores and other retail outlets in 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands.
The value of the jackpot is calculated on the basis of a 29-year payout, but winners can opt for a lump sum payment instead, which would be $210.2 million for Friday's drawing, Mega Millions said.
Powerball, the other multistate lottery, will hold one of its twice-weekly drawings on Wednesday night with a $294 million jackpot and an instant cash value of $177.6 million.
While the odds of hitting the Mega Millions jackpot are one in 302.6 million, the chances of turning a $2 ticket into a winner of any kind, including a $2 prize simply for matching the ""Mega ball,"" are one in 24.
The biggest-ever Mega Millions prize of $1.537 billion went to the holder of a single ticket in a drawing on Oct. 23. The ticket was sold in South Carolina but the winner has yet to come forward, Mega Millions said.

SUMUR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian rescue teams on Wednesday struggled to reach remote areas on the western coast of Java amid an ""extreme weather"" rain warning after a tsunami killed more than 400 people last week. 
Heavy rain lashed fishing villages along the coast, muddying roads and holding up convoys delivering heavy machinery and aid to isolated areas while authorities urged residents to stay away from the shore in case of further waves.
Clouds of ash spewed from the nearby Anak Krakatau, or child of Krakatau, almost obscuring the volcanic island where a crater collapse at high tide on Saturday sent waves up to 5 meters (16 feet) high smashing into the coast on the Sunda Strait, between Java and Sumatra islands.
Indonesia's meteorology agency (BMKG) said the rough weather could make the volcano's crater more fragile.
""We have developed a monitoring system focused specifically on the volcanic tremors at Anak Krakatau so that we can issue early warnings,"" said BMKG head Dwikorita Karnawati, adding that a two-kilometer exclusion zone had been imposed.
The confirmed death toll is 430, with at least 159 people missing. Nearly 1,500 people were injured and over 21,000 people have evacuated to higher ground.
(GRAPHIC: Indonesia tsunami disaster zone - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RdjsMd)
A state of emergency has been declared until Jan. 4, which authorities hope will make it easier to deploy assistance, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency. 
Search and rescue teams were focused on the town of Sumur near the southwest tip of Java, but ""the roads are damaged and clogged"" and helicopters had to be deployed to carry out assessments and evacuations, he added. 
Volunteers were having to piece together makeshift bridges out of concrete blocks after the waves washed away infrastructure along the coast.
Indonesia is a vast archipelago that sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"". This year, the country has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade. 
The latest disaster, coming during the Christmas season, evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. 
The Saturday evening tsunami followed the collapse of an area of the volcano island of about 64 hectares (222 acres), or about 90 soccer fields. 
The waves engulfed fishing villages and holiday resorts, leaving a coast littered with the matchwood of homes, crushed vehicles and fallen trees. Children's toys and rides at a seaside carnival in Sumur were left scattered along a swampy beach.
The surge of seawater also left dozens of turtles, weighing several kilograms, stranded on land, and some volunteer rescuers worked to carry them back to the sea.
On Sebesi Island in the middle of the Sunda Strait, helicopters had been dispatched to evacuate residents.
Along the coast, thousands of people are staying in tents and temporary shelters like mosques or schools, with dozens sleeping on the floor or in crowded public facilities. Rice and instant noodles have been delivered to many shelters, but clean water, wet weather gear, fresh clothes, and blankets are in short supply, some evacuees said.
Ade Hasanah, 45, staying in an emergency center with her children, said people were being told not to return to their homes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An 8-year-old Guatemalan migrant boy died early on Christmas Day after being detained by U.S. border agents, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said, the second migrant child to die in U.S. detention this month.
The boy and his father were in CBP custody on Monday when a Border Patrol agent noticed the child showing signs of illness, CBP said in a statement. The father and son were taken to the Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center in Alamogordo, New Mexico, where the boy was diagnosed with a common cold and fever, and eventually released by hospital staff. 
But later that evening, the boy began vomiting and was transferred back to the hospital. He died there early on Tuesday, CBP said, adding that the official cause of death was not known.
The father and son were not identified, and the agency said it would release more details ""as available and appropriate."" Guatemalan officials have been notified of the death, CBP said. 
The boy's death followed the death in early December of 7-year-old Jakelin Caal, also from Guatemala. She died after being detained along with her father by U.S. border agents in a remote part of New Mexico.
After the second death, the CBP announced it was developing several policy changes late Tuesday.
It will conduct secondary medical checks on all children in its custody, with a focus on those under 10, the agency said in a release.
The agency will also work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to improve custody options, such as better transportation to Family Residential Centers and supervised release, and working with non-governmental agencies for housing.
“This is a tragic loss. On behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, our deepest sympathies go out to the family,"" CBP Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan said in the release.
Guatemala's Foreign Ministry said its consul in Phoenix was seeking to interview the boy's father, to whom it pledged to give all necessary consular assistance and protection. In a statement, the ministry said it also requested medical reports to clarify the cause of death.
According to the ministry, the boy and his father entered the United States via El Paso, Texas, on Dec. 18 and were transferred to a border patrol station in Alamogordo on Dec. 23.
The Trump administration has tried to deter people from crossing the border between ports of entry illegally to seek asylum, while at the same time restricting legal access to official ports of entry. That has created a months-long wait for asylum applicants, including those who came as part of a large caravan of Central Americans this year.
Jakelin Caal's funeral was being held in her family's village in Guatemala.
Her death fueled criticism of President Donald Trump's immigration policies from Democrats and migrant advocates. The Trump administration said Caal's death showed the danger of her journey and the family's decision to cross the border illegally.
That death is being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General, which looks into accusations of misconduct by the agency's employees.

CBP said on Tuesday that the Guatemalan boy's death is being reviewed by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility, and that the Inspector General has been notified of the death. It was not immediately known if the watchdog would open an investigation.

Kommersant said Igor Kiyashko, a lawyer from Ukraine, had been found guilty of trying to purchase engine parts for MiG-29 fighter jets and of collecting classified documents related to the S-400 surface-to-air missile system at the request of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the daily reported. 
The Nizhegorodsky Regional Court, which Kommersant said had delivered the verdict against Kiyashko, did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Reuters on Wednesday. 
Kommersant reported that Kiyashko did not plan to appeal the verdict. It said he had not admitted to collecting information about the S-400 system, but had not denied his intention to pass on the MiG-29 engine parts to the SBU. 
Russia last month deployed S-400 battalions to Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Poroshenko said earlier this month he did not plan to extend martial law beyond the one month initially foreseen unless there was a large scale attack from Russia.
The Ukrainian navy ships were captured in the Kerch Strait, between Russian-annexed Crimea and southern Russia, which controls access to the Sea of Azov, where there are both Russian and Ukrainian ports.
Moscow said the ships entered Russian waters while trying to cross the strait without prior notice, ignoring orders to stop. Kiev said its ships needed no Russian permission to cross the strait.
Under the martial law, Ukraine banned Russian men of combat age from entering the country and boosted security at critical sites such as nuclear power stations and Black Sea ports.

Ukraine's military chief said this month Russia had been ramping up its forces near the border since August and now poses the greatest military threat since 2014, the year it annexed Crimea.

It occurred two days after Etna, Europe's highest and most active volcano, erupted, sending a huge column of ash into the sky and causing the temporary closure of Catania airport on Sicily's eastern coast. 
The earthquake hit at 3:19 a.m. (0219 GMT), prompting many people to run out of their homes and sleep in cars. It was felt strongly because its epicentre was a relatively shallow one kilometre deep, officials said. 
Television footage showed damage to older buildings in the towns of Santa Venerina and Zafferana Etnea. Several of the area's centuries-old churches appeared to suffer the most damage. They were empty at the time of the quake.

About 30 people suffered injuries, mostly from falling masonry as they fled from their homes, officials said. About 10 were taken to hospital by ambulances, the others were taken by friends and family members. None of the injuries were serious.

The news came days after reports last week of talks between U.S. and Taliban officials over proposals for a ceasefire in Afghanistan and a future withdrawal of foreign troops ahead of possible peace negotiations. 
Talks between Iran and the Taliban were held ""to help curb the security problems in Afghanistan,"" Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, was quoted by IRNA as saying.
""All contacts and talks with the Taliban group have been with the knowledge of Afghanistan's government and this process will continue,"" he said. He gave no further details.
Majority-Shi'ite Iran has long had close ties to Shi'ites in neighboring Afghanistan whose militias have fought the Taliban's Sunni militants. 
But in recent months Afghan officials have accused Tehran, which the United States says is trying to extend its influence in western Afghanistan, of providing the Taliban with money, weapons and explosives. Iran denies that.
Earlier this month, Afghan forces abandoned a remote western district bordering Iran, leaving the area to the Taliban after the government failed to resupply troops stationed there.
In November, the United States displayed pieces of what it said were Iranian weapons supplied to militants in Yemen and Afghanistan, a move by Washington to pressure Tehran to curb its regional activities. Iran denies supplying arms to the militants.
In October, the United States accused Iran of providing military training, financing and weapons to the Taliban and targeted sanctions against eight individuals, including two linked to the Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. Tehran denies the accusations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump set off a Christmas social media storm when he questioned whether a seven-year-old was too long in the tooth to believe in Santa Claus.
But not to worry.
The child, Collman Lloyd, from Lexington, South Carolina, told the Post and Courier newspaper she was still a believer. She and her two siblings left iced sugar cookies and milk out for Saint Nick overnight and, in the morning, the treats were gone and presents were under the tree.
Twitter had lit up after Trump, capping a week of plunging stocks, a government shutdown and the U.S. defense chief's unceremonious departure, cast doubt on the cherished childhood fantasy.
""Are you still a believer in Santa?"" Trump asked Collman in a phone call. ""Because at seven, it's marginal, right?""
In a video her family posted on the Internet, she replied ""Yes sir,"" later telling the newspaper she had no idea what ""marginal"" meant.
Trump made the comment during a holiday event with first lady Melania Trump, taking calls from children calling the North American Aerospace Defense Command Santa tracker.
A Christmas tradition, the tracker delights children with ""real-time"" updates on his Christmas Eve journey.
""It's just too freaking fantastic that Trump spent his Christmas Eve calling seven-year-olds and telling them believing in Santa at their age is 'marginal,'"" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on his Twitter account.
""Actually there is no heaven,"" tweeted Dan Amira, head writer for ""The Daily Show with Trevor Noah"" comedy show. ""When you die you just rot in the ground and get eaten by worms. Okay Merry Christmas, Timmy.""
The White House had no immediate comment on the social media response to the president's Santa comments. 
Stuck in Washington on Christmas morning because of the partial federal government shutdown, Trump displayed little holiday cheer to reporters after a 20-minute video conference with U.S. troops serving abroad.
He assailed the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, railed against Democrats who refuse to fund the wall he wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border, and blasted the investigation into his campaign's alleged ties to Russia, among other regular targets.

The president then closed with holiday wishes of sorts. ""It's a disgrace, what's happening in our country,"" he said. ""But other than that, I wish everyone a very merry Christmas.""

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - The widows of two sherpa climbers, who died on Mount Everest, will try to climb the world’s highest mountain to complete the unfinished ascents of their husbands and hopefully inspire other single women, the pair said on Wednesday.
Furdiki Sherpa's husband died while fixing ropes for his foreign clients on the 8,850-metre (29,035-ft) mountain in 2013. 
She said she would make a joint bid in May with Nima Doma Sherpa, wife of one of the 16 sherpas killed in an avalanche near the base camp in 2014.
""We are going to climb the mountain to close our pain and to honor our husbands by reaching the peak they could not,"" the two said in a statement. 
Nima, 36, said both climbers had completed training and scaled two smaller peaks. Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains.
Everest, which straddles Nepal-China border and can be reached from both sides, has been climbed by 4,833 people since it was first scaled by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953, according to a post by Everest blogger Alan Arnette.
Climbing officials say only about 500 of the Everest climbers were women.
Furdiki, 42, who like most sherpas goes by her first name, said the death of her husband resulted in immense economic hardship.

“The death of my husband is not the end of my life,” the mother of two children told Reuters. “I am undertaking the expedition to spread the message that widows can accomplish even such hard adventures.""

France launched the investigation, that also targeted Rwanda's former defense minister James Kabarebe, in 1998 following demands by relatives of the French crew who died when president Juvenal Habyarimana's plane was downed.
The investigation, and accusations by Rwandan officials that France was complicit in the 1994 genocide, damaged relations between the two countries for several years. 
The judicial source said on Wednesday that the charges were dropped on Dec. 21. A French prosecutor had recommended in October that the charges should be dismissed due to insufficient evidence.

Rwanda said on Dec. 24 that it welcomed the definitive end of what it called a politically-motivated investigation.

TIANJIN, China (Reuters) - The subversion trial of a prominent Chinese human rights lawyer in what Amnesty International called a ""sham"" hearing ended on Wednesday without a verdict being announced 
Wang Quanzhang, who took on sensitive cases such as complaints of police torture and defended followers of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement, went missing in August 2015 during a sweeping crackdown on rights activists.
Most cases from that summer, known as the 709 cases for the first day of detentions on July 9, 2015, have concluded. Wang, however, was incommunicado for more than 1,000 days and his case has drawn international attention.
Investigators said he had ""for a long time been influenced by infiltrating anti-China forces"" and had been trained by overseas groups and accepted their funding, according to a copy of the indictment seen by Reuters.
Police turned non-Chinese journalists and Western diplomats away from the heavily guarded court in the northern port of Tianjin and denied entry to Wang's supporters and family.
The court had decided, in accordance with the law, to hold a closed trial as the case involved state secrets, it said in a statement, adding that the verdict would be released at a later date. It gave no other details.
Yang Chunlin, an activist who has previously been jailed for subversion, stood opposite the courthouse shouting ""Wang Quanzhang is a good person"" and ""I support Wang Quanzhang"" before plainclothes agents wrestled him into a car and sped away.
The indictment says Wang worked with Peter Dahlin, a Swedish rights worker who was detained in China for three weeks before being deported in 2016, and others to ""train hostile forces"" as well as provide investigative reports on China to outsiders. 
It also says Wang had distorted the facts in his online statements about the case of a policeman who killed a man in Heilongjiang in 2014, and of ""cults"" that he had defended. 
Dahlin, now in Madrid, said on Twitter they had kept all documentation dating back to 2009 ""and will release anything needed to dispel that it constitutes subverting state power"".
Calls to the court seeking further comment went unanswered. 
""SHAM TRIAL""
Rights group Amnesty International said Wang's trial was a ""cruel charade"".
""This is a sham trial in which Wang Quanzhang is being persecuted only for peacefully defending human rights,"" said Doriane Lau, China researcher at the group. 
Wang's wife, Li Wenzu, says she has been unable to visit her husband since he went missing. She said seven lawyers she appointed to try to represent Wang had also been unable to visit.
In a statement sent to Reuters, Li said state security agents had followed her when she left her Beijing home and blocked off the six entrances to her compound.
She decided she would be unable to go to Tianjin after more than an hour spent trying to leave, she said. 
It was not possible to reach the State Security Ministry for comment because it has no website or publicly available telephone number.
President Xi Jinping has strengthened efforts to quash dissent since coming to power six years ago, with hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained and dozens jailed.
China routinely rejects foreign criticism of its human rights record, saying all Chinese are treated equally in accordance with the law and that foreign countries have no right to interfere.
China often holds high-profile human rights trials over the Christmas holidays, which activists and diplomats say is an attempt to minimize international attention.
On Tuesday, the justice department in the southern province of Guangdong disbarred another rights lawyer, Liu Zhengqing, on the grounds that his public defense statements had endangered national security, according to Hong Kong-based Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group.
China's legal authorities have disbarred over a dozen rights lawyers since a new set of rules with heightened political loyalty requirements for lawyers were introduced in 2016.

One of the lawyers, Yu Wensheng, had been Wang's defense attorney, before he was stripped of his license and then arrested in January. He is now being investigated for ""inciting subversion"".

630,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 03:44AM ET</span>",Japan to resume commercial whaling after pulling out of IWC,"By Linda Sieg and Kiyoshi Takenaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will resume commercial whaling from July in its waters and exclusive economic zone while ending its controversial hunts in the Antarctic, it said on Wednesday, as it announced its withdrawal from the International Whaling Commission (IWC).
Australia and New Zealand welcomed the decision to abandon the Antarctic whale hunt, but expressed disappointment that Japan would engage in any killing of the ocean mammals.
The decision, some experts said, allows Japan to save the money it spends to support Antarctic whaling while taking a tough pro-whaling stance - a matter of national pride for some conservatives. 
But doubts exist about whether Japanese commercial whaling can be economically viable, especially as fewer people than ever are eating whale meat, they said.
""From July 2019, after the withdrawal comes into effect on June 30, Japan will conduct commercial whaling within Japan’s territorial sea and its exclusive economic zone, and will cease the take of whales in the Antarctic Ocean/the Southern (NYSE:SO) Hemisphere,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in a statement announcing the decision.
""The whaling will be conducted in accordance with international law and within the catch limits calculated in accordance with the method adopted by the IWC to avoid negative impact on cetacean resources,"" Suga said.
Japan, which says most whale species are not endangered and that eating whale is part of its culture, has long campaigned without success for the IWC to allow commercial whaling.
Some influential lawmakers' constituencies include whaling communities, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's election district is home to the whaling port of Shimonoseki.
The decision to withdraw from the IWC followed its latest rejection of Japan's bid to resume commercial whaling at a September meeting, which Suga said showed it was impossible to bridge the gap between whaling advocates and anti-whaling members.
The resumption of commercial whaling is an unusual decision for Japan, which stresses multilateralism in its diplomacy, and it sparked swift criticism from environmental groups and others who believe all whales should be protected.
International Whaling Commission: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QOH7Ub
'OUT OF STEP'
""The declaration today is out of step with the international community, let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures,"" international conservationist group Greenpeace said.
""The Japanese government needs to recommit to the IWC and prioritize new measures for marine conservation.""
Yoshie Nakatani, an official at the foreign ministry's fisheries division, said Japan would still attend IWC meetings.
""It's not like we are turning our back on the IWC and abandoning international cooperation,"" she said. ""There is no change to our country's respect for the rule of law and multilateralism.""
New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters welcomed Japan's decision to halt Antarctic whaling but said he was disappointed with the decision to resume any commercial whaling.
“Whaling is an outdated and unnecessary practice. We continue to hope Japan eventually reconsiders its position and will cease all whaling in order to advance the protection of the ocean’s ecosystems,” Peters said in a statement.
Australia urged Japan to return to the IWC. 
""Australia remains resolutely opposed to all forms of commercial and so-called ‘scientific’ whaling,"" its environment minister, Melissa Price, and foreign minister, Marise Payne, said in a statement. 
Japan has long defied such protests to conduct what it calls scientific research whaling, having repeatedly said its ultimate goal was to whale commercially again.
In 2014, the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan should halt its Antarctic whaling.
Japan suspended its hunt for one season to re-tool its whaling program with measures such as cutting the number of whales and species targeted, but resumed hunting in the 2015-2016 season, capping its Antarctic catch with a quota of 333 whales annually.
Whales hunted: http://tmsnrt.rs/2iwNhlM
Japan began scientific whaling in 1987, a year after an international whaling moratorium began. Its aged whaling mothership is in need of a costly replacement or refit.
Much of the meat ends up in shops, even though most Japanese no longer eat it. Whale consumption accounted for 0.1 percent of all Japanese meat consumption, according to the Asahi newspaper. That works out to 35 grams per person per year, according to a whale meat shop owner Koichi Matsumoto.
""We ate whale meat in the old days but there are lots of other things to eat now,"" said a 75-year-old woman shopper.
""But if we don't explain internationally that whales are increasing ... people won't understand,"" she added.
The ever-dwindling demand means an uncertain outlook for Japan's whaling. 
""It could persist as a small-scale activity. There are still whale meat restaurants and I think some people will keep eating a small quantity,"" said Yoichiro Sato, a professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University.

""(But) if it's too expensive, people will not eat it. As an industry, its prospect is very grim.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese police detained a well-known Marxist at a top university on Wednesday, a witness said, on the sensitive anniversary of the 125th birthday of the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, whose legacy remains deeply contested.
Qiu Zhanxuan, head of the Peking University Marxist Society, was grabbed and forced into a black car outside the east gate of Peking University by a group of heavy-set men who identified themselves as police, a student told Reuters.
""I saw a black car parked by the gate and seven or eight men in plainclothes lifting him by his arms and legs and forcing him into the car,"" the student said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.
Qiu was on the way to attend a memorial for the 125th anniversary of Mao Zedong's birthday that he organized and had already been warned by a school adviser about the event on Tuesday, the student said.
""What's wrong with remembering Chairman Mao? What law does it break? How can they publicly kidnap a Peking University student?"" the student added.
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a request for comment. 
Students at Peking University, informally known as Beida, set on a sprawling, leafy campus in northwestern Beijing, played a central role in launching the anti-imperialist May Fourth Movement in 1919 and the pro-democracy Tiananmen protests in 1989.
But campus activism has been increasingly marginalized in the era of President Xi Jinping, with Beida in particular taking steps to quash dissent and strengthen Communist Party control.
A movement that saw students and recent graduates of universities including Beida team up with labor activists to support factory workers fighting the right to set up their own union has been dealt with harshly by authorities, attracting international media coverage. 
China has an awkward relationship with the legacy of Mao, who died in 1976, and his birthday, which was not marked in the print editions of major Communist Party newspapers on Wednesday.
Song Yangbiao, a Beijing-based neo-Maoist freelance journalist, told Reuters that this year ""the leftists have gone quiet"" and with no signs of any major activities to mark the birthday.
""I think the backdrop is the atmosphere around the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up,"" Song said, referring to official events celebrating the start of China's landmark economic reforms, with Xi giving a big speech last week.
""Remembering Chairman Mao will lead to a major clash between the two streams of thought.""

""Our air defenses confronted hostile missiles launched by Israeli war planes from above the Lebanese territories and downed most of them before reaching their targets,"" the military source said.
An arms depot was hit and three soldiers were injured due to the attack, the source added.
The nature of the Israeli missiles targets was unclear.
Syrian state media reported earlier in the evening downing several ""hostile targets"" near Damascus. 
An Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports.
""An IDF aerial defense system activated in response to an anti-aircraft missile launched from Syria,"" the official Israeli army Twitter account later said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor, said Israeli missiles were launched from above the Lebanese territories and targeted western and southwestern Damascus rural areas.
""A number of missiles hit arms depots for Hezbollah or Iranian forces,"" the observatory said. No casualties or losses were reported.
Lebanese state-run National News Agency said Israeli war planes performed mock raids above southern Lebanon. 
During the more than seven-year conflict in neighboring Syria, Israel has grown deeply alarmed by the expanding clout of its arch enemy Iran - a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
Israel’s air force has struck scores of targets it describes as Iranian deployments or arms transfers to Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in the war.

A Reuters witness said security forces barred protesters at one location in Khartoum from marching on the presidential palace by firing teargas and shots in the air.
Three witnesses told Reuters that three protesters were wounded by gunshots, one of them in the head.
A police spokesman was not immediately available to comment. Officials have previously said the security forces exercised restraint and dealt with the protesters in a ""civilized manner"".
Officials and witnesses have previously said at least 12 people have been killed in the unrest so far. Amnesty International said on Tuesday at least 37 people had died.
Rising prices, shortages of basic commodities and a cash crisis have driven protesters to the streets across Sudan to demonstrate against Bashir, who took power in a military coup backed by Islamists in 1989.
Protesters, who had gathered at several locations across Khartoum on Tuesday to march on the palace, have previously targeted offices of the ruling party, torching several of them.
Bashir, one of the longest serving rulers in Africa and the Middle East, told a rally in central Jazeera state on Tuesday that people who had destroyed institutions and burned public property were ""traitors"" and ""mercenaries"".
Three witnesses, one of them a doctor who has been offering medical support to the protesters, said three people were wounded by bullets.
""Three guys were shot next to me. One in the neck, one in the chest, and one in the head,"" one of the witnesses said by telephone, asking not to identified.
Since the demonstrations started spreading on Dec. 19, police have dispersed protesters with tear gas and sometimes used live ammunition, residents say.
The authorities have shuttered schools and declared curfews and a state of emergency in several regions. 

Journalists at the daily Al-Sudani said one of their colleagues was beaten by security forces after protesters passed next to the independent newspaper's offices.

The deployment was coordinated with the U.S.-backed militia in Manbij, the spokesman for the Manbij Military Council said. 
It is part of the wider buildup of forces in the area. 
""The battle will soon start,"" Major Youssef Hamoud, spokesman for the National Army, the main Turkish-backed rebel force in the area, told Reuters.
""What we see on the front now is reinforcements to all forces to reach full preparedness for the battle."" 
President Donald Trump’s plan to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria has triggered alarm among the largely Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
They have partnered with Washington in the war against Islamic State and now fear the U.S. move will open the way for Turkey to launch a long-threatened attack against them.
""The Russian army has restored the Syrian-Russian coordination center to Arima village to the west of Manbij city, after its withdrawal from there a while ago,"" said Sharfan Darwish, the spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
Manbij was seized in 2016 from Islamic State by Syrian militia allied to the SDF, which control roughly a quarter of Syria. Its capture was a milestone in the U.S.-backed campaign against Islamic State.
In June, the United States and Turkey reached an agreement that would see the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia ousted from the town, but Turkey says its implementation has been delayed. In November Turkish and U.S. troops began joint patrols in the region.
Turkey is determined to cross to the east of the Euphrates river in northern Syria as soon as possible, Ankara's foreign minister was quoted as saying on Tuesday. 
Ankara regards the YPG as terrorists and has been infuriated by U.S. support for the group in the fight against Islamic State.
Trump's abrupt decision to pull troops out of Syria has handed the fight against Islamic State over to Turkey - and effectively given Ankara the green light to push into remaining Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Syria.

Davor Dragicevic, who accused authorities in Bosnia's Serb Republic of concealing the murder of his son David for political reasons, was arrested early on Tuesday when police raided his house after he failed to show up for questioning.
The police said he had been arrested for security reasons. 
They also briefly detained his former wife, several other protesters, including opposition politicians, and a journalist taking photographs of Dragicevic travelling to hospital. 
Hospital authorities said Dragicevic was not suffering from any injuries. One policeman was injured in scuffles with protesters.
Dragicevic said his 21-year-old son, who was found dead in March in a creek in Banja Luka, was captured, tortured and brutally murdered. The prosecution completed its case but no one was found guilty of murder.
The European Union delegation and the office of Bosnia's international peace overseer expressed concerns about the arrests and urged all sides to refrain from violence.
""We have asked the Republika Srpska Ministry of Interior for an immediate explanation of the ongoing arrests of different persons associated with the 'Justice for David' movement,"" they said in a joint statement.
The association of Bosnia's journalists and the Transparency International corruption watchdog also condemned the arrests, saying they represented ""political persecution"" by the regime.
Police in combat gear removed an improvised memorial for David Dragicevic from the square and pushed back protesters who moved to a park in Banja Luka. 
In Sarajevo, where another father is demanding the truth about his son's murder, a protest in solidarity for Dragicevic was scheduled for the evening.
Sources said police were ordered to clear the square of activists and prepare it for public New Year celebrations which Dragicevic had threatened to obstruct.

In-between time, he has written a book of fairy tales for his children. 
""I did not decide to create a book – it was a request of my children. Every night I am with them they want me to tell a story. They don’t want me to read a story,"" Salvetti, 47, said after receiving the first printed edition of his book. 
He has three children: two boys aged 12 and 10 and a girl of eight. ""Once they told me: We like very much your stories. Why don’t you write one?"" 
The book, ""Arturo and the Unicorn"", is available in Russian, English and Italian.
It tells the story of a poor man from the Italian town of Bergamo working for a local nobleman. The book's hero is blackmailed and jailed but he manages to escape thanks to his paintings. 
""The message is that life sometimes can be unjust, but that art can help you even in the darkest moments of your life,"" says Salvetti, whose bank advises companies and government bodies in ex-Soviet countries. 
Salvetti did the drawings for the book himself, and published it with his own funds.
It can be bought online or in book stores in Russia and Ukraine for about 3 euros and proceeds from sales will go to a charity to help children in Russia and Ukraine who are suffering from cancer. 
Asked if anything about his business could be learned from the fairy tale book, Salvetti said none of the characters were based on people in real life. 
""I think I can write something more interesting not about children but about my... experiences in my business,"" he said, joking that might carry risks.

""But then I'll have to move to Argentina or Sri Lanka.""

It is still unclear whether the flag and a text in Arabic found close to the railway track were left by the same people who damaged the overhead contact wire, police said.
""Since the beginning of the investigation, several pieces of evidence have been secured,"" police said, adding that authorities discovered a torn steel cable and the damaged overhead contact wire at the train track on Sunday.
Train operator Deutsche Bahn (DBN.UL) informed the federal police about the incident and local train services were temporarily interrupted, police said.
It remains unclear if there is any connection between the Berlin investigation and a similar case in Bavaria where unknown suspects tried to damage or even derail a high-speed train with a steel cable in October.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Opposition candidates in this weekend's presidential election in Democratic Republic of Congo demanded on Tuesday that the electoral board deactivate SIM cards in voting machines to prevent the electronic transmission of results.
The opposition are up in arms because active SIM cards could allow the electoral board (CENI) to tabulate the vote electronically, despite repeated assurances the results would be based on hand counts of paper print-outs from the machines.
Disputes about the largely untested machines have stoked tensions ahead of Sunday's long-anticipated election, which the CENI postponed from this past weekend due to delays deploying voting materials. 
Seven opposition candidates, including one of the favorites in the race, Martin Fayulu, called on mobile phone operators to deactivate the SIM cards, which the CENI earlier admitted had been fitted in the machines.
At a joint news conference, the group also demanded the CENI ""send a letter to these operators ordering them to deactivate these cards"". 
A CENI spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment. 
On Monday, CENI president Corneille Nangaa acknowledged in an interview with France's TV5 Monde that the machines had been fitted with SIM cards. But he insisted the machines would only be connected to the internet after the results had been announced based on a manual count. 
However, four diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the CENI had informed them that it would announce partial results within days of the vote based on electronic transmissions. 
The election, which is meant to lead to Congo's first democratic transition, was originally scheduled for November 2016 to choose a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who is barred by term limits from running after 18 years in power. 
But it was repeatedly delayed due to what authorities said were logistical challenges. Opposition leaders accused Kabila of trying to cling to power, and security forces killed dozens in the protests that resulted.
Kabila is backing his former interior minister, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, in a field of 21 candidates, with Fayulu and another opposition leader, Felix Tshisekedi, seen as his main competitors.

The coalition said its attacks during the week of Dec. 16-22, including air strikes and ""coordinated fires,"" had destroyed logistics facilities and staging areas used by Islamic State, damaged the group's ability to finance its activities and ""removed several hundred ISIS fighters from the battlefield.""
""ISIS presents a very real threat to the long-term stability in this region and our mission remains the same, the enduring defeat of ISIS,"" said UK Major General Christopher Ghika, the deputy commander of the coalition. 
ISIS is a commonly used acronym referring to Islamic State.
That statement presents a contrast to Trump's declaration last week that U.S. troops had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State and were no longer needed in the country.
News of the withdrawal drew immediate criticism from some of Trump's fellow Republicans, who said that leaving would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
In response to Trump, Britain's Foreign Office said last week that Islamic State remained a threat even though it held no territory.

The withdrawal may also leave exposed an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militants known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which has been among the most effective against Islamic State, but is now seen under threat as Turkey weighs a new offensive in Syria.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Three suicide bombers attacked Libya's foreign ministry in Tripoli on Tuesday, killing at least two other people as well as themselves, authorities said.
The three attackers began their assault with a car bomb, damaging vehicles and buildings, and then opened fire on the ministry, a security source said. Two managed to get inside and blow themselves up. The other was killed by ministry guards.
Heavy smoke rose from the building, which was surrounded by security forces, as people were rushed to hospital. The health ministry said that apart from the attackers, three people had been killed and at least 21 injured.
Interior Minister Fathi Ali Bashagha said however that apart from the attackers only two people were killed, adding that investigations were continuing into the identity of the assailants.
""Security chaos in Libya offers propitious conditions for IS (Islamic State) and other terrorist groups,"" Bashagha said at a joint news conference in Tripoli with Foreign Minister Mohamed Taher Siala.
IS has been active in Libya in the turmoil since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The group took control of the coastal city of Sirte in 2015 but lost it late in 2016 to local forces backed by U.S. air strikes.
Siala called for a partial lifting of the UN arms embargo on Libya to help authorities counter militant groups.
He said the foreign ministry had been targeted because ""it is a symbol of sovereignty"".
""All important documents have been saved,"" he said, adding that he deplored the death of one ministry employee in the attack.
The foreign ministry earlier issued a statement saying: ""The Libyan people are waging a war on terrorism on behalf of the world."" 
The UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) condemned the attack, stressing the need to ""prevent terrorist groups from turning Libya into a haven or an arena for their crimes"".

Siala said security arrangements agreed between Libya's Government of National Accord and the UN after a month of clashes in the south of Tripoli are yet to be implemented.

645,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>","Iranian president presents budget, says U.S. sanctions to hit growth","DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday presented a $47 billion state budget with increased spending on lower income groups, saying U.S. sanctions would affect people's lives and economic growth but not bring the government to its knees.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran in May and reimposed sanctions on it, including on its vital oil industry.
""America's goal is to bring Iran's Islamic system to its knees... and it will fail in this, but sanctions will no doubt affect people's lives, and the country's development and economic growth,"" Rouhani told parliament in a speech carried live on state television.
He gave the value of the nominally balanced draft budget, excluding the spending of state enterprises, at about 4,700 trillion rials for the next Iranian year, which starts on March 21. 
That figure is up from about 3,700 trillion rials he had proposed for this year, but the new budget is effectively worth about half of this year's because of the weakening of Iran's currency.
Under the unofficial exchange rate used on the free market, the budget is worth about $47 billion.
Rouhani said state employees and pensioners would get a 20 percent pay rise next year, and the budget included $14 billion at a subsidized rate less than half of the market to provide cheap basic goods such as food and medicine, up from $13 billion in this year's budget.
Officials have said the budget is designed to provide for the basic needs of low-income groups, including state employees and pensioners, and to support production and employment. It also seeks to relaunch thousands of stalled state projects with the help of private investors.
The draft budget has to be passed by parliament and approved by a clerical body that vets legislation before it becomes law.
Rouhani called for trimming the state sector and curbing the government's dependence on oil income, which is forecast at 1,425 trillion rials in the proposed budget.
Officials have said the budget calculations were based on a forecast crude price of $50-$54 per barrel and exports of 1 to 1.5 million barrels per day, down from a peak of almost 3 million bpd in mid-2018.
""If the private sector was active in the country ..., and if the budget did not rely heavily on oil, the impact of sanctions would have been much less,"" Rouhani said.
A separate draft budget for state companies, institutions and banks allocates them a total of $127 billion.

Rouhani's speech was interrupted by parliament members, who Iranian news agencies said were mostly from the southwestern Khuzestan province and were protesting over shortages of drinking water in their region.

CARITA, Indonesia (Reuters) - It was a solemn Christmas for the congregation in Indonesia's Carita, a seaside town left reeling from the tsunami that has killed over 400 people and devastated the western coast of Java, as many churchgoers have fled the area for fear of further disasters.
Instead of holding festivities and exchanging presents, Pastor Rusman Anita Sitorus led a tearful vigil at a mass in her small church.
""We were planning on holding a Christmas celebration every year, but this year is different due to the tsunami,"" Sitorus said, as churchgoers lit candles and cried while praying.
The occurrence of the disaster during the Christmas season evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
Thick ash clouds continued to spew from nearby Anak Krakatau, a volcanic island where a crater collapse on Saturday sent waves smashing into coastal areas on both sides of the Sunda Strait between the islands of Sumatra and Java.
At least 429 people were killed and more than 1,400 injured, and 154 people remain missing. 
Thousands of residents have had to move to higher ground, and officials have extended their high-tide warning to Wednesday.
Sitorus said the congregation was much smaller than usual. But residents like Nikson Sihombing, now staying in a temporary evacuation center, attended.
""We usually celebrate with joy and festivities, but with the tsunami, we can only pray humbly and not celebrate much for this year's Christmas,"" he said.

Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population and is also home to sizeable Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, in his Christmas message to the world, urged people on Tuesday to see differences as a source of richness instead of danger and called for reconciliation in places torn apart by conflict.
Francis delivered the traditional papal ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message to tens of thousands of people in a sunny St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) from the same basilica balcony where he first appeared as pontiff shortly after his election on March 13, 2013.
Security has been tight around the Vatican for the Christmas season, with military jeeps stationed at key access routes and tourists undergoing metal detector and bag searches.
Last week police in southern Italy arrested a Somali man suspected of having been a member of Islamic State and who had threatened to bomb churches in Italy, including St. Peter's.
In his address, in what appeared to be a reference to the shrill political climate in a number of countries, Francis called for ""fraternity among people with different ideas, yet capable of respecting and listening to one another"".
Francis, the first pope from Latin America, alluded to polarization over migration, saying God wanted ""love, acceptance, respect for this poor humanity of ours, which we all share in a great variety of races, languages, and cultures"".
""Our differences, then, are not a detriment or a danger; they are a source of richness,"" he said.
Francis, 82, called for the resumption of dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians to ""undertake a journey of peace that can put an end to a conflict that for over 70 years has lacerated the land chosen by the Lord to show his face of love"".
He urged the international community to work for a political solution in Syria and said he hoped a truce brokered in Yemen's civil war could bring relief to a population exhausted by violence and famine.
The Argentinian-born pope also called for social harmony in Nicaragua and Venezuela, both racked by internal political conflicts.
The millions of refugees or displaced people in Africa who are in need of humanitarian assistance and food security should not be forgotten, he said.

In Ukraine, he called for ""a peace respectful of the rights of every nation"". Ukraine's relations with Russia have been locked in a downward spiral since Moscow annexed Crimea 2014 and backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Around two dozen masked youths attacked a group of Bangladeshi reporters with hockey sticks and batons, injuring about 10 of them, when they were resting at a hotel after covering an election rally, the journalists said on Tuesday.
The incident, which occurred late on Monday in the town of Nawabgonj about 40 km (25 miles) from the capital Dhaka, is the latest in a series of violent attacks that have marred campaigning for a national election on Dec. 30.
The youths, whose identity remains unclear, also smashed hotel windows and vandalized more than a dozen vehicles belonging to media outlets or privately owned, the journalists said.
""Some of us had to take shelter inside the toilet out of fear,"" Abdullah Tuhin, a journalist with a local TV channel, told Reuters. ""The attackers threatened our colleagues and asked us to leave the place immediately or face serious consequences.""
Dhaka Reporters Unity, a union body, said many of its members had been ""seriously injured"" in the assault. Reuters could not immediately confirm the nature of the injuries.
Dhaka district's top police official, Shah Mizan, said a police team sent to the hotel after the incident had not been able to immediately determine who the attackers were. No arrests have so far been made in the case.
Opposition parties have complained of violent attacks against their workers by ruling party activists and the arrests of candidates on what they say are trumped-up charges during the election campaign.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League, which is seeking a third straight term in power, has denied accusations of trying to intimidate opposition candidates and journalists.
One opposition lawmaker, Salma Islam, whose husband owns a leading newspaper and a TV channel, said she would file a police complaint soon over the hotel attack.
""It's unfortunate and unwanted. They also tore off my banners. We will lodge a written complaint,"" said Islam, who is contesting the election as an independent after quitting her Jatiya Party, which is part of the ruling coalition.
While Hasina's administration has won plaudits globally for welcoming hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in neighboring Myanmar, critics accuse her of cracking down on free speech and adopting an increasingly authoritarian style.
In interviews Reuters conducted with 32 local journalists and editors in recent weeks, the vast majority said a recent strengthening of defamation laws had spread a climate of fear in Bangladesh's media.

The government denies freedom of speech is under attack in the country of 165 million people.

SANDRINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's husband, missed a traditional Christmas Day church service on Tuesday, though a royal source said that the 97-year old was in good health and just wanted to spend the day in private.
Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, married Elizabeth in 1947 and has been by his wife's side throughout her reign, the longest in British history.
""The duke is in perfectly good health, he is just spending the day privately,"" the royal source said.
Former naval officer Philip, who had successful hip replacement surgery earlier this year, retired from public life last year, quipping at the time that he was no longer able to ""stand up much"".
Senior members of the royal family traditionally attend a Christmas service at the St Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham, eastern England.
Elizabeth attended, as did Charles, Prince of Wales, heir to the throne. Charles' wife, Camilla, did not attend, according to a Reuters photographer at the church.
Charles' sons, Princes William and Harry, also went to the service with their wives, Kate and Meghan. 
The U.S. born actress, who is pregnant, exchanged a smile with Kate as they walked to church.
Elizabeth will say in her Christmas message that the traditions of peace and goodwill need to be heeded as much as ever, and people should respect each other even when they harbor the most deeply held differences.
According to excerpts released by Buckingham Palace, the 92-year-old monarch will also speak of family and friendship following a year in which her grandson Harry married Meghan at a dazzling ceremony. 
The queen has avoided commenting in public on contentious issues, and the excerpts make no mention of the visit in July by U.S. President Donald Trump or the turmoil over Britain's departure from the European Union.
Speaking about the birth of Jesus, she will say: ""I believe his message of peace on earth and goodwill to all is never out of date. It can be heeded by everyone; it's needed as much as ever.""

""Even with the most deeply held differences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good step towards greater understanding.""

Christianity in Iraq dates back to the first century of the Christian era, when the apostles Thomas and Thaddeus are believed to have preached the Gospel on the fertile flood plains of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates.
Iraq is home to many different eastern rite churches, both Catholic and Orthodox, traditionally a sign of the country's ethnic and religious diversity.
But war and sectarian conflict shrank Iraq's Christian population from 1.5 million to about 400,000 after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Following the onslaught of Islamic State in 2014 and the brutal three-year war that followed their numbers have fallen further, though it is not known exactly by how much.
In Baghdad, Christians celebrated mass on Tuesday morning -- declared a national holiday by government -- in churches decorated for Christmas. Once fearful, they said they were now hopeful, since conditions had improved. 
""Of course we can say the security situation is better than in previous years,"" said Father Basilius, leader of the St George Chaldean Church in Baghdad where more than a hundred congregants attended Christmas mass. 
""We enjoy security and stability mainly in Baghdad. In addition, Daesh was beaten,"" he said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
Iraq declared victory over the militants more than a year ago, but the damage done to Christian enclaves on the Nineveh Plains has been extensive. 
In Qaraqosh, a town also known as Hamdaniya which lies 15 km (10 miles) west of Mosul, the damage is still visible. 
At the city's Immaculate Church, which belongs to the Syrian Catholic denomination and has not yet been rebuilt since the militants set it on fire in 2014, Christians gathered for midnight mass on Monday, surrounded by blackened walls still tagged with Islamic State graffiti. 
Dozens of worshippers prayed and received communion, and then gathered around the traditional bonfire in the church's courtyard.
Before the militant onslaught, Qaraqosh was the largest Christian settlement in Iraq, with a population of more than 50,000. But today only a few hundred families have returned. 
Faced with a choice to convert, pay a tax or die, many Christians in the Nineveh Plains fled to nearby towns and cities and some eventually moved abroad.

Some have since returned, Father Butros said, adding: ""We hope that all displaced families will return.""

Tal Afar, about 80 km (50 miles) west of Mosul, experienced cycles of sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shi'ites after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and produced some of Islamic State's most senior commanders.
The city, which had about 200,000 residents, came under the militants' control when Islamic State overran swathes of Iraq's north in 2014.
It fell to Iraqi Security Forces, backed by the U.S.-led coalition, in August 2017, the last area to be retaken in the north before fighting moved to the Syrian border. A heavy security presence has remained since then and the city has been mostly quiet.

Cizhong - a six-hour drive from the tourist magnet of Shangri-la in Yunnan province - has been predominately Catholic since the 19th century when French missionaries built a church and converted Tibetan Buddhist residents.
Yao, a Beijing-trained priest sent to Cizhong in 2008, said he had hoped to set up classes to spark interest in the Bible and Jesus. But he found a younger generation more interested in smartphones and playing video games.
Yao said his plans were also stymied by government restrictions on religious teaching for children, as well as regular checks by officials on church activities.
""The government also has some restrictions, not allowing us to preach to young people... because they never approve of the church growing,"" Yao said.
China's constitution guarantees religious freedom, but since President Xi Jinping took office six years ago, authorities have heightened government control of religion and demanded loyalty to the Communist Party.
""FOLLOW THE PARTY""
Residents of Cizhong have for centuries blended their Tibetan, Chinese and Catholic identities.
The decorations in Ruanna's living room are a patchwork of icons, from crosses and images of Jesus to traditional Tibetan scarves and pictures of Xi.
Around 200 mostly elderly villagers gathered for Christmas morning mass on Tuesday, followed by a cream birthday cake for Jesus and rounds of Tibetan dancing. It was a lower turnout than in previous years, villagers said.
Catholic traditions in the village are being eroded by politics and economic development, some villagers and Yao said.
Outside Cizhong's Catholic church, a red banner urges people to ""listen to what the party says, be grateful for the party's kindness, and follow the party"".
""Families are encouraged to have at least one member to join the Communist Party,"" said Tibetan hotel owner Hong Xing, a Catholic. ""The party member in family has the responsibility to supervise and educate others."" 
Government investment in hydropower dams on the nearby Mekong river and housing blocks for out-of-town workers have also disrupted the rhythms of local life, Yao said.
""The living standards of villagers have been getting higher in recent years, (but) they are starting to be less devout,"" Yao said. 

""There are more villagers who don't want to come to prayers or to church. They want to live it up at home,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Many Delhi residents were forced to spend Christmas indoors this year as air quality remained at ""severe to emergency"" levels for a fourth day, in the Indian capital's worst smog crisis this year.
Senior officials predicted the severe pollution would last another three days due to unusually stagnant and cold air. They issued a three-day emergency response on Monday that included closing area factories and banning construction works.
""We are preferring to stay at home due to pollution despite Christmas celebrations and a public holiday,"" said Amit Azad, a financial consultant. He bought an air purifier this week after developing a cough because of the smog.
A Delhi government official blamed the pollution for lighter-than-usual traffic on already holiday-thinned streets, while a Delhi airport official said some domestic and international flights were delayed for up to two hours due to poor visibility.
Delhi's air quality index, which measures the concentration of poisonous particulate matter, averaged 420 on Tuesday morning, slightly better than 449-450 the previous two days - the worst this year - data from the government's Central Pollution Control Board showed. A reading above 100 is considered unhealthy.
Delhi is ranked among the world's worst cities in air quality, after years of breakneck growth in auto sales and coal-fired power generation.
Environmentalists say the federal and city governments, while focusing on temporary responses, are side-stepping more effective, long-term measures that would hit at the sources of pollution and promote cleaner fuels.
""There is a lack of political will to take required measures on a sustained basis to contain pollution levels,"" said Sunil Dahiya, a senior campaigner with Greenpeace India. He called for higher car parking fees and reduced dependence on coal-fired power plants.

Dahiya also said the government should immediately close down schools and urge people to curtail outdoor activities given the serious health effects of the current pollution levels.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2018 04:51AM ET</span>",Attack on government building in Afghan capital leaves 43 dead-official,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan authorities on Tuesday collected 43 bodies from a government compound in the capital Kabul that was targeted by a suicide bomber and extremists armed with assault rifles on Monday, officials said.
The attack began when the suicide bomber blew up his explosives-laden car in front of a government building that houses a public welfare department in an eastern neighborhood of Kabul. 
Some of the attackers rampaged through the building of the Ministry for Martyrs and Disabled Persons taking workers hostage, and others fought a prolonged gun battle with local security forces.
Health ministry spokesman Wahid Majroh said so far 43 bodies and 10 injured had been transported by ambulances from the attack site. One policeman was killed and three militants were gunned down during seven hours of fighting inside the government compound.
Afghan forces evacuated over 350 civilians from the building before calling off the operation on Monday night. No militant group has claimed responsibility for the complex attack that was identical to previous attacks by Taliban insurgents on government offices, foreign buildings, and military bases.
Abdullah Abdullah, the government’s chief executive, blamed the Taliban for the attack. 
""The 'Taliban' crime syndicate must know that with every attack they carry out against our people our resolve is further strengthened to eliminate them. Their conduct is a disgrace to the very notion of peace,"" he said in a tweet.
However, the Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement that the group was not involved in the attack on Monday.
The latest assault came just days after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was considering pulling out at least 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops currently deployed in Afghanistan. 
The possibility of thousands of U.S. troops leaving has triggered confusion and panic in the Kabul government and foreign missions who fear that sudden withdrawal would lead to the return of the Taliban regime, who are fighting to expel foreign forces, topple the Western-backed government and restore their version of hardline Islamic law in Afghanistan.
But Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff who was in Afghanistan on Christmas Eve, was quoted by local news channels as saying that the mission for troops in Afghanistan continues without any changes.
“There are all kinds of rumors swirling around,” said Dunford while addressing hundreds of U.S. troops gathered Monday at a base in Afghanistan.
“The mission you have today is the same as the mission you had yesterday,"" he said. 
The Taliban controls nearly half of Afghanistan and are more powerful than at any time since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion. They carry out near-daily attacks, mainly targeting security forces, government officials and civilians as human shields. 
Even as diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have intensified, fighting between the Taliban and Afghan forces backed by foreign troops has not subsided.
In the north, Taliban fighters killed a district police chief and kept up the pressure to seize control over parts of Faryab province on Tuesday.
Karim Youresh, a spokesman for the Faryab police said the police chief died in clashes in the Garziwan district that also killed 16 insurgents. 
In eastern Nangarhar province, the Taliban killed eight pro-government militia members and injured 12 during clashes in the Bati Kot district. 
Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the Nangarhar governor said the Taliban attacked several security checkpoints, with the battles continuing for hours. Ten Taliban were killed and dozens were wounded.
Afghan forces also killed a Taliban field commander in western Herat province on Monday. Mullah Javed, a Taliban military commission chief, and three aides were killed in an air strike in the Zawul district, said a police official in Herat on Tuesday.
Air and ground operations have surged in recent weeks as General Scott Miller, who took command of U.S. forces in Afghanistan in September, has pressed government forces to go on the attack to strengthen their hand in any talks.

657,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Easy Netanyahu win predicted in first poll since Israel election set,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will easily win a snap election set for April 9, according to an opinion poll on Tuesday, the first to be published since the ballot was announced.
Netanyahu announced the early election on Monday, appealing directly to voters for a fresh political mandate that could help him weather possible charges in corruption investigations. An election had not been due until November 2019.
The survey, published in Israel's Maariv newspaper, showed Netanyahu's Likud party winning 30 of parliament's 120 seats, the same number it took in the last election in 2015, and a governing majority for a Likud-led right-wing coalition bloc.
The closest challenger, the poll said, was a hypothetical party led by former Israeli army chief Benny Gantz, who has been widely touted as a potential center-left candidate.
Gantz has not publicly declared a political affiliation or any intention to run. The center-left Yesh Atid party led by Yair Lapid came in third in the survey, with 12 seats compared with 11 in the current parliament.
Netanyahu is enmeshed in three graft cases and denies any wrongdoing. He is awaiting a decision by Israel's attorney-general on whether to accept police recommendations to bring criminal charges against him.
The indictment decision had been expected within weeks, but some Israeli media reports said the attorney general could opt to delay the move out of concern he might influence the outcome of the election.
The Justice Ministry said on Monday, after the early election was announced, that work on the cases would continue ""independent of political events"".
Commentary accompanying the Maariv poll said that if Netanyahu wins the election, he should be able to able to fulfill a pledge he made on Monday to form a right-wing government similar to the one he currently leads.
The poll predicted that Netanyahu, now in his fourth term, could control at least 63 parliamentary seats, two more than his coalition now holds. It surveyed 502 Israeli Jews and Arabs and had a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points.
Other recent polls have shown Netanyahu has remained popular among Israelis despite the investigations against him.

Netanyahu has focused in recent speeches on what he called his main achievements in meeting security challenges posed by Iran and Palestinian militants, building a strong economy and pursuing diplomatic outreach with Arab states in the Gulf that share Israel's concerns about Tehran.

U.S. officials have told Reuters that President Donald Trump has issued verbal orders to plan for a drawdown of close to 7,000 U.S. troops. The White House and the Pentagon have not yet commented publicly.
China, a close ally of Pakistan, has been deepening its economic and political ties with Kabul and is using its influence to try to bring the two uneasy neighbors closer.
Meeting in Beijing, the Chinese government's top diplomat State Councillor Wang Yi and Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had a ""deep discussion about new changes to the situation in Afghanistan and reached a broad consensus"", China's Foreign Ministry said.
""Both sides believe that military means cannot resolve the Afghanistan issue, and promoting political reconciliation is the only realistic way,"" the ministry said in its short statement.
""The two sides welcome the various efforts made by all parties and are willing to maintain close communication and strategic coordination.""
There was no direct mention of the planned U.S. troop drawdown. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, speaking at a daily news briefing, reiterated the statement and did not answer a question on whether the meeting was connected to the U.S. troop withdrawal.
Wang visited Kabul earlier this month, where he pledged to help Afghanistan and Pakistan overcome their longstanding suspicions of each other.

China has long worried about the effect of instability in Afghanistan on China's violence-prone far western region of Xinjiang, home to the mostly Muslim Uighur people and where China says it faces a threat from Islamist militants.

LABUAN, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian rescuers on Tuesday used drones and sniffer dogs to search for survivors along the devastated west coast of Java hit by a tsunami that killed at least 429 people, warning more victims are expected to be uncovered as the search expands.
Thick ash clouds continued to spew from Anak Krakatau, a volcanic island where a crater collapse at high tide on Saturday sent waves smashing into coastal areas on both sides of the Sunda Strait between the islands of Sumatra and Java.
At least 154 people remain missing. More than 1,400 people were injured, and thousands of residents had to move to higher ground, with a high-tide warning extended to Wednesday.
Rescuers used heavy machinery, sniffer dogs, and special cameras to detect and dig bodies out of mud and wreckage along a 100-km (60-mile) stretch of Java's west coast and officials said the search area would be expanded further south.
""There are several locations that we previously thought were not affected,"" said Yusuf Latif, spokesman for the national search and rescue agency.
""But now we are reaching more remote areas...and in fact there are many victims there,"" he added. 
The vast archipelago, which sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade. 
Earthquakes flattened parts of the island of Lombok in July and August, and a double quake-and-tsunami killed more than 2,000 people on a remote part of Sulawesi island in September.
It took just 24 minutes after the landslide for waves to hit land, and there was no early warning for those living on the coast.
Tsunami disaster zone: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Sjd1oa
TEMPORARY SHELTERS
Authorities have warned of further high waves and advised residents to stay away from the shoreline.
""Since Anak Krakatau has been actively erupting for the past several months additional tsunamis cannot be excluded,"" said Dr. Prof Hermann Fritz, from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the United States.
Rescue efforts were hampered by heavy rainfall and low visibility. Military and volunteer teams used drones to assess the extent of the damage along the coast. 
Food, water, blankets, and medical aid is trickling into remote areas via inland roads that are choked with traffic.
Thousands of people are staying in tents and temporary shelters like mosques or schools, with dozens sleeping on the floor and using public facilities. Many remained traumatized by the disaster.
""We can't sleep at night, and if we get to sleep a car goes past with sirens and we wake up again, on edge,"" said Enah, a 29-year-old woman who managed to survive with her family. 
A local official in the city of Labuan, Atmadja Suhara, said he was helping to care for 4,000 refugees, many of whom had been left homeless.
""Everybody is still in a state of panic,"" he said. ""We often have disasters, but not as bad as this.""
""God willing,"" he said, ""we will rebuild."" 
Destruction was visible along much of the coastline where waves of up to 2 meters (6 feet) crushed vehicles, felled trees, lifted chunks of metal,, wooden beams and household items and deposited them on roads and rice fields.
Out in the strait, Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was still erupting and authorities imposed a 2-km exclusion zone around it
The meteorology agency said that an area of about 64 hectares (222 acres), or about 90 soccer pitches, of the volcanic island had collapsed into the sea. 
In 1883, the volcano, then known as Krakatoa, erupted in one of the biggest blasts in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunamis, and lowering the global surface temperature by 1 degree Celsius with its ash. Anak Krakatau is the island that emerged from the area in 1927, and has been growing ever since.
President Joko Widodo, who is running for re-election in April, told disaster agencies to install early warning systems, but experts said that, unlike tsunami caused by earthquakes, little could have been done in time to alert people that waves were coming.
The timing of the disaster over the Christmas season evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

RIA said that one of Saif's representatives had delivered a letter from him to Moscow earlier this month in which he had set out ideas for the political future of Libya and that Saif was in regular contact with Russia.
Western powers and the United Nations are pushing for the North African country to hold elections next year after a national conference to try to end seven years of conflict in the oil producer. 
Saif's father was toppled and killed in a 2011 revolt. Saif, who was detained afterwards before later being freed, was seen by some as a potential reformist successor to his father in the years before 2011 and remains a key figure for Gaddafi loyalists.
""We support everyone. We believe that nobody should be isolated or excluded from a constructive political role,"" RIA cited Bogdanov as saying.
""That's why we are maintaining contacts with all groups who are based in the west, east and south of the country ... Saif al-Islam has the backing of specific tribes in specific areas of Libya and all this should be part of the overall political process with the participation of other political forces.""

Turkey said this month it would launch a new military operation in the area. Last week, the United States announced a full pull-out from northern Syria, prompting Turkey to delay the campaign until the withdrawal is completed.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to coordinate to prevent a power vacuum from developing, Turkey has said. 
Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters at a briefing that Turkey aimed to cross the east of the Euphrates as soon as possible, the Hurriyet said, without giving further details.
Turkey and the United States have also agreed to complete their agreement on the Syrian town of Manbij by the time the United States finishes its withdrawal, Cavusoglu also said, according to the state-owned Anadolu news agency. 
Under the Manbij roadmap, Turkey and the United States agreed to a complete withdrawal of the Kurdish YPG militia from the town. Ankara considers the YPG a terrorist organization.
Cavusoglu will travel to Russia to discuss the process of the U.S. withdrawal in the coming days, broadcaster CNN Turk said. 
Russia, the United States and Turkey are backers of warring sides in the Syrian conflict that erupted in 2011. Russia, alongside Iran, has propped up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey backed various rebel groups. The United States' main ally has been the Kurdish YPG militia in its fight against Islamic State.
On Monday, Turkey vowed that the fight against Islamic State would not be slowed by the U.S. withdrawal, where Ankara-backed rebels reinforced their positions around Manbij.

Cavusoglu said Turkey also requested that the United States take back the heavy weaponry it gave the YPG in its fight against Islamic State, Hurriyet reported.

Randy Heiss, 60, was out walking his dog in Patagonia, Arizona, about 20 miles northeast of the border, on Dec. 16 when he found the deflated red balloon and the present list attached with a red ribbon. 
On the outside of the note was the name ""Dayami,"" and inside were the girl's top-10 present choices written in Spanish. Top of the list was ""Enchantimals"" - animated human-animal figures - and a house for them, followed by painting and drawing supplies and slime. 
Heiss suspected the balloon had drifted from the Mexican border city of Nogales, Sonora.
He took to social media and contacted popular Nogales radio station XENY via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), according to Nogales International, a newspaper in the U.S. city of the same name.
XENY reporter Cesar Barron began broadcasting Heiss' story on Wednesday and within an hour Dayami's family got in touch. XENY suggested Heiss and his wife meet the girl.
The couple bought most of the presents on her wish list, although the Enchantimals doll house was sold out, plus gifts for the girl's 4-year-old sister, Ximena, and made the 45-minute drive to Nogales, Mexico.

Martha Erika Alonso, a senior opposition figure and governor of the state of Puebla, died with Rafael Moreno, a senator and former Puebla governor, when their Agusta helicopter came down on Monday afternoon shortly after take-off, the government said.
Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said the privately owned helicopter was bound for Mexico City and crashed after suffering an unspecified failure in the town of Santa Maria Coronango, about three nautical miles from Puebla airport.
""At this point, there's no evidence that could lead us to conclude that the cause was not related to how the (helicopter) was functioning,"" Durazo told a news conference.
Alongside the politicians were Captain Roberto Cope and first officer Marco Antonio Tavera, and it is presumed there was a fifth passenger, Durazo said, without giving more details.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Twitter that his government would investigate the accident. Durazo said that the authorities had been in touch with the helicopter and engine manufacturers, who will be at the scene on Tuesday.
""We will act with total transparency,"" he said.
Television images showed the remains of an aircraft in flames, a plume of smoke and people inspecting the scene.
Alonso, from the center-right National Action Party (PAN), took office this month after winning a bad-tempered contest in July. Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) accused her of stealing the election.
Moreno was governor of Puebla between 2011 and 2017 and headed the PAN in the Senate.
An electoral tribunal validated the Puebla result only this month, and opposition politicians called for an independent investigation into the crash due to the charged atmosphere.
Vicente Fox, a former Mexican president and longtime critic of Lopez Obrador, told local television he was troubled by the timing of the accident after the electoral dispute.
""Every single doubt must be cleared up,"" he said. 
MORENA and its allies hold a majority in the state congress.
For now, Puebla's interior minister Jesus Rodriguez will be interim governor before elections are held within five months, the Puebla government said.

A number of Mexican politicians have died in aircraft accidents in recent years, including federal interior ministers in 2008 and 2011. The latter two were also members of the PAN.

""While nothing definite is being planned, the President is open to a potential meeting in the future,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement.
The conflict in Syria following Trump's announcement of a U.S. pullout, the fallout from the murder of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and Turkey's demand for the extradition of a Muslim cleric from the United States are among the main issues occupying the two NATO allies.
The Turkish presidency said Trump and Erdogan agreed during a phone call on Sunday to coordinate to prevent an authority vacuum from developing as the United States withdraws from Syria.
Erdogan welcomed Trump's abrupt decision last week to withdraw American troops from Syria, which has upended U.S. policy in the region and would remove a source of friction between the two countries.
Washington has backed Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters while Turkey brands the group a terrorist organization.
A senior U.S. official said Trump had not discussed the pullout decision with Erdogan in advance.
U.S. military officials will visit Turkey this week to discuss the details of the Syria pullout with their counterparts, an Erdogan spokesman said on Monday.
Trump and Erdogan have taken different tacks in their response to the Oct. 2 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Trump has said he wants Washington to stand by the Saudi government and its de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite a CIA assessment it was likely the prince had ordered the killing.
Erdogan has pushed to keep international attention on Khashoggi's killing and put the spotlight on the prince. Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder.
Trump said last month he was not considering extraditing Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a failed 2016 coup, as part of efforts to ease Turkish pressure on Saudi Arabia over the killing of Khashoggi. 
Turkey's foreign minister said last week that during a meeting with Erdogan in Buenos Aires several weeks ago, Trump said he was working on extraditing Gulen.

A senior White House official later said that during the Argentina meeting, Trump did not commit to handing over Gulen to Turkey.

665,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2018 08:35PM ET</span>",Actor Kevin Spacey charged with indecent assault in Massachusetts,"(Reuters) - Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey has been charged in connection with an allegation that he sexually abused an 18-year-old boy at a Nantucket, Massachusetts, bar more than two years ago, the local district attorney said on Monday.
Spacey is scheduled to be arraigned at Nantucket District Court on Jan. 7 on a single charge of indecent assault and battery on a person who is at least 14 years old, according to court documents and a statement issued by Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe.
An attorney for Spacey did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The actor, however, released a video on YouTube on Monday in which he adopts the persona of his character Frank Underwood in the popular Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) TV series ""House of Cards"" and says, ""I know what you want, you want me back ... You wouldn't rush to judgments without facts, would you?"" 
The 3-minute video makes no specific reference to the Massachusetts allegation.
The charge against Spacey, 59, whose full name is Kevin Spacey Fowler, was filed after a Dec. 20 hearing, O'Keefe said. The name on the complaint was Kevin S. Fowler.
The charge against Spacey follows an allegation in November 2017 by Boston television journalist Heather Unruh that her 18-year-old son was sexually assaulted by the actor at the Club Car restaurant and bar in Nantucket on July 7, 2016.
At a news conference in which she made the allegations, Unruh said her ""star struck"" son falsely told the actor he was old enough to drink when he met him at the bar. The legal age to drink alcoholic beverages in Massachusetts is 21.
'DRINK AFTER DRINK'
""Kevin Spacey bought him drink after drink after drink, and when my son was drunk, Spacey made his move and sexually assaulted him,"" Unruh said at the 2017 news conference. 
The actor allegedly stuck his hands into her son's pants and grabbed his genitals, she said, adding it was ""completely unexpected"" and her son tried unsuccessfully to shift his body away from Spacey.
""He did not report the crime at the time, and that was largely because of embarrassment and fear,"" she said.
Unruh said her son filed a report with police in Nantucket, a resort island off the southern coast of Massachusetts, shortly before her news conference. 
More than 30 men have said they were victims of unwanted sexual advances by Spacey, who became embroiled in controversy last year when actor Anthony Rapp accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. In October 2017, Spacey apologized for any inappropriate conduct with Rapp but has not commented since.
The fallout resulted in Spacey, who won a best actor Oscar in 2000 for “American Beauty,” being dropped from the final season of “House of Cards” and erased from the 2017 movie “All the Money in the World.”
Spacey is one of dozens of men in the entertainment industry and politics who have been accused of sexual misconduct, partly as a result of the #MeToo social media movement that began over a year ago.

Warmbier's parents sued North Korea in April over their son's death. The 22-year-old student died days after he was returned to the United States in a coma, and an Ohio coroner said the cause of death was lack of oxygen and blood to the brain.
""North Korea is liable for the torture, hostage taking, and extrajudicial killing of Otto Warmbier, and the injuries to his mother and father, Fred and Cindy Warmbier,"" Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in her ruling.
Pyongyang has blamed botulism and ingestion of a sleeping pill for Warmbier's death and dismissed torture claims. 
Fred and Cindy Warmbier said in a statement they had promised their son justice.
""We are thankful that the United States has a fair and open judicial system so that the world can see that the Kim regime is legally and morally responsible for Otto’s death,"" the Warmbiers said.
""We put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,"" they said. ""Today’s thoughtful opinion by Chief Judge Howell is a significant step on our journey.""
Howell's ruling was a default judgment, a type of decision entered against a party that does not appear in court. Default judgments against foreign defendants are often difficult to collect.
U.S. courts can compensate default judgment holders by ordering the seizure of funds or other assets located within the country, but that is unlikely in this case because sanctions prohibit North Korea from accessing the U.S. financial system.
The ruling comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-North Korea diplomatic relations, as the two countries negotiate the dismantling of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. 
President Donald Trump has said Warmbier did not die in vain and his death helped initiate a process that led to a historic meeting this year between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump said in a Twitter message on Monday: ""Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea – Progress being made. Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim!""
He gave no other details. U.S. officials have said a second meeting between Trump and Kim is likely in the new year.

A student at the University of Virginia, Warmbier was imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months starting in January 2016. He had been visiting the country as a tourist. North Korea state media said he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal an item bearing a propaganda slogan from his hotel.

They include the four main suspects in the crime and fifteen other people accused of having connections to the alleged killers, the source told Reuters, without giving further details. 
Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway were found dead early on Dec. 17 near the village of Imlil on route to Toubkal, North Africa's highest peak and a popular hiking and trekking destination. 
The four main suspects, aged between 25 and 30 years, had pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a video made three days before the bodies were found, but without agreeing this in advance with any foreign group, police and domestic intelligence spokesman Boubker Sabik said on the state 2M TV channel on Sunday.
He described the four men as ""lone wolves,"" adding that ""the crime was not coordinated with Islamic State."" 
Electronic devices, an unauthorized hunting rifle, knives and materials that could be used for bomb-making were found during police raids.
Compared with other countries in North Africa, Morocco has been largely insulated from militant attacks. The most recent took place in April 2011, when 17 people were killed in the bombing of a restaurant in Marrakech. In 2017 and 2018, Morocco dismantled 20 militant cells planning attacks in the country.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - It's Christmas in Democratic Republic of Congo, but the atmosphere is more uneasy than festive as frustrated citizens wonder if a postponed presidential vote will take place as promised on Dec. 30.
Last week the opposition accepted the authorities' decision to push the long-anticipated vote back by seven days, but have warned of mass protest and upheaval if there is a further delay.
In a Christmas sermon delivered on Monday in the cathedral of Notre Dame du Congo in Kinshasa, Archbishop Fridolin Ambongo said lasting peace depended on the authorities sticking to their electoral promises.
""To have real peace today in our country we must have elections on the set date of December 30 2018,"" he said.
""Real peace today means also that the published results truly reflect the will of the people as expressed through the ballot boxes.""
Members of the Saint Benoit Catholic church in one of Kinshasa's poorer districts understand what's at stake. 
In February, a congregant was gunned down in the churchyard by security forces during a crackdown on protests demanding the prompt organization of elections to replace President Joseph Kabila, whose mandate expired in 2016.
On Christmas eve, parishioners described how the violence and political uncertainty weighs on their spirits.
""We are celebrating the birth of Jesus and people are stressed,"" said Yannick Tshimanga, whose brother was the one shot and killed on Feb. 25, as he tried to close the gates to the church.
He was one of dozens of civilians killed in church-led anti-Kabila protests across the country in early 2018. 
""There are children whose parents have spilled their blood under this regime who are going to celebrate without their parents,"" he said. ""It is in this climate that we are having to celebrate.""
Around him, work was underway to spruce up the grounds in preparation for a visit from Archbishop Ambongo, who had chosen to lead mass in Saint Benoit on Christmas Day. 
Young boys sloshed water across a chapel floor, swept the church rafters with long-handled brooms and picked weeds from the packed earth of the churchyard.
""Before at Christmas, the children would have decorated all the streets, but how can we celebrate like that now?,"" said one older parishioner, who asked not to be named because she ""does not want to be visited by the police.""
She recalled how security forces had fired tear gas canisters into the church, where people had taken refuge after Tshimanga's brother was shot on Feb. 25.
For her and other church-members who Reuters spoke to, further standoffs with police are inevitable if the country's hopes for a free and fair vote on Sunday are dashed once again. 

""We want change. We don't want Kabila, he's killed so many of us,"" she said. ""The people are angry, even the children.""

MANAGUA (Reuters) - An influential Nicaraguan journalist critical of the country's government said on Monday that local journalism was living its worst moment under repression by President Daniel Ortega.
In recent days, Ortega's government shut down a broadcaster, arrested two reporters on terrorism and hate-incitement charges, while a judge ordered the arrest of three more and others fled the country in fear.
""They are making up crimes. They are crimes that don't exist. In essence they are criminalizing the work of the journalist,"" Carlos Fernando Chamorro, one of Nicaragua's most famous journalists, said in an interview.
Chamorro has been producing online outlet Confidencial almost in hiding since police 10 days ago raided his offices and took equipment used to produce two television programs and two digital media outlets.
""It's a total assault against the right to freedom of expression,"" said Chamorro, who is the son of former President Violeta Barrios and Pedro Joaquín Chamorro, a journalist murdered when he ran a major newspaper critical of dictator Anastasio Somoza in the 1970s.
Representatives from Ortega's government did not respond to a request for comment. Ortega's administration has repeatedly said there is freedom of expression in the country.
Since April, Nicaragua has been experiencing one of its worst crises since a civil war in the 1980s. Protests raged for months before a government clampdown reined them in.
More than 300 people have been killed and more than 500 are incarcerated, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, one of the groups the government has blacklisted. Human rights groups say four radio stations and a TV station have closed, while dozens of journalists have been beaten and threatened.
Chamorro said he has been targeted with death threats on social media. He fears that the government could trump up charges as an excuse to throw him in jail.

""Never in the history of Nicaragua has there been such a terrible attack as this,"" said Chamorro, who has hired a driver for protection. ""We are all at immediate risk.""

670,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2018 04:49PM ET</span>","Remember the poor and shun materialism, pope says on Christmas Eve","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis led the world's Roman Catholics into Christmas on Monday, urging people in the developed world to seek a simpler, less materialistic life and condemning the yawning gap between the rich and the poor.
Francis, 82, marking the sixth Christmas of his papacy, led a solemn service for nearly 10,000 people in St. Peter's Basilica for his traditional Christmas Eve Mass. 
Security has been tight around the Vatican and many other tourist areas in Rome for the Christmas season.
Last week police in southern Italy arrested a Somali man suspected of having been a member of Islamic State and who had threatened to bomb churches in Italy, including St. Peter's.
In his homily, Francis said the infant Jesus, born in poverty in a stable, should make everyone, particularly those who have become ""greedy and voracious,"" reflect on the real meaning of life.
""... Let us ask ourselves: Do I really need all these material objects and complicated recipes for living? Can I manage without all these unnecessary extras and live a life of greater simplicity?"" Francis said.
""In our day, for many people, life's meaning is found in possessing, in having an excess of material objects. An insatiable greed marks all human history, even today, when, paradoxically, a few dine luxuriantly while all too many go without the daily bread needed to survive,"" he said.
Francis, the first pope from Latin America, has made defending the poor a hallmark of his papacy.
On Saturday, the Vatican said he had given the homeless in Rome a Christmas gift of a new clinic in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) where they can get free medical help.
The Catholic charity Caritas estimated late last year that there are more than 16,000 homeless in Rome and their number congregating near the Vatican has grown visibly in recent years, especially at night when they cluster under arcades to sleep.
Monday night's Christmas Eve papal Mass was the first held with a new, energy-saving lighting system for the largest church in Christendom. It employs 100,000 LEDs (light emitting diodes), using only 10 percent of the energy of the previous system.

On Christmas Day on Tuesday, Francis will deliver his twice-yearly ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, the same balcony where he first appeared after his election on March 13, 2013.

Tunis (Reuters) - Clashes erupted on Monday between Tunisian protesters and security forces in the western city of Kasserine following the self-immolation of a Tunisian photo journalist, eyewitnesses told Reuters.
Abderazzak Zergui died after he set himself on fire in protest over social conditions, they said.
The incident was reminiscent of the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouaziz eight years ago, which sparked revolutions that toppled autocrats in what came to be known as the Arab Spring.
Security forces used tear gas to disperse angry crowds that erected barricades and burned tyres inside the city of Kasserine in protest, an eyewitness told Reuters.
In a video shared on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) prior to his death, Zergui appeared to say that whenever the unemployed in his town prepare to protest, militant attacks are launched to silence them.
“This is an appeal to Kasserine people, I will carry out a revolution by myself,” he said in the video.
The journalists union issued a statement holding the state responsible for what it described as the corruption that plagues the media.
Tunisia has been praised for its democratic progress since 2011 but successive governments have failed to push through reforms to trim deficits, create jobs and boost growth.

SAN ANTONIO SECORTEZ, Guatemala (Reuters) - Shortly before daybreak on Christmas Eve, Claudia Maquin wept silently when she was finally reunited with the still body of her daughter Jakelin Caal, two weeks after the Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody at the age of 7.
An indigenous Maya who had been hoping to begin a new life in the United States with her father, Jakelin came down with a fever while in the hands of U.S. Customs and Border Protection authorities, and died in an El Paso hospital on Dec. 8.
Her death fueled renewed criticism by opponents of U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration policies, and gave a face to the many children who have accompanied parents on the long road north from Central America through Mexico to the border.
Under a gray sky, friends and relatives filed in to Jakelin's wake in the thatched hut of her grandfather. In a laminated white coffin, her small body was laid out clothed in a blue sweater and a red coverlet emblazoned with bears.
""This is not a merry Christmas, it's a bad Christmas,"" said her grandfather Domingo Caal, 61. ""To lose a child, a human being, is difficult,"" he added, as well-wishers and neighbors shuffled through the wooden house and its earthen floors.
Her mother Claudia wept but did not speak, looking down on the child for a few moments in the coffin.
Plagued by chronic gang violence and endemic poverty, Central America has sent out an endless stream of migrants desperate to reach the United States at almost any cost. 
Jakelin's father Nery remains in the United States waiting to see whether he will be allowed to stay. The two had handed themselves in to U.S. border agents in New Mexico on Dec. 6. She fell ill soon afterwards and died after suffering cardiac arrest, brain swelling and liver failure, U.S. officials said. 
HELPING HANDS
In the early hours of the morning, Claudia had stood at a gasoline station some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from her impoverished mountain village of San Antonio Secortez, waiting to meet the white minibus that bore her daughter's body. 
During the slow, winding procession back home through the municipality of Raxruha, the driver honked the horn as it passed dwelling places. A few villagers came out to give Claudia and the grandfather money.
Struggling to make its way through the steep, rugged mountain roads in the gloom, the minibus briefly ground to a halt and had to be pushed onwards by helping hands.
White balloons with messages of love for the girl hung over the coffin. On top of the casket was a small framed photo of Jakelin.
To one side hung a yellow note in Spanish.

""Domingo Caal and family thanks: the media, the vice-president, the embassies of Guatemala and the United States, the mayor of Raxruha and everyone in general who in some way or other has accompanied us in this irreparable loss.""

Security in the capital had been fortified ahead of the planned protest. Car and pedestrian traffic in the city were reduced on Monday.
President Omar al-Bashir warned citizens against responding to ""attempts to instill frustration"", his first public comments since the protests began on Wednesday last week.
The demonstrations are the biggest in several years against Bashir's 29-year rule, with protesters enraged over price rises, shortages of basic goods and a cash crisis. Protests on Sunday also followed a soccer match.
The official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) said Bashir had met security aides on Monday. It quoted him as saying the state was ""continuing with economic reforms that provide citizens with a decent life"".
Demonstrators have repeatedly targeted the offices of Bashir's party and called for him to step down.
Government officials have blamed the unrest on ""infiltrators"". Officials and witnesses have recorded at least 12 deaths, though exact casualty figures are hard to ascertain.
Monday saw mostly smaller protests, including two in Jazeera state, where Bashir was due to visit on Tuesday for a trip shortened from three days to one.
He will travel to the state's north to open a hospital, avoiding a visit to its capital Madani which was one of the central locations of unrest during a wave of similar protests in September 2013, when scores of people were killed in the city.
Security forces in Sudan's Sennar state arrested 25 people who were part of two cells, SUNA said on Monday. It said they were ""working to incite sabotage"" and ""were planning to burn the Sennar municipal building and a number of governmental and private institutions.""
Police reports were also filed against suspects for ""crimes of sabotage"" in al-Qadarif state, private TV channel Sudania 24 said on Monday. Officials told the same channel on Friday that six people died there, without giving details on how they were killed. Authorities had arrested 14 leaders of an opposition coalition on Saturday.
Eight unofficial unions of professionals planned a protest on Tuesday in central Khartoum less than 1 km from the presidential palace. Organizers said they plan to march to the palace and hand the presidency a memo calling for Bashir to step down immediately.
One of Sudan's top opposition parties, Umma, backed the plans. Its leader Sadiq al-Mahdi, Sudan's last democratically elected prime minister until he was overthrown by Bashir in a coup in 1989, returned to Sudan on Wednesday and addressed thousands of supporters, calling for a democratic transition.

Since the demonstrations started spreading on Wednesday, police have dispersed protesters with tear gas as well as using live ammunition in some cases, residents say. Authorities have shuttered schools and declared states of emergency and curfews in several states.

ZURICH/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Monday agreed to release an Austrian student, activist and journalist who was arrested three months ago, but he will have to remain in the country to await judicial proceedings, his lawyer said on Monday.
Two others, both Turkish citizens, were also released in the same case.
Max Zirngast, a political science student who writes for the far-left online publication Re:volt, had been taken into custody in September, prompting Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz to demand an explanation from Ankara for why he had been detained. 
Lawyer Murat Yilmaz told Reuters on Monday that Zirngast is accused of being a member of a leftist terrorist organization, as a result of a number of articles he wrote about Turkey and for demonstrations he took part in while in Turkey.
Yilmaz said the court had accepted the indictment against Zirngast on Monday but decided to release him.
""Normally, he would not be released before the first trial but today the court set the trial date for April 11 and released him,"" Yilmaz said, calling the charges without merit.
The court has barred Zirngast from leaving the country, the lawyer said.
Ties between Turkey and some European Union countries including Austria have been strained by a wave of arrests made as part of a security crackdown by President Tayyip Erdogan following a failed military coup in July 2016.
Turkey has detained around 160,000 people, including many journalists, and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants since the putsch attempt, the U.N. human rights office said in March. Of that number, more than 50,000 have been formally charged and kept in jail during their trials.
Two Turkish citizens who were arrested and jailed in the same case and like Zirngast are accused of being members of a terrorist organization were released as well, Yilmaz said. He also said charges against Mithatcan Turetken and Hatice Goz were without basis.

(Reuters) - Britain's security forces have detection systems that can be deployed throughout the country to combat the threat of drones, security minister Ben Wallace said on Monday, after three days of disruption at London's Gatwick airport last week. 
""I can say that we are able to now deploy detection systems throughout the UK to combat this (drone) threat,"" Wallace said in a tweet The tweet did not give further details.
Three days of drone sightings caused chaos at Britain's second busiest airport, thought to be the most disruptive incident of its kind, revealing a vulnerability that will be scrutinized by security forces and airport operators worldwide.
Police say they have taken statements from scores of witnesses who saw the drones. They have rowed back from a statement by one police officer to the BBC that there may have been no drone activity at all.
On Sunday, British police released without charge two people arrested earlier in the inquiry.
The investigation is ongoing, with no group having yet taken responsibility publicly for the incident.
The drones were spotted at the airport on Wednesday evening, forcing it to close its runway in the run up to Christmas. Every time the airport sought to reopen the runway on Thursday, the drones returned.
Authorities finally regained control over the airfield after officials said the army had deployed unspecified military technology to guard the area, reassuring the airport that it was safe enough to fly.
Flying drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary is punishable by five years in prison.

""Those people who choose to use drones recklessly or for criminal purposes can expect the most severe sentence when caught,"" Wallace said on Twitter.

Shahroudi, 70, was a close ally of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and had been seen by analysts as a possible successor to him. 
He cut short a visit to Germany for treatment in January when activists referred him to German prosecutors, citing his record of passing death sentences which they said amounted to a crime against humanity.
Shahroudi was head of Iran's hardline judiciary for a decade until 2009, but he implemented some reforms including banning death penalty by stoning, arguing it was tarnishing Iran's image.
However, human rights groups say he failed to put an end to arbitrary arrests of political and human rights activists, and mistreatment and torture of the prisoners. Dozens of newspapers were banned under his watch and many journalists and bloggers faced long term sentences.
Shahroudi was appointed by Khamenei in 2017 as the head of the Expediency Council, a body intended to resolve disputes between parliament and a watchdog body, the Guardian Council.
He was born in the city of Najaf in Iraq to Iranian parents. In the 1970s he was jailed and tortured by Saddam Hussein’s security forces because of his political activities.
He moved to Iran after the Islamic revolution in 1979 and was promoted to top posts. In recent years, Shahroudi aimed to raise his profile in Iraq as a replacement for Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the top Shi’ite cleric and a powerful figure in Iraq.

KABUL (Reuters) - Gunmen who raided a government building in the Afghan capital killed at least 28 people - mostly government employees - and wounded more than 20 others in a seven-hour standoff with police that ended on Monday night, Afghan authorities said. 
Others killed included a policeman and three of the attackers who were shot dead by Afghan security forces, Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said.
The attack began in the afternoon when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a car outside the public works ministry. Militants then stormed the building of the National Authority for Disabled People and Martyrs’ Families, taking civilians hostage as they fought a gun battle against Afghan soldiers. 
Afghan security forces went from floor to floor of the building in an operation to rescue over 350 people inside, but had to exercise restraint in their operations against the attackers given the number of employees there, a senior security official said. 
No militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
Ambulances raced to the scene during a lull in the shooting, a witness who lives nearby told Reuters. At least 20 people wounded in the clashes were taken to hospital. 
An official working in another government building close by said employees had locked themselves in their offices after hearing the explosions and gunfire. During the standoff, the building's second floor caught fire, local news channels reported.
Attacks on government offices are frequent and are generally carried out by the Islamist Taliban, who are fighting to expel foreign forces from strategic provinces, topple the Western-backed government and restore their version of hardline Islamic law.
The 17-year-old war with the Taliban has seen both fighting and diplomacy intensify in recent months.
On Thursday, an official said U.S. President Donald Trump was planning to withdraw at least 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a day after Trump unexpectedly announced that U.S. troops in Syria would be withdrawn.
The United States went to war in Afghanistan in 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, seeking to oust the Taliban militants harboring Saudi-raised militant Osama bin Laden, who led plans to carry out the attacks.
At present, American troops make up the bulk of the Resolute Support mission to train and advise Afghan forces fighting the Taliban and the Islamic State militant group. Others are part of a U.S.-led counter-terrorism mission.
The prospect of a U.S. drawdown has triggered widespread uncertainty in war-torn Afghanistan.

With security deteriorating, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Sunday replaced his defense and interior ministers with two uncompromising opponents of the Taliban.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday criticized departing Defense Secretary James Mattis and his view of alliances, saying the Pentagon chief failed to recognize the true costs of America's military support around the world.
A day after Trump announced he would replace Mattis two months earlier than expected, the president took a parting shot at the Pentagon chief, who resigned last week over policy differences with Trump. 
""We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S., and our TAXPAYERS, on Trade,"" Trump wrote in a series of tweets.
""General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed!"" he wrote.
Administration officials said Trump was annoyed by Mattis' resignation letter, which included an implicit criticism of Trump's disregard for allies. 
Despite the falling out, the Pentagon said on Monday that Mattis authorized Trump's withdrawal of U.S forces from Syria, one of the decisions that helped trigger his resignation. 
The exit of Mattis, highly regarded by Republicans and Democrats alike, added to concerns over what many see as Trump's unpredictable, go-it-alone approach to global security. 
""To those few Senators who think I don't like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, I DO,"" Trump also tweeted.
""What I don't like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States.""
""AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!"" Trump added. 
Mattis has been seen in Europe as firmly committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance, while Trump warned European allies that the United States could withdraw its support unless they boost defense spending.
Trump also tweeted on Monday that Saudi Arabia had agreed ""to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States.""
It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to new funding from Saudi Arabia, which has already pledged money to cover costs for the next two years of stabilizing areas of Syria retaken from the Islamic State militant group.
The State Department was not immediately available for comment due to the partial U.S. government shutdown. 
Trump made the decision last week to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria and pull out about half of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, against the advice of his top aides and U.S. commanders. The move brought withering criticism from fellow Republicans, Democrats and international allies.
Defense officials have cautioned against a timeline, but the withdrawal could begin in weeks. A senior official said a specific plan was being worked out.
Mattis' abrupt resignation sparked concern among allies, who credit the retired Marine general with building trust and tempering isolationist impulses.
In his resignation letter, Mattis had said he would step down at the end of February to allow for a successor to be confirmed and to attend congressional hearings and a key NATO meeting.

But Trump Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will now take over on an acting basis beginning Jan. 1.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey vowed on Monday that the fight against Islamic State would not be slowed by the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, where Ankara-backed rebels reinforced their positions around the potential flashpoint town of Manbij.
Ibrahim Kalin, spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan dismissed concerns that the withdrawal ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump would allow Islamic State to regain territory.
""As part of the global coalition to defeat ISIS, we would like to express again that we will not allow such a thing to happen on Syrian soil, Iraqi soil or Turkish soil,"" Kalin told a news conference.
He added that there would be no disruption or slowdown of the fight against the militant group.
Erdogan and Trump agreed in a phone call on Sunday to establish military and diplomatic coordination to prevent a power vacuum from developing as the United States withdraws.
A committee of U.S. military officials will visit Turkey this week to discuss the details of the pullout with their counterparts, Kalin said, adding that Turkey would also increase coordination with Russia in Syria.
Russia backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey has backed rebels fighting against him. The two countries reached an agreement in September to create a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region, the last major rebel stronghold.
(GRAPHIC: Map of control of territory in Syria - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RgCxxb)
Trump's abrupt decision to pull troops out of Syria has upended American policy in the region. It will also effectively hand the fight against Islamic State in Syria to Turkey and set Ankara up to broaden its push against the Syrian Kurdish YPG.
Differences over Syria have long been a source of tension between the United States and Turkey. Washington has backed the YPG in the fight against Islamic State, but Ankara sees the militia as a terrorist organization.
FLASHPOINT?
A rebel spokesman said on Monday Turkish-backed Syrian forces had reinforced the area around the town of Manbij, occupied by the Kurdish fighters, in preparation for the U.S. withdrawal. 
""Yesterday units from the (rebel) Syrian National Army headed toward the Manbij front and took preliminary positions (in preparation) for the battle,"" said Major Youssef Hamoud, the spokesman for the National Army.
U.S. forces are still in Manbij and the Turkish-backed fighters will not advance until they withdraw, Hamoud told Reuters.
In June Turkey and Washington reached an agreement that would see the YPG ousted from the town, but Turkey has repeatedly blamed the United States for what it says has been a delay in that deal.
President Tayyip Erdogan said earlier this month that Turkish forces would enter the town unless the United States removed the Kurdish fighters.
Outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has signed the order for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from Syria, the defense department said on Monday.
The withdrawal is seen as possibly beginning within weeks. 
""Americans have uttered numbers such as 30-60 days, 60-100 days. We will see about that,"" Kalin said on Monday. ""This will have more to do with the coordination of the withdrawal process in the field.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican government on Monday pledged to end the ""horror"" migrants face crossing the country en route to the U.S. border, and pressed Washington for more details of its plan to send asylum-seekers to Mexico while their requests are processed.
Mexico's government had said it would on Monday set out its position on the Trump administration's radical policy change, announced last week, that migrants seeking refuge in the United States would be sent to Mexico while their cases are pending.
But for the second time running, Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard told a regular news conference that he would seek ""more information"" from U.S. authorities about the plan both sides unveiled on Thursday.
Most migrants traveling to the United States are from poor and violent countries in Central America. Caravans of them from the region have in recent months fanned tensions between Mexico and U.S. President Donald Trump over border security.
Ebrard reiterated his government would not sign any accord that made Mexico a ""safe third country"" - an agreement Mexico says U.S. officials have requested which would oblige migrants who arrive first in Mexico to file asylum requests there.
Instead, the minister said, Mexico would ""drastically"" change its migration policy to ensure that its response to the mass movement of people was humanitarian.
""Today there's only one way of describing the experience of the migrants that travel through our country: It is a horror. Humiliations, abuses, violations, and outrages,"" Ebrard said alongside President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Deflecting attention from Trump's often pointed criticism, Mexico has tried to take the higher ground in the debate by promising to help migrants get jobs and visas.
Interior Minister Olga Sanchez told the news conference that migrants would in future enter Mexico in an ""orderly"" and ""safe"" way, vowing a shift away from what she called a policy of ""repression and militarization"" at its southern border.
But many questions remain about how Mexico will cope with an influx of potentially thousands of Central Americans into the country for cases that may take years to process.
Lopez Obrador has sought not to antagonize Trump by commenting on the U.S. president's demands for a southern border wall, and on Monday he again declined to do so.

""There's a special situation in the United States and I don't wish to offer a point of view,"" he told reporters. ""I will keep my counsel. There will be time.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Monday a snap election in less than four months, appealing directly to voters for a fresh political mandate that could help him weather possible charges in corruption investigations.
The government cited differences within Netanyahu's coalition over a new military conscription bill affecting exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jews as the main reason for the early ballot.
But there has long been speculation that the right-wing leader, whose popularity has held up despite corruption allegations, could call an election before the attorney general decides whether to follow police recommendations to indict him.
The April 9 election would otherwise not have been due until November.
The indictment decision had been expected within weeks, but some Israeli media reports said the attorney general could opt to delay any indictments out of concern over influencing the outcome of the poll. The Justice Ministry said work on the cases would continue ""independent of political events"".
Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and has given no indication he will step down if charged.
""The voters, I think, understand exactly what we have done for Israel,"" Netanyahu told lawmakers from his Likud party on Monday. ""We are coming to ask for a clear mandate from the voters to continue leading Israel our way.""
Leaders of parties in the ruling coalition met earlier in the day with Netanyahu and announced a decision to ask parliament to dissolve itself. A Likud spokesman said the dissolution vote was likely this week.
Netanyahu has been governing with a majority of a single seat in parliament since November when Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman quit the government.
An electoral victory would give Netanyahu ammunition to fight a potential indictment, said Hebrew University political analyst Reuven Hazan.
""He wants to win. He wants to turn around to the attorney general and say, 'before you decide to prosecute me, pay attention. The people of Israel have reelected me ... You cannot overturn the results of a democratic election.'""
After the election was announced, the main Tel Aviv share indexes fell by more than 2 percent and the Israeli shekel also weakened.
Since Lieberman's resignation last month, Netanyahu took over as defense minister as well as prime minister, and has been appearing regularly in photos with soldiers, seen as a bid to boost his image ahead of a likely early election.
In recent speeches, he has focused on what he called his main achievements in meeting security challenges posed by Iran and Palestinian militants, building a strong economy and pursuing diplomatic outreach with moderate Arab states.
No one in Netanyahu’s Likud has made a public challenge against him. Outside Likud, Yair Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid opposition party, is seen as the strongest candidate to succeed Netanyahu in any upset.
Former army chief Benny Gantz is seen as a dovish potential candidate who could tip the balance in favor of a center-left bloc, but has not yet thrown his hat in the ring.
On the right, Lieberman and Naftali Bennett, head of the Jewish Home party, could both seek to head a right-wing bloc.

Netanyahu has been in power for three consecutive terms since 2009 and also led Israel from 1996-1999. A fifth election victory would give him the most in Israeli history.

The USS John C. Stennis entered the Gulf on Friday, ending a long absence of U.S. aircraft carriers in the region as tensions rise between Tehran and Washington. 
""The presence of this warship is insignificant to us,"" Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari was quoted as saying by the semi-official ISNA news agency.
""We will not allow this warship to come near our territorial waters in the Persian Gulf,"" said Sayyari.
Sayyari said the U.S. navy was allowed to sail in international waters near Iran, just as the Iranian navy could sail in the Atlantic Ocean near U.S. waters. 
He said, however, that Iran was on alert for possible threats. ""They do not have the courage or ability to take any measures against us. We have enough capabilities to stand against their actions and we have fully rehearsed for that.""
Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards launched war games in the Gulf on Saturday in which naval vessels, helicopters, drones, rocket launchers and commando units took part.
Praising the ""success"" of the war games, Guards' spokesman Brigadier General Ramezan Sharif said on Monday: ""The Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman has had more safety and security in the last 10 months in the absence of a U.S. aircraft carrier."" 
A U.S.-Iranian war of words has escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump took Washington out of a world powers’ nuclear deal with Iran in May, and reimposed sanctions on its banking and energy sectors.
Iran has warned that if it cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressures, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf.
A third of the world’s sea-borne oil passes through the Strait from Middle East crude producers to major markets. 

In recent years, there have been periodic confrontations between the Revolutionary Guards and U.S. military in the Gulf, but the number of incidents has dropped in recent months.

The grave was unearthed on Sunday, after information was obtained during investigations of arrested IS members, the interior ministry's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
A video posted on social media in April 2015 appeared to show IS militants shooting and beheading the Christians, who were wearing orange jumpsuits, on a beach.
The CID displayed drone images of the mass grave, which appeared to be on a farm near the coastal city of Sirte.
The bodies will be repatriated to Ethiopia once “domestic and international legal procedures are completed”, it said. Hundreds of thousands of people have migrated from sub-Saharan Africa to Libya in recent years, many hoping to eventually reach Europe.
Islamic State took control of Sirte, the hometown of Libya's former leader Muammar Qaddafi, in 2015 and lost the city late in 2016 to local forces backed by U.S. air strikes.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif was sentenced to seven years in prison on Monday and fined $25 million on corruption charges that he says were politically motivated.
The anti-corruption court in Islamabad said in its ruling that the three-time prime minister was unable to prove the source of income that had led to his ownership of a steel mill in Saudi Arabia. Under Pakistani law, this is taken to prove corruption.
Sharif had already been sentenced by the same court to 10 years in prison on charges related to the purchase of upscale apartments in London, after the Supreme Court removed him from power. He was freed from custody in September pending an appeal.
Sharif's supporters said he would also appeal against his latest conviction.
""Appeal is our right, we will protest but will remain peaceful,"" former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who had succeeded Sharif last year, told reporters outside the courthouse.
Sharif was ousted and disqualified from holding office by the Supreme Court in July 2017, and convicted in absentia a year later. He was arrested on July 13 on returning from London.
The court ruled on Thursday on two charges related to Sharif's assets: the Al-Azizia Steel Mills in Saudi Arabia, set up by Sharif's father in 2001, and Flagship Investments, a company established by his son, Hasan Nawaz, that owns luxury properties in Britain. 
Sharif was found to have been unable to demonstrate that his family had acquired the steel mill legitimately, but was acquitted on the second charge, relating to Flagship.
Sharif denied the charges which he said were politically motivated. He accused the military and courts of working together to end his political career and destabilize his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.
Sharif was once a favorite of Pakistan's powerful generals but fell out with them. The military has denied exerting any influence over the court proceedings.
Daniyal Aziz, a former lawmaker from Sharif's party, criticized the National Accountability Bureau, the watchdog that charged Sharif, and described the verdict as ""the weaponization of anti-corruption"". 
""With each passing day an expression of a double standard is coming forward from the NAB,"" Aziz said. 
Before the verdict, hundreds of Sharif supporters threw stones outside the courthouse at police, who fired teargas.
Five months ago, Sharif's PML-N lost a general election to the party of Imran Khan, the new prime minister whose anti-corruption campaign and street protests spurred the cases against Sharif. 
PML-N and other opposition politicians allege the election was rigged to favor Khan, who is seen as close to the army. 

Both Khan and the military have denied colluding against Sharif and the PML-N.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament approved on Monday two more ministers in Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's cabinet but political divisions blocked his attempts to form a complete government as the defense, interior, and justice portfolios remain empty.
Intensifying disagreements between the rival Islah and Bina blocs, led by populist Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Iran-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri, have prevented the formation of a full government of 22 ministers.
Lawmakers were scheduled to vote on the final five remaining empty posts but managed only to approve Shaima Khalil as education minister and Nawfal Moussa as migration minister before the session descended into chaos.
Abdul Mahdi was confirmed as premier in October after months of political gridlock that followed an inconclusive May election. He was sworn in with only a partial cabinet and has since been trying to get a full government up and running.
The post of interior minister has emerged as the biggest stumbling block over which parliament's two biggest coalitions are arguing. 
Amiri's bloc has repeatedly nominated Falih Fayadh, who once led the umbrella grouping of militias known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces. Sadr's coalition has consistently rejected him.
Lawmakers allied with Sadr walked out of Monday's session when Speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi put forth Fayadh's name for a vote, as they have done several times in the last few months, thus breaking quorum and ending the session. Halbousi said he would ask Abdul Mahdi to put forward a different name next time.
""We walked out of the session because we strongly reject holding a vote on Falih Fayadh as interior minister. We will never show leniency and our position is firm. No vote for partisan candidates,"" said lawmaker Jamal Fakhir.
The deadlock over forming a cabinet has raised the prospect of further unrest as the country struggles to rebuild and recover after three years of war with Islamic State.
The prime minister faces the daunting task of rebuilding much of the country after that war, solving acute economic problems and coping with power and water shortages.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China accused Britain and the European Union of hypocrisy on Monday for expressing concern about China's detention of two Canadian citizens, saying they had double standards for not mentioning a senior Chinese executive arrested in Canada.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Saturday Canada will maintain a high-level campaign in the coming days to seek support from allies as it pressures China to free the two detained Canadians, who China says are suspected of endangering state security.
Freeland spoke a day after the United States joined Canada in calling on Beijing to release the pair, who were held after Canadian authorities arrested a senior Chinese executive on a U.S. extradition warrant. Britain and the European Union have also expressed support for Canada.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing expressed ""strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition"" to comments by Canada, the United States and others on the detained Canadians.
The two, Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and an adviser with the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank, and businessman Michael Spavor, are suspected of endangering state security so they are ""of course"" being detained, Hua said.
""We urge relevant countries to earnestly respect China's judicial sovereignty,"" she told a daily news briefing, reiterating their lawful rights have been guaranteed.
The support of Britain and the European Union was ""strange"", Hua added.
""What's this got to do with Britain and the EU? When the Canadians illegally detained a senior executive at a Chinese company at the request of the United States, where were they?"" she said.
""Their so-called human rights have different standards for different countries' citizens,"" Hua added.
Kovrig is also a Hungarian and therefore an EU citizen, sources told Reuters last week.
The two were detained after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Dec 1.
China again urges Canada to release Meng and the United States to withdraw its arrest warrant, Hua said.
While Meng has had full access to lawyers and is able to see family, Kovrig is being denied legal representation, is not allowed to see family, and is limited to one consular visit a month, sources familiar with the situation say.
No details have been revealed about Spavor's detention. Canadian diplomats have seen both men at least once since they were detained.
Canada arrested Meng at the request of the United States, which is engaged in a trade war with China. Meng faces extradition to the United States to face fraud charges which carry a maximum sentence of 30 years jail for each charge.
China has given only vague details of why they have detained the two Canadians, and has not drawn a direct link to Meng's arrest.
Influential state-backed Chinese tabloid the Global Times said in a Monday editorial that Canada would ""pay for its bad behavior"".

""Canada's attempts to resolve a conflict with China by roping in its allies will never work,"" it said.

Felipe González Morales, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, also said the family of Jakelin Caal, from the Mayan indigenous community, should be given access to legal representation in the proceedings in a language they understand.
""Redress to her family should be provided and if any officials are found responsible they should be held accountable,"" he said in a statement.
""The government should also address failings within the immigration system, and specifically within the US Customs and Border Patrol agency, to prevent similar situations.""
Caal and her father Nery were in a group of more than 160 migrants who handed themselves in to U.S. border agents in New Mexico on Dec. 6. Jakelin developed a high fever while in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and died two days later at a hospital in El Paso, Texas.
""The U.S. authorities must ensure that an in-depth, independent investigation of the death of Jakelin Ameí Caal is conducted,"" González Morales, who is a Chilean professor of international law, said in the statement. 
U.S. officials have said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's internal watchdog will investigate the girl's death.
Initial news reports said Caal died of dehydration and exhaustion. Later U.S. officials said she had suffered cardiac arrest, brain swelling and liver failure.
Gonzalez Morales called on the Trump administration to halt the detention of children, unaccompanied or with their families, based on their migratory status, and to seek alternatives.
""As repeatedly stated by a series of UN human rights bodies, detention of children based on their migratory status is a violation of international law,"" he said. 
Detention is detrimental to a child's well-being, produces long-term severe adverse impacts and exacerbates the trauma that many suffer along their migration journeys, he said.
The U.S. authorities’ treatment of migrants and ""the public discourse about immigration in the US"", were of great concern, Gonzalez Morales said. 
His two requests to carry out an official visit to the United States to obtain first-hand information had not received a reply, he said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A British academic publisher has dropped more than 80 journals from its offerings in China at the government's request, including the Asian Studies Review which had content deemed ""inappropriate"" by authorities.
They are the latest journals to be restricted since Chinese importers of foreign publications were told by authorities last year they must verify that products are legal.
The Asian Studies Association of Australia said last Thursday its journal, the Asian Studies Review, had been restricted in China.
Importers had told the publisher, Britain's Taylor and Francis, to remove the journal from a package offered to libraries because ""some of its content is deemed inappropriate by the government"", the association said in a statement. 
Taylor and Francis said six articles were deemed objectionable by authorities, the association said, but the publisher declined to identify the articles because it was ""commercially sensitive"".
""In recent times, the Chinese government has initiated wide-ranging censorship of academic publications, in ways that have embroiled academic publishers,"" the association said.
China's foreign ministry and State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment on Monday.
In response to the association's statement, Taylor and Francis said last Thursday that it ""does not participate in censorship in China, or anywhere else"".
However, from September 83 journals were excluded from the arts, humanities and social sciences package sold to libraries in China at the request of importers, Taylor and Francis said in a statement. It did not identify the affected journals.
""Our view has always been that everyone should be able to read the research we publish via their usual access routes,"" the publisher said, adding that it was working to try to sell the entire package in China.
The censorship issue erupted in August 2017 when Britain's Cambridge University Press (CUP) removed online access to hundreds of scholarly articles in China after coming under pressure from authorities. (https://reut.rs/2rUyJ6B)
CUP reversed the decision and restored access to the articles within a few days.
Under President Xi Jinping, censorship efforts by the government have been heightened and the authority of the ruling Communist Party, as well as its views on society, history and politics, have been re-asserted over academia. 
""It seems that the Chinese censors have fully realised that they do not need to censor anything themselves,"" Nicholas Loubere, a China scholar at Lund University in Sweden, said in a tweet on Sunday.
""Rather, they can just cancel subscriptions and then let the 'Great Paywall' do the work for them,"" he said.

Maliki who now heads an Iraqi coalition called ""the State of Law"", attended a meeting last week organized by the February 14 movement, a Bahraini activist group which Manama designated a terrorist group in 2014.
""Discrimination, marginalization ... have reached a severe limit on the people of Bahrain,"" Maliki said according to videos from the event published by Iraqi media.
He was quoted as urging dialogue with those ""demanding freedom and justice"" to protect Bahrain and Bahrain's people, Sunnis and Shi'ites. 
Bahrain described Maliki's statements as ""blatant and unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of Bahrain"", state news agency (BNA) reported.
""(A Bahraini official) described Maliki’s attitude as a clear solidarity with those who seek to spread chaos, violence and terrorism and exhibit hatred,"" BNA said.
Iraq's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment but it was expected to issue a statement.
Bahrain, like Iraq, is a flashpoint for the proxy-war between the two regional arch-rivals Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran. 
The Gulf island state, where a Sunni Muslim royal family rules over a Shi’ite-majority population, has closed the main opposition groups, barred their members from running in elections and prosecuted scores of people, many described by human rights groups as activists, in mass trials.
Iraq has also struggled for years with the Sunni-Shi’ite sectarianism that followed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, ending with the disastrous war against the Islamic State militants.
Bahrain, which is home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, has seen unrest with demonstrators clashing frequently with security forces in Bahrain in recent years, and there have been several bomb attacks.

Last week's alleged radar incident joined a list of issues discussed by diplomats from the two countries at a meeting in South Korea's capital Seoul on Monday.
Relations between the two U.S. allies have soured since South Korea's top court ruled in October that a Japanese steel firm must compensate four South Koreans for their forced labor during World War Two. Japan denounced the ruling.

YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar court heard arguments on Monday in the appeal of two Reuters reporters sentenced to seven years in jail on charges of breaking the Official Secrets Act.
Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were found guilty in September after a trial at a Yangon district court in a landmark case that has raised questions about Myanmar’s progress toward democracy and sparked an outcry from diplomats and human rights advocates.
Lawyers for the reporters filed an appeal against the conviction in early November, citing evidence of a police set-up and lack of proof of a crime.
For more coverage on jailed Reuters reporters: https://reut.rs/2FuHigK
Lawyers for the reporters and the prosecution presented arguments for more than an hour on Monday before the hearing was adjourned. The court did not give a date for a decision.
Appeal lawyer L. Khun Ring Pan, asked the judge, Aung Naing, to overturn the lower court’s decision and release the reporters.
The lawyer said the lower court had wrongly placed the burden of proof on the defendants and prosecutors had failed to prove the reporters gathered and collected secret information, sent information to an enemy of Myanmar or that they had an intention to harm national security.
""According to the evidence, case files and references I have submitted, they are innocent,” L. Khun Ring Pan said.
Before their arrest, the reporters had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and Buddhist civilians in western Myanmar’s Rakhine State during an army crackdown that began in August last year. 
The operation sent more than 730,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, according to U.N. estimates.
L. Khun Ring Pan said the lower court had ignored flaws in the prosecution case, including inconsistencies regarding the reporters’ arrest. 
Police said the two were seized when they walked past a routine police traffic stop holding confidential documents.
But during eight months of hearings, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo testified that two policemen they had not met before handed them papers rolled up in a newspaper during a meeting at a Yangon restaurant on Dec. 12, 2017. 
Almost immediately afterwards, they said, they were bundled into a car by plainclothes officers and taken into detention.
""The arrest at the traffic stop is a lie. The truth is they were arrested in a set up. There cannot be legal action based on a set up,” the defense lawyer said.
'INTENTION TO HARM'
Khine Khine Soe, a legal officer representing the government, said the evidence had shown the reporters had been found to have collected and kept confidential documents.
""It was found that they had the intention to harm national security and the national interest,” Khine Khine Soe said.
The judge gave no response to the presentations.
The reporters did not appear in court. Some family members attended, along with some diplomats, including representatives of the United States, European Union, Britain and the United Nations.
The case has raised concern about the outlook for Myanmar's transition after decades of harsh military rule.
Government leader Aung San Suu Kyi said in September that the jailing of the reporters had nothing to do with freedom of expression. 
She said they had been sentenced for handling official secrets and “were not jailed because they were journalists”.
Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement before the hearing the reporters should be released.
""We will explain to the appellate judge why, under the law, the only possible conclusion is that the appellate court must restore our reporters' freedom and reaffirm Myanmar’s democratic principles,"" Adler said.
Pan Ei Mon, the wife of Wa Lone, told reporters the couple had signed their marriage certificate at the same court two years ago.

""We want justice and we hope for the best,” she said after the hearing.

A deal on a new national unity government led by Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri looked close last week when a mediation effort made headway toward resolving the last big problem, which surrounded Sunni Muslim representation.
But new complications surfaced on Saturday.
Berri told al-Akhbar: ""What happened confirms there are parties that do not want the government to be born at all.""

More than seven months since its last general election, Lebanon, heavily indebted and suffering from low economic growth, is in dire need of an administration to enact long-stalled reforms and put public debt on a sustainable footing.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2018 02:27AM ET</span>","From U.S. suburbs, 'friends of Modi' set to blitz India with calls in re-election drive","By Alexandra Ulmer
CLARKSBURG, Maryland (Reuters) - On a chilly Sunday morning in this quiet American suburb, IT consultant Madhu Bellam scoured a spreadsheet with contact details for over 1,500 Indian voters. He punched numbers into his phone and rang his hometown of Hyderabad, a tech hub in southern India about 8,800 miles away.
Bellam emigrated to the United States around two decades ago, and then renounced his Indian passport to became an American in 2011. He now runs his own tech consultancy.
But the 47 year-old, convinced that the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will unlock India's economic potential, is part of an army of activists seeking to propel Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a second term in next year's general election, due to be held by May.
""I am requesting you to vote for BJP and spread the word in the constituency,"" Bellam says in his phone calls to people in India whose numbers were provided to him by the party. He then extols Modi's policies, including his flagship ""Make in India"" plan.
Bellam and fellow BJP supporters also lobby their own networks in India, calling acquaintances, cousins and old schoolmates with the same message.
The U.S. chapter of the Overseas Friends of the BJP has some 4,000 members, although its president Krishna Reddy estimates the broader network includes up to 300,000 supporters. Many cannot travel home to vote, so ardent BJP backers are channeling their energy into phone campaigns and a blitz of social media messages to people in India. 
To be sure, this kind of campaigning may only have a modest impact on the nearly 900 million voters in India, where hot-button issues center on a lack of jobs for young people and distress in heartland farming states because of low crop prices.
Vijay Chauthaiwale, the head of the BJP's foreign affairs cell, said Modi supporters in 20 countries will be helping out in the campaign. Besides the United States, these include Britain, Canada, Australia and parts of Africa, where there are large Indian communities. 
But Indian-Americans, who number around four million, have perhaps the most influence. As one of the most educated and prosperous minorities in the United States, the community is admired in India - an asset the BJP has seized on.
""They are shocked to be getting a call from the United States,"" Bellam said of the people he phones. ""We call some rural people too. They look at us as very successful people, so that's the good thing for us to convince them. They think that we speak the truth.""
IDENTITY POLITICS
U.S.-based BJP supporters said they back Modi because they believe he is ushering in policies that will turn India, already the world's fastest-growing large economy, into a powerhouse.
But identity politics also help explain BJP success overseas. U.S.-based supporters often have roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist group that is the ideological parent of the BJP. Also helping Modi, who governed the western state of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, is the large Gujarati community in the United States.
Modi moved to the federal government after winning the general election in 2014 with a thumping majority, when he was widely supported by the Indian diaspora overseas.
Although he remains popular and is largely expected to win another five-year term, the 2019 election will likely be tougher, with some voters feeling let down by his campaign promise of ""development for all.""
But there is no indication that the enthusiasm of Modi's overseas supporters has waned. 
From his sofa in Maryland, Bellam was trying to woo voters ahead of local elections this month, in which the BJP lost control of three major heartland states to the opposition Congress party. But he and other Modi supporters already have their sights set on the general election.
U.S. supporters will likely make around 500,000 calls next year, according to Reddy, the president of the group. Members will target India's biggest states and their own hometowns, given they can campaign in the local language and have a good grasp of community issues.
Devesh Kapur, a political scientist at John Hopkins University who has written two books on Indian-Americans, said calls from the United States are unlikely to change voters' minds but they could help rally support.
""My impression is that their effect is at the margin, and more on turnout rather than changing voting preferences per se,"" said Kapur.
Amid the buzz around the BJP abroad, the Congress party, which ruled India for most of its post-independence era after 1947, is trying to drum up support from the diaspora, too.
During a tour of the United States last year, Congress president Rahul Gandhi praised emigres as the ""backbone"" of India.
For the 2019 election, members are asked to support Congress on social media and speak to friends and family back home - but not to call voters, said Sam Pitroda, the chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress Department. 
""I am not going to force you. I am not going to tell you: 'I'm great and successful, listen to me.'... How can I tell some poor little farmer that I am successful?"" said Pitroda, who was an adviser to then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in the 1980s and now lives in Chicago. 

""All you can tell them is: Do you believe in freedom? Do you believe in inclusion? Then the Congress party is the party you want to vote for.""

Rajoelina had 55.06 percent of the vote compared to 44.94 percent for Ravalomanana, the commission said after tallying results from 21,473 of 24,852 polling stations.
The two ex-presidents - Ravalomanana and the man who ousted him in a 2009 coup, Rajoelina - had previously said they would accept the results, raising hopes of a peaceful outcome and no repeat of the political chaos nearly a decade ago. 
However, Ravalomanana said on Sunday the electoral body should investigate the election. 
""Fraud and violence have prevailed and this has an impact on the results. The results of this election are not credible and the election is not transparent,"" he said in statement broadcast on Sunday.
""It is true that I said that I will respect the results if the rules are respected. Unfortunately, it is not the case,"" he said, calling on his supporters ""whose rights have been violated, to stand up and defend their choices.""
There was no immediate comment from the electoral commission which has scheduled a press conference for Monday. 
In the first round last month, Rajoelina received 39.23 percent of the vote compared to Ravalomanana's 35.35 percent.

Hery Rajaonarimampianina, who became president after Rajoelina stepped down in 2014, came a distant third.

LABUAN, Indonesia (Reuters) - The death toll from a tsunami triggered by a massive underwater landslide on an Indonesian volcano rose to 281 on Monday, as rescuers using heavy machinery and their bare hands searched through debris in the hope of finding survivors.
Indonesia's meteorological agency confirmed the collapse of part of Anak Krakatau, a volcano midway between Java and Sumatra, caused a tsunami 2-3 meters (6-10 feet) high that hit the rim of the Sunda Strait late on Saturday. 
At least 1,000 people were injured and nearly 12,000 coastal residents forcibly evacuated to higher ground, with a high-tide warning extended to Wednesday.
Anak Krakatau, which means child of Krakatau, has been spewing ash and lava for months. Sixty-four hectares (0.64 square km) of the southwest side of the volcano collapsed.
""This caused an underwater landslide and eventually caused the tsunami,"" said Dwikorita Karnawati, head of the meteorological agency.
Aid trickled in to Pandeglang, the worst-affected area on Java's west coast, and hundreds of soldiers and volunteers picked through piles of wreckage looking for bodies along a 100 km (60 mile) stretch of beach.
The vast archipelago, which sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade. Earthquakes flattened parts of the tourist island of Lombok in July and August, and a double quake-and-tsunami killed more than 2,000 people on Sulawesi island in September.
Saturday's tsunami came with almost no warning and destroyed more than 700 buildings, from small shops and houses to villas and hotels.
Disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said Indonesia had no warning system for volcanoes and underwater landslides.
President Joko Widodo visited the area on Monday and said an alert system was needed. 
""I've instructed the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency to buy a detection device or a system that would provide an early warning so that the residents can be spared,"" he told reporters. 
Several scientists said earlier the most likely cause of the tsunami was the collapse of part of the volcano.
Indonesia tsunami disaster zone: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RdjsMd
ROADS JAMMED
Families continued to stream out of the area on Monday for fear of further tsunamis, jamming roads already blocked by debris.
Britain, Australia and Canada advised nationals to monitor the situation closely and the United States embassy said it was ready to assist if needed.
The timing of the tsunami over the Christmas season evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
Witnesses recalled how a light breeze was followed by a huge wave that smashed together wooden fishing boats moored off the coast.
Dented vehicles were shunted together by a wave that carried chunks of metal, felled trees and left roof tiles, wooden beams and household items strewn across roads. Some cars ended up in rice fields.
Nurjana, 20, ran for half an hour to the mountains after the tsunami hit. Her beachside stall, where she sold snacks to tourists, was washed away.
""I opened the door straight away and saved myself. I jumped over the wall,"" she told Reuters.
""Everything is destroyed."" 
Heavy equipment was being used to help with rescue efforts. Medics were sent in with the military, while groups of police and soldiers reached remote areas.
One team of volunteers who worked on disasters in Lombok and Palu was looking for victims at Villa Stephanie, one of dozens of beachside retreats, where eight people were missing.
""It's difficult here because it's piled with debris,"" said West Jakarta Tagana chairman Muhammad Idris, who led the team.
""This year has been pretty busy. The disasters have been more severe,"" he said.
At least five bodies were found in that area on Monday. Military and other rescuers used an excavator to remove cars and debris, including piles of steel roofing tangled like spaghetti.
MASS BURIAL
The western coast of Banten province in Java, Indonesia's most populated island, was also badly hit and at least 60 people were killed in Lampung in southern Sumatra, the disaster agency said.
Authorities buried 16 bodies in a mass grave in South Lampung late on Sunday at the request of relatives, Colonel Erwin Djatmiko, a military commander there, told Reuters.
Television footage showed how the tsunami washed away an outdoor stage where Indonesian rock band Seventeen was performing for hundreds of guests at a party for utility company Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).
At least four band members and support crew were killed, lead singer Riefian ""Ifan"" Fajarsyah told followers in a tearful Instagram account. The band's drummer was among the missing.
Another 29 PLN employees and relatives were also killed.
Anak Krakatau erupted again just after 9 p.m. on Saturday and the tsunami struck 24 minutes later. Earthquake geologist Ben van der Pluijm said an underwater landslide would be ""like suddenly dropping a bag of sand in a tub filled with water"".

The eruption of Krakatau in 1883 killed more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunamis. Anak Krakatau is the island that emerged from the area in 1927 and has been growing ever since.

RABAT (Reuters) - Moroccan authorities believe four suspects in the killing of two Scandinavian women in the Atlas Mountains were acting on their own initiative, even though they had just pledged allegiance to Islamic State, an official said on Sunday.
Boubker Sabik, spokesman for the Moroccan security and domestic intelligence services, also said the arrest of nine more people in the case had foiled a terror plot.
Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway were found dead early on Monday near the village of Imlil on a route to Toubkal, North Africa’s highest peak and a popular hiking and trekking destination. 
Sabik said on the state 2M TV channel that the four suspects, aged between 25 and 33 years, had headed to the Imlil area intent on committing a crime but without selecting their target in advance.
They had pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a video made on the Friday before the bodies were found, but without agreeing this in advance with any foreign entity.
Sabik described the four as ""lone wolves"". ""The crime was not coordinated with Islamic State,"" he said. ""Lone wolves do not need permission from their leader,"" he added, without explaining how the authorities had come to their conclusions.
One of them was arrested in 2013 as part of a crackdown on individuals who wanted to join extremists abroad, he said, adding that this suspect had radicalized the other three.
However, he dismissed reports that one was a returning foreign fighter from the Middle East. All four, who originated from the outskirts of Marrakech, had only informal jobs and had a low level of education, he added.
Referring to the nine other suspects detained on Friday in various Moroccan cities, he said their arrests ""spared Morocco a terrorist plot"". 
Electronic devices, an unauthorized hunting rifles, knives and materials that could be used for bomb-making were found in the course of those raids.
Sabik gave no details of this suspected plot but said Morocco is stepping up efforts to counter security threats posed by the return of Islamic State fighters from Syria and Iraq.
So far 242 out of 1,669 Moroccans who joined the militant group had been arrested, he said. Some fighters were using false passports and trying to hide among refugees heading for Europe as the jihadists suffer setbacks in the Middle East.
Authorities were still trying to authenticate a video that has been shared on social media purporting to show the beheading of one of the victims. ""The video has no background and the clothes of the victim are not identical to those in reality,"" he said.

Compared with other countries in North Africa, Morocco has been largely insulated from militant attacks. The most recent took place in April 2011, when 17 people were killed in the bombing of a restaurant in Marrakech. In 2017 and 2018, Morocco dismantled 20 militant cells planning attacks in the country.

According to excerpts released by Buckingham Palace on Monday, the 92-year-old monarch will also speak of family and friendship following a year in which her grandson Prince Harry married U.S.-born actress Meghan Markle.
Throughout her record 66 years on the throne, the queen has avoided commenting in public on contentious international affairs or party political issues, and the excerpts make no mention of the visit in July by U.S. President Donald Trump or the turmoil over Britain's departure from the European Union.
But speaking about the birth of Jesus, she will say: ""I believe his message of peace on earth and goodwill to all is never out of date. It can be heeded by everyone; it's needed as much as ever.""
""Even with the most deeply held differences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good step toward greater understanding."" 
Before leaving Britain for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump breached British royal protocol by publicly disclosing the details of a conversation he had with the queen about the complexities of Brexit, an issue that has divided the nation.
Trump's trip to Britain was marked by public protests and downgraded from a full state visit that Prime Minister Theresa May had originally proposed.
However, he took tea with the queen at Windsor Castle. Trump later described the monarch, who has met 12 U.S. presidents, as an ""incredible woman"", who was both ""sharp"" and ""beautiful"".
She has shown little sign of slowing down in the last year, during which Harry and Meghan's wedding marked another royal step toward modernity, with a ceremony that blended ancient English ritual with African American culture.
""Through the many changes I have seen over the years, faith, family and friendship have been not only a constant for me but a source of personal comfort and reassurance,"" she will say. 
Another grandchild, Princess Eugenie, also married this year and the queen's sixth and seventh great grandchildren were born, while she made her debut appearance on the front row of a fashion show.
She also led British and Commonwealth tributes to the soldiers of the World War One on the centenary of the signing of the Armistice that ended it in 1918. 
The queen wore a cocktail dress in ivory silk with pastel blue, white and gold lame overlay designed by Angela Kelly for the broadcast, which was recorded in the White Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace.

She is spending Christmas as usual at her Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, eastern England, where she will be joined by other members of the Royal family.

Amid a heavy police presence, the protesters gathered in Omdurman, just across the River Nile from central Khartoum, and chanted, ""The people want the fall of the regime"" and ""Freedom! Freedom!"". 
About 4km (2.5 miles) from the stadium, security units, including elite forces, prevented them from crossing a bridge that leads toward the heart of the capital and the presidential palace. 
Cities across Sudan have been shaken by five days of protests over price rises, shortages of basic commodities and a cash crisis. Protesters have repeatedly targeted the offices of Bashir's party and called for an end to his 29-year rule.
Since the demonstrations started spreading on Wednesday, police have dispersed protesters with tear gas as well as using live ammunition in some cases, residents say. Authorities have declared states of emergency and curfews in several states. 
Government officials have blamed the unrest on ""infiltrators"". Officials and witnesses have recorded at least 12 deaths, though exact casualty figures are hard to ascertain.
After the soccer match on Sunday evening, security forces had cordoned off main streets around the stadium and more than 30 trucks carrying police in riot gear were spread across the area.
When the match ended, fans marched down Al Arbaeen street in Omdurman singing and chanting until they got close to the river, where they were blocked by security forces, one witness told Reuters.
""They encircled them in four-wheel drives from the back and confronted them with vehicles coming from the White Nile bridge, forcing some of the protesters to enter the military hospital,"" he said.
Earlier on Sunday in Um Rawaba in North Kordofan state, three people were wounded as police dispersed protesters, according to a witness in the southern town. 
Security forces had changed tactics by moving more quickly to break up protests as soon as they started, he said.
Bashir, one of the longest-serving leaders in African and the Arab world, took power in an Islamist and military-backed coup in 1989. 
Members of parliament this month proposed a constitutional amendment to extend term limits that would have required him to step down in 2020.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A U.N. advance team arrived in Yemen's port city of Hodeidah on Sunday to start monitoring a ceasefire and withdrawal of forces agreed by the Iranian-aligned Houthi group and Saudi-backed government forces, the United Nations said.
The warring parties in Yemen's nearly four-year war reached the deal at U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden earlier this month. The truce began on Tuesday but skirmishes continued on the outskirts of the city.
The U.N. Security Council on Friday unanimously approved the deployment - for an initial 30 days - of an advance monitoring team led by retired Dutch General Patrick Cammaert. He is chair of a Redeployment Coordination Committee (RCC) that includes representatives from both sides of the conflict. 
""General Cammaert is encouraged by the general enthusiasm of both sides to get to work, immediately. One of the priorities in the coming days will be the organization of the first joint RCC meeting, which is projected for 26 December,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.
Cammaert's team, which the United Nations has said will not be uniformed or armed, will oversee the truce and troop withdrawal from Hodeidah city and three ports.
The United Nations will also provide support for the management of and inspections at the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Issa; and strengthen its presence in the war-torn region.
Hodeidah, the main port used to feed Yemen's 30 million people, has been the focus of fighting this year, raising fears abroad that a full-scale assault could cut off supplies to nearly 16 million people suffering from severe hunger. 
The deal reached in Sweden is meant to pave the way for a wider ceasefire in the impoverished country and a second round of talks in January on a framework for political negotiations.
A Sunni Muslim Arab alliance led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates entered the war in 2015 against the Houthis to restore the internationally recognized government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which was ousted from the capital Sanaa.

The Houthis control most urban centers, including Sanaa, while Hadi's government is based in the southern port of Aden.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey began reinforcing its positions on both sides of its border with Syria on Sunday, a Reuters witness said, as Ankara and Washington agreed to coordinate a U.S. withdrawal from Syria.
The heightened military activity comes two days after President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would postpone a planned military operation on Kurdish YPG militia east of the Euphrates river in northern Syria following the U.S. decision to pull out.
He also said Turkey would take over the fight against Islamic State militants. 
The Turkish presidency said Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call on Sunday agreed to establish military and diplomatic coordination to prevent an authority vacuum from developing as the United States withdraws.
Earlier in the day, footage from broadcaster TRT World showed some Turkish convoys entering Syria via the Turkish border town of Karkamis, which is located some 35 km (22 miles) north of the northern Syrian town of Manbij. 
The convoys are crossing into an area controlled by the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a Turkish ally, and are heading to the frontlines of Manbij, TRT World said.
Manbij has been a major flashpoint between Ankara and Washington. In June, the NATO allies reached an agreement that would see the YPG ousted from the town but Turkey has complained the roadmap has been delayed and said Turkish forces would enter the town if the United States does not remove the Kurdish militants.
The YPG has been a main U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State. Ankara says the militia is a terrorist organization and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency in Turkey since the 1980s.
HUNDREDS OF VEHICLES
A Reuters witness saw hundreds of vehicles head to the southern border province of Kilis after leaving Hatay, another border province, around 0030 GMT on Sunday, as citizens sounded their horns to celebrate. The convoy included tanks, howitzers, machine guns and buses carrying commandos, the witness said. 
Part of the military equipment and personnel are to be positioned in posts along the border while some had crossed into Syria via the district of Elbeyli situated some 45 km (28 miles) northwest of Manbij, Demiroren News Agency (DHA) reported.
Reuters could not independently verify the reason for the reinforcements and Turkish officials were not immediately available for comment.
Turkey, with support from the FSA, carried out two cross-border operations in northern Syria, dubbed ""Euphrates Shield"" and ""Olive Branch"", against the YPG and Islamic State. 

The military offensives were focused on areas to the west of the Euphrates and Turkey has not gone east of the river, partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces. The operations carved out de facto buffer zones, which are currently under the control of Turkey and the FSA.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh said on Sunday it had approved 175 foreign observers for next weekend's national election, dismissing U.S. criticism for failing to secure accreditation for a U.S funded monitor.
Past elections have been chaotic and sometimes violent. International observers shunned the last vote in 2014 that was boycotted by the main opposition party as there was no caretaker administration to oversee the process.
The U.S. State Department said on Friday it was disappointed by Bangladesh's ""inability to grant credentials and issue visas within the timeframe necessary"" for the majority of international election monitors from the Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL), which is funded by the U.S. government.
ANFREL, which has operated in 57 election observation missions across Asia since 1997, said it had terminated its observer mission on Saturday due to ""significant delays in the accreditation approval by the Bangladesh Election Commission and visa approvals by the (foreign ministry)"".
""With ANFREL’s withdrawal, the organization registers its doubts regarding the integrity of the elections, especially with the reports on civil society restrictions and arrest of numerous opposition members,"" it said on its website on Sunday.
Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ANFREL canceled its observation mission itself while the approval process was under way, adding it was ""disheartened"" by the State Department's statement.
It said it welcomed international monitors for next Sunday's election that would be held in a ""festive atmosphere"".
""As of now, 175 foreign election observers from different countries and organizations have been accredited to undertake election monitoring missions,"" the ministry said. It gave no details which countries the monitors would come from.
The Election Commission could not immediately be reached for comment outside regular business hours.
Activists and supporters of the two main parties, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ruling Awami League and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), regularly engage in violence around elections in the country of 165 million people, sometimes disrupting its multi-billion-dollar garments industry.
Apart from the foreign observers, the Election Commission had registered 118 local bodies to monitor the polls, the ministry said.
Tens of thousands of armed forces personnel will from Monday fan out across the country to support police as preparations for the vote heats up, a move that has cheered the opposition front that includes the BNP, who envisage greater protection for them.

""We hope that this deployment will create a congenial electoral environment which was not existing before. Armed forces must create a level playing field for all parties and play a positive role,"" said Kamal Hossain, the convener of National Unity Front, part of the opposition grouping.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2018 09:23AM ET</span>",Afghan President names two former spy chiefs to key posts,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani named two former heads of the intelligence services to key security posts in his government on Sunday in a step that could affect both next year's presidential election and moves toward peace with the Taliban.
Asadullah Khalid, who suffered horrific injuries in a Taliban suicide attack shortly after taking over the National Directorate for Security in 2012, was named as acting defense minister. Amrullah Saleh, who served as NDS chief until 2008, was appointed acting interior minister.
Both men, veterans of decades of conflict in Afghanistan, have been uncompromising opponents of the Taliban and of Pakistan, which they accuse of supporting the insurgency, but both have also been at times strongly critical of Ghani.
The appointments come at a critical time, with elections due in April and talks between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives over a possible peace deal expected to continue in January following three meetings this year. 
Ghani is expected to run for a second five-year term, and the future of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan is unclear following Khalilzad's meetings and last week's surprise U.S. announcement of plans to withdraw almost half of its forces.
The appointments have fueled accusations that Ghani, sidelined from the talks by the Taliban's refusal to deal with his government, was trying to neutralize potential opponents by bringing them onto his side ahead of the election.
Afghan politics, lacking strong political parties, is dominated by ethnic loyalties, personal alliances and often unstable coalitions between powerful regional leaders.
Ghani, an ethnic Pashtun like almost all Afghan heads of state, has no strong local power base of his own but has been adroit at building alliances with regional strongmen who have exchanged their support for influence in national politics.
Both Khalid, a Pashtun who founded his own political movement this year, and Saleh, an influential figure in the ethnic Tajik political world, had been expected to be on opposing sides to Ghani in the election.
But their unrelenting hostility to the Taliban and Pakistan may complicate efforts to reach a peaceful settlement to end 17 years of war in Afghanistan.
""It hurts the whole peace process and makes it difficult to convince the Taliban to negotiate with the government,"" said one senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Khalid, who recovered from his wounds after two years in the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington, has faced strong criticism from human rights groups over allegations of torture and running private prisons, which he denies.
When he was nominated as head of the NDS in 2012, Amnesty International said there were numerous reports he was involved in torture and unlawful killings, particularly while serving as provincial governor in Kandahar and Ghazni.

Saleh, who started his career as intelligence chief for the former anti-Soviet Mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, served as head of the NDS under former President Hamid Karzai.

LONDON (Reuters) - British police on Sunday released without charge two people arrested in an inquiry into the illegal use of drones at London's Gatwick Airport that crippled operations for three days last week.
Sussex Police arrested a 47-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman from the local area late on Friday after drones were flown onto the airfield between Wednesday and Friday, forcing about 1,000 flights to be diverted or canceled and affecting 140,000 passengers.
""Both people have fully co-operated with our inquiries, and I am satisfied that they are no longer suspects in the drone incidents at Gatwick,"" Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Tingley said on Sunday.
The two were held after information was passed to the police by a member of the public, Tingley told Sky News. He said he was confident the arrests were justified.
He said authorities were continuing to actively follow lines of investigation to catch those responsible for the most disruptive incursions from unmanned aerial vehicles seen at any major airport.
A damaged drone had been recovered a close to the perimeter of the airport, he said, and it was being forensically examined, for example for clues about whether it was controlled remotely from afar or by somebody in the vicinity.
No group has claimed responsibility for the disruption.
""We have kept an open mind throughout and that is still the case with regards to the motivation behind these incidents,"" he said.
The drones were spotted at Britain's second-largest airport on Wednesday evening, forcing it to close its runway in the run up to Christmas. Every time the airport sought to reopen the runway on Thursday, the drones returned.
Authorities finally regained control over the airfield after the army deployed unidentified military technology to guard the area, reassuring the airport that it was safe enough to fly.
The drones caused misery for travelers, many sleeping on the airport floor as they searched for alternative routes to holidays and Christmas family gatherings.
Airlines operating at Gatwick, which is located south of London, include easyJet (L:EZJ), British Airways (L:ICAG) and Norwegian (OL:NWC).
The airport said on Sunday it was offering a reward of 50,000 pounds ($63,275) for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.

It said it was expecting to operate a full schedule of 785 flights on Sunday, although a small number of delays and cancellations could occur as the airport fully recovered.

PANDEGLANG, Indonesia (Reuters) - A tsunami killed at least 222 people and injured hundreds on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra following an underwater landslide believed to have been caused by the erupting Anak Krakatau volcano, officials said on Sunday.
Hundreds of homes and other buildings were ""heavily damaged"" when the tsunami struck, almost without warning, along the rim of the Sunda Strait late on Saturday, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said.
Thousands of residents were forced to evacuate to higher ground. By 5:40 p.m. (1040 GMT), the disaster agency had raised the death toll to 222, with 843 injured and 28 missing.
It has been a torrid year for the vast archipelago that sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire. Successive earthquakes flattened parts of the tourist island of Lombok in July and August, and a double quake-and-tsunami killed more than 2,000 people on Sulawesi island in September.
As night fell on Sunday, rescue efforts continued but workers and ambulances were finding it difficult to reach affected areas because some roads were blocked by debris from damaged houses, overturned cars and fallen trees.
TV images showed the seconds when the tsunami hit the beach and residential areas in Pandeglang on Java island, dragging with it victims, debris, and large chunks of wood and metal.
Coastal residents reported not seeing or feeling any warning signs on Saturday night, such as receding water or an earthquake, before waves of 2-3 meters (6-10 feet) washed ashore, according to media.
Authorities said a warning siren went off in some areas.
The timing of the tsunami, over the Christmas holiday season, evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26 in 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. 
Øystein Lund Andersen, a Norwegian holidaymaker, was in Anyer town with his family when Saturday's tsunami struck. 
""I had to run, as the wave passed the beach and landed 15-20 meters inland. Next wave entered the hotel area where I was staying and downed cars on the road behind it,"" he said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""Managed to evacuate with my family to higher ground through forest paths and villages, where we are taken care of by the locals.""

EVACUATION WARNING
Authorities warned residents and tourists in coastal areas around the Sunda Strait to stay away from beaches and a high-tide warning remained in place through until Dec. 25 as officials tried to determine the exact cause of the disaster. 
""Those who have evacuated, please do not return yet,"" said Rahmat Triyono, an official at the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG).
President Joko Widodo, who is running for re-election in April, said on Twitter that he had ""ordered all relevant government agencies to immediately take emergency response steps, find victims and care for the injured"". 
Vice President Jusuf Kalla told a news conference the death toll would ""likely increase"".
The western coast of Banten province in Java, Indonesia's most populated island, was the worst-hit area, Nugroho told reporters in Yogyakarta. He also said at least 35 people were reported dead in Lampung in southern Sumatra.
The Red Cross send out equipment and aid from its regional warehouse in Banten including water, tarpaulins, shovels and axes, as well as hygiene kits, it said in a statement.
""WASHED AWAY""
Television footage showed the seconds when the tsunami washed away an outdoor stage where a local rock band was performing for hundreds of guests at an end-of-year party for state utility company PLN. 
Four of the musicians from the band, Seventeen, were killed, along with 29 PLN employees and relatives. 
""The water washed away the stage which was located very close to the sea,"" the band said in a statement. ""The water rose and dragged away everyone at the location. We have lost loved ones, including our bassist and manager ... and others are missing.""
Police officers rescued a young boy who was trapped in a car buried under fallen trees and rubble for nearly 12 hours, according to a video of his rescue posted on Twitter by the Indonesian National Police.
The tsunami was caused by ""an undersea landslide resulting from volcanic activity on Anak Krakatau"" and was exacerbated by abnormally high tide because of the full moon, Nugroho said.
Anak Krakatau, an active volcano roughly halfway between Java and Sumatra, has been spewing ash and lava for months. It erupted again just after 9 p.m. on Saturday and the tsunami struck at around 9.30 p.m., according to BMKG.
Ben van der Pluijm, an earthquake geologist and a professor in the University of Michigan, said the tsunami may have been caused by a ""partial collapse"" of Anak Krakatau.
""Instability of the slope of an active volcano can create a rock slide that moves a large volume of water, creating local tsunami waves that can be very powerful. This is like suddenly dropping a bag of sand in a tub filled with water,"" he said.
The eruption of Krakatau, previously known as Krakatoa, in 1883 killed more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunamis. 

Anak Krakatau, which means child of Krakatau, is the island that emerged from the area once occupied by Krakatau, which was destroyed in 1883. It first appeared in 1927 and has been growing ever since.

Egypt's military and intelligence services play a leading role in top level decision making, taking a more public role since current president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the 2013 military overthrow of Egypt's first freely-elected president, Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood.
The sources did not give a reason for al-Shahat's dismissal, but Sisi has replaced several high-ranking security officials in the military, interior ministry and the general intelligence service over the last couple of years.
Sisi appointed close ally Major General Abbas Kamel to serve as chief of the country's General Intelligence Service in June, two weeks after replacing the defense and interior ministers.
Megawer previously served as deputy head of the military intelligence body, Commander of the Second Field Army and Defense Attaché at the Egyptian embassy in Washington.

The workers were trapped underground by smoke after a fire broke out in the mine in Solikamsk, some 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Moscow, on Saturday morning.
The fire, which broke out in a section of the mine that was under construction, has yet to be fully extinguished, Interfax reported.
Rescuers were working to recover the bodies from a depth of more than 360 meters, the agency said. 
Russia's Investigative Committee, the state body that investigates major crimes, opened a criminal case over the possible violation of safety rules, it said on its website.
Russia's mining industry has been plagued by accidents for years. In February 2016, 36 miners and rescue workers died in a coal mine above the Arctic circle.

YANGON (Reuters) - The body of a missing Myanmar policeman was found on the country's troubled border with Bangladesh, state media and officials said on Sunday after a clash with unknown gunmen last week.
Private Aung Kyaw Thet had been missing since his patrol was fired on from the Bangladesh side of the border on Dec. 17, according to the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar. 
His body was found on Friday with ""gunshot wounds in his face, arm and leg,"" the newspaper said, adding that another policeman was wounded in the incident.
The newspaper said the clash occurred in a rugged section of the border in Maungdaw township, the epicenter of violence in August 2017 that drove more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims out of Myanmar and into Bangladesh.
Myanmar's military had responded to attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group with a campaign that U.N.-mandated investigators said involved killings, rape and arson carried out with ""genocidal intent"" against the wider Rohingya population.
Major Mohammad Iqbal of the Bangladesh border guards said his men were not involved in the Dec. 17 incident, but they had heard the exchange of gunfire on the border. 
Bangladeshi guards joined a patrol with their Myanmar counterparts to investigate, he said, adding that Aung Kyaw Thet's body was found on Friday. 
Lt. Colonel Tin Han Linn, of Myanmar's Border Guard Police in Maungdaw, said they knew the location of the body several days before it was recovered on Friday, but had to arrange a joint Myanmar-Bangladesh team to retrieve the corpse.
The identity of the attackers was unknown and police are still investigating, he told Reuters.
The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), a group claiming to represent the Rohingya, launched the August 2017 attacks on more than two dozen security posts, killing 13 members of Myanmar's security forces.
ARSA ""continues to have a prominent presence"" in the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh and could launch cross-border raids on Myanmar forces, the International Crisis Group said in a November report on the proposed repatriation of Rohingya refugees.
Fighting between the Myanmar army and the Arakan Army - a group that says it fights for the Rakhine Buddhist ethnic group - has flared this month in areas of northern Rakhine state further from the Bangladesh border, displacing more than 700 people.

TOKYO (Reuters) - More than 82,000 well-wishers paid their respects to Emperor Akihito who turned 85 on Sunday, his last birthday celebration at Tokyo's Imperial Palace before stepping down next year.
The birthday of the emperor, whose position is ceremonial with no political power, is traditionally marked by a national holiday and an address at the palace, which opens to the public on the day.
The crowd of 82,850, according to the Imperial Household Agency, was the largest birthday attendance during Akihito's three-decade reign, known as the ""Heisei"" era, which means ""achieving peace"" in Japanese.
Akihito - flanked by his wife, eldest son Naruhito and other members of the imperial family on a balcony - addressed well-wishers waving small Japanese flags and holding up smartphones.
""My thoughts go out to those who have lost family members or those close to them, or have suffered damage and whose lives are currently impaired,"" he said, referring to the natural disasters that hit Japan in the past year.
Earthquakes, severe storms and heatwaves killed hundreds of people, destroyed homes and disrupted supply chains, clouding the outlook for Japan's export-reliant economy. 
Along with Empress Michiko, Akihito has spent much of his reign addressing the legacy of World War Two, which was fought in the name of his father, Hirohito, and consoling victims of natural disasters.
""I would like to thank him for standing by us, the Japanese people, and would like him to rest and enjoy his time from now on,"" said 46-year-old Kazuyo Toyama from Nagoya. 
Akihito, who has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer, is scheduled to step down on April 30, passing the Chrysanthemum Throne to 58-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito.
The last time a Japanese emperor abdicated was in 1817.
Although he cannot directly influence government policy, Akihito has created a broader consciousness of Japan's wartime past throughout his symbolic reign, experts said.
In comments made to the media ahead of his birthday, Akihito said ""it is important not to forget that countless lives were lost in World War Two...and to pass on this history accurately to those born after the war"".
His conciliatory stance contrasts with gestures made by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has adopted a less apologetic tone over Japan's past military aggression.
Akihito also referred to foreign workers, saying he hoped that ""the Japanese people will be able to warmly welcome as members of our society those who come to Japan to work"".

Japan enacted a law this month to let in more foreign, blue-collar workers to ease a labor shortage, despite criticism it was too hastily crafted and risked exposing the workers to exploitation.

(Reuters) - A New Jersey high school referee was suspended after a video showed a black wrestler being forced to have his hair cut before a bout after being told he would have to forfeit the match if he refused, according to state athletic officials on Saturday.
The video, which was uploaded on Twitter on Thursday by a reporter from SNJ Today newspaper, showed Andrew Johnson of Buena Regional High School in Buena, New Jersey, getting his dreadlocks hairstyle cut off by a school official. Moments later, Johnson, who is black, won his match against his opponent.
A referee named Alan Maloney, who is white, apparently had ordered Johnson to cut off his hair, according to local media reports. The clip went viral on Friday, with many social media users condemning the school for allowing Maloney to make the order, calling it racist and discriminatory.
""Deeply disturbed that Andrew Johnson, a student at Buena Regional H.S., was forced to choose between keeping his dreadlocks and competing in a wrestling tournament,"" wrote New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, a democrat, on Twitter. ""No student should have to needlessly choose between his or her identity & playing sports.""
Larry White, the executive director of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA), said the incident would be investigated by the New Jersey Civil Rights division and the referee would not be assigned to future high school wrestling events in New Jersey until the review is complete. 
""NJSIAA can confirm that those groups that assign high school wrestling referees in New Jersey will not assign the referee in question until this matter has been thoroughly reviewed,"" White said in a statement on Saturday. ""This will help to avoid disruption of events for student athletes."" 
A representative from the New Jersey Civil Rights division did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Jordan Burroughs, an Olympic champion wrestler, commended Johnson on Twitter for cutting his hair to win the match for his team, but expressed his anger over the referee's order, calling it sickening, racist and an abuse of power.
Maloney had come under fire in 2016 after he was accused of using a racial slur against a black referee, according to the Courier Post newspaper. Maloney told the paper that he did not remember using the word. 
Maloney could not immediately be reached for comment.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban lawmakers on Saturday unanimously approved a revised draft of a new constitution that retains the island's one-party socialist system but reflects its socio-economic opening since the fall of the Soviet Union.
The draft new constitution, which has 229 articles and will replace a Cold War era one, will maintain the Communist Party as the country's guiding force and the state's dominance of the economy, according to state-run media. A copy has not yet been distributed to the public.
The document, however also, legitimizes private business that has blossomed over the last decade, acknowledges the importance of foreign investment and opens the door to gay marriage, according to state-run media.
It imposes age and term limits on the presidency, after late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and his younger brother Raul Castro ruled the country for nearly six decades, and introduces the role of a prime minister.
The current draft incorporates into an original one published in July hundreds of mainly small changes proposed by citizens during a three-month public consultation at community meetings nationwide. It will go to a referendum next Feb. 24.
""This process is a genuine and exceptional demonstration of the practice of power by the people and therefore of the markedly participative and democratic nature of our political system,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel told the national assembly in a speech closing its week-long, twice-yearly session.
The 58-year-old took office from his mentor Raul Castro in April although the latter remains head of the Communist Party until 2021.
Critics say the fundamentals of Cuba's system were never up for discussion and the government only included suggestions it wanted to.
Some, including opposition groups that typically do not mobilize many people, are already campaigning against the constitution online using the hashtag #yovotono (""I vote no"").
One of the articles revised regards the accumulation of property. Whereas the first draft originally banned this, the revised constitution simply stipulates that the state must regulate it, according to state-run media.
However the latest draft also reinserts the aim of ""advancing toward communism"" that was taken out of the first draft. 
One controversial revision is the elimination of an article that recognized matrimony as the union of two persons as opposed to the union between a man and a woman as in the 1976 constitution.
That article was the one that sparked the most controversy in a society that has made great strides in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in recent years but remains conservative on the topic.
The new draft removes the definition of marriage altogether thus still opening the door to same-sex union albeit not giving it the same symbolic level of backing. 
The government has said instead it will update the family code and put it to a referendum in the next two years.
""There is no setback,"" wrote Mariela Castro, the daughter of Raul Castro, who has championed LGBT rights in Cuba in recent years, on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""The fight continues, let's give a 'yes' to the constitution and then close ranks to achieve a family code as advanced as the new constitutional text.""
She asked for permission to briefly interrupt the assembly meet on Saturday to hug her father in an unusual public display of affection within the Castro family, thanking him for his example ""as a parent and as a revolutionary"", sparking applause.
Still, the decision to put the family code to a referendum has angered Cuban intellectuals who say fundamental human rights should not be put up for vote. Other laws have not been put to a referendum.

""Equal rights to marriage in Cuba should be a presidential decree, not a referendum that exonerates the state from responsibility and opens the door to conservative homophobia,"" said Harold Cardenas, a professor of Marxism and blogger.

LONDON (Reuters) - Paddy Ashdown, the face of centrist politics in Britain for more than a decade and a one-time marine commando who sought to secure peace in the former Yugoslavia, died on Saturday after being treated for cancer. He was 77.
Ashdown led the Liberal Democrats for 11 years up to 1999, steering it to become a campaigning force in British politics against the Conservatives and the Labour Party.
The party said Ashdown died on Saturday evening after a short illness. He had recently been hospitalized with bladder cancer.
It said he would be remembered as someone who made an immeasurable contribution to furthering the cause of liberalism.
Tributes came in from across the political spectrum. Prime Minister Theresa May said Ashdown served his country with distinction. ""He dedicated his life to public service and he will be sorely missed,"" she said in a statement. 
Calling Ashdown a ""true patriot"", former Conservative Prime Minister John Major said: ""In Government, Paddy Ashdown was my opponent. In Life, he was a much valued friend."" 
Jeremy John Ashdown was born in India on Feb. 27, 1941, the eldest son of an Indian army colonel. When he was five, his father became a pig-farmer in Northern Ireland.
He was educated at an English private school where he earned the nickname Paddy because of his strong Irish accent.
He spent years in the Royal Marines, and was on active service as a commando in the jungles of Borneo. He entered parliament in 1983 and was virtually unknown when he became leader of the pro-European party five years later. 
However his craggy good looks - he had short sandy hair - and an earnest expression swiftly helped him to become one of his country's most popular leaders and for a time the ""Mr Clean"" of British politics.
He also gained in stature during the 1991 Gulf War, which allowed him to display his military experience and diplomatic skills.
Ashdown's image as a family man above the sniping of mainstream politics took a hit in February 1992 when he was forced to admit to a brief extra-marital affair with his secretary.
Having stood down in 1999, he went on to become the United Nations high representative and European Union special representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ashdown described himself as having few gifts other than strong willpower.
""People said I couldn't learn Chinese, they said I couldn't run 30 miles in six hours. This sounds extraordinarily arrogant but I can't remember a thing upon which I've set my mind that I didn't succeed in doing,"" he said in early 1992.
He was replaced as head of the party by Charles Kennedy who enjoyed further electoral success when he opposed Blair's decision to invade Iraq, and the party under Nick Clegg entered power in a coalition David Cameron's Conservatives in 2010. 
It has since been decimated at the polls. 
Ashdown, the author of several books, had two children with his wife, Jane.

He had in recent years campaigned alongside Cameron and other leaders for Britain to remain within the European Union. He warned that chaos could ensue if it voted to leave and described Brexit as ""a sense of personal bereavement"".

A video of the multi-instrumentalist and university lecturer taken during the six-hour surgery for a brain tumor, shows him lying on his back in the operating theater, surrounded by scrubbed-up medical staff, plucking the strings of his guitar.
This allowed doctors in the South African city of Durban to observe which areas of his brain Manzini used to play music, allowing them to preserve those areas and also restore some movement to his fingers, which were affected by the tumor. 
""I felt very awkward and uncomfortable,"" Manzini told Reuters a week after the operation. ""Being in between general anesthesia and awake and hearing the sounds of a blow torch inside your brain...it's very difficult to concentrate."" 
Doctors opted to keep Manzini awake in order to assess which areas of his brain were functioning as the surgery went on, helping to reduce the risk of neurological damage.
""It was a success in that the biggest risk was paralysis. I'm not paralyzed, and I still have control of my limbs and thus in good spirits and recovering nicely,"" he said.
Once fully recovered, Manzini intends to take to the stage again, he said.

One lawmaker defected from Granger's APNU-AFC coalition, which had a one-seat majority, and sided with an opposition-led motion to cut short his term that would have ended in 2020. The Guyanese parliament had never before called a no-confidence vote.
The opposition called the no-confidence motion claiming mismanagement of the country's oil resources.

Freeland spoke a day after the United States joined Canada in calling on Beijing to release the pair, who were held after Canadian authorities arrested a senior Chinese executive on a U.S. extradition warrant.
""I will continue in the coming days, along with Canada's ambassadors around the world, to be speaking with foreign counterparts about this issue,"" Freeland told reporters on a conference call.
""Our ambassadors ... will be speaking directly in an organized effort with their counterparts.""
As well as the United States, Britain and the European Union have also expressed support for Canada.
Freeland said Chinese authorities had not drawn a direct connection between the detention of the two men and Canada's move to arrest Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Dec. 1.
Canadian analysts and former diplomats said they have no doubt the cases are linked.
""One point we have been raising with our allies ... is the concern about the worrying precedent that the arbitrary detention of these two Canadians sets. That's a point that has really resonated,"" said Freeland.
Sources have told Reuters that Michael Kovrig, one of the two men, was not allowed to see a lawyer. He is being questioned every morning, afternoon and evening and is not allowed to turn the lights off at night.
Freeland said she had raised the conditions of the two men's detention when she spoke to China's ambassador to Canada on Friday but did not give details of the conversation.
""We continue to be in discussion with China ... this is clearly a difficult moment in our relationship with China, it's important to keep on talking and raising the issues directly with them,"" she said.

The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The senior member of the al-Saud family, father of billionaire investor Alwaleed bin Talal, had been ill for several years.
Prince Talal lived in exile abroad in the 1960s, when Saudi authorities revoked his passport after he led a group of princes demanding constitutional reforms and allied himself with then Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, the arch-foe of the Saudi monarchy.
Prince Talal returned to the kingdom after Faisal bin Abdulaziz al-Saud become king in 1964, and after toning down his rhetoric.
In 2011 he resigned from the Allegiance Council, the body responsible for overseeing the royal succession in the world’s top oil exporter.
He also supported moves to give Saudi women greater rights to work and allow them to drive, and limit Riyadh's substantial military spending.
The royal court said funeral prayers would be said for the prince in Riyadh on Sunday. Prince Talal had been hospitalized in Riyadh though it was not clear where he died.

TOULOUSE/PARIS, France (Reuters) - France's anti-government ""yellow vest"" protest was losing steam on Saturday but caused traffic disruption through road blocks across the country, leading to the death of a 10th person since the start of the movement last month. 
The turnout on the streets of Paris and other cities was smaller than in previous weekends, authorities said. No major damage or clashes had been reported between police and protesters as of mid-afternoon. 
About 23,800 people were demonstrating at 1300 GMT, including fewer than 1,000 in Paris, the interior ministry said. This was down from a week ago at the same time when there were 33,500 protesters out on the streets, 2,200 of which were in Paris. 
Authorities had expected a march in Versailles, whose castle is a symbol of French state power and one of Europe's top tourist attractions.
But few ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) protesters - so-called after the high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their cars - showed up in the formal royal city.
Dispersed groups of protesters were out on the streets of Paris near tourist landmarks such as the Sacre Coeur Basilica and the Galeries Lafayette department stores, singing La Marseillaise and calling for President Emmanuel Macron's resignation.
Attendance was on the rise, however, in Lyon and Bordeaux, according to Reuters witnesses. Protesters also managed to block some of the big highways, including one leading to Spain. 
Late on Friday, a 36-year-old man died in Perpignan, southern France, when his car hit a truck at a road block erected by protesters, raising the death toll linked to the demonstrations to 10.
On Saturday, police fired tear gas against protesters who gathered near Macron's villa in the chic resort of Le Touquet in northern France. 
ROAD ACCIDENTS
In the French capital, the police arrested 109 protesters, seven of whom were held in custody. 
Three weeks ago the protests in Paris turned into some of the worst unrest seen in the capital since the student-led civil unrest of 1968. Cars were set on fire, bank and insurance offices' windows smashed and street furniture was vandalized. 
Of the ten deaths linked to the protests, most have been the result of road accidents.
The ""yellow vest"" protesters began in mid-November to rally against fuel tax increases and subsequently against the wider liberal economic reform policy of Macron, who made tax and salary concessions earlier this month.
But the movement has gradually lost steam in recent weeks.
Since he caved in to protesters in a TV address on Dec 10, Macron, who turned 41 on Friday, has largely kept out of the public eye, staying inside the Elysee palace for what his press team called internal meetings.
A recent poll showed France's far-right party National Rally, formerly known as the National Front, confirmed it was so far the biggest political beneficiary of the protests.

731,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2018 12:55PM ET</span>",Nicaraguan police raid news network critical of Ortega,"MANAGUA (Reuters) - Nicaraguan police raided the offices of a major broadcaster and arrested its director late on Friday, family members and co-workers said, in the latest crackdown on critics of President Daniel Ortega's increasingly authoritarian government.
The broadcaster, 100% Noticias, was the only independent 24-hour news network that covered the country's deepening political unrest, one of its worst crises since a civil war in the 1980s. 
The government has sought to rein in months of protests seeking Ortega's ouster. 
The director of 100% Noticias, Miguel Mora, had taken refuge in the broadcaster's offices for the past three weeks, citing threats he said he received from Ortega's government. 
""They can do everything they want to me, imprison me, kidnap me, but we'll be here until the final consequences,"" Mora told Reuters on Thursday during an interview at his office.
Nicaraguan prosecutors have accused Mora of instigating hate, among other crimes, which prompted a judge to order the closure of 100% Noticias and Mora's arrest.
A government spokesman declined to comment on Saturday. 
Ortega's government had already sought to stop critical coverage by ordering cable and satellite television providers to suspend the 100% Noticias signal, as well as raiding other outlets and cutting their ability to broadcast.
Last week, police raided the offices of Carlos Fernando Chamorro, the son of former president Violeta Chamorro, who runs the digital newspaper Confidencial and hosts television news programs. Chamorro blamed the raid and seizure of equipment on Ortega's efforts to purge the country of dissent.
Since April, at least 322 people have been killed and more than 500 have been incarcerated, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, a group now blacklisted by the government.
On Wednesday the government expelled two missions of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that were investigating violence during anti-government protests. 
Authorities also seized the assets of 10 blacklisted non-governmental organizations, blocking them from operating and dealing another blow to civil society.
Pro-government lawmakers accuse the organizations of receiving money to finance a ""coup."" 
Ortega's opponents accuse the veteran leftist of attempting to cement an authoritarian family dynasty along with his wife, Rosario Murillo, whom he chose to be his vice president.

More than seven months since its last general election, Lebanon, heavily indebted and suffering from low economic growth, is in dire need of an administration to enact long-stalled reforms and put public debt on a sustainable footing.
A deal on a new government led by Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri looked close earlier this week when a mediation effort made headway towards resolving the last big problem, which surrounded Sunni Muslim representation.
Hariri, Lebanon's leading Sunni politician, said on Friday he hoped to finalize the cabinet later that day. The cabinet seats must parceled out among rival groups according to a finely balanced sectarian system.
""A number of obstacles have appeared in the last hours that led to delaying the government. The obstacles include the problem of Sunni representation and the problem of portfolio distribution,"" the official said.
The official did not give an estimate as to when the problems would be resolved.
More contacts are expected on Sunday.
The dispute over Sunni representation emerged as a group of Sunni MPs allied to the Shi'ite group Hezbollah said they must be allocated a seat in cabinet to reflect their election gains and Hariri resisted their demand.
Under the compromise solution, the six pro-Hezbollah Sunnis agreed to be represented in cabinet by another figure acceptable to them, with each of the six submitting a name from which President Michel Aoun would pick one.
But on Saturday, the pro-Hezbollah Sunni MPs withdrew their support for the Sunni candidate picked by Aoun - Jawad Adra - because he ""did not consider himself an exclusive representative"" of the six Sunni MPs.
Fresh disputes have also arisen over precisely which portfolios should go to which factions. The portfolios in question are seen as of secondary significance, the official said, with the most powerful ministries already allocated.
The May 6 national election, Lebanon’s first in nine years, produced a parliament tilted in favor of the heavily armed, Iran-backed Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah, which together with its political allies won more than 70 of the 128 seats.
Hariri, who enjoys Western backing, lost more than one third of his lawmakers, though he remained Lebanon’s biggest Sunni Muslim leader and as such was nominated again as prime minister.

Uralkali, one of world's largest potash producers, said a rescue operation got underway after an incident just after 10 am (0700 GMT) at a mine in Solikamsk, some 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Moscow.
The Investigative Committee, the state body that investigates major crimes, said eight miners had managed to escape but nine remained unaccounted for.
""There is no contact with those who had stayed underground,"" it said in a statement.
The committee said it has opened up a criminal case ""as there were enough grounds to believe that the people, who are in the area of the smoke, have died"".
The Russian mining industry has been plagued by the accidents for years. In February 2016, 36 miners and rescue workers died in a coal mine above the Arctic circle.

The government released the statement following talks in Tripoli between Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
The statement quoted Cavusoglu as saying Ankara rejected such actions ""which do not represent the policy or approach of the Turkish state"". 
The weapons were seized by customs on Tuesday in Khoms port, just over 100 km (62 miles) east of Tripoli.
The consignment sent from Turkey contained 3,000 Turkish-made pistols, as well as some other pistols, hunting rifles and ammunition, Benghazi's Benina airport customs services said on their official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account.
A day earlier a cargo of 2.5 million Turkish-made bullets was seized at the same port, the same source said.
The UN mission in Libya has condemned the shipment of arms to Libya as ""extremely disconcerting.""
The UN last June extended an arms embargo on Libya for another year.
The oil-rich country plunged into chaos nearly eight years after a NATO-backed uprising that toppled former Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi. 
The country has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since 2014, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudanese authorities arrested 14 leaders of an opposition coalition on Saturday, a spokesman for the grouping said, as anti-government protests driven by an economic crisis continued for a fourth day in several cities.
Farouk Abu Issa, the 85-year-old head of the National Consensus Forces, one of the country's two main opposition groupings, was among those detained after an opposition meeting in the capital Khartoum, said spokesman Sadiq Youssef.
""We demand their immediate release, and their arrest is an attempt by the regime to stop the street movements,"" Youssef said, adding that Abu Issa was in poor health and had been transferred to hospital after his detention.
Officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
The arrests came on the fourth day of demonstrations, fueled by deteriorating economic conditions in cities across Sudan, in which protesters have voiced anger over corruption and some have called for an end to President Omar al-Bashir's rule.
On Saturday, students protesting in the city of al-Rahad set fire to the ruling party's office and other official buildings and briefly closed the main road to the capital Khartoum, about 370km (230 miles) to the north east, witnesses said. 
Police used teargas to disperse protesters, witnesses said. Protesters also gathered in several eastern neighborhoods of Khartoum and in the southern city of Madani, witnesses said.
Faisal Hassan Ibrahim, an assistant to Bashir and deputy head of the ruling party, said the protests were ""coordinated and organized"" and that two of those killed in demonstrations in the city of al-Qadarif were from the armed forces.
""Now the Sudanese armed forces are guarding strategic locations in all Sudanese regions,"" he added. 
At least nine people have been killed in protests this week, according to officials and witnesses, though casualty numbers are hard to confirm. 
Internet service has slowed and activists have accused the government of blocking social media to stop protesters communicating. Authorities have blamed the protests on ""infiltrators"".
Bashir, one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, took power in an Islamist and military-backed coup in 1989. Lawmakers this month proposed a constitutional amendment to extend term limits that would have required him to step down in 2020.
Sadiq al-Mahdi, leader of the opposition Umma party who returned to Sudan this week from nearly a year in self-imposed exile, backed the protests, saying they would ""continue because the people are driven by collapsing services"".

The Rome Catholic charity Caritas estimated late last year that there are more than 16,000 homeless in Rome and their number congregating near the Vatican has grown visibly in recent years, especially at night when they cluster under arcades to sleep.
The new clinic with three visiting rooms will be open three days a week and will be staffed by volunteer doctors from the Vatican medical services and Rome hospitals.
Foot specialists will be available once a week. Charities say homeless people suffer particularly from foot ailments because they rarely remove their socks and shoes, and also wear ill-fitting shoes, causing ailments such as fungal infections, blisters and calluses.
The new clinic replaces an older temporary one nearby, also set up by the 82-year-old Francis. He has also opened facilities where the homeless can bathe and get haircuts.
When it is not serving the homeless, the new clinic, built on the premises of the old Vatican post office, will serve as a first aid station for pilgrims and tourists.

Turkey has carried out two operations, dubbed ""Euphrates Shield"" and ""Olive Branch"", against Kurdish YPG militia and Islamic State in northern Syria. Ankara regards the U.S.-backed YPG as a terrorist organization.
Turkey hosts more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees who have fled the conflict in their homeland. Some Turks view them as an economic burden and a threat to jobs.
""The number of Syrians that returned to their country after the Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch operations is 291,790,"" Soylu was quoted by state-owned Anadolu news agency as saying.
The Turkish military pushed into Syria northwest in two offensives, carving out a de facto buffer zone.
The first, ""Euphrates Shield"" in 2016, drove Islamic State from territory along the border. The second, ""Olive Branch"", wrestled the nearby Afrin region from the hands of Syrian Kurdish forces this spring.
Soylu also said that more than 250,000 illegal migrants had been caught in Turkey in 2018, without specifying their nationalities, adding that this showed a jump of more than 50 percent from the previous year.
He said stepped up efforts by Turkish police and security forces and the coastguard to clamp down on illegal migration had curbed the flow of migrants to countries in Western Europe.
Turkey became one of the main launch points for more than a million migrants from the Middle East and Africa taking the sea route to European Union territory in 2015.
The influx of migrants was drastically curtailed by a 2016 accord between Ankara and the EU to close the route after hundreds died crossing to Greek islands.

President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that Turkey would postpone a planned military operation against Syrian Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria as he ""cautiously"" welcomed Washington's decision to withdraw its troops in the area.

Television showed amphibious forces landing on Iran's Gulf island of Qeshm during the exercises, in which naval vessels, helicopters, drones, rocket launchers and commando units also took part.
""Hopefully, with these exercises, our enemies will realize more than ever how devastating our response would be to any move by them,"" said Guards chief Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, state news agency IRNA reported.
Qeshm, the largest island in the Gulf, is located near the Strait of Hormuz through which a third of the world’s seaborne oil passes.
The U.S. aircraft carrier John C. Stennis entered the Gulf on Friday and was shadowed by Revolutionary Guards speedboats. Reuters witnesses also saw an Iranian drone flying nearby.
Guards speedboats fired rockets but a U.S. Navy spokeswoman said they were pointed away from U.S. vessels.
""We believe it was part of their naval exercise,"" Lieutenant Chloe Morgan, a spokeswoman for the Bahrain-based U.S. Fifth Fleet, said. 
Iranian officials have made apparent threats to disrupt other countries' oil shipments through the Gulf if Washington presses ahead with efforts to halt Iranian oil exports as part of U.S sanctions against Tehran.
""We certainly strive to support our Gulf allies and let them know that we are going to continue to be committed to this area and to (ensure) equal access to international waters,"" said Captain Randy Peck, commander of the carrier Stennis.
In an apparent comment on the arrival of the Stennis, Jafari told state television: ""They've come, pretending to ensure the Persian Gulf states' security ... But it is Iran which has to provide security for the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf and our friends and brotherly countries on its southern coast"".

740,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2018 07:11AM ET</span>",Surge at U.S. border pushes some evangelicals to help asylum seekers,"By David Schwartz and Andrew Hay
PHOENIX/TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - Members of an Arizona evangelical church are for the first time taking Central American asylum seekers into their homes, responding to record arrivals of migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The predominantly white Central Christian Church, a Phoenix area ""megachurch"" had in the past assisted Muslim refugees. Church leaders wanted to help another group that lacked support and were portrayed as a threat in areas of the media and politics - asylum seekers. 
Central Christian is among a group of around 10 churches, most of them Hispanic, taking in up to 500 migrants a week from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) in greater Phoenix.
The migrants, mostly families, have been released into the United States to pursue their immigration cases in court. That flow could dwindle if the Trump administration is successful in its plans to make non-Mexican asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their claims are processed.
""It’s the first time we have been engaged with asylum seekers,” said Matt Nutter, director of global outreach at Central Christian. ""It’s an issue of humanity, we look at this beyond the politics of it.”
'THEY'RE NOT CRIMINALS'
President Donald Trump has said many migrants who left their countries for economic reasons are applying for asylum in the United States even though they may not have legitimate claims for protection from persecution.
Central Christian members Stephanie and Peter Apostol said they put aside politics and labels put on asylum seekers to host six families in the last two months. They ranged from a Mexican mother and infant to a Guatemalan father and teenage son, with families staying up to three nights.
The Apostols have received criticism and praise on social media for giving shelter to asylees. They said their faith compelled them to show compassion for this ""vulnerable"" group.
""These are just very wonderful people, they’re not criminals,"" said Stephanie Apostol, 48, who has given away the family's luggage to help asylum seekers travel on to relatives and other sponsors after staying at their home in Chandler, a Phoenix suburb. 
Her 9-year-old son gives up his bedroom if they host two families at once. A Mexican-American neighbor translates for the Apostols, who only speak a few words in Spanish.
""It's very easy to put yourself in their shoes when you're with them in your home,"" said Apostol, a market research analyst. ""What would we do if we were facing hunger and violence and the safety of our kids?""
'NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE'Illegal crossings at the southern border have dropped dramatically since the late 1970s, but in recent years applications for asylum have ballooned and more Central American families and unaccompanied children are heading to the United States.
Facing high numbers of migrant families, and to avoid holding them beyond legal time limits on how long children can be detained, ICE began releasing large groups to Arizona charities and churches in October, ICE spokeswoman Yasmeen O'Keefe said. 
With Hispanic churches running out of beds, coordinator Magdalena Schwartz reached out to dozens of churches in the Phoenix area. Two Anglo-American churches stepped up, one of them Central Christian.
""They have opened their churches and homes, I've never seen this before,"" Schwartz, pastor of evangelical church Nueva Esperanza in Mesa, said of the Anglo congregations.
LAW AND ORDER
Using high school Spanish and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Translate, Ericka Henry, 27, and her husband Blake, 30, hosted two Guatemalan families at their two-bedroom home in Phoenix suburb Mesa.
""We have more than enough, more than we need, so we try to help people as much as we can,” said Blake, a pastor at Central Christian. 
The church's initiative is growing, with members of other congregations asking to host families. But reactions to the program have not all been positive.
When the Apostols spoke on a radio show in Phoenix, the capital of a state that backed Trump in 2016, posts on social media said they were endangering their children, breaking the law and helping criminals by letting asylum seekers into their home. Others came to their support, however.
""These folks that are housing asylees are, in some ways, I think very brave, because they are swimming against the tide of public opinion and trends in their own religious community,"" said Janelle Wong, professor of American Studies at Maryland University and author of ""Immigrants, Evangelicals and Politics in an Era of Demographic Change.""
Polls show most white U.S. evangelicals back President Donald Trump and his immigration policies, even though their churches often support refugees and immigrants, said Ed Stetzer, a dean at Illinois evangelical school Wheaton College.
A November poll by the Public Religion Research Institute found white evangelicals were the only major religious group in the United States in which a majority said immigrants represented a threat to America's customs and values. (https:// 
Central Christian families declined to comment on their political affiliations, but said they had a politically diverse congregation.
For the Henrys, hosting asylum seekers was a commitment to ""love the other,"" regardless of their politics, religion or race. 

""Once you get a taste of it, then you realize that this is kind of what being a human is about,” said Ericka, also a pastor at Central Christian.

AMMAN (Reuters) - U.S. troops have not left the strategic Tanf garrison on the Iraq-Jordan border following President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of Syria, the leader of a Pentagon-backed rebel group there said on Saturday.
Colonel Muhanad al Talaa, leader of Maghawir al-Thawra whose several hundred fighters work alongside U.S. troops at the Tanf camp, said although they were notified of Washington's decision, the situation on the ground remained as it was.
""American troops plan to withdraw completely form Syria but I don't have details and things are as they are up until this moment,"" Talaa told Reuters from the base. 
The garrison is located in a strategic area near Syria's Tanf border crossing with Iraq at the crossroad of a main Baghdad-Damascus highway, Tehran's main arms supply route by land to Syria and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah militia.
Russia and the Syrian government have repeatedly called on Washington to pull its troops from the Tanf base, where it has declared a 55 km (35 mile)-radius ""deconfliction zone"" which has become a safe haven for at least 50,000 civilians, mostly women and children, who live in the Rukban camp within it.
The garrison was first set up when Islamic State fighters controlled eastern Syria bordering Iraq but since the militants were driven out, Tanf has assumed a role as part of a U.S. strategy to contain Iran's military buildup in eastern Syria.
Tanf is the only position with a significant U.S. military presence in Syria outside the Kurdish-controlled north, where it has much larger air bases
Only several months ago, U.S. marines held major rare exercises in the base in what Western military officials said was a strong message to Russia and Iran that the Americans and the rebels it supports intend to stay.
A western diplomatic source and a regional intelligence source told Reuters the decision to leave Tanf will not necessarily affect the broader U.S. strategy against Iran, where regional power Israel will continue its aerial strikes.
Israel has in the last year hit several suspected Iranian-backed militia convoys and bases near Tanf where Iran's proxies are expanding their foothold, especially in the city of AlBukamal to the northeast of the base, another intelligence source involved in Syria said.

Washington's decision means an even bleaker future for these camp dwellers for whom the camp was a safe haven as many fear retribution if they return back to their towns in Syrian government-controlled areas in eastern Syria, residents say.

Asked what stance Labour would take if a referendum were held, Corbyn said: ""it would be a matter for the party to decide what the policy would be; but my proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU, in which we would be able to be proper trading partners.""
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29. Prime Minister Theresa May has struck a withdrawal agreement with Brussels but was forced to pull a parliamentary vote on it last week after admitting she would lose by a large margin.
A new election is not due until 2022 but one could be called if May fails to get her primary policy through parliament. 
Labour wants a permanent customs union with the EU and a close relationship with its lucrative single market. The policy has been dubbed ""constructive ambiguity"" by some, who question whether Labour could negotiate a better deal.
Critics argue that Corbyn has been happy to go along with the policy as long as the vote to leave the bloc is respected.
He told the Guardian he still had concerns about EU rules on state aid, and that he had to balance the views of all those in the party and understand why so many voted to leave the world's biggest trading bloc. 

He said his plan for a customs union with the EU, to protect trade and access to the market, was designed to do just that.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - At least 13 people were killed and 17 wounded in a car bomb attack claimed by al Qaeda-linked group al Shabaab close to the president's residence in the Somali capital Mogadishu, police said on Saturday.
A second explosion followed nearby. Al Shabaab, in comments broadcast on its Radio Andalus, claimed responsibility for both blasts and said the second was also a car bomb.
""The death toll has risen to 13 people including civilians and soldiers. Seventeen others were injured. The casualties are from the two blasts,"" Major Mohamed Hussein, a police officer, told Reuters.
Among those killed were a journalist, two security personnel and a driver working for local station Universal TV, whose car was passing the checkpoint at which the first blast went off, another reporter working for the station said.
""My colleague Awil Dahir Salad died in the blast together with the driver and two security guards. They were killed by the first blast as they drove. May Allah rest their souls,"" journalist Abdiasis Ibrahim who works for Universal TV, told Reuters.
Police had earlier said the first car bomb at the checkpoint killed five, mostly soldiers. 
A Reuters witness at the scene of the second blast said he saw at least two bodies.
Ahmed Abdi, another police officer, said the first car bomb exploded at a checkpoint some 400 meters from the president's residence.
Al Shabaab carries out frequent attacks in Mogadishu. Its members want to dislodge the government and impose its rule based on its own strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law. 

The group was forced from Mogadishu in 2011 but maintains a foothold in some regions. It has killed thousands of Somalis and hundreds of civilians across East Africa in a decade-long insurgency.

Moscow had put forward a resolution in support of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) which bans Moscow and Washington from stationing short- and intermediate-range, land-based missiles in Europe. 
Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement that the UN had failed to vote in favor of the proposal.
""A new blow has been dealt on the global architecture of security and stability. Now, with the collapse of the INF treaty, several global regions could be plunged into the arms race or even into a direct confrontation,"" it said.
Washington has threatened to pull out of the accord, saying Moscow failed to comply with it.

On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the United States of raising the risk of nuclear war by threatening to spurn the key arms control treaty and refusing to hold talks about another pact that expires soon.

President Donald Trump has begun what will be a total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, declaring on Wednesday they had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State and were no longer needed. The plan has drawn criticism from allies such as Britain and France who say the militants are not fully beaten.
""Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi received a phone call from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who explained the details of the upcoming withdrawal from Syria and affirmed the United State's is still committed to fight Islamic State and terrorism in Iraq and other areas,"" Abdul Mahdi's office said in a statement.
Abdul Mahdi and Pompeo also discussed Washington’s decision to extend for 90 days a waiver granted to Iraq from sanctions against Iran that would allow Baghdad to keep importing Iranian gas that is critical for Iraqi power production.
The Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran’s energy exports in November, citing its nuclear program and meddling in the Middle East, but has granted waivers to several buyers to meet consumer energy needs.
Washington gave Iraq a 45-day waiver for imports of gas from Iran when it reimposed sanctions on Iran’s oil sector on Nov. 5. Iraqi officials have said they need around two years to find an alternative source.

Iraq relies heavily on Iranian gas to feed its power stations, importing roughly 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day via pipelines in the south and east.

THOOTHUKUDI, India (Reuters) - Twelve of the 13 protesters killed when police opened fire on a demonstration against Vedanta's copper smelter in southern India in May were hit by bullets in the head or chest, and half of those were shot from behind, autopsy reports show.
Two others died after bullets pierced the sides of their heads, according to the reports produced by forensic medicine experts from several government hospitals and reviewed by Reuters. They have not been previously published.
In the case of the youngest to be killed, a bullet entered the back of 17-year-old J. Snowlin's head and exited through her mouth, the autopsy found.
    ""The deceased would appear to have died of cardio-pulmonary arrest due to firearm bullet injury to the back of the neck,"" forensic medicine experts who examined Snowlin's body wrote.
When Reuters visited her family, they said they had not collected the teenager's autopsy report. ""We are continuing to exist, that's it,"" said her mother.
Indian police rules allow the use of live ammunition to quell civil unrest, but stipulate the response should be proportionate and officers should not shoot to kill. Police Standing Orders for Tamil Nadu, the state where the shootings took place, say that, when using firearms, ""aim should be kept low, preferably well below the waist level, and directed against the most threatening part of the mob"".
The incident was the deadliest at an environmental protest in India in a decade. A working group of United Nations' human rights experts in May condemned the ""apparent excessive and disproportionate use of lethal force by police"".
Federal police are investigating the shootings, which took place as protesters were marching to the local government headquarters in the port city of Thoothukudi, demanding that a copper smelter controlled by London-headquartered Vedanta Resources be shut for allegedly polluting the environment. 
No police officers have been arrested or charged in connection with the killings. In a statement following the incident the Tamil Nadu state government, which is responsible for the police, said: ""Due to unavoidable circumstances, we had to take action to bring the situation under control."" 
The Thoothukudi district administration and state police officials did not respond to emails seeking comments on the autopsy reports. Federal police investigating the deaths did not respond to requests for comment on the autopsy findings. 
Vedanta did not respond to a request for comment. The company, which had no involvement in the shootings, has previously expressed regret over the deaths at the protest, which it call ""absolutely unfortunate"".
Four senior police and two government officials who were present on the day told Reuters in June they were forced to fire live ammunition as the crowd turned violent and threatened a neighboring Vedanta employees' apartment building.
DETAIL OF DEATHS
Among the eight people killed from bullets entering their head or body from behind or the side, 40-year-old Jansi, who like many people in Tamil Nadu goes by just one name, was shot a few hundred meters away from her house in a narrow street close to Thoothukudi's seafront. She was shot through the ear, the report into her death showed.
   A bullet went through the forehead of 34-year-old Mani Rajan. ""The deceased would appear to have died of penetrating injury to the brain due to the firearm bullet injury to the right side of forehead,"" Mani's autopsy report said.
The dead also included a man in his 50s, six men in their 40s, and three men in their early 20s.
The head of the forensic science department at the Thoothukudi Medical College, where the autopsies were conducted, declined to comment, as did two of the principal examiners. 
Reuters contacted 11 of the 13 families or friends of those killed, 10 of whom said they were not pursuing any legal action. One of the 11 said he was in touch with a lawyer and wanted justice, but did not elaborate further. Two of the families could not be reached for comment.
Authorities in Tamil Nadu ordered the permanent closure of the Vedanta smelter on environmental grounds immediately after the shootings at the May 22 protest. That order was overturned by a ruling from India's green court on Dec. 15. Vedanta, controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal, has always denied damaging the environment.
MINIMUM FORCE
The shootings are being investigated by a court-mandated commission as well as the federal police. Officials familiar with the investigations said they were not likely to conclude ""any time soon"".
Fifteen police weapons were discharged in total, including three self-loading rifles (SLR), according to a state government documents submitted to the investigation commission and reviewed by Reuters.
Of 69 live bullets used, 30 were fired from the three SLRs, according to the documents. Police fired an additional four rounds from .303 rifles and 12 shots from .410 weapons.
The Police Standing Orders, an exhaustive manual on police action, recommends the use of .303 and .410 rifles as a last resort against violent crowds.
Unlike the colonial-era .303 and .410, the SLR is modern rifle capable of continuous fire, said Jacob Punnose, former police chief of the neighboring Kerala state.

""There is no illegality per se,"" he said, referring to the use of SLRs in such circumstances. ""But it definitely goes against principle of minimum force.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan is planning to ease visa restrictions for visitors from 55 countries, including most European nations, in a bid to revive tourism that was devastated by Islamist violence in the fallout from the 9/11 attacks in the United States.
""We are reviewing our visa policies. We are trying to bring 55 countries into a visa-free region, which includes most of the European countries,"" Pakistan's information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, told Reuters.
That comes after Portugal this month declared Pakistan safe for travel, while France has also relaxed its advisory on travel to the South Asian nation
""I'm happy our (travel) advisories are changing,"" said Chaudhry.
Potentially restarting tourism has been one of the most talked about parts of new Prime Minister Imran Khan's push to create an Islamic welfare state in Pakistan, but visitors to the country often complain of an arduous visa process. 
Former Real Madrid soccer stars Kaka of Brazil and Portuguese playmaker Luis Figo were recently denied visas to the country for a promotional visit, Chaudhry said, highlighting the nation's laborious visa process. 
""We refused a visa to Kaka and Figo. Can you believe that? I called the section officer and he never heard of ... Kaka,"" Chaudhry said, laughing. 
""I spoke to the interior secretary yesterday and gave him a piece of my mind."" 
Pakistan was last a prominent tourist destination in the 1970s when the ""hippie trail"" brought Western travelers through the apricot and walnut orchards of the Swat Valley and Kashmir on their way to India and Nepal.
Since then, a deteriorating security situation and the imposition of a harsh interpretation of Islamic laws has chipped away at the number of visitors. 
Following Pakistan's participation in the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York and Washington, the country was rocked by a decade of regular large-scale militant attacks.
Security has since improved dramatically, with militant attacks down sharply in the mainly Muslim country of 208 million people. 
British Airways on Tuesday announced it would resume flights to Pakistan next year after a 10-year absence that followed a major hotel bombing, becoming the first Western airline to restart such flights.

The new Islamic revolutionary courts — whose rulings cannot be appealed, except in the case of death sentences — were set up in August after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for “swift and just” action to confront an ""economic war"" by foreign enemies after the United States reimposed sanctions.
Hamidreza Baqeri-Dermani had been convicted of ""spreading corruption on earth"", a capital offence under Iran’s Islamic laws, for offences including bribery and fraud, the television said. 
His death sentence was upheld by the supreme court this month.
Iran executed two traders for economic crimes in November in an effort to stem financial misconduct in the face of an economic crisis and U.S. sanctions, reimposed after President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 international accord over Iran’s nuclear program.
The special courts have jailed dozens of businessmen and traders for up to 20 years.
The rial currency's weakness earlier this year disrupted foreign trade and helped boost annual inflation fourfold to nearly 40 percent in November. 
The weak currency has sparked sporadic street protests since late last year.
Iranian economists have said the campaign against economic crime, combined with an order from Ayatollah Khamenei this month to strengthen the rial, have made many traders more wary of bidding the currency lower.

China last week detained two Canadians - Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and an adviser with the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank, and businessman Michael Spavor - after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Dec 1.
""We are deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention by Chinese authorities of two Canadians earlier this month and call for their immediate release,"" Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.
Freeland said that Meng, who is also the daughter of Huawei's founder, was facing a ""fair, unbiased and transparent legal proceeding,"" and Canada would not ""compromise nor politicize the rule of law and due process.""
Her words were echoed in a similar statement by U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Palladino, who noted that Canada was honoring its international legal commitments in arresting Meng, and called for the immediate release of Kovrig and Spavor.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in a statement that the United Kingdom ""has confidence Canada is conducting a fair and transparent legal proceeding"" with respect to Meng. He said he was ""deeply concerned by suggestions of a political motivation"" for the detention of Kovrig and Spavor.
The European Union said the ""declared motive"" for the arrest and detention of Kovrig and Spavor ""raises concerns about legitimate research and business practices in China"". 
""The denial of access to a lawyer under their status of detention is contrary to the right of defence,"" it said in a statement, adding that it supported the efforts of the Canadian government.
While Meng has had full access to lawyers and is able to see family, Kovrig is being denied legal representation, is not allowed to see family, and is limited to one consular visit a month.
Peter Dahlin, a Swedish rights worker who was detained in China for three weeks before being deported in 2016, also over allegations of violating national security, said governments had to speak out.
""The only way to protect Kovrig and Spavor right now is to protect their rights vehemently, and let China be the one to de-escalate the situation,"" Dahlin told Reuters.
""Silence will merely give China the ability to use Kovrig as a pawn, as a tool, and as long as that can be useful to them, he will not see the light of day.""
China has given only vague details of why it has detained the two Canadians, saying they are suspected of engaging in activities that endangered China's security, and has not drawn a direct link to Meng's arrest.
The United States has sought to extradite Meng on charges of misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. The 46-year-old executive is out on bail in Vancouver.

Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of telecoms network equipment and second-biggest smartphone seller. The United States has been looking since at least 2016 into whether Huawei shipped U.S.-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of U.S. export and sanctions laws, Reuters reported in April.

752,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 09:52PM ET</span>",Turkey says it will take over fight against IS after U.S. pull-out,"By Ece Toksabay and Dahlia Nehme
ISTANBUL/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkey will take over the fight against Islamic State militants in Syria as the United States withdraws its troops, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, in the latest upheaval wrought by Washington's abrupt policy shift.
The surprise announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump this week that he would withdraw roughly 2,000 troops has felled a pillar of American policy in the Middle East. Critics say Trump's decision will make it harder to find a diplomatic solution to Syria's seven-year-old conflict.
For Turkey, the step removes a source of friction with the United States. Erdogan has long castigated his NATO ally over its support for Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters against Islamic State. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group and an offshoot of the armed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), fighting for Kurdish autonomy across the border on Turkish soil.
In a speech in Istanbul, Erdogan said Turkey would mobilize to fight remaining Islamic State forces in Syria and temporarily delay plans to attack Kurdish fighters in the northeast of Syria - shifts both precipitated by the American decision to withdraw.
The news was less welcome for other U.S. allies. Both France and Germany warned that the U.S. change of course risked damaging the campaign against Islamic State, the jihadists who seized big swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014-15 but have now been beaten back to a sliver of Syrian territory. 
Likewise, the U.S.-backed militia spearheaded by the YPG said a Turkish attack would force it to divert fighters from the battle against Islamic State to protect its territory.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said American troops may continue to operate against Islamic State in Syria. The Pentagon is considering using Special Operation teams based in Iraq to target militants in Syria, the official said.
The official emphasized that using special operators on the ground was one of many options being considered, was still in the planning stages and that no final decision had been made.
Islamic State launched an attack on Friday in Syria's southeast against the U.S.-backed SDF militia, employing car bombs and dozens of militants.
""We will be working on our operational plans to eliminate ISIS (Islamic State) elements, which are said to remain intact in Syria, in line with our conversation with President Trump,"" Erdogan said.
The Turkish president had announced plans last week to start an operation east of the Euphrates River in northern Syria to oust the YPG from the area that it largely controls. This week, he said the campaign could come at any moment. But on Friday, he cited the talk with Trump as a reason to wait.
""Our phone call with President Trump, along with contacts between our diplomats and security officials and statements by the United States, have led us to wait a little longer,"" he said.
""We have postponed our military operation against the east of the Euphrates river until we see on the ground the result of America's decision to withdraw from Syria.""
Erdogan said, however, that this was not an ""open-ended waiting period"" and that, due to past ""negative experiences"", Ankara welcomed the United States' statements with an equal amount of pleasure and caution.
Turkey has repeatedly voiced frustration over what it says is the slow implementation of a deal with Washington to pull YPG fighters out of Manbij, a town in mainly Arab territory west of the Euphrates in northern Syria.
The United States will probably end its air campaign against IS in Syria when it pulls out troops, U.S. officials have said. Erdogan's foreign minister said the withdrawal plan would be discussed by the two countries in Washington in January.
'TIME FOR OTHERS TO FIGHT'
Trump maintained that IS had been wiped out, a view not shared by key allies, that Washington had been doing the work of other countries and it was ""time for others to finally fight"".
His defense secretary, Jim Mattis, opposed the decision and abruptly announced on Thursday he was resigning after meeting with the president.
In a candid letter to Trump, the retired Marine general emphasized the importance of ""showing respect"" to allies that have voiced surprise and concern about the president's decision. 
Russia said on Friday it did not understand what the United States' next steps in Syria would be, adding that chaotic and unpredictable decision-making in Washington was creating discomfort in international affairs.
Several of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress, joined by opposition Democrats, urged the president to reverse course, saying the withdrawal would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran in Syria and enable a resurgence of Islamic State. 
Trump has given no sign of changing his mind. He promised to remove forces from Syria during his 2016 election campaign.
The roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, many of them special forces, were ostensibly helping to combat Islamic State but were also seen as a possible bulwark against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has retaken much of the country from his foes in the multi-sided civil war, with military help from Iran and Russia.
IS declared a caliphate in 2014 after seizing parts of Syria and Iraq. The ultra-hardline Sunni militants established their de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe.
A senior U.S. official last week said Islamic State was down to the last 1 percent of the territory it once held. The group has no remaining territory in Iraq, though militants have resumed attacks since their defeat there last year.
Islamic State launched an attack on Friday on positions held by the SDF in Syria's southeast and the U.S.-led coalition mounted air strikes in the area, an SDF official said.

Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria may not be able to continue to hold Islamic State prisoners if the situation in the region gets out of control after a U.S. pullout, top Syrian Kurdish official Ilham Ahmed said on Friday.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian armed forces killed Marxist insurgent commander Walter Patricio Arizala in an operation aimed at ending his attacks on civilians after he kidnapped and shot dead three Ecuadorean media workers earlier this year, President Ivan Duque said on Friday.
Arizala, known by his war alias Guacho, was killed in a police and military operation near the border with Ecuador, Duque said in a televised statement. 
Arizala was a member of the Oliver Sinisterra unit - a faction of former rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) that refused to adhere to a 2016 peace agreement. The government had deployed more than 3,000 members of the armed forces to search for Arizala ""dead or alive.""
""The message is clear, we won't take a step back in the defense of legality, life, honor and the property of Colombians,"" Duque said. ""Many Colombian communities will sleep well because one of the most horrendous criminals the country has known is dead.""
Arizala, who was 29, was accused of drug trafficking, extortion and homicide.
He killed two Ecuadorean journalists and their driver after taking them hostage on March 26 as they reported on assignment for the Quito-based El Comercio newspaper on the border between Ecuador and Colombia.
""I told the Ecuadorean people that the crime of the three Ecuadoreans would not end in impunity,"" said Duque.
A proof-of-life photograph released shortly after the Ecuadoreans' kidnapping showed them chained and padlocked by their necks. Arizala later shot them in the head.
The media crew was reporting on violence in the Esmeraldas region of the border when they were snatched by Arizala's gang.
Colombia and Ecuador had both offered $100,000 each for information leading to Arizala's capture.
More than a thousand FARC fighters refused to demobilize under the peace accord with former President Juan Manuel Santos and continued cocaine trafficking across the nation. There are now almost 1,800 members of the dissident ranks in 30 units nationwide. 
Those operating in Colombia's southern jungles have attacked Ecuadorean security forces along the border. 
The FARC, which battled for more than a half century before demobilizing, attacked military targets and civilian towns but generally allowed journalists to work freely, unless they went against the rebels' interests.

LONDON, England (Reuters) - London's Gatwick Airport reopened on Friday after a mystery saboteur wrought 36 hours of travel chaos for more than 100,000 Christmas travelers by using drones to play cat-and-mouse with police snipers and the army.
Sussex police made two arrests late on Friday in connection with the disruption and urged the public and passengers around the airport to remain vigilant. 
After the biggest disruption at Gatwick since an Icelandic volcanic ash cloud in 2010, the airport had said around 700 planes would take off on Friday, although there would still be delays and cancellations.
Gatwick, Britain's second busiest airport, briefly closed again on Friday to investigate a new drone sighting but was soon operating as normal.
""Flights have resumed,"" a spokeswoman said. ""The military measures we have in place at the airport have provided us with reassurance necessary to re-open our airfield.""
Britain deployed unidentified military technology to guard the airport against what transport minister Chris Grayling said were thought to be several drones. ""This kind of incident is unprecedented anywhere in the world,"" he said. 
The motivation of the drone operator, or operators, was unclear. Police said there was nothing to suggest the crippling of one of Europe's busiest airports was a terrorist attack.
Gatwick's drone nightmare is thought to be the most disruptive yet at a major airport and indicates a new vulnerability that will be scrutinized by security forces and airport operators across the world.
The army and police snipers were called in to hunt down the drones, thought to be industrial-style craft, which flew near the airport every time authorities tried to reopen it on Thursday.
No group has claimed responsibility publicly and police said there was no evidence another state was involved.
Sussex Police Assistant Chief Constable Steve Barry said they were keeping an open mind about who was responsible. 
""In terms of the motivation, there's a whole spectrum of possibilities, from the really high-end criminal behavior that we've seen, all the way down to potentially, just individuals trying to be malicious, trying to disrupt the airport,"" he said. 
After a boom in sales, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a growing menace at airports across the world. In Britain, the number of near misses between private drones and aircraft more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year.
THERMAL IMAGING? 
The British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA) said it understood ""detection and tracking equipment"" had been installed around Gatwick's perimeter. 
BALPA said that it was extremely concerned at the risk of a drone collision. Flying drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary is punishable by five years in prison.
The defense ministry refused to comment on what technology was deployed but drone experts said airports needed to deploy specialist radar reinforced by thermal imaging technology to detect such unmanned flying vehicles.
Other ways to tackle them is typically by frequency jamming that can disable or disrupt control signals and the GPS signals that allow the drones to navigate.
The Telegraph newspaper had reported earlier that the perpetrator had circled the drone around the airport building and flashed its lights. A description of the drone by witnesses had enabled experts to determine the model of the machine, according to the report.
The drone sightings caused misery for travelers, many sleeping on the airport floor as they searched for alternative routes to holidays and Christmas family gatherings.
Flights were halted at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted near the airport. The disruption affected at least 120,000 people on Wednesday and Thursday but flights were restarted at 0614 GMT on Friday.
At 1740 GMT flights were suspended again but restarted less than an hour later.
It was not immediately clear what the financial impact would be on the main airlines operating from Gatwick including easyJet (L:EZJ), British Airways (L:ICAG) and Norwegian (OL:NWC).
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said it considered the event to be an ""extraordinary circumstance"" meaning airlines are not obliged to pay compensation to affected passengers. 
Airlines will have to refund customers who no longer wish to travel, however, and try to reschedule flights to get passengers to their destinations.
Some airport staff handed out chocolate and Christmas elf toys to stranded passengers.
Some, like Sarah Garghan-Watson, chose to stick it out at the airport overnight, having arrived at 8 a.m. on Thursday.
""It's now 2 o'clock in the morning at Gatwick, and it's very bright and very noisy. It's now also very cold,"" she said in a video shown on Sky.

""All I can see tonight ... is a sign that says 'no more sleeps until the beach'. And here we are, sleeping, in the stairs at Gatwick, because there's no flights.""

The move comes after Lithuania and the United Kingdom increased their security assistance to Ukraine, the department said, following the Nov. 25 attack near the Kerch Strait.

Russia opened fire on the Ukrainian ships and then seized them and their crews near Crimea - which Russia annexed from Ukraine in March 2014. The Kerch Strait is the only outlet to the Sea of Azov and controls access to two major Ukrainian ports.

The incident prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to call off a meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Argentina to signal Washington's disapproval of Russian behavior in the naval clash with Ukraine.

The justices on a 5-4 vote rebuffed the administration's bid to put on hold a California-based federal judge's order preventing it from carrying out the policy making anyone crossing the U.S.-Mexican border outside of an official port of entry ineligible for asylum.
The planned asylum change was a key component of Trump's hardline policies aimed at making it tougher for immigrants to enter and stay in the United States.
Roberts, who last month rebuked Trump over his criticism of the judiciary, joined liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor against the administration. Trump's two high court appointees, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, joined the two other conservative justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, in dissent.
""The Supreme Court's decision to leave the asylum ban blocked will save lives and keep vulnerable families and children from persecution. We are pleased the court refused to allow the administration to short-circuit the usual appellate process,"" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged Trump's policy.
The Justice Department expressed disappointment with the decision, saying the 25 nationwide injunctions against Trump administration policies were ""unprecedented.""
""The Court has not yet fully considered the merits of this case,"" Justice Department spokesman Steven Stafford said. ""We will continue to defend the executive branch's lawful authority over the discretionary benefit of asylum.""
SEEKING TO BLOCK THE CARAVANS
U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco blocked the policy on Nov. 19. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals then refused the administration's request to lift Tigar's order.
Tigar's ruling prompted Trump to call the jurist an ""Obama judge"" and blast the 9th Circuit in general as a ""disgrace."" Tigar was appointed to the bench by Democratic former President Barack Obama.
Trump's comments led to an extraordinary response from the normally reticent Roberts, who defended the independence of the federal judiciary and wrote in a public response to Trump on Nov. 21, ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.""
The port-of-entry restrictions, due to expire after 90 days, were made through a presidential proclamation Trump issued on Nov. 9 alongside a new administration rule. The administration has sought ways to block thousands of Central American men, women and children traveling in caravans to escape violence and poverty in their home countries from entering the United States, with Trump calling them a national security threat.
Illegal crossings at the southern border have dropped dramatically since the late 1970s, but in recent years, applications for asylum have ballooned and more Central American families and unaccompanied children are migrating to the United States.   
Trump's proclamation stated that mass migration on the border had precipitated a crisis and he was acting to protect the U.S. national interest. Trump's policy was crafted to alter American asylum laws that have given people fleeing persecution and violence in their homelands the ability to seek sanctuary in the United States. 
The Supreme Court in June backed Trump in another major immigration-related case when the justices in a 5-4 ruling endorsed the legality of the Republican president's travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations. Roberts joined the court's other conservatives in that ruling.
On Wednesday, a different judge blocked another of Trump's asylum-related orders, this one aimed at restricting asylum claims by people citing gang or domestic violence in their home countries.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador's legislative assembly on Friday denied Attorney General Douglas Melendez a second term, after he pursued tough anti-corruption investigations and put a former president in prison.
In less than three years, career prosecutor Melendez also jailed his predecessor, a judge and a top businessman, among others, and faced death threats for his work.
But after several days of backroom negotiations, El Salvador's main political parties decided not to reinstate him.
They instead chose Raul Melara, a doctor of law who ran the conservative National Association of Private Enterprise (ANEP) and was a substitute Supreme Court judge.
Melara was proposed by right-wing party ARENA, and will run the attorney general's office from January 2019 for three years.
Outgoing Melendez's team prosecuted former President Antonio Saca, who is now serving 10 years in prison for embezzlement and money laundering, and is trying to extradite Mauricio Funes, who was president until 2014, from Nicaragua.
Melendez has powerful critics from the country's left, who said he was tougher on their politicians. Melendez says both the left and right accused him of bias.

The attorney general's office declined to comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - By plainly stating his policy differences in his resignation letter, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has sparked an incipient challenge to President Donald Trump's foreign and security agenda that sets his departure apart from scores of others that preceded him.
Mattis, a retired Marine general who was highly regarded by Republicans and Democrats, had far wider political support in Washington than Trump himself when he walked into the White House on Thursday afternoon.
Sources said Mattis had already made up his mind that it was time to go. Later in the afternoon, Trump announced Mattis was retiring, only to be rapidly contradicted as Mattis circulated his eight-paragraph resignation letter.
Even as Washington digested Trump's surprise decisions this week to remove U.S. troops from Syria and to draw down the military presence in Afghanistan, it was Mattis' departure and the attendant strategic uncertainty that sources said really vexed officials across the administration and in the U.S. Congress.
It prompted unusually sharp criticism of Trump from his fellow Republicans.
""It's sadness for our country,"" said retiring Republican Senator Bob Corker, adding he thought Mattis' departure could change how Senate Republicans defend Trump. ""We are in a really bad place as it pertains to foreign policy.""
U.S. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was ""distressed"" by Mattis' departure. Senator Lindsey Graham, who has mostly been a staunch Trump ally, called for immediate hearings on Trump's moves in Syria and Afghanistan and wanted to hear directly from Mattis.
Mattis is the first U.S. defense secretary in decades to explicitly resign over purely policy differences with a president. 
His departure is wholly different from that of other top foreign policy and national security officials in the administration who have left, including the president's unceremonious firing of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Two national security advisors left Trump - but did so from weakened positions.
'STATE OF SHOCK'
Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria was a major contributing factor to Mattis' departure, and was part of their discussion in the 45-minute conversation on Thursday, as the two men aired their differences, officials told Reuters.
The defense secretary made a final effort on Thursday to convince Trump to reverse course on Syria, one official with knowledge of discussions told Reuters.
Trump, by all accounts, was not pressuring Mattis to resign and had not been expecting an announcement to come that day, sources said.
The Pentagon declined to comment on Mattis' resignation, referring reporters to his letter.
Even aides to Mattis said they were surprised. ""We're all in a state of shock,"" said one U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Republican-led Congress, which has done little to check Trump's political instincts, including his decision to create a Space Force and to deploy troops to the southern border with Mexico, appeared more ready to step in.
The top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry, rebuked Trump's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, another surprise move by Trump that leaked in news reports on Thursday. 
""Reducing the American presence in Afghanistan and removing our presence in Syria will reverse (U.S.) progress, encourage our adversaries, and make America less safe,"" he said.
Hearings are planned in the U.S. House of Representatives, which will be controlled by Democrats starting in January.
The resignation has triggered deep concern among U.S. allies abroad. In Europe, Mattis was seen as a critical advocate for the NATO alliance, which extolled him in a statement on Friday. In Asia, he was credited with building trust and tempering Trump's isolationist impulses. 
TRUMP'S CALL WITH ERDOGAN
Trump's decision to pull troops from Syria, where he said they are no longer needed against what he called a defeated Islamic State, initially appeared to come out of nowhere. But its genesis, said sources, was a phone call he had with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Dec. 14.
The call was arranged by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after Turkey's threat to launch a military operation against U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters in the northeast.
Mattis, Pompeo and others helped prepare briefing notes for the call. Trump was supposed to push back against the Turkish plan, according to an official briefed on discussions. 
During the call, Erdogan asserted that Islamic State had been defeated and complained that the United States was undermining Turkish security by backing the Kurds, the official said. 
That message appealed to Trump, who said the United States did not want to be in Syria and made a snap decision to pull out, ignoring his briefing notes and the advice of Mattis and Pompeo, the official said.
Trump has long been skeptical of the U.S. military mission in Syria that his national security team have advocated to ensure Islamic State's defeat.

A White House spokesman called this a ""false version of events.""

DENVER (Reuters) - An ex-FBI agent who accidentally shot and wounded a Denver bar patron in June after performing a dance-floor back flip pleaded guilty on Friday to misdemeanor assault under a plea deal that spares him from serving jail time, prosecutors said.
Chase Bishop, 30, pleaded guilty to third-degree assault in Denver District Court for shooting Thomas Reddington in the leg at the Mile High Spirits and Distillery, prosecutors said in a statement.
""We believe that this agreement strikes an appropriate balance of seeking justice for the victim and ensuring that this type of incident does not happen again,"" District Attorney Beth McCann said.
Bishop, an FBI agent who was off duty at the time, was among the patrons at the nightclub in downtown Denver in the early morning hours of June 2. Video footage of the incident, captured by another customer and widely circulated online, showed Bishop breakdancing, then performing a backward somersault in the air.
His handgun fell from its holster onto the dance floor and discharged as Bishop picked it up, striking Reddington, 25, in the leg. A muzzle flash can be seen on the video.
The Denver Post reported that Bishop told the judge that he ""never expected the result of my actions to lead to something like this.""
""My whole goal in life is to care, protect and serve people,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying.
Reddington's lawyer, Bill Marlin, told Reuters in a phone interview that his client is still recovering from a severed artery in his lower leg. He said Reddington was satisfied with the plea agreement that included no jail time.
""His (Reddington’s) concern was about Bishop's conduct and his behavior after the shooting,” Marlin said.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Marlin said a prosecutor told him the FBI fired Bishop sometime after the incident.
Bishop was initially charged with second-degree assault, a felony. In exchange for his guilty plea, Bishop will serve two years of unsupervised probation, the district attorney said.

Marlin said Reddington has not committed to filing a lawsuit, but is ""exploring civil remedies.""

Police said no one was injured in the operation.
The Sun newspaper said the rescue was led by members of the navy's elite Special Boat Service.
Four stowaways had threatened crew on the ship, the Grande Tema, a spokesman for the boat's operator, Grimaldi Lines, said.
Four men were detained under Britain's immigration laws and the vessel was being taken safely to the port of Tilbury, police said in a statement.
Sky News said the stowaways were believed to have boarded the ship in Nigeria and had demanded to be taken to the English coast, threatening the crew with iron bars.
Earlier, police said they did not think the incident in the Thames Estuary was piracy or terrorism-related.
Police first attended the incident at 0900 GMT on Friday and the operation was concluded about 14 hours later.

The BBC said the crew had locked themselves in the vessel's bridge for safety.

762,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>",Planned drawdown in Afghanistan imperils U.S. push for peace,"By Idrees Ali and Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will upend his own strategy to bring peace to Afghanistan and end America's longest war if he proceeds with plans to withdraw about half of the 14,000 U.S. troops there, according to veteran diplomats and U.S. officials.
A drawdown also will deal a fresh blow to allies' trust in the United States and give new room to militant groups al Qaeda and Islamic State in which to operate and plot attacks, they said.
""Barring some unforeseen details that have yet to come out, there is no way I can objectively look at this and see this as beneficial,"" said Jason Campbell, who was the Afghanistan country director at the Pentagon until September.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump has issued verbal orders to plan for a drawdown of close to 7,000 U.S. troops. But, they cautioned, he could always reverse course.
The White House and the Pentagon have not yet commented publicly.
Word of Trump's decision followed a two-day meeting in Abu Dhabi earlier this week between U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives at which the sides discussed a withdrawal of international forces and a ceasefire in 2019.
If a U.S. drawdown goes ahead, ""We just gave them half of what they wanted in all of this. Their top priority is for the United States to leave Afghanistan,"" said Campbell, now an analyst with the RAND Corp think tank.
Trump unveiled a South Asia strategy in August 2017 calling for an open-ended deployment of U.S. forces with the goal of compelling the Taliban to negotiate peace with the Kabul government.
But with the insurgents controlling large swaths of territory and chronically understrength Afghan forces suffering thousands of casualties a month, even a partial U.S. withdrawal reduces pressure on the Taliban to strike a deal, the experts and officials said. It also threatens to erode Afghan troops' willingness to fight.
Richard Olson, a former U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that Trump’s plan severely weakened Khalilzad's negotiating hand.
""It's easier for them (the Taliban) to envision waiting us out,"" he said.
MILITARY FIGHT
Late last year, Trump reluctantly agreed to deploying thousands of additional U.S. troops. 
The United States has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of a NATO-led mission, known as Resolute Support, and a U.S. counter-terrorism mission largely directed against groups such as Islamic State and al Qaeda.
Some 8,000 troops from 38 other countries are participating in Resolute Support.
The planned drawdown, according to a Pentagon adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity, blindsided top U.S. military and allied commanders.
U.S. commanders now will have to scramble to re-balance the international forces remaining in Afghanistan between training and advising Afghan security forces and fighting al Qaeda and Islamic State’s South Asian branch, according to Ronald Neumann, a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul.
Thursday's news of the planned drawdown followed Trump's order on Wednesday to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria. Trump said Islamic State had been defeated and there was no longer a need for U.S. forces in Syria. 
""The Syrian and the Afghan withdrawals together mark the United States as a power too large to ignore and too fickle to trust,"" said Neumann. 
The departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who announced his resignation on Thursday over policy differences with Trump, could also affect coordination with allies. 
Mattis twice drafted letters over the past two years asking NATO allies to increase or maintain their troop levels and many countries agreed, said Campbell, the former Pentagon official.
""He was very influential and personally involved in doing that,"" Campbell said. 
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the military has begun planning the details of a drawdown, which could include reviewing what bases the United States would keep and what type of troops would be removed.

The official acknowledged it would be difficult to maintain the same military missions with half the troops.

In a statement, prosecutors said those charged included former high-ranking officials at Petrobras and its pension fund Petros, and executives from scandal-plagued builder Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL] and engineering conglomerate OAS. 
The charges mark the latest development in the ""Car Wash"" probe, a sprawling corruption investigation that has felled many members of Brazil's political and business elite, revealing the rotten business dealings that long underpinned the upper echelons of Brazilian society. 
Prosecutors said the charges related to a bribery scheme involved in the costly construction of the Pituba tower in the Bahia state capital Salvador, which was built in order to be Petrobras' local headquarters. Money went to senior Petrobras and Petros officials, as well as to the leftist Workers Party (PT).
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's former president and a founder of the PT, is currently in jail as a result of a graft racket uncovered by the Car Wash probe. 
The prosecutors said the alleged culprits had been charged with corruption, money laundering and criminal organization. The bribes totaled 67.2 million reais ($17.22 million), they said. 
The charges come after police last month served 22 arrest warrants related to the racket, which allegedly lasted from 2009 to 2016.

BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces used live bullets and teargas on Friday to disperse protesters who were trying to storm a local government building in the southern city of Basra. 
It was the second week in a row that riot police used force to quell the demonstrators. 
About 250 people gathered outside the temporary headquarters of the provincial council throughout the afternoon to protest against corruption and demand jobs and better public services.
Protesters threw rocks and empty water bottles at riot police. 
By nightfall, some of the protesters broke through the main gate of the building's outer perimeter using a large cylinder, and attempted to storm the building.
No injuries were reported. 
Iraq's second city has been rocked by demonstrations in which government offices, including the main provincial council building, have been ransacked and set alight by protesters angry about corruption.
Unrest first erupted in July over poor government services but intensified in September before dwindling in recent months.
Residents in Basra say they have been driven onto the streets by corruption and misrule that have allowed infrastructure to collapse, leaving no power or safe drinking water.

765,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 03:53PM ET</span>",U.S. plan to keep asylum seekers in Mexico sows confusion,"By Daina Beth Solomon and Kristina Cooke
MEXICO CITY/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Mexican and U.S. officials charged with carrying out a radical new change in U.S. immigration policy to process asylum seekers in Mexico say they have not been informed about how the plan will work in practice .
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and the Mexican government released simultaneous announcements about the plan on Thursday but said details about the rollout would be forthcoming.
Mexico's government said on Friday it wanted more details from the United States on the plan, and vowed not to deport people seeking refuge. It is not clear how Mexico plans to house what could be thousands of people from Central America for the months, or years, it takes U.S. immigration cases to be heard. There is currently a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration courts.
""Today, I'm going to ask the U.S. authorities to give us many details,"" said Mexico's foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, adding that the country would lay out its position more clearly on Monday once it had more information. 
The immediate lack of guidance has also left U.S. immigration judges, who will have to process the bulk of the asylum claims through their courts, in the dark, said Ashley Tabaddor, the head of the immigration judges' union. 
""Information certainly hasn't been shared with the people who may be responsible for having to implement this,"" said Tabaddor. ""We haven't heard anything. Every peep on this we have heard through the media.""
She said that has left the nation's nearly 400 immigration judges with many questions, including how the cases will be distributed among the more than 60 immigration courts.
Currently asylum seekers that have been released into the interior of the United States are assigned to courts near where they live. Tabaddor said it was not clear if judges would now be expected to travel to border courts en masse to hear cases there. 
Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the immigration courts, said the asylum hearings would be conducted ""in accordance with applicable law."" But she referred questions about logistics to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Before asylum cases get a hearing in immigration court, migrants have to pass an interview with an official from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, to determine whether they have a ""credible fear"" of returning to their home country. 
One asylum officer tasked with conducting those interviews told Reuters, on condition of anonymity, that they ""didn't even know"" about the new policy until after it was announced. 
""The fact that we didn't have a clue is pretty true,"" the officer said. A spokesman for USCIS also referred questions to DHS, as did a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
MEXICAN CONCESSIONS
The accord was widely viewed as a concession by Mexico's new president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to shut down the Mexico-U.S. border if the flow of migrants is not contained.
It is unclear how many migrants the new policy could end up returning to Mexico, and Ebrard said he did not believe the measure could be applied retroactively.
Local officials in Mexican border states are worried they will not be able to deal with the influx, said Rodolfo Olimpio, head of Baja California's state council on migrant assistance 
""It is clear the (Mexican) Federal Government does not have the infrastructure, capacity or legal framework for this to happen. And the state and municipal governments of border states also lack the budget and conditions for this,"" Olimpio said. He said recent budget cuts have also left migrant shelters strapped for cash. 
Serious doubts remain over whether Mexico can keep vulnerable asylum seekers safe. Authorities are investigating the deaths of two Honduran teenagers kidnapped and killed in the border city of Tijuana last weekend.
LEGAL CHALLENGES
To send people to Mexico, the Trump administration is invoking a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that allows the government to return migrants to a foreign country bordering the United States pending their immigration process.
Immigration advocates are expected to file lawsuits challenging the plan, but any legal arguments could turn on the details of how the policy will be implemented.
""Right now we don’t know all the logistics, and I suspect the people on the ground who work for the government don't know all the details,"" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney from the American Civil Liberties Union who has led several efforts to block the Trump administration's immigration policy changes in court. ""From what we know now, we believe it cannot be implemented lawfully."" 
Immigration advocates raised concerns about the difficulty accessing lawyers to help navigate complex asylum claims. 
Almost all communication from immigration courts comes through the mail and the Mexican postal system is notoriously dysfunctional. 
""I don’t understand, if people are living in one of these shelters in Tijuana, how they would get mail,"" said Kara Lynum, an immigration attorney based in Minnesota who recently volunteered in Tijuana to help asylum seekers. 
Mexico has pledged to provide work visas to migrants and Deputy Interior Minister Alejandro Encinas said the government's public works plans in the south of the country could attract laborers.

Ebrard reiterated that Mexico was not planning on becoming a ""safe third country,"" which would oblige those seeking asylum who arrive first in Mexico to apply for asylum there, saying ""We haven't signed a deal, we're not going to.""

ABUJA (Reuters) - Police said they had arrested the suspected mastermind of bombing attacks by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram that killed 15 people in the Nigerian capital Abuja in 2015.
The force named the man as Umar Abdulmalik and said he and other people they arrested had confessed to the bombings, the jailbreak of more than 100 prisoners in June, the killing of seven police officers in July and various bank robberies.
There was no comment from any lawyer representing Abdulmalik, who police said was arrested in the commercial capital Lagos on Thursday.
Police issued a photograph of Abdulmalik in handcuffs in front of a van, and another of seven other men in front of weapons, walkie-talkies, credit card point-of-sale machines and ammunition.
More than 30,000 people have been killed and millions forced to flee in Boko Haram's decade-long campaign to carve out an Islamist state in northeast Nigeria.
A military campaign by Nigeria and its neighbors has pushed the group out most of its territory since the beginning of 2015, but fighting has rumbled on.
Over the past year, a splinter group allied with Islamic State has become the dominant branch, killing hundreds of soldiers and frequently overrunning military bases.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Friday urged predator priests who have sexually abused minors to turn themselves in, making one of his strongest comments ever on the crisis sweeping the Roman Catholic Church.
While it was not immediately clear if Francis was saying such priests should surrender to the Church judicial system, civil justice, or both, Vatican sources believed it was the first time the pope had made such a direct appeal.
""To those who abuse minors I would say this: convert and hand yourself over to human justice, and prepare for divine justice,"" Francis said in his Christmas address to the Curia, the Vatican's central administration.
He spoke two months before a summit on the sexual abuse crisis that will be attended by the heads of some 110 national Catholic bishops' conferences and dozens of experts and leaders of religious orders in the Vatican. 
Francis has previously used the Christmas address to denounce cases of corruption and mismanagement in the Curia. This time, he concentrated on the global sexual abuse crisis.
""Let it be clear that, faced with these abominations, the Church will spare no effort to do all that is necessary to bring to justice whoever has committed such crimes. The Church will never seek to hush up or not take seriously any case,"" he said.
When the pope has made similar promises of zero tolerance in the past, victim groups have scoffed, saying the Church has to come up with a clear policy to make bishops themselves accountable for the mishandling of abuse cases.
Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, a group that tracks abuse cases worldwide, said the pope's words on their own did nothing to protect children or deter abusers and the Church had to come up with real changes at the conference.
""Let's hope that he's working now on a host of concrete systemic reforms that he plans to present soon to a horrified and grieving people,"" she said.
In his address, Francis acknowledged that the Church had made serious errors in handling the crisis in the past in the past.
Earlier this year, Francis himself first strongly defended a bishop in Chile who had been accused of covering up abuse, only later to launch an inquiry and accept the resignation of that bishop and other prelates there. 
""It is undeniable that some in the past, out of irresponsibility, disbelief, lack of training, inexperience, or spiritual and human short-sightedness, treated many cases without the seriousness and promptness that was due,"" he said, without referring to the Chilean cases.

""That must never happen again. This is the choice and the decision of the whole Church.""

768,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 02:39PM ET</span>","U.S. Justice Ginsburg, 85, has malignant nodules removed from lung","By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday underwent surgery in New York to remove two cancerous nodules in her left lung, the latest serious health issue experienced by the 85-year-old liberal jurist, a court spokeswoman said.
Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Ginsburg, who previously bounced back from bouts with colon and pancreatic cancer, underwent a procedure called a pulmonary lobectomy on Friday at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Arberg said that according to the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Valerie Rusch, ""both nodules removed during surgery were found to be malignant.""
After the surgery, which had been scheduled in advance, there was ""no evidence of any remaining disease,"" Arberg added.
""Currently, no further treatment is planned. Justice Ginsburg is resting comfortably and is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days,"" Arberg said.
Ginsburg, one of the court's nine justices, broke three ribs in a fall last month. The nodules were found as part of the tests the justice underwent after the earlier fall, Arberg said.
As the oldest justice, Ginsburg is closely watched for any signs of deteriorating health. Ginsburg, appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1993, is also the senior liberal member of the court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority. 
If she were unable to continue serving, Republican President Donald Trump could replace her with a conservative, further shifting the court to the right. A potentially dominant 6-3 conservative majority would have major consequences for issues including abortion, the death penalty, voting rights, gay rights and religious liberty.
""Lung cancer can be an unpredictable disease. Based on the information currently available, Justice Ginsburg's prognosis is good,"" Dr. Leonard Lichtenfeld, acting chief medical and scientific officer with the American Cancer Society, said in an interview.
""It appears that the surgeon saw no other evidence of cancer. What we don't know is about how large the tumors were. We don't know the exact location of those tumors. And we don't know whether or not there was any lymph node involvement. At the time of surgery they may have taken additional specimens and it usually takes a period of time until those specimens are processed,"" Lichtenfeld added.
Lymph node involvement ""becomes a higher-risk situation,"" Lichtenfeld added.
""However, that does not mean patients with lymph node involvement can't have a good outcome,"" Lichtenfeld said. ""They certainly can, with treatments that are currently available. Also, the predictability of cancers in patients who are older can be different than in folks who are younger.""
A pulmonary lobectomy involves surgically removing one of the sections of the lung. The left lung has two lobes and the right lung has three lobes.
""Part of the treatment for primary lung cancer that has shown no spread to other parts of the body is to go ahead and resect and remove those cancers through surgery,"" Lichtenfeld said, adding that he assumed the doctors used a minimally invasive approach that did not involve a major incision in the chest.
MEDICAL ISSUES
Ginsburg has recovered from previous medical issues. She was treated in 1999 for colon cancer and again in 2009 for pancreatic cancer, but did not miss any argument sessions either time. In 2014, doctors placed a stent in her right coronary artery to improve blood flow after she reported discomfort following routine exercise. She was released from a hospital the next day.
The Supreme Court's conservative majority was restored in October when the Senate confirmed Trump's nominee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, after a contentious nomination process in which Kavanaugh denied a sexual assault allegation dating to the 1980s when he was a high school student. 
The justices are scheduled to hear their next round of arguments on Jan. 7.
Ginsburg is considered a hero by many liberals. She has helped buttress equality rights during her time on the high court, including in sex discrimination cases.
In recent years she has become something of a cult figure, particularly on the left, known by the nickname ""Notorious RBG,"" after the late rapper Notorious BIG.

769,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>","After U.S., British tussle, U.N. approves Yemen truce monitors","By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Friday unanimously approved the deployment of a U.N. advance team to monitor a ceasefire in Yemen's Hodeidah region after days of wrangling that pitted the United States against ally Britain.
After a week of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden, the Iranian-aligned Houthi group and Saudi-backed Yemen government foes agreed last week to stop fighting in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah and withdraw forces. The truce began on Tuesday.
The Security Council authorized U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to deploy - for an initial 30 days - an advance monitoring team. That team, led by retired Dutch General Patrick Cammaert, is due to arrive in Yemen shortly, said a U.N. spokesman, adding that the personnel will not be uniformed or armed.
The council also asked Guterres to submit proposals by the end of the month on substantive monitoring operations for the ceasefire and redeployment of forces; support for the management of and inspections at the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Issa; and strengthening of the U.N. presence in the Hodeidah region.
Guterres is also required to report weekly to the Security Council on implementation of the resolution, which endorses the ceasefire deal agreed in Sweden.
""It's vital that the parties follow through on their commitments,"" British U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce told the council after the vote. 
The Security Council has been wrangling over the British-drafted text since Monday and in an unusual move the United States, unhappy with Britain's efforts, came up with its own version on Thursday. Traditionally countries propose amendments to an initial draft rather than coming up with their own text.
When asked about the negotiations with the United States, Pierce told reporters: ""This is what diplomacy is meant to be about so I'm glad it worked on this occasion.""
U.S. WARNS ON IRAN 
The U.S. draft text, which was seen by Reuters, mirrored the British language focused on the ceasefire deal and authorizing U.N. support. However, Washington had stripped out language on the humanitarian crisis.
The resolution adopted on Friday retained some of the British language on the aid crisis. The conflict has pushed impoverished Yemen to the verge of famine with millions relying on food aid. More than 80 percent of Yemen's imports used to come through Hodeidah port, but that has slowed to a trickle.
The resolution calls on the government of Yemen and the Houthis to remove bureaucratic obstacles to the flow of aid and commercial goods, including fuel, and ensure all the country's ports are functioning. 
The United States had also wanted to condemn Iran for breaching an arms embargo on Yemen, but Russia objected, diplomats said. Iran has repeatedly denied accusations that it has supplied weapons to Yemen's Houthis.
""We hope that in the days to come Iranian missiles or misdeeds do not shatter the promise of peace and bring us back to where we were before. But if that does happen, this council may come to regret this omission,"" U.S. diplomat Rodney Hunter, the political coordinator of the U.S. mission to the United Nations, told the Security Council after the vote. 
In order to reach a consensus Britain had to cut language on the ""need for transparent, credible and timely investigations into alleged violations of international humanitarian law"" and for those responsible to be held accountable. The U.S. draft did not include that language. 
A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to back government forces. The United Nations and Western countries have criticized the coalition for killing a high number of civilians, including children. 
Western countries, including the United States and Britain, have provided arms and intelligence to coalition members.

About 8,000 Palestinians gathered near the border fence, the Israeli military said. Most kept their distance, while some burned tires and tried to throw an explosive device into Israel, though it did not land across the border, the military said.
A military spokeswoman said the troops responded with ""riot dispersal means"" and fired in accordance with Israeli procedure.
Gaza's health ministry said 16-year-old Mohammad Jahjouh was fatally shot in the neck, while 25 others, including a local journalist, were wounded by Israeli gunfire.
It later said two men, aged 28 and 40, died of injuries they sustained at protests in two separate locations along the fence with Israel earlier in the day.
Health officials in Gaza, which is run by the Islamist Hamas movement, say more than 220 Palestinians have been killed since they began weekly border protests on March 30 to demand the easing of Israel's blockade on the territory and the right to return to land lost in the 1948 war of Israel's founding.
Israel has ruled out any such right, concerned that the country would lose its Jewish majority.
Alarmed at the bloodshed, Egypt, the United Nations and Qatar have sought ways to improve conditions in the enclave.
Israel withdrew settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains tight control of its land, air and sea borders. The wider Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled for several years.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Thousands of Hungarians joined a march in Budapest on Friday led by spoof political party MKKP ""to support government policies, Christmas and snowfall"" - the latest in a string of demonstrations stoked by controversial reforms.
Passage of two laws last week backed by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party angered a variety of groups. One, dubbed by critics the ""slave law"", allows employers to ask staff to work up to 400 hours per year of overtime. Another would set up new courts which critics say could be politically manipulated.
At the rally, one protester brandished a placard saying ""Happy boss, gloomy Sunday"".
The Two-Tailed Dog Party (MKKP), launched over a decade ago as a joke, has become a semi-serious force, using ironic humor to tackle practical issues.
""I wanted to come because I consider the Dog Party to be the most serious of all in the current lineup, which is rather sad,"" said student Almos Edes, 26, a university student holding a sign saying 'We promise everything' beneath a logo of Fidesz.
Edes was skeptical of any change being triggered by the rallies, but said he had joined to make his voice heard.
Friday's rally also took aim at grievances including regulations that have led to the departure of the Central European University, founded by Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, from Budapest.
""We can finally work eight days a week. We no longer need to hassle with independent courts. Homelessness has been eliminated. Irritating foreign schools will vanish. And Soros, Soros, Soros, Soros, Soros,"" said an invitation to the rally posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Orban has said the protests have been partly stoked by activists paid by Soros, an accusation Soros' Open Society Foundation has denied.
The demonstrators were planning to end the rally in Buda Castle outside the Presidential Palace.
MKKP, which is not in parliament, had 3 percent support among voters in November according to pollsters Zavecz Research and Nezopont. Orban's Fidesz scored 36 and 38 percent in the two surveys.
""I have come to rejoice over the government's policies,"" said Gergo Gocza, 28, holding a sign saying 'A Sign'.

""This event is not meant to change anything,"" he said. ""We have come to salute the government and the lots of good they have done for us.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Yellow vest protesters, who have blocked roads across France and fought running battles with police since mid-November, will march in the former royal city of Versailles on Saturday in their fight against the government's reforms. 
The Versailles chateau and gardens, a symbol of French state power and one of Europe's top tourist attractions, will be closed on Saturday as authorities expect hundreds of protesters in the wealthy suburb, 20 km (12 miles) west of Paris. 
Jean-Jacques Brot, prefect of the Yvelines region, told reporters the demonstration would be confined to the city's central avenue, well away from the palace and shopping areas.
Versailles was a focal point of the French revolution and the October 1789 march on the palace by the Parisian mob led to overthrown and subsequent execution of King Louis XVI. 
According to a prefecture official quoted by daily Ouest France, about 1,400 people have said they would take part in the march following a call to demonstrate in Versailles by one of the yellow vest leaders on Thursday. 
""We are ready in case the protest focuses on Versailles, but it could also be elsewhere,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said on Thursday. 
Yellow vest leaders have called for new demonstrations on Saturday and encouraged their supporters to block trucks at the borders in a sixth weekend of nationwide protests, which have led to rioting and looting in Paris and other big French cities. 
Nine people have died in the protests, mostly in traffic accidents at yellow vest roadblocks. Retailers, restaurants and hotels have lost millions of revenue in the weekends leading up to Christmas as they were forced to closed their doors for fear of looting and violence. 
But the movement - named after the fluorescent vests motorists are required to have in their cars - has gradually lost steam in recent weeks, with just 66,000 people taking part in protests nationwide last Saturday compared to nearly 300,000 on Nov. 17., according to interior ministry data. 
President Emmanuel Macron has announced a raft of measures costing the state budget some 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion) to appease the yellow vests, boosting the minimum wage and easing tax increases on pensioners.
Macron has also promised to organize a broad nationwide debate about taxation in the coming three months.

Bild said the German government had taken the decision to stop Mahan Air from operating its flights to Dusseldorf and Munich after intensive deliberations on U.S. demands.
A German government spokesman said he could not comment on the report in Bild, which said Mahan Air would be banned in January.
The U.S. government has sanctioned several companies for their links to Mahan Air, including a Thai aviation company and a Malaysia-based sales agent.
The U.S. embassy in Berlin has criticized Germany for allowing the airline to fly to the two major cities. Mahan Air says on its website that it also operates flights to Paris, Barcelona, Milan and Athens.
Germany and its European Union partners are at odds with the United States over policy toward Iran.
U.S. President Donald Trump in May pulled out of a deal between Iran and major powers intended to constrain Tehran's nuclear program and reinstated sanctions on the Islamic Republic.

Fabricio Queiroz, who for years was on Flavio Bolsonaro's payroll, is under pressure to explain 1.2 million reais ($310,575) that flowed through his bank account between 2016-2017, including payments to the president-elect's wife, Michelle Bolsonaro. 
Her husband, Jair Bolsonaro, easily won the October election with a promise to ends years of political graft, and the scandal has hurt the reputation of a family that promised to put an end to grubby political corruption. 
Queiroz was originally due to explain the money to prosecutors on Wednesday. But he did not show up, and his lawyers cited a health crisis that prevented him from appearing. 
According to Brazil's Council for Financial Activities Control, which identified the suspicious transactions, some of the payments to Queiroz' bank account were made by other employees on Flavio Bolsonaro's payroll when he served as a Rio de Janeiro state lawmaker, including by Queiroz' own daughter. Many of the deposits were made on or around the same day that the state congress paid employees. 
Flavio and Jair Bolsonaro have denied any wrongdoing. 
Jair Bolsonaro said the payment to his wife was Queiroz repaying a personal loan. He added that if he made a mistake by not declaring the money from Queiroz, he would rectify it with tax authorities.
Flavio Bolsonaro has said that Queiroz gave him a ""plausible"" explanation of the origin of the money and that the accusations are intended to destabilize the Bolsonaro family.

776,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 11:47AM ET</span>",Catch me if you can: London drone attack lays bare airport vulnerabilities,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - A mystery drone operator's success in shutting down Britain's second busiest airport for more than 36 hours has exposed the vulnerability of others across the world to saboteurs armed with such cheap and easily available devices.
The incursion at London Gatwick, a brazen game of cat and mouse that those responsible played with Europe's top military power, underlined how many airports lack the means to catch drone pilots quickly, let alone destroy the unmanned aerial vehicles themselves.
Advances in technology mean drones can be controlled from far away using cameras on board, or even programmed to navigate their own way to targets, and back again.
""There is no silver bullet technology,"" said Geoff Moore, business development manager at UK-based Blighter Surveillance Systems, which supplies the U.S. military with anti-drone technology he said was used in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq.
""Drone technology is evolving quickly, the levels of autonomy are increasing, the ease of flight is increasing to the point where they can be almost 'fire and forget' one-button launchable.""
The nightmare at Gatwick, which stranded more than 100,000 people when all flights were grounded, was finally brought under control on Friday after the government ordered the army to use military equipment to protect the site.
Moore said radar systems used by air traffic control were designed to spot commercial aircraft rather than something as small and as close to the ground as a drone. To detect them, airports need specialist radar reinforced by thermal imaging technology.
    ""There are no specific regulations or guidelines on UK airports that mandate that they have to deploy drone detection systems,"" he said.
STRAY BULLET DANGER 
After detecting the drone, it needs to be disabled by interfering with its navigation system or by simply shooting it down. Authorities at Gatwick were reluctant to use guns because of the danger posed by stray bullets at a crowded airport.
And it is not enough to jam some radio frequencies because modern drones were not always radio-controlled like old-fashioned model aircraft.
Richard Gill, founder and chief executive of Drone Defence, said the fact that the drones at Gatwick were not disabled more quickly indicates that they were not relying on a radio link.
""The drone potentially could have been pre-programmed to cause this disruption and there could have been more than one drone over the period,"" he told BBC radio.
Gill said the technology that allowed a drone to be pre-programmed, so that it navigates to a point or a number of points and then returns to base to recharge, could be bought from online.
""A motivated individual could potentially carry out this act,"" he said. ""But it is very sophisticated, it is pre-planned, it is very deliberate what they have done to cause the maximum disruption at a really busy airport in the UK.""
JAMMING DRONES?
Jamming tactics can be risky in an airport where there are other critical communications systems.
Defense systems cannot simply block radio frequencies used to control drones, or GPS signals that the devices use to navigate, because of regulations, Moore said.
""The problem with the UK is there are some regulatory requirements around the use of things like radio frequency jamming - it's illegal to do that,"" he said. ""There's not so many mitigation technologies available in the UK because mostly they are restricted or unavailable.""
ADS, a trade group representing the aerospace, defense and security sectors, said it had asked the government to strengthen police powers, as well as the ability of airport operators and others to deploy electronic counter-measures.
Chief Executive Paul Everitt said UK security companies could help airport authorities with systems that detect, track and identify drones, electronic measures to prevent drone incursion, and with advice about the legal implications of using electronic counter-measures in Britain.

But at Gatwick, the perpetrators were still at large on Friday after the most advanced drone attack yet on a major airport.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Friday that two Reuters journalists jailed in Myanmar on charges of breaking the country's Official Secrets Act were innocent and that Britain had serious concerns about due process in the case.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were found guilty in September after a trial at a Yangon district court in a case that has raised questions about Myanmar's progress towards democracy and triggered an outcry from diplomats and human rights advocates.
Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said in September that the jailing of the reporters had nothing to do with freedom of expression. She said they were not jailed because they were journalists.
In a sign of the level of concern among world powers about the case, Britain's foreign policy chief took the unusual step of recording a short video to show his support for the jailed Reuters journalists.
""We want the world to remember these two journalists, not just because we believe they are innocent, but also because this is a year when we have seen a big increase in the number of journalists who have been locked up and indeed far worse - murdered,"" Hunt said.
There were 251 journalists jailed for doing their jobs as of Dec. 1, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in an annual study earlier this month. 
At least 53 journalists were killed around the world between January 1 and December 14, 2018, according to the CPJ, a U.S.-based nonprofit that promotes press freedom.
Britain's Hunt said that at a time when people were looking forward to spending time with their families, it was time to reflect on the fate of the two Reuters journalists.
They ""are both in prison this Christmas because they wanted to report of the Rakhine crisis where there has been some alleged genocide against the Rohingya people in Burma,"" Hunt said.
The Reuters reporters, who pleaded not guilty, said they were handed papers by police shortly before they were detained, and a police witness testified that they had been set up. 
They had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya men and boys as part of a military response to insurgent attacks.
""We are very worried about due process in this case - it is something that I have raised with Aung San Suu Kyi,"" said Hunt. He did not elaborate further on the British concerns about the case. 

Lawyers for the two Reuters reporters have lodged an appeal against their conviction and sentence.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",U.N. tells UK: Allow Assange to leave Ecuador embassy freely,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. rights experts called on British authorities on Friday to allow WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to leave the Ecuador embassy in London without fear of arrest or extradition.
The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention reiterated its finding published in February 2016 that Assange had been de facto unlawfully held without charge in the embassy, where he has now been holed up for more than six years.
He initially took asylum to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where authorities wanted to question him as part of a sexual assault investigation. That investigation was dropped. 
Assange, whose website published thousands of classified U.S. government documents, denied the Sweden allegations, saying the charge was a ploy that would eventually take him to the United States where a prosecutors are preparing to pursue a criminal case against him.
Britain says Assange will be arrested for skipping bail if he leaves the embassy, but that any sentence would not exceed six months, if convicted. It had no immediate comment on the experts' call, but in June, foreign office minister Alan Duncan said Assange would be treated humanely and properly.
""... the only ground remaining for Mr. Assange’s continued deprivation of liberty is a bail violation in the UK, which is, objectively, a minor offence that cannot post facto justify the more than six years confinement that he has been subjected to since he sought asylum in the Embassy of Ecuador,"" the U.N. experts said in a statement.
""It is time that Mr. Assange, who has already paid a high price for peacefully exercising his rights to freedom of opinion, expression and information, and to promote the right to truth in the public interest, recovers his freedom,” they said.
Lawyers for Assange and others have said his work with WikiLeaks was critical to a free press and was protected speech. 
The experts voiced concern that his ""deprivation of liberty"" was undermining his health and could ""endanger his life"" given the disproportionate amount of anxiety that has entailed.
Ecuador in October imposed new rules requiring him to receive routine medical exams, following concerns he was not getting the medical attention he needed. The rules also ordered him to pay medical and phone bills and clean up after his cat.

Assange has sued Ecuador, arguing the rules violate his rights.

780,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 11:15AM ET</span>","Afghans, diplomats surprised by report of Trump plan to pull out troops","By Hamid Shalizi, Rupam Jain and James Mackenzie
KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan officials and America's Western partners reacted with unease on Friday to reports that the United States planned to withdraw more than 5,000 of its 14,000 troops from Afghanistan, after tentative steps toward peace talks.
Although there has been increasing acceptance in Kabul that U.S. President Donald Trump was impatient for progress in ending the 17-year war, comment from a U.S. official that he was planning to withdraw at least 5,000 troops, coupled with the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, came as a surprise.
Mattis has been widely seen in Afghanistan as a guarantor of U.S. engagement, and his departure would inevitability raise worries in the minds of many Afghan officials. 
The news followed a two-day meeting in Abu Dhabi between U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives at which the two sides discussed the withdrawal of international forces and a ceasefire in 2019.
However, with the plans still unconfirmed and further meetings expected in Saudi Arabia in early January, it was unclear whether a ceasefire was close and whether the news heralded a wider settlement.
""The withdrawal will certainly affect overall operations but we will have to wait and see which units are going to go home first. It is too early to say anything for now,"" said a senior Afghan government official.
""Depending on how the Taliban react, the government might ask forces to reduce operations,"" he said.
But Haroon Chakansuri, spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani, said the withdrawal would not affect overall security because the role of U.S. forces has been to assist and advise Afghan troops.
The United States has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of a NATO-led mission, known as Resolute Support, and a separate U.S. counter-terrorism mission largely directed against militant groups like Islamic State and al Qaeda.
In addition, some 8,000 troops from 38 other countries in Resolute Support provide training and support for Afghan forces.
The Taliban are fighting to oust foreign forces and defeat the Western-backed Kabul government.
With the insurgents in control of large stretches of the country and chronically understrength Afghan forces suffering thousands of casualties a month, even a partial U.S. withdrawal could reduce the incentive of the Taliban to strike a deal and erode the willingness of Afghan troops to fight.
""We all know the morale of the Afghan forces has hit an all-time low, they are under-equipped, poorly paid and they lack coordination. We train them to the best of our abilities,"" said a Western diplomat from a Resolute Support member.
'NO CONSULTATION'
A withdrawal of so many U.S. troops would represent an abrupt shift in U.S. strategy announced a year ago, which saw thousands of troops sent to Afghanistan and air strikes intensified to put pressure on the Taliban to talk.
But for months, diplomats have joked grimly about a ""Tweet of Damocles"" hanging over Afghanistan - the fear that Trump could take to social media to announce the United States was pulling out.
With the reports from Washington still unconfirmed, there was no comment from the headquarters of the NATO-led mission in Kabul but the news appeared to have caught some allies by surprise.
""The U.S. has not consulted us on the withdrawal and today we will start meetings to discuss it,"" said one Western diplomat in Kabul. 
""It will take a while and there are some countries who are ready to exit. So they could be the first to leave.""
Another senior diplomat in Kabul said countries with military or development commitments might now make plans independent of U.S. strategy. 
""Each country has to answer this one question: Should we stay in Afghanistan?"" the diplomat said.
A senior security official working for an international organization said Afghan officials would be shaken by the news.

""We're keeping a watch on how Afghan elites, policymakers react to this ... Many have been sharing their exit plans with us and now we could see them implement them,"" the official said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A Geneva prosecutor is reviewing material in a suitcase seized nearly three years ago to decide what can be shared with Italian authorities in a case involving oil majors Eni and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and corrupt payments in Nigeria, his office said on Friday. 
The prosecutor received the green light after Switzerland's top court, the Federal Tribunal, rejected an appeal by Nigerian defendant Emeka Obi to prevent his bag from being unsealed. 
The Lausanne court's Nov. 8 ruling, published online, said that the confiscated material - including documents, an external hard drive, British and African passports, and USB keys - could have ""potential pertinence"" in the criminal investigation and the sealing could be lifted without violating Swiss law. 
""The Geneva prosecutor now has access to all the material in conformity with the Federal Tribunal ruling,"" it said in a reply to Reuters. 
He will select the material to be handed over, it said. Under Swiss law, privileged information cannot be shared in international judicial assistance in criminal matters and the prosecutor's choice of documents can be appealed.
Obi's Geneva lawyers Paul Gully-Hart and Charles Goumaz told Reuters that they were cooperating with the prosecutor's office.
""With respect to the ongoing proceedings in Switzerland, regarding the suitcase of our client, we can confirm that no decision has yet been taken in respect of the transmission of any of its contents to the Italian authorities,"" they said in a statement. 
""Our client has maintained his innocence in regards to the various allegations made by the Milan prosecutors and is confident that the final evaluation of the contents of his bag will confirm this. 
""Our position remains, as it has always been from the beginning, that the only material that should even be considered for transmission to the Italians must be strictly limited to non-protected material that is directly related to our client's involvement in the OPL 245 transaction,"" they added.
An Italian judge said on Monday Eni and Shell were fully aware their 2011 purchase of a Nigerian oilfield would result in corrupt payments to Nigerian politicians and officials.
Eni and Shell bought the OPL 245 offshore field for about $1.3 billion in a deal that spawned one of the industry's largest corruption scandals. It is alleged that about $1.1 billion of the total was siphoned to agents and middlemen.
The Milan judge made the comment in her written reasons for the September conviction of Obi and Italian Gianluca Di Nardo, both middlemen in the OPL 245 deal, for corruption. The pair were jailed for four years.
Obi and Di Nardo have been tried separately from Eni and Shell, which also face corruption allegations over the same deal in a hearing that is expected to drag on for months.
Eni has denied any wrongdoing. Shell said on Monday that neither Obi nor Di Nardo had worked for Shell, and that there was no basis to convict it or any of its former staff of alleged offences related to the deal.
Obi brought the Swiss case to keep the contents of the bag seized in Geneva in April 2016 from being shared with foreign authorities.
Its confiscation led the Geneva prosecutor to open a criminal case for suspected corruption of foreign officials and money-laundering. Days later Italian authorities requested judicial assistance, arguing that the suitcase and its contents had been deliberately stashed in Geneva, the Swiss ruling said.
Italy's proceedings targeted 13 defendants and two companies suspected of corruption activities from 2009 and 2014 linked to acquiring prospecting rights in Africa, it said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Key allies of Washington expressed concern on Friday about the resignation of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the policies of President Donald Trump that prompted it, praising Mattis as a committed partner.
Mattis said on Thursday he would quit after falling out with Trump over the latter's foreign policies, including the surprise decision to pull troops out of Syria and plans for a drawdown in Afghanistan. 
""Secretary Mattis has made a key contribution to keeping NATO strong and ready to deal with the significant security challenges we face,"" NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said. ""He is widely respected as a soldier and a diplomat.""
Mattis has been seen in Europe as firmly committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance, unlike his ex-boss.
Trump has warned European allies the United States could withdraw its support unless they boost defense spending.
""We are grateful for the iron-clad commitment of the United States to NATO. U.S. leadership keeps our transatlantic alliance strong,"" Lungescu said.
Former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, head of the liberals in the European Parliament, said the resignation only made it more urgent for the European Union to push on with its plans to bolster its own defense capabilities.
""Mattis checked President Trump's worst instincts & was a strong supporter of NATO & multilateralism. His departure is bad news & makes it look like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s plan is being delivered on,"" Verhofstadt said on Twitter.
MACRON FAILS TO PERSUADE
Mattis' resignation also sparked concern among Washington's Asia-Pacific allies, who credit the retired general with building trust and tempering isolationist impulses.
The region includes strong U.S. allies Japan, South Korea and Australia and has some of the world's most volatile flashpoints, with high tension on the Korean peninsula and China's militarization of the South China Sea causing friction.
The resignation also surprised Kabul, where the retired Marine had been seen as a guarantor of U.S. engagement. Afghan officials reacted with unease to plans to withdraw more than 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in the country.
After being tipped off by White House sources and diplomats, French President Emmanuel Macron called Trump on Tuesday to warn him against the Syria decision, a French official said. 
""He told him: Be careful, we think that would be a bit too early',"" the official said.
Macron has often been cast as the one leader who had some influence on Trump, with a good personal and working relationship. 
French Defence Minister Florence Parly said Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria in the belief that Islamic State (ISIS) had been defeated was ""extremely grave"".
""We do not share the analyses that the territorial caliphate has been annihilated,"" Parly said on RTL radio. ""It's an extremely grave decision and we think ... the job must be finished.""
German Defense Minister Ursula Von der Leyen called for clarity on future policies.

""Because the United States has such a prominent role and responsibility in the global security architecture, it is important for everyone to quickly get clarity about succession and the future course,"" she said in a statement.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudanese police fired tear gas at dozens of demonstrators on Friday in the cities of Omdurman and Atbara, witnesses said, where people gathered in a third day of protests driven by price rises and a nationwide cash shortage.
The protests that began after noon prayers were smaller than those on Thursday, when at least eight people were killed as thousands took to the streets, some calling for the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir.
A government spokesman blamed ""infiltrators"" for derailing peaceful demonstrations into ""subversive activity.""
The protests are among the biggest the country has seen in five years. 
They could put at risk moves to change the constitution and allow Bashir to stay in power into a fourth decade, while deepening turmoil in a nation of 40 million that slid into economic crisis after the south seceded in 2011.
There were also small-scale demonstrations across at least eight neighborhoods in the capital Khartoum on Friday, but they were short-lived, witnesses said.
Police had stepped up their presence outside Khartoum's main mosques ahead of an anticipated third day of demonstrations.
Hundreds of Sudanese web users reported issues with internet access, particularly on social networks like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and WhatsApp, late on Thursday and into Friday. 
Many believe the government may be attempting to stall protests. Some who were able to gain access using VPNs called for the demonstrations to continue. 
Demonstrators on Thursday torched ruling party offices in the cities of Dongola and Atbara, while security forces fired tear gas to disperse crowds in Khartoum, where small and scattered protests continued into the night. 
Public anger has been building over price rises, inflation and other economic hardships, including a doubling in the cost of bread this year and limits on bank withdrawals.
Long lines continued to stretch outside of ATMs and bakeries in Khartoum early on Friday.
Sudan's economy has struggled to recover from the loss of three quarters of its oil output - its main source of foreign currency - when South Sudan seceded in 2011.
The Education Ministry said on Friday it was shutting schools and kindergartens in Khartoum ""for the safety of the children.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police are investigating two women employees and members of an internal complaints panel of a local unit of U.S.-based tech services provider Genpact after an executive accused of sexual misconduct committed suicide, two officers said on Friday. 
The wife of Swaroop Raj, an assistant vice president at Genpact India, has accused the company of driving him to kill himself, saying he was suspended without due investigation, police said.
The case - a rare instance of police questioning the alleged victims of sexual assault and Genpact India's internal complaints committee - highlights the risks associated with the naming and shaming of individuals in the so-called #MeToo movement against sexual predators.
Raj was suspended after the staffers made serious charges of sexual harassment against him, Genpact said in a statement.
""The complaint was being duly investigated by the internal complaints committee as per the mandated process,"" Genpact said. ""To have a fair and uninfluenced inquiry, he was placed under temporary suspension pending the closure of the inquiry.""
Raj, 35, left a note saying he killed himself because the allegations had irrevocably tarnished his reputation, Nishank Sharma, a police officer in Greater Noida region, on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi, told Reuters.
Police have registered a preliminary complaint for abetting suicide against at least seven employees of Genpact, including the two women who accused Raj of sexual misconduct, Munish Chauhan, another police official, said.
India's anti-sexual harassment laws mandate that all firms with more than 10 employees must have an internal complaints committee (ICC) to examine cases of sexual harassment at the workplace. 
The committee, which comprises one external member, is empowered to function as a civil court - it can summon and enforce attendance, examine persons on oath as well as ask for documents.
The police move to widen the probe to the ICC will ignite broader concerns among human resource professionals and anti-harassment panels dealing with sexual misconduct allegations at the workplace, experts said.
""This may make ICC members skeptical about the personal liability involved in these cases,"" said Vishal Kedia, the founder of legal compliance services firm ComplyKaro. ""Some members may even step down to avoid repercussions like this.""
In a 2014 case, a woman approached the Bombay High Court following her husband's suicide, alleging he killed himself because of harassment by ICC members who found him guilty of sexual misconduct.
The court ruled that the ICC could be not be held accountable for the suicide of the man, a teacher in western Maharashtra state.
Raj's case could also turn the focus on the training given to ICC members, said Renu Jethani, a senior human resource professional at a UK-based company.
""They must be adequately prepared since they are dealing with people's lives and careers,"" she said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday decreed a 22 percent rise in the minimum wage, the biggest in four decades, and a move that could strengthen his grip on power but defies warnings that it could worsen unemployment.
Such decrees are one of the rare ways Sanchez, whose Socialist party controls only a quarter of seats in parliament, can try to make an impact on the economy and get voters on his side ahead of a spate of elections next year.
""This is the biggest rise in the minimum wage since 1977 and it will benefit more than 2.5 million people, mostly women,"" government spokeswoman Isabel Celaa told a news conference after the weekly cabinet meeting, which was held in Barcelona.
The increase to 1,050 euros ($1,197.84) per month will allow Spain to jump from having one of Europe's lowest minimum wage, as compared to average wage, to one of the highest.
Wages had been slashed in Spain, the euro zone's fourth-largest economy, as a way out of a steep economic crisis that started in 2008, leaving many struggling to make ends meet.
""Sanchez has realized that he can mobilize left-wing voters with issues that have huge symbolic weight such as the minimum wage,"" said Lluis Oriols, a political science professor at Madrid's Carlos III university. 
Spanish voters go to the polls at the end of May for a series of municipal, regional and European elections. Speculation has been rife over whether and when Sanchez could call snap elections ahead of the 2020 scheduled date.
The Bank of Spain, International Monetary Fund and employer groups warned against the minimum wage increase, which will enter into force on Jan. 1, saying it would make it harder for those struggling to find a job, in particular young people.
The OECD think-tank was more positive, saying the move would better align Spain with its neighbors.
The AIREF fiscal watchdog, an independent body, estimates that 40,000 jobs would be lost in 2019 because of the minimum wage increase. But the boost for those who do have a job will bring an extra 1 billion euros into the economy, it said.
2019 BUDGET STUCK
Sanchez has also announced an increase of at least 2.25 percent for civil servant wages next year and a 1.6 percent increase for state pensions, which were also adopted by decree as a way to overcome his lack of a majority in parliament.
There is no knowing when or if Sanchez will be able to convince a divided parliament to approve his 2019 budget for Spain, now in limbo for lack of sufficient votes. 
The government has not yet even sent a draft budget to parliament, but Sanchez said he would do so in January.
If he cannot get it adopted he might struggle to stay in power, but if there were to be snap elections, he would be able to go to voters with measures such as the minimum wage increase.
Sanchez came to power in June after several parties teamed up to oust the conservatives over a corruption scandal. 
But he is struggling to get these same parties to back his policies now that he is power, except on issues such as the minimum wage. Decrees need to be later endorsed by parliament, but opposition parties have said they would not oppose such a popular step.
Symbolically, the step will be adopted by the cabinet in Barcelona, the Catalan regional capital, on Friday, with Sanchez stressing this is to show that his policies aim to help people throughout Spain. Catalonia's independence drive is one of the thorniest issues for any Spanish prime minister to handle. 
But out on the streets of Madrid, voters were not convinced such steps would be enough to keep the Socialists in power.

""It's a positive step,"" said 54-year-old accountant Isabel Martin. ""But to vote for a party you need more reasons.""

The member of parliament, Ville Vahamaki of the nationalist Finns Party, denied any wrongdoing in a statement.
Finnish tabloid Iltalehti reported in July he and another member of parliament had been claiming elevated housing allowances for a sauna facility which they had rented from a chief police officer in the basement of an apartment building.
""In practice, I use it for laundry and so forth,"" Vahamaki told the newspaper at the time. 
Vahamaki is suspected of having defrauded parliament of around 13,000 euros ($14,830) in the form of unjustified allowances, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation said in a statement, adding he had already paid the money back.
The prosecutor will now consider the charges. Police found no grounds to suspect the other member of parliament of a similar fraud.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congo opposition parties said election officials were trying to provoke trouble by delaying Sunday's scheduled presidential election, and warned they would not tolerate any move to further postpone the contest.
Felix Tshisekedi, a leading opposition candidate in the Democratic Republic of Congo's presidential contest, urged his supporters to stay calm despite the electoral board's (CENI) decision on Thursday to delay the vote by a week.
The CENI announced the election, which has been delayed several times since 2016, would now take place on Dec. 30 due to a fire last week that destroyed voting materials. 
The poll is meant to choose a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who is due to step down after 18 years in what would be Congo's first democratic transition. 
In remarks to the media and hundreds of chanting supporters, Tshisekedi accused the CENI of trying to provoke his followers to protest in order to later accuse them of inciting trouble.
""We are aware of this strategy. That's why I ask you to remain calm and respect the position that we are announcing,"" Tshisekedi said at the headquarters of his Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) party.
UDPS secretary-general Jean-Marc Kabund added in response to questions from the media that any further delays would not be accepted, saying that the new election date was ""a red line"". 
""If there is a delay of the election after the 30th, you don't need to wait for our instructions,"" Kabund said. 
Kabila's refusal to step down when his mandate officially expired in December 2016 sparked violent protests in which security forces killed dozens of people and contributed to a spike in militia violence across the country.
Security forces have cracked down in the past week on supporters of Tshisekedi and the other leading opposition candidate, Martin Fayulu, who are competing against Kabila's preferred candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. 

At least seven opposition supporters were killed last week, and Kinshasa's governor suspended campaigning in the capital on Wednesday, citing security fears.

About 100 protesters scuffled with police at a central square in Lisbon, while in the northern city of Braga some access roads were blocked early in the day.
""The reason why I joined this protest today is because this really is the voice of the people,"" said Joao Viana, 50. 
""The movement is not aligned to any political party and we simply want to tell the government that we are tired of corruption, we are tired of taxes, we are tired of paying to sustain the political class.""
The Socialist government had put 20,000 police on alert, yet there were no serious interruptions to traffic at the major intersections targeted by the protesters in Lisbon. 
Portugal has no real tradition of violent protests, unlike in France where the movement began. 
The French ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) protesters - named after the high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their cars - launched their demonstration in mid-November to rally against fuel tax increases.
The movement has since evolved into a wider backlash against the economic reforms of French President Emmanuel Macron, and protests in Paris this month were marred by major outbreaks of violence and vandalism.
Some copycat protests have flared up in other countries such as Belgium.
Portugal's minority government, which is backed by two far-left parties in parliament, has recently cut some taxes and raised the wages of civil servants in an effort to reverse austerity measures launched during Portugal's 2010-14 debt crisis.

Lebanese politicians have indicated a government deal is close but have to announce a final agreement. Speaking about the government formation at a Beirut conference, Hariri said: ""God willing we will finish today.""
Efforts to form the government have been obstructed by conflicting demands for cabinet seats that must be parceled out in line with a finely balanced, sectarian political system.
Heavily indebted and suffering from a stagnant economy, Lebanon is in dire need of an administration that can set about long-stalled reforms to put public debt on a sustainable footing.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Doctor Khalil Agha was working at a hospital in northwest Syria when masked gunmen knocked at his door, waved a piece of paper saying he was wanted by a powerful Islamist group, and bundled him into their car, bound and blindfold.
The surgeon, whose captors demanded $100,000 for his freedom, was one of 10 medical personnel who doctors say have been seized this year in a rebel-held region sinking into anarchy.
A deal between Russia and Turkey three months ago averted a Syrian army offensive to recapture the region, centered around Idlib province. But cuts in foreign funding - both to militant groups and local police struggling to assert some order - have undermined security.
Now medical workers are feeling the impact as armed gangs compete for influence and money. Doctors are targeted because they are well-known, comparatively well-paid and inclined to express views that put them at odds with their kidnappers. 
For the first five years of the civil war, until the end of 2016, there were almost no attacks on medics, said Munther Khalil, head of the Idlib Health Directorate. ""But in the last two years, there have been explosive devices that target our cars, car thefts, detentions and assassination attempts.""
Four months ago Agha was working a shift at his hospital in eastern Lattakia province, near Idlib, when he heard a knock. He opened the door to find two armed men who told him he was wanted by a court run by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which controls much of the region.
They tied his hands and covered his eyes. ""It wasn't until they released me seven days later that I saw daylight,"" he said.
His kidnappers accused him of working with Turkey, foreign NGOs and another Syrian opposition group and demanded $100,000 from his wife. She sold her jewelry and his car, and borrowed money from as many people as she could to pay the ransom.
NORTHWEST UNREST
The arrival of tens of thousands of fighters and civilians from defeated rebel enclaves elsewhere in Syria has made a bad situation worse in the northwest, the last major bastion of opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
""The number of factions increased, and the fighting between factions increased as some groups took control and others went extinct,"" Agha said.
""Everyone started working alone, according to their own agenda - religious or political - leaving no one in complete control,"" he said. 
The area is held by an array of rebels, the most powerful being Tahrir al-Sham, an amalgamation of Islamist groups dominated by the former Nusra Front - an al Qaeda offshoot until it distanced itself from the group in 2016.
Other groups fight under the rebel Free Syrian Army banner with Turkish backing, in an alliance called the ""National Front for Liberation"".
Foreign payments to several factions were halted following a U.S. decision to halt its funding program last year, cutting off groups that depended almost wholly on donations from outside and driving some to kidnapping to make ends meet.
Earlier this year, a cut in British support ended funding for projects including an independent police force. 
The Free Syrian Police, which operates only in rebel-held areas outside the control of Tahrir al-Sham, was unarmed in accordance with a deal with Western backers - the United States, Britain, Denmark, Netherlands, Canada and Germany.
Since the funding ended, some policemen have taken up arms. But they cannot defend civilians and doctors against kidnappings by armed groups in areas out of their control.
""We don't have a magic wand,"" said Colonel Maher Ghrebeh. 
The funding cut also forced policemen to find other jobs to make ends meet, undermining their security work, said General Fouad al-Sweid, head of the Idlib Free Police. ""Policemen are being forced to leave work and go work in their olive groves, harvest potatoes, work as laborers or bakers.""
""NEITHER WAR NOR PEACE""
Over the summer, doctors in Idlib went on a three-day strike to protest against the kidnappings and rampant insecurity. Some doctors started carrying small arms for protection, though others said that would not protect them. 
""What good would a light weapon be in the face of an armed group?"" said one pharmacist who was recently abducted.
The pharmacist, who asked not to be named, was doing his rounds in a village in Idlib when he was stopped by masked men. Armed and riding a pickup truck with a mounted rifle, the seven men forced him to abandon his car, blindfolded him and took away his phone.
They then drove him to an unidentified location and put him in a dark, guarded room, where he was held for five days and tortured. They sent recordings of the torture to his wife and demanded $150,000 in exchange for his release.
The pharmacist's wife sold all her jewelry and borrowed money until she had $18,000, negotiating the armed group down to that amount and won his release. 
Agha didn't go back to his hospital for three months after being freed, and he now has a list of 29 people he owes money.
He says he's still afraid, but despite friends warning him against returning, he's back doing surgery at the hospital.
In the relative lull which followed September's truce, Agha says they almost miss the bombs. 
""We wish for bombardment and clashes, because people get distracted,"" he said with a weak laugh. ""The situation we're in, neither war nor peace, is a disaster.""

SYDNEY/SEOUL (Reuters) - The abrupt resignation of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sparked concern among Asia-Pacific allies who credit the retired general with building trust and tempering isolationist impulses, regional officials and analysts said on Friday.
The region - which includes strong U.S. allies Japan, South Korea and Australia - hosts some of the world's most volatile flashpoints, with high tension on the Korean peninsula and China's militarization of the South China Sea causing friction.
Mattis, who embraced America's traditional alliances, said he was quitting after falling out with President Donald Trump over foreign policy, including surprise decisions this week to pull troops from Syria and start planning a drawdown in Afghanistan.
""He has generally been referred to as one of the adults in the Trump administration,"" Australian government Senator Jim Molan told The Australian newspaper. 
He said his departure was concerning because it introduced ""another extreme variable"" into U.S. decision making. 
Mattis has been a vocal critic of China's increasing presence in the South China Sea but he worked to ensure tensions did not boil over.
""He's been the point of continuity and the gatekeeper in the administration that they've relied on most to temper the instincts of Trump, which are much more, I think, isolationist and clearly highly skeptical ... about alliance commitments,"" said foreign policy and security analyst Euan Graham, executive director of La Trobe Asia at Australia's La Trobe University.
Mattis' departure also robs Australia, without a U.S. ambassador since 2016, of a key ally in the Trump administration.
""Australia has always had the ear of Mattis,"" a U.S.-based diplomatic source told Reuters.
Australia has had roughly 800 troops in the Middle East since 2014, mostly based in Iraq, as part of coalition efforts to combat the Islamic State group.
About 300 troops are based in Afghanistan, where they have had a presence since not long after the war began 17 years ago.
Trump announced on Wednesday that U.S. troops in Syria would be withdrawn, a decision that upended U.S. policy in the region.
A U.S. official said on Thursday Trump was planning to withdraw at least 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Mattis had advocated for a strong U.S. military presence to bolster diplomatic peace efforts there.
Adam Mount, defense analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, said Mattis was a steady hand on North Korea and was instrumental in preventing a war.
""Mattis was bailing water out of an alliance being buffeted by an erratic president, an advancing North Korea, and an increasingly assertive China,"" Mount said. 

""His work kept the alliance afloat but major questions will have to be resolved to keep it strong,"" he said.

""I send my prayers and good wishes to all those who will be marking this solemn anniversary,"" she said.
Libyan intelligence officer Abdel Basset al-Megrahi was found guilty of the bombing, along with others who were never identified, and was jailed for life in 2001. 
Megrahi was later released because he was suffering from cancer. He died in 2012.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Jimmy Martinez, a 22-year old Salvadoran who has traveled north since October in a caravan of Central American migrants seeking to reach the United States, wears his shorts low and baggy and his hair slicked back like his favorite U.S. hip hop artists.
Like many other young Central Americans who have traveled thousands of miles to this Mexican city with hopes of crossing the border into California, he said U.S. music videos and Hollywood films have formed his vision of the American Dream.
""I want to go to Miami because it looks so nice in films like 'Fast and Furious',"" said Martinez, who is fleeing street gangs in El Salvador, a country with one of the highest homicide rates in the world.
He said the gangs killed his father, uncle and cousin and threatened to come after him. After weeks of walking and hitching rides, he arrived in Tijuana. He has been working in construction but hopes to study to become a psychologist in the United States.
""I want to be there to have more security and a better future,"" he said.
Also sheltering in a squalid camp in Tijuana, Anyi Loan Mejia, 22, from Honduras, said she dreamed of New York City's bright lights and skyscrapers, that she had seen in films.
She said she believed ""you can walk there without danger ... and that I could have things there I couldn't in Honduras, like a good job, wage and house, healthcare.""
Wearing black leggings, a white t-shirt and crimson lipstick, Loan Mejia said she always liked to look her best, no matter how difficult her living conditions. Like many of the migrants in Tijuana, she is living in a tent.
All those interviewed for this story said they did not have enough food and water or facilities to go to the bathroom and wash. 
Still, Loan Mejia's friend Damaris Tejeda said she was wearing combat trousers and a sports t-shirt because that is how she imagined from films and the news media that Americans dress.
""My dream is to have the opportunity there of studying and working,"" said the 15-year old, who had to leave school early to help provide for her family.
All the young migrants agreed on one point: even if they did not manage to cross to the United States this time, they would never give up on their American dream.
""I would feel sad and defeated if I don't make it this time,"" said Martinez. ""But I would come back and try again - as many times as necessary.""

The mandate of the mission will remain unchanged despite Italy's threats to quit it if migrants rescued at sea by the operation's ships were not shared among EU states.
Operation Sophia was launched in June 2015 to counter migrant smugglers in the central Mediterranean and reduce arrivals to European shores.
By strengthening the coastguard of Libya, the country from which most migrants have in recent years attempted the perilous journey toward Europe, the mission has contributed to bringing down arrivals from more than a million in 2015 to a tenth of that figure this year.
Despite the drop in arrivals, Italy's far-right home affairs minister Matteo Salvini has pushed for months to change the mandate of the mission to make sure migrants picked up in the Mediterranean are shared among EU countries instead of being mostly brought to Italian ports.
Under international rules, enshrined in Sophia's mandate, people saved at sea must be delivered to the closest and safest ports, which in most cases are in Italy, given the mission's area of intervention. 
The mission also has its headquarters in Rome.
Salvini had threatened to bar Sophia's ships from bringing migrants to Italian ports if the rules were not changed, but the mission mandate has been extended with no changes, an EU official said.
The three-month prolongation of the mission is meant to give more time to negotiators to find a compromise before a possible longer extension of Sophia.

A United Nations panel of human rights experts said in August it had received many credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uighurs in China were being held in what resembled a ""massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy"".
The United Nations called for the immediate release of those detained on the ""pretext of countering terrorism"". 
Opposition groups in Indonesia, has the world's largest Muslim population, have criticized President Joko Widodo for not providing enough support for China's Uighur community.
""The United Nations must speak out, the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) must speak out, Muslims must take a stand against the Chinese government,"" said protester Ridwan Abdul Ridho said on Friday. 
China says Xinjiang faces a threat from Islamist militants and separatists. It rejects all accusations of mistreatment and denies mass internment, although Chinese officials have said some citizens guilty of minor offences were being sent to vocational centers to work.
China worries that Uighurs, who speak a Turkic language, have gone to places like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and Iraq to fight for militants.
The Indonesian foreign ministry said it had summoned the Chinese envoy in Jakarta to ""convey concern from various parties in Indonesia on the condition of people of Uighur in China"" and called on China to respect freedom of religion.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 06:35AM ET</span>",Myanmar army pauses operations in north in rare conciliatory action,"By Shoon Naing and Thu Thu Aung
(Reuters) - The Myanmar military on Friday announced a more than four-month cessation of its activities in northern areas where it is fighting ethnic minority insurgents, in what appeared to be a rare conciliatory move aimed at kick-starting peace talks.
The army would ""stop military operations in respective military regions"" in the north and east of the country until April 30, 2019, the office of the military's commander in chief said in a statement.
The cessation would allow military negotiators to conduct talks with insurgent groups that have refused to sign up to a nationwide ceasefire agreement, with the aim of completing a peace process by 2020, it said.
Government spokesman Zaw Htay said the military had informed the civilian administration led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi ahead of the announcement, and that the two sides were ""cooperating"" on the peace process.
""We hope there will be good results,"" Zaw Htay told a news conference in the capital, Naypyitaw.
Suu Kyi prioritized ending the conflicts on coming to power in 2016, but talks have failed to make significant gains.
The Myanmar military has been engaged in multiple conflicts for decades with groups who say they represent the interests of ethnic minorities that want more autonomy in their regions.
The military said its commands in the northern Kachin State and Shan State to the northeast would be affected by the cessation, after a coalition of groups fighting there asked for a pause in the conflict this month.
More than 100,000 people have been displaced by clashes between the army and insurgents since a ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army broke down in 2011.
Maung Maung Soe, a political analyst based in Yangon, said it was the first time in at least three decades that the military had unilaterally announced a stop in fighting.
""Peace for the whole country will depend on further discussions with each group,"" he said, noting that there would be concern that the announcement does not cover the troubled western state of Rakhine.
The Friday announcement did not make specific reference to Rakhine, where the military has battled both Buddhist and Rohingya Muslim insurgents in recent years.
The military launched a crackdown in response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) in August 2017, which claims to represent the stateless Rohingya Muslim minority. Myanmar considers the group ""terrorists"" and they are not included in any negotiations.
U.N.-mandated investigators said the military committed killings, gang rape and arson in a campaign carried out with ""genocidal intent"" that pushed more than 730,000 Rohingya across Myanmar's border to Bangladesh.
Myanmar denied that saying it conducted a legitimate counter-terrorist campaign.
In recent weeks, fighting has flared up between the army and a Rakhine Buddhist group, the Arakan Army, in mountainous parts of the western state.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs received reports that more than 700 people had been displaced by that fighting since Dec. 8, said Pierre Peron, a spokesman for the agency.

The bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway were found on Monday in the Atlas Mountains, on the way to Toubkal, North Africa's highest peak and a popular hiking destination.
Moroccan authorities have said four suspects arrested over the murder had pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a video posted on social media before the killings. The women were found with knife wounds to the neck, Morocco said.
A separate video of the actual deaths, also on social media, was likely to be real, Norwegian police said.
""When it comes to the assessment of the video that purportedly shows the killings, there is still a certain amount of technical analysis and assessment to be done,"" Norway's National Crime Investigation Service said in a statement.
""We still believe, however, that we have grounds to say that so far, there is nothing concrete to show that this video is not real."" 
Norwegian police were not immediately available for further comment, while their Danish counterparts said they were was still analyzing the video.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Explainer: How drones caused travel chaos at Britain's Gatwick airport,"By Alistair Smout and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - London Gatwick Airport reopened on Friday after a rogue drone saboteur wrought travel chaos for hundreds of thousands of Christmas travellers. [nL3N1YQ2H1]
The perpetrator, or perpetrators, have not yet been caught. Here are some details of the incident.
WHAT HAPPENED?
Flights were halted at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted near the airfield. The airstrip was reopened briefly on Thursday but had to be closed again after another sighting.
By midday on Thursday, Gatwick was describing the ""ongoing drone activity around the airfield"" as ""what appears to be a deliberate attempt"" to disrupt flights.
In the afternoon, the army was drafted in to Gatwick to deploy ""specialist equipment"", the Ministry of Defence said.
On Friday morning, Gatwick reopened for a limited number of flights, though warned there would be continued disruption.
Gatwick's chief operating officer said measures had been put in place to give him confidence to re-open the airport, even though the perpetrator had not been caught.
Transport Minister Chris Grayling said military technology had been deployed as the sort of anti-drone capability needed was not yet commercially available.
THE INCIDENT IN NUMBERS
Flights resumed more than 30 hours after the initial closure.
On Thursday, 665 flights were cancelled, a Gatwick spokesman said, adding of the 837 flights scheduled for Friday, 155 had been cancelled by 0848 GMT.
About 120,000 people have been affected by the disruption, with thousands more affected on Friday.
EasyJet is the biggest operator at the airport, accounting for 40 percent of all traffic, with IAG's British Airways having 15.1 percent and Norwegian Air Shuttle on 12.5 percent, according to broker Goodbody.
Gatwick is the second biggest airport in Britain and the eighth biggest in Europe.
HAS THIS HAPPENED BEFORE?
Aviation experts and Grayling said the length of disruption at an airport the size of Gatwick was unprecedented.
Aerospace trade organisation ADS said Dubai airport was shut a number of times in 2016, but the longest period was for under two hours. Gatwick had brief runway closures in July 2017.
Richard Parker, head of air traffic management technology firm Altitude Angel, said this was the first time a major airport had been hit by such a sustained and deliberate incursion into its airspace.
""It's sophisticated - not from a technology side, but it's organised. People have charged lots of batteries and are deliberately trying to avoid being caught, probably by driving around to different locations,"" he told Reuters.
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?
The government said it was not yet clear who was responsible. No group has claimed responsibility.
WHY NOT SHOOT IT DOWN?
""You can't just fire weapons haphazardly in what is a built up area around the airport, because there are consequences if that goes wrong,"" Grayling said.
However, police on Monday were more bullish about the prospects of taking any drone down from the sky, should it reappear. Jason Tingley, head of crime at Sussex Police, said it was now a ""tactical option"".
WILL PASSENGERS BE COMPENSATED?
The Civil Aviation Authority said it considered the event an ""extraordinary circumstance"" meaning airlines are not obliged to pay compensation to affected passengers. 
Airlines will have to refund customers who no longer wish to travel and try to reschedule flights to get passengers to their destinations. 
Grayling said he hoped the insurance industry would take an ""enlightened"" view of the incident.

""It goes beyond what the airline is responsible for. This is something that should be covered under travel insurance policies,"" he said.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury said it would lift sanctions on the core empire of Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, including Rusal and its parent En+, as they have agreed to restructure to reduce Deripaska's stakes.
The deal is a corporate matter for Rusal only, Peskov said, when asked whether the Kremlin had approved it. Rusal is the world's largest aluminum producer outside China. 
""Certainly, Oleg Deripaska is fighting for this company. This company plays a significant role not only in the Russian economy, but also a significant role in the global economy,"" he added.
Deals with ""strategic"" Russian companies the size of Rusal, which employs 62,000 people in Russia and other countries, are usually subject to close attention from the Kremlin. Russia also has a history of defending large groups to prevent them falling into foreign control.
The deal was probably approved by Russian officials, analysts said on Thursday.
""If the company manages to take some action to minimize the consequences of illegal restrictions ... we can only welcome that,"" Peskov said.
The deal is subject to a 30-day review, during which the U.S. Congress may pass a joint resolution of approval or disapproval.

If approved, half of En+'s new board of directors board will become U.S. or British nationals. Deripaska will reduce his stake and his voting rights will be limited. He will have up to four representatives in En+'s board, where eight more directors will be independent.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>","Canadian held in China questioned daily, no lawyer, can't turn off light: sources","By Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - A former Canadian diplomat detained in China is being denied legal representation and is not allowed to turn the lights off at night, people familiar with the situation said, offering new details on the closely watched case.
China last week detained two Canadians - Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and an adviser with the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank, and businessman Michael Spavor - after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Dec 1.
Canada arrested Meng at the request of the United States, which is engaged in a trade war with China. Meng faces extradition to the United States to face fraud charges which carry a maximum sentence of 30 years jail for each charge.
China has given only vague details of why they have detained the two Canadians, saying they are suspected of engaging in activities that endangered China's security, and has not drawn a direct link to Meng's arrest. 
Canada has said the detentions are unacceptable and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said China should free the men. ICG President Robert Malley has also called for Kovrig's release. 
The sources familiar with Kovrig's case said he was taken away at around 10 p.m. (1400GMT) on Monday last week while on a street in Beijing.
China formally notified the Canadian government of Kovrig's detention two days later, at 4 p.m. (0800GMT) on Wednesday last week. 
Canada only gained consular access to him at a police station on Friday last week, when he was visited for half an hour by the Canadian ambassador and two other Canadian diplomats, the sources said.
""He's not allowed to apply for bail and not allowed to see a lawyer,"" said one source, adding Kovrig was being held at an undisclosed location, questioned every morning, afternoon and evening and not allowed to turn the lights off at night.
He is also only allowed one consular visit a month and is not allowed to see family or loved ones.
""He is physically all right but tired and stressed,"" the source said. ""Physically he does not appear mistreated.""
Two other people familiar with the case corroborated the details.
A third person said Kovrig was being confined to a single room, but despite the stress remained lucid.
""Our previous comments on this case stand,"" said Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, when asked about Kovrig.
The comments on Kovrig from the sources were made in recent days. All the sources requested anonymity citing the sensitivity of the situation.
Under Chinese criminal procedure law, special forms of detention and interrogation can be used for state security suspects. 
Rights groups say conditions in Chinese detention facilities are often basic and can be harsh, with lack of legal representation and due process compounding worries about treatment.
In 2015, a British corporate investigator accused Chinese officials of deliberately withholding medical treatment while he was in jail to try to force him to confess to a role in a scandal involving drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc.
While details are unclear, it is possible Kovrig is being held in a form of detention known as ""residential surveillance at a designated location"", according to Hong Kong-based Amnesty International East Asia Research Director Joshua Rosenzweig.
Previous reported experiences of individuals held under this measure have included prolonged questioning, close and constant monitoring and sleep deprivation, Rosenzweig said.
Both the United Nations and Amnesty have singled out this form of detention as ""creating a potent environment for abuse aimed at extracting confessions, which are highly prized in China's criminal justice system"", he said. 
'LAWFUL RIGHTS'
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Friday the details of Kovrig's detention and treatment needed to be checked, and referred specific questions to the ""relevant authorities"".
The Ministry of State Security, which is leading the investigation into Kovrig, has no publicly available contact details.
""We have already said that China has in accordance with the law guaranteed Michael Kovrig's lawful rights and humanitarian treatment,"" Hua told a daily news briefing.
Canada has been provided ""necessary help"" to get consular access, she said.
""I don't know whether you paid attention to the treatment or the human rights of the Chinese citizen who was illegally detained in Canada at the request of the United States?"" Hua said, referring to Huawei's Meng.
A Canadian court last week granted Meng bail. Among conditions of her bail, the 46-year-old executive must wear an ankle monitor and stay at home from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. 
The Canadian government has said several times it saw no explicit link between the arrest of Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, and the detentions of Kovrig and Spavor.
But Beijing-based Western diplomats and former Canadian diplomats have said they believed the detention of the Canadians were a ""tit-for-tat"" reprisal by China.
If a Canadian judge rules the case against Meng is strong enough, Canada's justice minister must next decide whether to extradite her to the United States. If so, Meng would face U.S. charges of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions.
No details have been revealed about Spavor's detention.

China on Thursday said a third, female Canadian was undergoing ""administrative punishment"" for working illegally, after Canada's government confirmed the detention.

For Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, the choice of the venue is both a show of resolve not to allow full independence and part of a strategy to secure the survival of his minority government in Madrid with the help of Catalonian pro-independence parties by negotiating a greater degree of autonomy with their leaders.
On Thursday night, Sanchez met Catalonia's pro-independence regional government head Quim Torra. They agreed to open a deeper dialogue and to work to reach a political solution to the conflict.
Nine separatist leaders being held in detention called on Thursday for large but peaceful protests to greet Sanchez; last year dozens were injured in numerous confrontations between national police and pro-independence protesters.
There were further signs of a spirit of compromise as four of the leaders ended a hunger strike, and their party said it would support Sanchez's broad plan for the national budget in 2019 and 2020, currently blocked.
The region unilaterally declared independence in October 2017, triggering Spain's worst political crisis in decades and prompting the previous conservative central government to seize control there for several months. Spain's constitution prohibits regions from breaking away. 
National police will be deployed in Barcelona again to guard the cabinet meeting due to fears of violence.
Activist networks known as the Committees for the Defence of the Republic began blocking various roads in and around Barcelona in the early hours of Friday, and planned to rally in the city center before noon. A large rally organized by the leftist pro-independence CUP party is planned in the evening. 
Still, Antonio Barroso of London-based political consultants Teneo wrote in a research note that apparent divisions between the more radical and moderate secessionists, which had resulted in recent positive signals, were ""more relevant than upcoming protests"".
He said a strategy of moderation ""seems to be making inroads, opening the door to a potential negotiation around the budget"".
The Socialists control fewer than a quarter of seats in the Madrid parliament and need the support of smaller parties, including Catalan nationalists, to pass legislation.

Failure to approve the 2019 budget could topple Sanchez's government, raising the possibility of a right-of-center government with stronger centralist preferences coming to power -- a risk some Catalan politicians would prefer to avoid.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's media regulator said on Friday it would carry out checks to determine if the BBC World News channel and BBC internet sites complied with Russian law, a move it described as a response to British pressure on a Russian TV channel. 
Roskomnadzor, the regulator, said in a statement its checks were Russia's response to a decision by British media regulator Ofcom, which on Thursday said that Russian broadcaster RT had broken impartiality rules in some of its news and current affairs programs.
""The results of our check will be announced separately,"" the Russian regulator said.
There was no immediate comment from either the BBC or Ofcom.
Ofcom said on Thursday it was considering imposing some kind of sanction on RT, which is financed by the Russian state. It took issue in particular with its coverage of the poisoning in Britain of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter.
Britain has accused agents working for Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, of committing the crime, an allegation Moscow denies.
British Media Secretary Jeremy Wright also weighed in on Thursday, saying what he called RT's mask as an impartial news provider was slipping. 
RT rejected Ofcom's findings, saying Ofcom had ignored its explanations and not paid ""due regard"" to its rights.
Commenting on the launch of the Russian investigation on Friday, Margarita Simonyan, RT's editor-in-chief, said on Twitter that Ofcom had hinted that it planned to strip her channel of its broadcasting license in Britain.
""(Welcome to the) brave new world,"" she wrote.
""I assume they (the Russian regulator) will now look to see if the BBC expresses alternative points of view. With a microscope."" 

Russian state media has criticized the BBC in recent days, accusing it of trying to falsely prove that Moscow was involved in whipping up street protests in France, a charge that Russia rejects.

""We ask President Jokowi to immediately withdraw troops,"" Papua Governor Lukas Enembe told reporters on Thursday, referring to President Joko Widodo by his nickname.
""The presence of Indonesian military and National Police personnel in Nduga has traumatized the community ... resulting in them seeking refuge in the forest,"" Enembe said.
Members of the military wing of the Free Papua Movement (OPM) claimed responsibility for killing at least 16 people working on a bridge on a high-profile road project, and a soldier, in the Nduga area.
At least 300 villagers were reported last week to have fled into the forest to escape the military sweep.
Papua has been plagued by a separatist conflict since the former Dutch colony was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969.
Enembe said the community should be allowed to celebrate Christmas in peace.
""We pay our respects to the past and present victims, but this is enough. There must be no further civilian casualties,"" he said.
A spokesman for Widodo was not immediately able to comment on the matter, but the military rejected Enembe's call.
Provincial military spokesman Muhammad Aidi said forces were searching for the remains of four of the victims of the attack on the bridge and they would not leave.
""If the governor, Lukas Enembe, poses in support of the Free Papua Movement struggle and rejects the national strategic program policy, he has violated state law and should be prosecuted,"" Aidi said.
Enembe did not say what action he thought should be taken against those responsible for the killings, but said in past attacks separatists had fled the area immediately. 
The provincial parliament would look in to the incident with the National Human Rights Commission, he said.
The rebels have rejected a call to surrender and have demanded a referendum on the future of the area.
Widodo wants to develop impoverished Papua and tap its resources and has tried to ease tensions and address rights concerns while stepping up investment with projects like the Trans Papua highway.

The OPM has said it views the project workers as members of the military and casualties in their war against the government.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Top judges from China's Supreme People's Court have made a rare defense of the death penalty, with one saying ""a life for a life"" is ingrained among the people, and backed ""social credit"" blacklists as necessary to made people repay their debts.
President Xi Jinping has urged widespread reforms to the legal system, pledging to tackle miscarriages of justice and to strengthen the leadership of the ruling Chinese Communist Party over the courts.
But rights groups say the reforms fail to ensure fair trials, guard against rights abuses or restrict use of the death penalty. Amnesty International said on Tuesday that China is failing to restrict the use of the death penalty to the most serious crimes only, in line with international norms.
Despite efforts to reduce executions, China could not abolish the system which would risk angering a public that overwhelmingly supports its use, Li Xiao, a top judge, told reporters late on Thursday, during a promotional visit to the Supreme Court.
""For thousands of years, the idea of 'a life for a life' has been deeply ingrained among ordinary folk... If we released the figure, then ordinary folk would say too few were killed,"" she said.
The Supreme People's Court is responsible for review and approval of all death sentences before they are carried out.
Beijing considers the number of people executed in China each year to be state secret. International human rights organizations estimate the figure at around 2,000.
Judges also defended China's nascent social credit system, saying that restrictions on luxury purchases, such as flights or high-speed train tickets, are a good way to get people to fulfill their court-mandated debt repayments.
China's lack of a system for dealing with individual bankruptcy, as there is in the United States, means that such restrictions are necessary, Liu Guixiang, another judge, told reporters. 
""If I am bankrupt and say that I cannot repay my debts, then I enjoy a luxurious, extravagant life day to day - I reckon you would be put in jail for that in the West,"" Liu said.
The court's blacklists for individuals who fail to carry out court-mandated tasks, such as repaying debts, are a part of a plan to build a ""social credit"" system to punish citizens more effectively for illegal behavior and encourage actions deemed socially beneficial.
The system is being tried out in a handful of cities and punishments are largely linked to industry-specific blacklists, but some observers have expressed concerns that it may be abused to compel people or companies to toe the party line.

The nuclear negotiators of the United States and South Korea held a meeting in Seoul of a working group they launched last month to boost policy coordination on North Korea. 
They explored ways to improve the delivery of humanitarian aid, which relief groups say has been sharply limited by the United States' strict enforcement of international sanctions imposed because of the North's nuclear and missile programs, the envoys said. 
Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea, said on Wednesday he would meet U.S. aid groups early next year and review Washington's aid policy.
South Korea's envoy, Lee Do-hoon, said the United States agreed to support South Korea's plan to provide the flu drug Tamiflu to the North as part of the discussions.
The move is aimed at kick-starting nuclear diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang, Biegun said, as they struggle to find a breakthrough in stalled negotiations. 
""Of course all of this is intended to advance what we're trying to do with North Korea,"" Biegun told reporters. 

""Now that work begins with denuclearization but also includes the strong commitments by both of our countries to transform relations and build a permanent peace regime on the Korean peninsula,"" he said.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 12:12AM ET</span>",Sacred and political: world's largest religious festival to kick off in India,"By Alasdair Pal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Spirituality, politics and tourism: welcome to the Kumbh Mela, the world's largest gathering of humanity, that begins next month in India. 
During the Kumbh Mela, to be held in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, millions of pilgrims including naked, ash-smeared ascetics, will bathe at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna, and a mythical third river, the Saraswati. 
Devout Hindus believe that bathing in the waters of the Ganges absolves people of sins and bathing at the time of the Kumbh brings salvation from the cycle of life and death.
The government says about 100 million to 150 million people, including one million foreign tourists, are expected to attend over the eight-week festival period beginning on January 15, and the scale of the efforts to feed and house the pilgrims is immense. 
Organizers are erecting temporary bridges, 600 mass kitchens, more than 100,000 portable toilets, and vast tents, each sleeping thousands of pilgrims at a time, in a pop-up city on the banks of the two rivers. 
And yet, based on tradition, there shouldn't be quite such a giant event next year - which is where politics and tourism promotion comes in.
The Kumbh Mela is traditionally held every three years in one of four cities along India's sacred rivers, with one of the largest of those in Prayagraj. The next Kumbh Mela, meaning ""festival of the pot"", was due to be held in the city in 2025. 
But with a general election due by May in which the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) faces a tough contest, the northern state of Uttar Pradesh has transformed a smaller Ardh, or ""half"" Kumbh Mela, into a full version of the festival. 
The BJP controls both the federal and the Uttar Pradesh governments. 
And this ""half Kumbh"" may by some measures end up being one of the biggest Kumbhs yet because of the state's massive promotional efforts, especially as Prayagraj – which until recently was known as Allahabad - is seen as the holiest of the four sites.
Besides the upcoming election, the promotion coincides with an international charm offensive to improve the image of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state of more than 220 million people with a reputation for poverty and violence. 
But the state's chief minister Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu monk who is close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has an eye for publicity, has also been driving support for any event that celebrates the dominance of Hindu culture in India, and marginalizes the nation's Muslim minority. 
    
PLACE OF SACRIFICE
It was Adityanath who in October renamed Allahabad, a city of six million where there are nearly 800,000 Muslims, as Prayagraj, from its ancient name of Prayag meaning ""place of sacrifice"" in Sanskrit. 
Allahabad is a Muslim name given to the city by a Mughal emperor in 1575.
""It is part of a Hindu nationalist agenda and is very worrying to us,"" said Zafaryab Jilani, a senior member of the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board, that liaises with the government on Muslim affairs. 
""There is no justification for changing these names."" 
Neither side is expecting tensions to lead to violence during the festival, although a stampede at the last Kumbh Mela held in Allahabad in 2013, as it was then known, killed 42. 
""Muslims have always respected the Kumbh. We will not challenge it in public,"" Jilani said.  
Officials do not expect clashes either, but have boosted the number of police on duty compared with previous events. 
""People who are not involved will not come,"" said a state official involved in the preparations. ""This is not a problem for us.""
But he added: ""To ensure security and safety, there will be five times the number of police officers compared to the previous Kumbh."" 
Officials say the festival won't be a ""half"" event by any means.
""This is the way we are taking it forward. There is nothing which is half,"" said Awanish Kumar Awasthi, a senior official in charge of tourism in the Uttar Pradesh government.     
The state government has promoted the Kumbh Mela at several tourism expositions in Europe, and has invited representatives of every country in the world to attend. Last Saturday, foreign diplomats visited Prayagraj to witness the set-up. 

The festival has its roots in a Hindu tradition that says the god Vishnu wrested a golden pot containing the nectar of immortality from demons. In a 12-day fight for possession, four drops fell to earth, in the cities of Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain and Nasik, who share the Kumbhs as a result.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 10:02PM ET</span>","U.S. plans for more than 5,000 troops to be withdrawn from Afghanistan","By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is planning to withdraw more than 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a U.S. official said on Thursday, in the latest sign Trump's patience is thinning with America's longest war and overseas military interventions.
On Wednesday, Trump rebuffed top advisers and decided to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria, a decision that contributed to U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis abruptly quitting on Thursday over significant policy differences with the president.
One official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a decision had been made and verbal orders had been given to start planning for the drawdown. The official said timelines were being discussed but it could happen in weeks or months.
It is unclear how the United States with less than 9,000 forces in Afghanistan will be able to fulfill the full set of missions now underway, including training Afghan forces, advising them in the field, and waging an air campaign against the Taliban and other militant groups. 
Instead, the United States almost certainly would have to curtail its missions, something that could provide an opportunity for a resurgent Taliban to expand their offensives across Afghanistan.
Mattis had argued for maintaining a strong U.S. military presence in Afghanistan to bolster diplomatic peace efforts. He resigned shortly after U.S. officials raised the possibility that Trump would order the drawdown. 
The decision on Syria has bewildered U.S. allies and triggered harsh reaction from Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress. 
The Pentagon declined to comment on Afghanistan.
Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the White House would not comment ""on future strategic developments.""
The United States went to war in Afghanistan in 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, seeking to oust the Taliban militants harboring Saudi-raised militant Osama bin Laden, who led plans to carry out the attacks.
U.S. officials are currently engaged in talks with the Taliban, who now control a significant amount of territory. The Taliban insurgency has strengthened its grip over the past three years, with the government in Kabul controlling just 56 percent of Afghanistan, down from 72 percent in 2015, a U.S. government report showed.
Trump privately has been grousing about U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, telling an ally as recently as Wednesday words to the effect of, ""What are we doing there? We've been there all these years.""
The source, who asked to remain unidentified, said it appeared the president ""has lost all patience"" with the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan.
More than 2,400 U.S. forces have died in the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan, and Pentagon officials have repeatedly warned that a precipitous exit would allow militants to develop new plots on America.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, often a vocal Trump ally, warned of possible danger to the United States if the drawdown goes through.
""The conditions in Afghanistan - at the present moment - make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy. If we continue on our present course we are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 9/11,"" Graham said in a statement.
Trump last year approved an increase in U.S. troops but acknowledged that he did so reluctantly. 
Late last month, at least 22 Afghan police were killed in a Taliban ambush in Afghanistan's western province of Farah, adding to the growing casualty toll on Afghan security forces.
Earlier this week, U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives held talks in Abu Dhabi on a deal that would end the war. Officials from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also took part. 
The Saudi ambassador to Washington, Khalid bin Salman, tweeted on Thursday that the discussions had been productive and would bring ""very positive results by the beginning of next year.""
But a former senior State Department official familiar with the issue said that the Taliban representatives rejected a proposal by Khalilzad for a ceasefire and demanded that the talks focus on a U.S. withdrawal.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 08:25PM ET</span>",Chilean president removes police chief after shooting controversy,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera asked the country's police chief to resign on Thursday following a growing controversy over the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of an indigenous man in southern Chile.
Last month, Camilo Catrillanca, the grandson of a local Mapuche leader, was shot in the head during a police operation near the town of Ercilla, 480 miles (773 km) south of Santiago in the province of Araucania.
Police originally said they had acted in self-defense when they fired on Catrillanca, a suspect in a recent car theft and assault, but the government and subsequent police reports found that he was unarmed.
The incident prompted fury among opposition parties and human rights activists and triggered widespread protests throughout Chile.
The Pinera administration had come under increasing pressure to remove Hermes Soto, the country's top-ranking police officer, amid accusations Soto had helped cover up problematic details of the incident, or had been unaware all together.
At a news conference at the La Moneda presidential palace late on Thursday, Pinera said he had asked Soto to resign and that 10 other top police generals would depart as well.
""I've reached the conclusion that Chile's police needs new leadership to face, with more will, effectiveness and speed, all of today's problems and the big challenges of the future,"" Pinera told journalists as he read from a prepared statement.
Pinera, who started his speech by praising the police and ended it by expressing his esteem for Soto, said his government was committed to uncovering the truth in the ""unfortunate death"" of Catrillanca.
Soto initially said it was unclear who shot Catrillanca because none of the members of the special forces unit that handled the raid had worn body cameras.
But one of the police officers involved was later spotted in media footage wearing a camera. He told investigators he had destroyed the camera's memory card.
Earlier this week, two additional police videos surfaced in the local media, showing key moments of the raid and raising questions as to the veracity of the original police account.
Pinera said he would purge officers who had provoked a ""credibility crisis"" in the 60,000-strong police force.
""A small group of police have betrayed their oath, dishonored their institution and caused grave harm to society,"" he said.
The Mapuche have long accused the state and private companies of taking their ancestral land, draining its natural resources and using undue violence against them. Their communities are among the poorest in Chile.

830,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 06:39PM ET</span>",U.S. to send migrants back to Mexico to wait out asylum requests,"By Yeganeh Torbati and Anthony Esposito
WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States will soon send non-Mexican migrants who cross the U.S. southern border back to wait in Mexico while their U.S. asylum requests are processed, a major change in immigration policy, the Trump administration announced on Thursday.
Immigrant advocates and human rights experts quickly denounced the policy change as illegal and violating the rights of refugees. 
Mexico's government said that it would accept some of those migrants for humanitarian reasons, in what many will see as an early concession to U.S. President Donald Trump's administration by Mexico's new president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1.
""We want to discourage those who are claiming asylum fraudulently,"" U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told a congressional committee on Thursday, describing the plan.
In response to the plan, Mexico's foreign ministry underscored that it still has the right to admit or reject the entry of foreigners into its territory.
""Mexico's government has decided to take the following actions to benefit migrants, in particular unaccompanied and accompanied minors, and to protect the rights of those who want to start an asylum process in the United States,"" the foreign ministry said.
But there appeared to be initial confusion within the Mexican government about the plan. Tonatiuh Guillén, who as head of Mexico's National Migration Institute regulates migration in the country, said at a news conference on Thursday that the country would not be able to receive migrants from other countries until the regulatory framework had been established. 
“We can't begin to operate, we can't begin to receive. We are not in a place to receive,"" he said. ""When will we able to do it? When the regulatory issues and operational issues are resolved,"" he said. 
Department of Homeland Security officials told reporters on condition of anonymity that the Mexican government has said asylum seekers would have access to attorneys in Mexico and that migrants would be able to enter the United States for their court hearings, without giving more details about how the process would work.
""Operationally this will look a little bit different at different ports of entry simply based on what the infrastructure is like in the area,"" said one official. ""We are not implementing this on the entire U.S. border all at once.""
Nielsen said the new policy will not apply to Central American unaccompanied children, who have some special protections under U.S. law.
The administration is invoking a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act allowing the government to return migrants to a foreign country bordering the United States pending their immigration proceedings. 
""We remain convinced that this is a power that the president was granted by Congress to execute exactly the way we have,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News show host Laura Ingraham. ""We've had lots of thought and legal review of this. We are confident that we are on firm ground."" 
But the section of law being used by the Trump administration exempts anyone who is found inadmissible at the border because of a lack of documents, rather than for a criminal conviction, said Stephen Legomsky, a professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis and a former senior DHS official during the Obama administration.
""That means the exemption to that section would apply to virtually every asylum seeker at the border,"" he said.
'NOT A SAFE COUNTRY'
Serious doubts remain over whether Mexico can keep vulnerable asylum seekers safe. Authorities are investigating the deaths of two Honduran teenagers kidnapped and killed in the border city of Tijuana last weekend.
Immigrant and human rights advocates swiftly denounced the new policy, saying it violated international law and would put migrants at further risk.
""Make no mistake — Mexico is not a safe country for all people seeking protection,"" said Amnesty International Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""Many people seeking asylum in the United States face discrimination, exploitation, sexual assault, murder, or the possibility of being disappeared while traveling through Mexico or while forced to wait for extraordinarily long times in Mexican border towns.""
Trump tweeted on Nov. 24 that migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border would stay in Mexico until their asylum claims were individually approved in U.S. courts.
But Kennji Kizuka of the nonprofit group Human Rights First said serious questions remain about implementation of the plan.
""The administration seems to have no plan,"" Kizuka said in a statement. ""Will lawyers be able to visit their clients before hearings? Where will those hearings take place? We know that access to counsel is one of the most important factors in whether or not an asylum seeker is able to live in safety in the United States.""
The arrival of several thousand Central Americans in Tijuana about a month ago prompted Trump to mobilize the U.S. military to beef up border security. At the same time, the Trump administration has restricted the number of asylum applications accepted per day, saying they do not have the capacity to process more.

Illegal crossings at the southern border have dropped dramatically since the late 1970s, but in recent years applications for asylum have ballooned and more Central American families and unaccompanied children are migrating to the United States.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The 193-member United Nations General Assembly called on the United States on Thursday to implement a 2004 international court ruling by allowing consular access to dozens of Mexicans sentenced to death by U.S. courts and reviewing their cases.
Despite what some diplomats described as strong lobbying by the United States, the General Assembly narrowly adopted a Mexican-drafted resolution with 69 votes in favor, four votes against and 66 abstentions. Another 54 countries did not vote.
The resolution also asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to use his good offices to push for implementation of the resolution. General Assembly resolutions are non-binding but can carry political weight.
""The United States believes that it is inappropriate that Mexico has brought this bilateral matter to the U.N. General Assembly,"" Kelley Currie, U.S. Ambassador for Economic and Social Affairs at the United Nations, said.
Relations between Mexico and the United States are already at a low, hurt by U.S. President Donald Trump's vows to build a wall along the Mexican border.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague ruled in 2004 that the United States had violated international law by failing to inform 51 Mexicans then on death row of their right to consular assistance, and said the cases should be reviewed.
The U.N. resolution said six of those Mexicans have since been executed. 
""Under these circumstances, having exhausted all efforts ... the Mexican Government has decided to appeal to the General Assembly,"" Mexico's U.N. Ambassador Juan José Gómez Camacho said.
He said it was not a strictly bilateral issue as ""it violates the international law and has a profound impact on the system of the United Nations as a whole.""
Currie said the United States continued to take steps related to the international court judgment and has engaged extensively with Mexico. However, she added that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling said the International Court of Justice decision ""does not constitute directly enforceable federal law.""

She said the U.S. State Department had engaged with relevant state authorities in the United States to urge them to take the necessary steps related to the international court ruling.

832,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 06:21PM ET</span>","Drones paralyze British airport, grounding Christmas travelers","By Sarah Young and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain sent troops to its second-biggest airport after an unprecedented attempt to cripple Christmas travel with large drones forced all flights to be canceled on Thursday.
As thousands of passengers waited at Gatwick Airport, south of London, police hunted unsuccessfully for the operators of the large drones which reappeared near the airfield every time the airport tried to reopen the runway.
Police said there was no indication of a terrorism motive behind the devices, which first appeared on Wednesday night. 
""The assessment earlier on today was that we wouldn't be using firearms,"" Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Tingley said late on Thursday. ""This is continually reviewed so you will know and have seen that we have firearm officers deployed.""
Europe's air traffic control agency Eurocontrol said the airport would remain closed until 0600 GMT on Friday.
The armed forces were also deployed to help resolve the situation. 
""We are there to assist and do everything we can,"" Defence Minister Gavin Williamson told reporters. 
Drones were seen as recently as the last hour, a Gatwick spokesman said at about 2200 GMT on Thursday, more than 24 hours after their first sighting.
The airport said flights would remain shut down for the rest of the evening on a day when 115,000 people were scheduled to pass through, many en route to seasonal breaks.
Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman condemned the standoff as ""irresponsible and completely unacceptable"". 
Passenger Ani Kochiashvili had been bound for Georgia but spent six hours overnight sitting on a plane with her children.
""I'm very annoyed because I'm with two kids, a three-month-old and three-year-old,"" she told Reuters by phone among thousands camped in the terminal. 
""They require a lot of space and food and changing and all that, and the airport is crazy busy so it's challenging."" 
Flights were halted at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted near the airfield, triggering the biggest disruption at Gatwick since a volcanic ash cloud in 2010.
Police said more than 20 units were hunting the operators near Gatwick airport, 50 km (30 miles) south of London.
Transport minister Chris Grayling said it was clearly a deliberate act. ""This is a commercial-sized drone,"" he said. ""Every time Gatwick tries to re-open the runway, the drones reappear.""
Grayling temporarily lifted night-flying restrictions at other airports to ease congestion caused by diverted aircraft, Sky News reported.
""COMPLETE MAYHEM""
With a surge in public enthusiasm for drones, there has been an increase in near-collisions by unmanned aircraft and commercial jets in recent years. 
The number of near misses between private drones and aircraft in Britain more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year, according to the UK Airprox Board regulator. 
Richard Parker, head of air traffic management technology firm Altitude Angel, said this was the first time a major airport had been hit by such a sustained and deliberate incursion into its airspace.
""It's sophisticated, not from a technology side, but it's organized. People have charged lots of batteries, and are deliberately trying to avoid being caught, probably by driving around to different locations,"" he told Reuters. 
""It really is unprecedented.""
Gatwick's Chief Operating Officer Chris Woodroofe described one of the drones as a heavy industrial model.
""The police advice is that it would be dangerous to seek to shoot the drone down because of what may happen to the stray bullets,"" he told BBC radio.
Drone expert Peter Lee of Portsmouth University said he and others had been anticipating disruption. 
""One of my concerns about today is that it may well encourage copy-cat incidents because you can achieve a high amount of disruption for a very, very low cost,"" he said.
It is illegal to fly drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary, punishable by five years in prison.
Even after Gatwick re-opens, the backlog and disruption are expected to last for days.
Gatwick said it was working with its airlines, the biggest of which also include British Airways (L:ICAG) and Norwegian (OL:NWC), on recovery plans once the runway re-opens. 
Safety was its ""foremost priority"", it said. 
Gatwick, which competes with Europe's busiest airport Heathrow, west of London, had previously said Sunday would be its busiest day of the festive period.
Passengers took to Twitter to share their stories. 

One waiting at the airport said: ""At Gatwick Airport, drone chaos, surprisingly good natured, but complete mayhem.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian police on Thursday requested that a popular faith healer face criminal charges related to accusations by hundreds of women that he sexually assaulted or raped them.
João Teixeira de Faria, known as ""John of God,"" became a celebrity after his healing methods were featured on Oprah Winfrey's television show in 2013. He drew thousands of Brazilians and foreigners to his spiritual center in the small town of Abadiânia, in the central Brazilian state of Goiás.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Friday to endorse a ceasefire agreed by the warring parties in Yemen's Hodeidah region and authorize an advance U.N. team to begin monitoring the deal, diplomats said. 
The 15-member council has spent several days wrangling over a British-drafted text and the United States, unhappy with Britain's efforts, came up with its own version on Thursday. The council will vote on Britain's draft and Washington is not expected to put its text to a vote, diplomats said.
The U.S. mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""It is rather unusual to see similar but competing drafts put forward by allies, rather than suggesting amendments to existing drafts. But these are unusual times,"" said a senior U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""Our focus must be on getting swift adoption to support U.N. efforts and the agreement between the parties,"" the diplomat said. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain to pass. 
After a week of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden, the Iranian-aligned Houthi group and Saudi-backed Yemen government foes agreed last week to stop fighting in the Red Sea city of Hodeidah and withdraw forces. The truce began on Tuesday.
The draft resolution, seen by Reuters, authorizes U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to deploy - for an initial 30 days - an advance team to begin monitoring and to support and facilitate the deal between the warring parties. 
It also asks Guterres to submit proposals by the end of the month on substantive monitoring operations for the ceasefire and mutual redeployment of forces; support for the management of and inspections at the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Issa; and strengthening of the U.N. presence in the Hodeidah region.
Guterres would report weekly to the Security Council on implementation of the deal, according to the draft resolution.
The text condemns ""the supply, from whatever source, of weapons and associated materiel in contravention of the arms embargo."" The United States had wanted to name Iran, but Russia objected, diplomats said. Iran has repeatedly denied accusations that it has supplied weapons to Yemen's Houthis.
The conflict has pushed impoverished Yemen to the verge of famine, and millions of people rely on food aid. More than 80 percent of Yemen's imports used to come through Hodeidah port, but that has slowed to a trickle.
The draft resolution ""calls on the government of Yemen and the Houthis to remove bureaucratic impediments to flows of commercial and humanitarian supplies, including fuel, and on the parties to ensure effective and sustained functioning of all of Yemen's ports.""

The national assembly is this week debating a revised draft of the constitution, designed to replace a Soviet-era one to better reflect the times, for example acknowledging private property and opening the door to same-sex marriage.
Cuba is one of a handful of countries worldwide still run by the Communist Party and has insisted its one-party socialist system is irrevocable.
Still, the commission writing the new constitution, headed by party chief Raul Castro, took the mention of ""communism"" out of the first draft that it published in July and put to a nationwide, three-month popular consultation.
Thousands of citizens at community-level meetings then called for it to be re-inserted, according to Cuba's state broadcaster, and as a result it was re-inserted into the draft now under debate by the national assembly.
""The true revolutionary is the one who always looks to overcome the limits of the possible and that is why we must maintain this aspiration (to communism),"" lawmaker Yusuam Palacios told the assembly on Thursday.
The inclusion of ""communism"" is one of 760 changes to the first draft made on the back of the popular consultation. 
The government has insisted the drafting of the constitution is participatory democracy at its best, while critics point out that the fundamentals of the Cuban system were never up for discussion and say its methodology is questionable.

If this latest draft passes, as expected, a national assembly vote this week, it will go to a nationwide referendum on Feb. 24.

Judge Fausto Jose Martins Seabra in Sao Paulo found Ricardo Salles guilty of infractions including altering maps in a environmental protection plan to benefit mining companies when he was the state's environment secretary, according to the decision posted late on Wednesday.
Salles, who has been named as Brazil's next environment minister after Bolsonaro assumes office on Jan. 1, told Reuters on Thursday that he did not agree with the ruling and would appeal.
""I understand there was no impropriety at all and my lawyers will appeal at the opportune moment,"" he said, adding that while the ruling found issues with the protection plan, it did not indicate that there had been environmental damage or personal gain.
Bolsonaro was elected with strong backing from farmers, and comments he made on the campaign trail - such as complaining about the current regime of fines for environmental infractions - have led to fears that the country will backtrack on protecting the environment.
Groups like Greenpeace and the Climate Observatory have criticized Salles' appointment, citing his alignment with rural interests that they say would essentially see the environmental ministry subordinated to the agriculture ministry.
Salles said in an interview with Reuters earlier this month that as minister he would seek to strike a balance between environmental protections and economic development.
The conviction strips him of the right to stand for office for three years, but Salles said that would not interfere with his ability to become a minister, which is not an elected position.
Bolsonaro representatives did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 04:44PM ET</span>",Spanish prime minister agrees with Catalan leader on easing political tension,"By Sam Edwards and Andrés González
MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Catalan leader Quim Torra expressed a commitment to dialogue on Thursday in a symbolic joint declaration to ease tensions in the protracted crisis over Catalonia's ambitions to split from Spain.
The statement indicates a turning point in the conflict between Madrid and the northeastern region, opening the door for a political solution to a dispute which reached its summit last year with its unilateral declaration of independence.
The meeting took place hours before a rare visit to Barcelona on Friday by the Spanish cabinet - an event which has led to protests being planned across Catalonia.
""Although maintaining notable differences...they share, above all, their commitment to an effective dialogue that conveys a political proposal with broad support in Catalan society,"" both governments said in a statement.
Sanchez and the pro-independence Torra agreed to keep working together, and Spain's vice-president Carmen Calvo and her regional counterpart Pere Aragones will meet again in January.
Earlier in the day, nine jailed Catalan separatist leaders called for large but peaceful protests and four of them called off a hunger strike they had started in early December.
In signs of a cooling down in the conflict, Torra's party and other pro-independence groups also supported the government's broad plan for budget deficits in 2019 and 2020, which could bode well for the 2019 budget vote in January.
The meeting prompted criticism of the leaders by the center-right opposition People's Party and Ciudadanos, who accused Sanchez of ""humiliation"" and ask for Madrid to take control of the region again.
In October 2017, Catalonia unilaterally declared independence, prompting Madrid to intervene in the region by dismissing its parliament and arresting secessionist leaders.
But Sanchez, who came to power in June 2018, has been more open to dialogue with Catalonia, which has 7.5 million people and accounts for about a fifth of Spain's economy. 
His Socialists hold a minority in parliament and rely on the backing of pro-independence parties to pass legislation, including the 2019 draft budget.
Friday's planned demonstrations against Madrid will be the latest of many, some of which have drawn hundreds of thousands.
National police will be deployed in Barcelona to guard the cabinet meeting amid fears that extreme elements of the independence movement could stoke violence. 
""(Sanchez's government) will want to provoke us, they will be angry, they would like us to be violent, and they will not succeed,"" the nine prisoners said in a letter released by their political parties.
""Our strength also lies in maintaining, always and everywhere, a civic and peaceful attitude,"" they wrote.
Spain's constitution prohibits regions from breaking away and the independence drive, backed by about half of Catalans, has caused the country's worst political crisis in decades.

During last year's independence vote, Spanish police attempted to shut down impromptu voting stations, provoking an international outcry with the use of batons and rubber bullets in melees that injured dozens.

838,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 04:39PM ET</span>",U.S. air campaign against Islamic State in Syria likely to end,"By Phil Stewart and Ellen Francis
WASHINGTON/BEIRUT (Reuters) - The United States will likely end its air campaign against Islamic State in Syria when it pulls out troops, U.S. officials said on Thursday, as President Donald Trump defended the planned withdrawal against criticism from allies abroad and at home.
NATO allies France and Germany said Washington's change of course on Syria risks damaging the fight against Islamic State, the militant group that had seized swathes of Iraq and Syria but has now been squeezed to a sliver of Syrian territory.
Several of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress, joined by opposition Democrats, urged the president to reverse course, saying the withdrawal would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran in Syria and enable a resurgence of Islamic State.
Trump, however, gave no sign of changing his mind and lashed out at Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who is sometimes an ally of the president but who has said a withdrawal would have ""devastating consequences"" for the United States.
""So hard to believe that Lindsey Graham would be against saving soldier lives & billions of $$$,"" Trump tweeted. ""Why are we fighting for our enemy, Syria, by staying & killing ISIS for them, Russia, Iran & other locals? Time to focus on our Country & bring our youth back home where they belong!""
Trump's troop announcement on Wednesday upended a pillar of American policy in the Middle East and caused consternation in domestic and foreign critics who argued it would make it harder to find a diplomatic solution to Syria's seven-year civil war.
France, a leading member of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, said it would keep its troops in northern Syria for now and contested Trump's assertion that the group has been defeated in the country. 
""Islamic State has not been wiped from the map nor have its roots. The last pockets of this terrorist organization must be defeated militarily once and for all,"" French Defence Minister Florence Parly said on Twitter.
France has about 1,100 troops in Iraq and Syria providing logistics, training and heavy artillery support as well as fighter jets. In Syria it has dozens of special forces, military advisers and some foreign office personnel.
Trump, however, tweeted that he was fulfilling a promise to leave Syria made during his presidential campaign and arguing that the United States was doing the work of other countries and it was ""time for others to finally fight.""
Four U.S. officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the troop withdrawal is expected to mean an end to the U.S. air campaign against Islamic State in Syria. The U.S.-led air war has been vital to crushing the militants there and in neighboring Iraq, with more than 100,000 bombs and missiles fired at targets in the two countries since 2015.
Still, one U.S. official said a final decision on the air campaign had not been made and did not rule out some kind of support for partners and allies.
The United States told the U.N. Security Council it was committed to the ""permanent destruction"" of Islamic State in Syria and would keep pushing for the withdrawal of Iranian-backed forces in the country. 
The roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, many of them special forces, were ostensibly helping to combat Islamic State but were also seen as a possible bulwark against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has retaken much of the country from his foes in the civil war, with military help from Iran and Russia.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which have been fighting Islamic State with U.S. support for three years, said the withdrawal of troops would let the militants regroup at a critical stage and leave Syrians stuck between ""the claws of hostile parties"" fighting for territory in the civil war.
The SDF are in the final stages of a campaign to recapture areas seized by the militants. 
But they face the threat of a military incursion by Turkey, which considers the Kurdish YPG fighters who spearhead the force to be a terrorist group, and Syrian forces committed to restoring Assad's control over the whole country.
The SDF said the battle against Islamic State had reached a decisive phase that required more support, not a precipitate U.S. withdrawal.
THREAT ALIVE
Islamic State declared a caliphate in 2014 after seizing parts of Syria and Iraq. The hardline group established its de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe.
According to U.S. estimates, the group oversaw about 100,000 square kms (39,000 square miles) of territory, with about 8 million people under its control and estimated revenues of nearly $1 billion a year.
A senior U.S. official last week said the group was down to its last 1 percent of the territory it once held. It has no remaining territory in Iraq, although militants have resumed insurgent attacks since the group's defeat there last year.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said he largely agreed with Trump that the group had been defeated in Syria but added there was a risk it could recover.
He also questioned what Trump's announcement meant in practical terms, saying there was no sign yet of a withdrawal of U.S. forces, whose presence in Syria Moscow calls illegitimate.
Israel will escalate its fight against Iranian-aligned forces in Syria after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
While Turkey has not commented directly on Trump's decision, an end to the U.S.-Kurdish partnership will please Ankara.
Kurdish militants east of the Euphrates in Syria ""will be buried in their ditches when the time comes,"" state-owned Anadolu news agency reported Defence Minister Hulusi Akar as saying.

Turkey has intervened to sweep YPG and Islamic State fighters from parts of northern Syria that lie west of the Euphrates over the past two years. It has not gone east of the river, partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and three allies condemned China for economic espionage on Thursday as American prosecutors charged two Chinese nationals tied to a spy agency in a wide-ranging cyber campaign that stole confidential data from U.S. government agencies and businesses, fanning tensions with Beijing.
U.S. authorities unveiled indictments charging Zhu Hua and Zhang Jianguo in hacking attacks against the U.S. Navy, the space agency NASA and the Energy Department as well as companies in numerous sectors. The operation targeted intellectual property and confidential business and technological data to give Chinese companies an unfair competitive advantage, they added.
The United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand slammed China over what they called a global campaign of cyber-enabled commercial intellectual property theft, signaling growing global coordination against the practice.
""No country poses a broader, more severe long-term threat to our nation's economy and cyber infrastructure than China,"" FBI Director Chris Wray said at a news conference. ""China's goal, simply put, is to replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower, and they're using illegal methods to get there.""
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other officials in President Donald Trump's administration said China's hacking effort, which U.S. officials said began in 2006 and ran through 2018, violated a 2015 agreement intended to crack down on cyber espionage for commercial purposes. 
Britain agreed. The campaign is ""one of the most serious, strategically significant, persistent and potentially damaging set of cyber intrusions against the UK and our allies that we have seen,"" a British security official said. 
U.S. authorities said hacking targets included NASA's Goddard Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and companies involved in aviation, space and satellite technology.
The targets also included companies involved in banking and finance, telecommunications, consumer electronics, manufacturing technology, pharmaceutical technology, oil and gas exploration and production technology, communications technology, computer processor technology and maritime technology, they added.
""The list of victim companies reads like a who's who of the global economy,"" Wray said, though he did not name specific businesses.
The U.S. action may worsen tensions between Washington and Beijing after the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies , in Canada at the request of the United States.
The charges were announced just weeks after the United States and China agreed to talks aimed at resolving an ongoing trade dispute that threatens global economic growth. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business Network he did not think the charges would affect the trade talks, calling it a ""separate"" matter.
U.S. authorities said the two defendants, who worked in China in association with a Chinese intelligence agency known as the Ministry of State Security, were charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.
Zhu and Zhang were members of a hacking group known within the cyber security community as Advanced Persistent Threat 10, or the APT10 Group, U.S. authorities said. The defendants worked for a company in China called Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Company, or Huaying Haitai, they said.
The Chinese efforts targeted more than 45 commercial and defense technology companies in the United States, as well as managed service providers (MSPs) - firms to which they outsource email, storage and other computing tasks - and their clients, U.S. officials said. The defendants compromised the data of MSP clients in 12 countries, they said.
NASA said it did not believe agency missions were jeopardized by the hacking and took immediate action to secure affected servers. China's embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The Navy referred questions to the FBI. 
'SERIOUS CONCERN'
Australian officials issued a statement expressing ""serious concern"" about Chinese commercial intellectual property theft. An official in New Zealand said in a statement the country ""joins likeminded partners in expressing that such cyber campaigns are unacceptable.""
Canada, Japan, the Netherlands and Sweden also were expected to denounce Chinese cyber efforts, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
""It is a sign that the United States is building an international coalition to hold China accountable for its egregious behavior,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer of cyber security technology company CrowdStrike.
The Chinese campaign is considered a major threat by private-sector cyber security researchers and government investigators because of the scale of the intrusions.
Beginning in about 2014, the APT10 Group engaged in a campaign to get unauthorized access over an extended period of time to computers and computer networks of MSPs for businesses and governments around the world using malware to steal user names and passwords of employees, U.S. authorities said.
APT10 also stole personal data including Social Security numbers from more than 100,000 U.S. Navy personnel, they said.
Over the past several years, as globally companies have sought to reduce information technology spending, they have increasingly relied on outside contractors to store and transfer data. When a managed service provider is hacked, it can unintentionally provide attackers access to secondary victims who are customers of that company and have their computer systems connected to them, according to experts.
""China's state-sponsored actors are the most active perpetrators of economic espionage against us, in short, to strengthen themselves and to weaken the United States,"" Wray said. 
This is the latest in a series of hacking cases brought by the United States against alleged Chinese hackers.
In October, the U.S. government charged Chinese intelligence officers with conspiring with hackers and company insiders to break into private companies' computer systems and steal information on a turbo fan engine used in commercial jetliners. The same month, the Justice Department arrested an alleged spy for China's Ministry of State Security on charges of economic espionage and attempting to steal U.S. aviation trade secrets.
In September, a Chinese national who had enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve was arrested in Chicago for working for Chinese intelligence to recruit engineers and scientists, including some who worked for U.S. defense contractors.

The bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, were found on Monday in an isolated area near Imlil, on the way to Toubkal, North Africa's highest peak and a popular hiking destination.
Police arrested a suspect on Tuesday in the tourist hub of Marrakech who they said belonged to a militant group. Three more were picked up later in the city, the Central Bureau for Judicial Investigations said.
Morocco's general prosecutor on Thursday confirmed the authenticity of a video in which he said the four pledged allegiance to Islamic State and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
In the video, which was posted on social media, the suspects threatened to carry out attacks, the general prosecutor said in a statement.
Investigations by the bureau also showed the video was made last week before the killing of the two women. The evidence discovered so far pointed to a terrorist motive, the bureau said.
Preliminary investigations of the video found that it was shot in a different place from where the women's bodies were found, a police source told Reuters. 
Danish intelligence said earlier on Thursday that Islamic State could be behind the killings.
""The video and preliminary investigation according to the Moroccan authorities indicate that the killings may be related to the terrorist organization Islamic State,"" the Danish intelligence service said in a statement.
""This is a case of an unusually bestial killing of two totally innocent young women,"" it said.
Before leaving, Jespersen had posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) about her upcoming trip.
""Dear friends, I'm going to Morocco in December. Any of you guys who's around by then or any mountain friends who knows something about Mount Toubkal?"" 
Compared to other countries in North Africa, Morocco has been largely insulated from militant attacks. The most recent took place in April 2011, when 17 people were killed in a bombing of a restaurant in Marrakech.
""This is a brutal and meaningless attack on innocent people, which we react to with disgust and condemnation,"" Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said in a statement.

The Bureau for Judicial Investigations, established in 2015, says it has so far broken up 57 militant cells, including eight in 2018.

PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - In April last year, the 148-tonne tugboat Cerro Santiago collided with the U.S. Coast Guard vessel Tampa while passing through the Panama Canal after the captain of the tug fell asleep.
No one was injured, but the repairs to the Tampa cost $170,000, said a report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, a government agency.
The risk of such incidents is growing as fatigue plagues tug operators from long shifts, according to a report published this month commissioned by Panama's captains union.
The Panama Canal Authority disputes the findings.
Since the Panama Canal opened a new set of locks in 2016, some captains have been covering long shifts.
The report said the system is negatively affecting crews' health on the canal, which handles 5 percent of world trade.
The study, which included interviews with 55 captains, a third of the total working at the facility, is the union's most recent push for a different shift system, crew members said.
""We're worried about the deterioration of the captains' health and fear another accident might happen,"" captain Ivan De La Guardia told Reuters.
The union said it had sent 15 letters to the canal authority urging action, without receiving an answer.
De La Guardia, one of the union's leaders, said that since July 1 there have been seven tugboat accidents. None were serious, but all involved captains falling asleep, he said.
When the new locks first opened, two tugboat captains were assigned to each maneuver in the canal. But the canal authority decided in mid-2018 that one captain would be enough after a period of ""adaptation"" ended.
That has implied longer shifts and more pressure at work, captain Roberto Feurtado said.
Jorge Quijano, administrator of the Canal authority, told Reuters that operational rules for tugboats demand only one captain, two crew and one machinist.
""The work that is being done is not generating any fatigue,"" Quijano said, calling the operations safe and the work environment ""appropriate.""
The authority says the accident rate is below 1 percent at the canal, which has over 13,000 transits every year.
The new set of locks requires tugboats to accompany vessels passing through the waterway during the entire transit. Maneuvers can take up to 10 hours.

Nearly one in three captains interviewed for the report said they have worked up to 20 hours in a single shift, and six of them reported falling asleep at work.

Members of the Professional Pilots Union (PPU), which says it represents around a third of the airline's pilots, were due to stage a series of walkouts in a row over union recognition beginning on Saturday and continuing into the New Year.
The PPU called the strikes against the airline, which is owned by Richard Branson’s Virgin Group and U.S. airline Delta and whose main business is flying between Britain and the United States, over its exclusion from talks on changes to pilot benefits.
""We're pleased that the High Court has granted an injunction. We took the decision to go to court reluctantly, but we felt it necessary to ensure that our customers will be able to travel over the festive period as planned,"" Virgin said in a statement.
""We'd like to take this opportunity to thank the overwhelming majority of our pilots who have offered to take on extra work this Christmas to make sure our flights are protected."" 
Virgin Atlantic did not say on what grounds the court granted the injunction.
The PPU said it was disappointed by the ruling, which it said was partially upheld on a ballot technicality, and will study the judgment before deciding its next move.

Khalid bin Salman added on his Twitter account that the talks were productive and would ""help promote intra-Afghan dialogue toward ending the conflict"".
The U.S. special envoy for Afghan peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad arrived in Kabul on Wednesday to meet government leaders following his discussions with Taliban representatives in Abu Dhabi earlier this week.
Officials from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates took part in the Abu Dhabi meeting, at least the third encounter between Khalilzad and Taliban envoys since he was named to oversee the peace effort from Washington's side in September.
In an interview with Afghanistan's Ariana Television, Khalilzad repeated that, ideally, an agreement would be reached before presidential elections, currently scheduled for April 20.
""I think it would be great if we could reach a peace deal before the elections,"" he said, according to a transcript provided by the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.
""But it doesn't only depend on Afghanistan’s government. It depends on the Taliban too,"" 
The United States insists that any peace settlement must be agreed between Afghans but the Taliban have so far publicly refused to talk directly to the Afghan government, which they say is an illegitimate, foreign-imposed regime.
The urgency around the peace talks was heightened by President Donald Trump's unexpected decision this week, fulfilling a promise from his 2016 presidential election campaign, to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.
According to Western diplomats in Kabul, there is concern among some U.S. allies that Trump may decide a similar move in Afghanistan and Khalilzad is widely believed to have until the middle of next year to come up with a settlement.
In a separate interview with Tolo News, Khalilzad said Trump was ""in a hurry"", having promised the American people that he wanted to end the war in Afghanistan.
""But it should not be misinterpreted - we want peace here with respect to set objectives - that Afghanistan will not be a threat for the U.S. - and that we have a positive relationship with Afghanistan,"" he said.
""... but if the Taliban are not prepared for that and war continues, then we will stand by the Afghan government and people,"" he said. 
Washington hopes Saudia Arabia and the UAE can push Pakistan to use its leverage on the Taliban to drop their refusal to talk directly with the Afghan government.
Khalilzad said that during the Abu Dhabi meeting, the two countries had proposed a three-month ceasefire between the Taliban and the Afghan government but that the Taliban had asked for more time to consult with their leadership.

""We told them, if they want peace or if they are serious about peace, they should sit with the Afghans and respond as soon as possible to the Emirati and Saudi suggestion.""

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Kurds, among the biggest winners of Syria's war, stand to lose most from a U.S. decision to withdraw forces who have helped them battle Islamic State militants and deter their adversaries Ankara and Damascus.
With U.S. help, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have captured large parts of northern and eastern Syria from Islamic State, but warn that the jihadists still pose a threat even if President Donald Trump has declared their defeat.
NATO allies France and Germany agree, saying Washington's abrupt reversal of course on Syria - fulfilling a Trump presidential campaign pledge in 2016 - risks sapping the fight against Islamic State (IS).
Not only will Trump's decision expose SDF territory to the risk of an IS resurgence, but it increases the possibility of an assault on Kurdish-dominated northern Syria by Turkey and its Syrian rebel proxies.
It's shaping up to be a case of deja vu for the Kurds, a stateless minority divided between Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkey whose national aspirations have historically been thwarted by foreign powers. The Kurds are the largest ethnic group left stateless when the Ottoman Empire collapsed a century ago. 
To protect themselves from Turkey, some analysts say, Syrian Kurdish groups may now beat a path to Damascus to make a deal with President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies who could shield them in exchange for the surrender of their autonomy.
Unlike Syria's rebels, the SDF and the Kurdish YPG militia that leads it have never fought to topple Assad. At times, they have even cooperated against common insurgent foes and earlier this year political talks were held in Damascus.
These however got nowhere: Assad opposes the Kurdish vision of a federal Syria that preserves their regional autonomy. 
Seen as the most likely winners from a U.S. withdrawal, Assad and his Iranian and Russian allies are already eyeing the recovery of SDF territory that spans roughly one quarter of Syria and is rich in farmland, oil and water.
""The Syrian government must certainly take the area after the (U.S.) withdrawal,"" an official in the Iranian-backed regional alliance that supports Assad told Reuters.
In the Kurdish regions of northern Syria, Trump's move has deepened fears of an attack by Turkey, which views Kurdish control of the north as a menace to its security and has demanded an end to U.S. support for the SDF.
""Before, America was here and nobody was afraid. But now the (Turkish) threats scare us,"" said Bengin Seydo, 35, speaking in the town of Ras al-Ayn where a demonstration was held on Thursday against any Turkish attack. 
Trump's decision stunned the SDF, even though it had been wary of what it saw as shaky U.S. policy toward Syria, said Ahmad Sleiman, a Kurdish politician and commentator.
""Relying on the Americans is always a failed experience, at the very least for Kurds,"" he told Reuters. ""Now the Kurds' choices have become much tougher.""
""SERIOUS DANGER"" FROM ISLAMIC STATE
U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, the backbone of the SDF, evolved from 2014 when Islamic State was at its zenith and the Kurds were battling to prevent IS capturing the town of Kobani at the Turkish border.
The relationship enraged neighboring Turkey, which views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a 34-year-old insurgency in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast.
Ties expanded as YPG fighters rolled back Islamic State with air and special forces support from the U.S.-led coalition. Islamic State has now lost most of its territory in Syria.
But at least 5,000 jihadists are still battling hard in their last enclave east of the Euphrates River near the Iraqi border, SDF commander-in-chief Mazloum Kobani told Reuters last week.
These include hardened foreign combatants and possibly even the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Kobani said. Islamic State also has a pocket of desert territory west of the Euphrates in areas otherwise held by Damascus and its allies.
Nawaf Khalil, a German-based analyst of Kurdish affairs with SDF ties, flagged the risk posed by the many former Islamic State members who had melted back into civilian life.
""Within months they can rejoin Daesh (Islamic State), maybe under another name,"" he told Reuters, also noting the hundreds of foreign jihadists in SDF detention whose governments refuse to repatriate. ""There is real, serious danger. Thousands of people joined Daesh. They did not evaporate,"" he said.
REBEL PRAISES TRUMP MOVE
Turkish attacks in Syria this year have led the SDF to temporarily halt operations against Islamic State. Now, Turkey is threatening to mount a major attack into the northeastern area targeting the YPG.
""The operation east of the Euphrates will start soon, God willing,"" Abu Hatem Shaqra, head of the Turkey-backed Ahrar al-Sharkia Syrian rebel group, which is set to take part, told Reuters. Praising Trump's decision, he added: ""Our aim is to take all the SDF-held areas.""
Much now depends on how the United States manages the withdrawal of the 2,000 troops.
""If the Americans pull out fast, it will be chaos. If the Turks come in..., it will be terrible blood-letting,"" said Joshua Landis, an expert on Syria and head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma.
The natural resources in the Kurdish area would represent potentially strong bargaining chips in a negotiation with Damascus, but the U.S. declaration has undermined the Kurdish negotiating position.
""It's not clear who wins yet, but it is clear who loses. The YPG loses, and the Kurdish population loses,"" said Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group think tank.

""Their bargaining position is basically reduced to nil.""

852,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>",Special Report: From terror to triumph - a young Rohingya woman's journey to the impossible,"By Zeba Siddiqui
CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (Reuters) - On the first day of the school year at the Asian University for Women in southern Bangladesh, groups of teenage girls in skinny jeans, sleeveless tops and T-shirts chattered, their laughter carrying through the sticky air.
Formin Akter, 19, stood in a corner by a row of suitcases, facing away from the students who seemed so modern and full of confidence. Wearing a tunic and pants that hung loosely on her, she nervously adjusted a brown georgette scarf that kept slipping from her head.
When she finally saw someone she recognized, she beamed, holding a card tied to red straps around her neck.
""Look at my identity card!"" she said, flashing it like a gold medal.
Getting a college ID may have been a mildly exciting rite of passage for other new students. For Formin, a stateless Rohingya Muslim from Buddhist-dominated Myanmar, it meant the world.
She had spent most of her life dreaming about this moment. But as a Rohingya in Myanmar's apartheid-like Rakhine State, her goal of attending university had been thwarted. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled a campaign of arson, rape and killing by the military since August 2017, and many of those still in the country are languishing in de facto internment camps.
Raised by a father who wanted more than his peasant's life for his daughters, Formin and her older sister, Nur Jahan, had defied those in their community who believed education was wasted on women. They were the only two girls from their village ever to finish high school.
Back then, the sisters made a pact. Someday, they would go to university together.
In her dorm room, Formin moved her belongings into a cupboard: a small pile of clothes, a dinner plate, a steel pot. Her Burmese-English dictionary – one of the few things she had taken with her when fleeing Myanmar a year before – was tucked on the top shelf. On one of the walls of the dorm, someone had painted a quote from the Harry Potter series: ""It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.""
A few hours to the south, in the world's largest refugee camp, her sister Nur Jahan spends her days teaching children and trying to forget how close she was to realizing her childhood dream. This year, her parents pushed her to accept a young man's proposal; now, she is married and pregnant, and must stay at home. 
Formin said her sister calls her every day. Formin is excited about college, but she knows she's a constant reminder of the education that her sister, and hundreds of thousands of other Rohingya women, can't have.
""I miss my sister more than anything else,"" she said. ""Every time I spent with her, I miss.""
SKIPPING ROPE IN A REMOTE VILLAGE
The two girls loved to skip rope together when they were growing up in Hlaing Thi, an all-Muslim village of about 6,000 people in Rakhine, one of Myanmar's poorest and least-developed states. 
Now the village where the girls grew up is no longer home. Scores of Rohingya houses in northern Rakhine, including those in Hlaing Thi, were burned and abandoned in what the United Nations has called an ""ethnic cleansing"" carried out with ""genocidal intent."" Satellite images show what remains of the village: rolling green interspersed with the fields that former neighbors left behind, cut here and there by narrow streams. Formin would visit one of those streams every day with her mother to collect drinking water in plastic pails. 
Since the military launched its crackdown in August 2017, more than 730,000 Rohingya have fled northern Rakhine for neighboring Bangladesh. About 15,000 fled this year alone.
Myanmar's government denies committing abuses against the Rohingya, saying the military action in northern Rakhine came in response to attacks by Muslim militants. Still, the country doesn't grant most Rohingya citizenship, and Myanmar authorities refer to the Rohingya as ""Bengali,"" a derogatory term because it implies they are interlopers from Bangladesh. The government and the military didn't respond to questions about specific incidents in this story.
Restrictions on education, employment and travel meant most Rohingya were like Formin's father, farmers or day laborers largely cut off from the outside world. According to a 2015 survey by the Yangon-based Center for Diversity and National Harmony, Rakhine had the country's lowest literacy levels and the lowest rates of primary and secondary school enrollment in Myanmar. Rohingya students struggle to understand teachers because their language isn't recognized in the public school system.
But Formin's uncle, Sayat Hossain, showed what was possible against the odds. Admitted to an engineering college in 1994 in the then-capital, Yangon, he was forced to leave school after it was shut down in response to pro-democracy protests two years later, and he fled Myanmar to find work as a day laborer in Malaysia. Eventually he made his way to asylum in Norway, where he now works as a translator.
""My uncle studied, so he is in Norway. My father didn't study, so he is a farmer,"" Formin said.
For many in Formin's village, her uncle was something of a local hero. ""There was no family like theirs in the village,"" Mohammed Bashar, the Rohingya chairman of Hlaing Thi, said from a refugee camp in Bangladesh. ""They understood the value of an education."" 
Formin's father, Mohammed Hossain, imagined a happier future for his daughters. ""You get respect when you have an education,"" he said. ""Illiterate people have to do hard work, but educated people can find comfortable work. I wanted that for my girls.""
In 2012, when Formin was 13 and Nur Jahan was 16, an international humanitarian group was operating schools for children in need of a secondary school education in northern Rakhine. It offered the sisters the chance to study under a program that would cover their tuition and living expenses. But they would have to move away from home. 
There were murmurs of disapproval in the village. ""People thought the girls would be ruined,"" said Bashar, the former village chairman. 
Formin's father said he was often told by fellow villagers: ""No matter how much you make them study, they have to sit at home and cook for their husbands. What is the point?""
But he allowed his daughters to go away to school – just as racial and religious tensions in Rakhine boiled over.
MALALA ON THE RADIO
In a white notebook with pink flowers, Formin kept a diary. ""I wrote about some happy and sad things every day,"" she said. ""If someone said anything bad about me, I used to write about that."" 
In maintaining that diary, Formin had unconsciously started creating a record of events in Rakhine that few in the largely illiterate population were documenting firsthand. ""At that time, we didn't have TV, radio or mobile,"" she said, matter-of-factly.
Just weeks after Formin and her sister began school away from their village, communal violence broke out. It was June 2012, and thousands were displaced across Rakhine State as Buddhists and Muslims torched each other's homes. 
""We saw the military shoot two people going on a motorcycle,"" Formin said. Schools were shut, travel was risky, and the hostel where she and other students lived had to close.
Authorities responded to the violence, in part, by barring the Rohingya from enrolling in the only university in Rakhine State, citing unspecified ""security concerns,"" according to a report by U.N. investigators earlier this year. That effectively denied the Rohingya access to higher education, which was already limited because of travel restrictions, the report said. 
But that didn't break the sisters' determination to keep studying. Formin and Nur Jahan moved to a secondary school in Kyein Chaung, a village with a bustling market where Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus ran shops alongside each other. Kyein Chaung had been largely untouched by the wave of violence in 2012, and things began to look hopeful.
In 2015, Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy swept elections and came to power in a country that had long been ruled by generals. Many Rohingya rooted for Suu Kyi, who had been a political prisoner, believing she would put an end to their persecution.
Nur Jahan, three years older, had finished high school and was teaching children for an international nongovernmental organization. She wanted Formin to graduate, like her, and was paying her sister's study costs with her NGO salary.
At school in Kyein Chaung, Formin met a teacher, Ali Ahmed, who was one of the few Rohingya licensed to teach in public schools. He says he encouraged her and other Rohingya students to dream big. 
""Master Ali,"" as the students called him, would often pepper his lectures with inspiring stories, sometimes pulled from news reports he heard on the small radio he kept.
That was how he first heard about Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani peace and education rights activist. He took the story to Formin's class with a challenge: ""If she can go to Oxford from Pakistan, why can't you?""
Formin was struck by the story from the moment she heard how a young Muslim woman from rural Pakistan stood up to the Taliban, survived a gunshot wound to the head from a would-be assassin and, in 2014, won the Nobel Peace Prize. At home, she told her family all about Malala. ""Did you know they put a gun to her head?"" Formin said. ""She is a great girl. She cares about education, not other things.""
In her class, she also heard the story of Helen Keller's remarkable education. Her sister Nur Jahan found her a copy of Keller's autobiography, and she read it with the same rapt admiration.
""She is blind, but she didn't stop learning,"" Formin said. ""We can see everything – we can't stop studying.""
The heroic stories of Malala and Helen kept her dreams of university alive. And she began to nurture another desire: to become an inspiration for Rohingya girls like her.
COULD SHE PASS HER EXAM?
On Oct. 8, 2016, Formin remembers, she went to bed early because she had a physics and chemistry test the next morning. When she woke before dawn for a final round of study, all the students in her lodgings were already up. Overnight, dozens of Muslim militants armed with sticks, knives and homemade weapons had launched an attack on police outposts.
The attack marked the emergence of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) – a group that claimed to be fighting for the rights of the Rohingya.
In the early light, Formin said, she could see soldiers fanning out across the village. She heard gunfire. The students hunkered down in their lodgings, afraid to move. Some 80,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in the months that followed, many claiming soldiers had torched homes, arrested and tortured suspected militants and raped women. 
Once again, schools were shut, and gradually reopened over the next few weeks. But Formin's parents had no plans of sending her back this time. They were terrified. It wasn't until four months later, as Formin's high school graduation exam neared, that her parents finally relented. They were still fearful, her mother said, but they also wanted to prove wrong those in the village who had predicted that Formin would fail.
Formin and her father made the risky trip back to her high school to take the test. Of the 150 girls who sat for the exam at the Kyein Chaung school in March 2017, only four would pass.
Myanmar's Education Ministry typically puts matriculation results on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), but Formin's village rarely had a connection. She asked a friend in another village to look for her roll number on the list of those who had passed, but the friend couldn't find it.
Formin cried for days. One evening, one of her teachers called and asked her: ""Formin, your roll number is 542?""
""I said yes.""
""OK,"" he said. ""You passed your exam.""
'I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE'
Formin returned to school to receive her diploma. But once again, violence intervened.
The militant group ARSA had waged a more ambitious attack in the early hours of Aug. 25, 2017, across security posts in northern Rakhine. In the military's response, the U.N. said, entire Rohingya villages were razed, scores of women were raped and murdered, and an estimated 10,000 people, if not more, were killed. The military denies these allegations and says it made a proportionate response to militant attacks.
As houses went up in flames in Hlaing Thi, Formin's mother called her at her lodgings. ""Our village is burning. We are leaving for Bangladesh,"" she said. ""What will you do, Formin?""
Formin didn't know what to do. She felt paralyzed as the rattle of bullets went on and on around her.
For the first time in her life, she said, she felt hope slipping away, and she cried – cried because she was scared for her life, and cried for her dream of attending college.
""I thought I was going to die,"" she said. ""I thought that would be the last day of my life.""
Formin remained locked up inside her lodgings for two days. But as she saw local Buddhists and the military start to burn houses in the village, an account that echoes those of other eyewitnesses on both sides of the conflict in Rakhine, she decided to escape with five schoolmates.
She was in a panic over how to get away. From afar, her sister Nur Jahan helped her once again.
""She didn't know the way. When I called her on the phone, Formin was crying,"" Nur Jahan said. ""There was military everywhere.""
""Just follow the people,"" Nur Jahan told her. 
Using the dim light of a small phone her father had given her, Formin walked with crowds of people heading toward the border through monsoon-drenched forests and streams, protecting her belongings that were wrapped carefully in plastic under her arm.
The group moved by night to avoid security forces and civilian mobs, stopping at abandoned houses for shelter. Along the way, Formin said, she saw several bodies.
At the border with Bangladesh, Formin paid the equivalent of $10 to a boatman to cross the Naf River. On a wooden boat with nine other people, she reached the other shore and a refugee camp that would become a home in exile.
When she was reunited with her family at the camp, one of the first things she asked about was her books back home. Between tears, her mother told her the house had burned down.
Formin's most prized possessions had turned to ash.
Gone too, was a small pink-and-white notebook – her first diary.
A SISTER LEFT BEHIND
Almost exactly a year since she had fled her country to reach the refugee camps of Bangladesh, Formin was preparing to leave. She was going to college.
""I am happy, but nervous,"" she said, blushing, as she sat on her knees on the mud floor of a hut. She and 24 other Rohingya girls from the refugee camps had been accepted to the university's ""Pathways to Promise"" program, which offers a full scholarship to selected young women in marginalized communities.
She dipped a hand into a purse to fish out a compact face powder with a mirror. She held the mirror in one hand and with the other lightly dabbed the peach-colored powder onto her cheeks with the puff, moving her face from left to right. ""I have watched makeup videos,"" she said, giggling.
She also now had a smartphone that she'd bought with her earnings from working as a translator and community health worker for NGOs in the camp. She had filled it with language learning apps: Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, English; and a Bollywood movie about a Hindu boy and Muslim girl who flee communal riots together, and eventually get married.
But marriage hasn't been a fairytale ending for her sister Nur Jahan.
In May, Nur Jahan married a Rohingya from their village. Like Formin, she had been desperate to continue studying, but she was older, and there was no guarantee the university program in Chittagong would come through.
""After coming here, we were worried about our daughters' future. The situation became uncertain,"" their father said. ""She has younger sisters who are growing fast."" So when a proposal came from a fellow refugee who had spent time working in Saudi Arabia, her parents pushed her to accept.
Her husband declined to allow Nur Jahan to be interviewed alone. She sat in a chair with her back straight and legs folded, listening attentively and speaking enthusiastically about her relationship with Formin and their life back in Hlaing Thi.
But midway during talk of college, as Nur Jahan tried to stay composed in front of her husband, her voice cracked, and she started to cry.
""Our father was very poor, but he helped a lot for our studies,"" she said. ""We made a pact that we would go to college together, and after we finished our education, we would help our father any way we can.""
Her 79-year-old grandfather, Nur Ahmed, said: ""Nur Jahan is even smarter than Formin. She would do even better at college.
""I know she is sad. We are also sad. We wish we had waited. But now we cannot do anything. I am happy for Formin, but I feel bad for Nur Jahan. She still blames us.""
Formin is hoping to study law after she completes her five-year university program, including two years spent improving her English, math and comprehension skills.
""I am a Rohingya. If I become a lawyer, I can do something for the cause of the Rohingya,"" she said.
She reflected on her role models, Malala and Helen Keller. And she spoke of another woman whom she revered. Growing up, she said, she idolized Suu Kyi, who has drawn international criticism for her silence on the plight of the Rohingya.
""Yes, yes, I really liked her!"" she said. ""We thought that woman stood for everyone.""
If she ever met Suu Kyi, she said, she would ask her: ""I am Rohingya, but I am also a woman like you. We are all women like you. Please put yourself in our place. What do you feel?""

The work was being carried out on the Israeli side of the frontier demarcation, known as the ""Blue Line"", military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus told reporters.
Israel says Hezbollah dug the tunnels with the aim of launching cross-border attacks with backing from its regional sponsor Iran. Hezbollah has yet to comment.
U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon have said they had so far confirmed the existence of four tunnels which the Israeli army discovered in recent weeks in the vicinity of the border.
Conricus said the military would ""neutralize and destroy"" the tunnels. Some were built with concrete components while others were dug directly into rock,"" he said.
""Preliminary work has started,"" Conricus said. ""We warn anybody against approaching the openings of the tunnels or staying close to them, all of the tunnels, on the Lebanese side.""
He said Israel had asked the U.N. peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, to convey the warning to the Lebanese army.
""The end result is that Hezbollah will no longer be able to utilize these tunnels in order to terrorize Israeli civilians.""
Conricus said the work was likely to be completed in a matter of hours.
Israel has called for UNIFIL to deal with the tunnels on the Lebanese side of the border. The Israeli military has said it holds the Beirut government responsible for breaching Security Council resolution 1701, which ended a 2006 war with Hezbollah.
President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, has said Lebanon is committed to implementing 1701.
The resolution banned all unauthorized weapons between the Litani River and the U.N.-monitored border between Israel and Lebanon. Under the resolution Lebanon's army is responsible for security on its side of the border in a zone from which any other armed force, including Hezbollah, is banned.

Last year parliament rescinded legislation that guaranteed Palestinians rights and privileges enjoyed by Iraqi citizens - from eligibility for state jobs and free education to receiving pensions and food items from a government subsidies program. 
The law had been decreed by Saddam, the longtime strongman president who was executed in 2006 after being ousted three years before by the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
Many Palestinian families have seen their economic situation deteriorate since parliament's action - and those interviewed by Reuters were keen to find refuge in other countries - but this was not the start of their difficulties in post-Saddam Iraq. 
As predominantly Sunni Muslims, Palestinians have been increasingly viewed with suspicion by Iraq's Shi'ite Muslim majority, who were at times persecuted under the Sunni Saddam.
Iraqi security forces have carried out repeated raids in search of suspected Sunni Islamist militants among Palestinians living in predominantly Shi'ite areas.
Late one night in 2015, Fawzi al-Madhi's evening was disrupted by a loud banging on the door. When Madhi, 56, opened the door, a SWAT team knocked him over and searched his flat.
""They grabbed my sons while they were sleeping and tied them up, Madhi's wife Um Mohammed recalled, wiping tears away. ""I was yelling, 'Leave my sons alone...Leave them alone,' and suddenly one of them hit me in the arm with their pistol.""
The security forces left after arresting the couple's two sons Mihad and Abdul Rahman - on what grounds, their father said he still does not know.
ONE SON FREED, OTHER STILL MISSING
Abdul Rahman, now 21, was released 28 days later after what his parents described as torture in custody. ""He couldn't use his hands to eat. I was helping him. I was feeding him with my hand,"" Um Mohammed said.
Mihad, 25, did not make it home. More than three years since his detention, his whereabouts remain unknown to his family.
""We still don't know if our son is dead or still alive. If he's dead we want his body to get a burial ceremony, and if he's alive we want to know where he is and why they took him,” said Madhi, seated in his apartment with his wife and young daughter. 
Fearing for their lives, Madhi sent Abdul Rahman and another son, Mohammed, 25 - who avoided arrest by staying in the home of a relative - to Turkey a month after Abdul Rahman was released.
PALESTINIANS CAME IN THREE WAVES
Palestinians came in three waves to Iraq: first in 1948 as refugees from the war surrounding Israel's creation, then in 1967 when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and in the 1990s after being expelled by Gulf states at odds with Saddam.
Portraying himself as a defender of the Palestinian cause for statehood, Saddam gave them subsidized housing and the right to work - rare privileges for foreign refugees that bred resentment among many Iraqis.
But worsening conditions since 2003 have forced at least 25,000 Palestinians to flee Iraq, leaving only around 10,000 in the country, said Fouad Hajjo, media and cultural counselor at the Palestinian embassy in Baghdad. 
""If they don't want us to stay in Iraq, then I want my son back and we will leave,"" said Um Mohammed.
Ayman Ahmed, who runs a small watch shop in a Palestinian-inhabited apartment complex in the east of the capital Baghdad, said his life had become increasingly precarious since 2003, replete with threats from unknown persons.
""We want an immediate exit from Iraq to any other country whether an Arab or (other) foreign state. We're tired and fed up, we've run out of patience,"" he said in his shop on a narrow dusty road fouled by uncollected garbage and overflowing sewage.

A spokesman for Iraq's Migration and Displacement Ministry said it hoped to get parliament to restore some benefits for Palestinians including subsidized foodstuffs.

856,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 12:08PM ET</span>","In presidential election, Congo seeks first democratic transfer of power","By Giulia Paravicini and Aaron Ross
KINSHASA (Reuters) - In his 74 years, Congolese historian Isidore Ndaywel has lived through independence from Belgium, two coups d'etat, multiple civil wars and three changes to the country's name. 
In the coming days, he hopes to witness another milestone: a presidential election meant to lead to Democratic Republic of Congo's first democratic transfer of power. But like many of his compatriots, he's keeping his expectations in check.
""There is no freedom,"" said Ndaywel, who has lived in hiding since last year because of his work with a Catholic group that has organized protests against President Joseph Kabila, who is stepping aside after nearly 18 years in power.
""There isn't much of a chance that these elections will be transparent,"" Ndaywel told Reuters. 
In the latest twist to an election that had already been delayed by more than two years, the electoral commission announced on Thursday that the vote planned for Sunday would be postponed by a week because of a shortage of ballot papers. 
Even so, for many of Congo's 80 million citizens, half of whom are registered to vote, the election offers a chance to draw a line under decades of conflict and economic stagnation.
Repeated crises have left the country mired in poverty and 15 million people in need of food assistance despite immense reserves of commodities such as copper and cobalt, which is important to the electric vehicle revolution. 
That the election will happen at all - even with the latest delay - represents progress of sorts. The vote to replace Kabila, who succeeded his assassinated father in 2001, was first scheduled for November 2016 but has been repeatedly delayed.
Kabila's opponents accused the increasingly unpopular president of trying to cling to power, and security forces shot dead dozens of people protesting against him. The violence raised fears of a slide back into the kind of open conflict in which millions were killed around the turn of the century. 
After refusing to comment publicly on whether he would defy the constitution to seek a third term, Kabila finally announced in August that he would step down and threw his support behind former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. 
For some Congolese, most of whom live on less than $2 a day and survive through informal odd jobs, the announcement provided a rare glimmer of hope. 
""I congratulate Mr Kabila on having organized the elections. (It's) something serious we did not expect,"" said Joseph Mukuna, 32, a taxi driver in the capital, Kinshasa. ""We ... think there will be big changes in our country."" 
VIOLENCE
Ndaywel, however, is wary of false dawns. 
He recalled how, when he was a student in 1965 at Kinshasa University, a young army general named Joseph Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup to the delight of much of the country, then known as the Republic of Congo.
""Certain students knew something was going to happen and they stayed up all night listening to the radio,"" Ndaywel said. ""People were happy to have an energetic president at last."" 
But Mobutu, who later renamed the country Zaire and himself as Mobutu Sese Seko, did not organize open elections for the next 32 years. 
The current election, in which Shadary's main rivals are two opposition candidates, Felix Tshisekedi and Martin Fayulu, has been marred by technical problems organizing the vote and violence on the campaign trail. 
Security forces have cracked down since last week on Tshisekedi and Fayulu's supporters, killing at least seven people and causing parallels to be drawn with the violence-plagued 2006 and 2011 elections.
And a fire, which authorities blamed on unidentified criminals, destroyed about 8,000 of 10,000 voting machines earmarked for Kinshasa, leaving election officials trying to recall machines from Congo's vast forested interior.
On Wednesday, Kinshasa's governor ordered campaigning in the city halted for security reasons. The electoral commission then announced on Thursday that the vote would be delayed until Dec. 30, a move that appeared certain to spark fresh protests.
VOTING MACHINES
Kabila's opponents accuse authorities of conspiring to rig the election with untested electronic voting machines, and have urged their supporters to be vigilant. 
""After you have voted ... stay in front of the polling place until our observers have obtained the vote tally sheet to prevent any cheating,"" Tshisekedi, the president of Congo's largest opposition party, told supporters at a rally. 
The government says the vote will proceed smoothly although its spokesman, Lambert Mende, accused opposition factions last week of ""a radical desire to sabotage the electoral process"". 
The government refused to accept election observers from the European Union and the U.S.-based Carter Center, which said Kabila's re-election in 2011 was marred by widespread fraud.
Observers from the African Union and Southern (NYSE:SO) African Development Community (SADC) will be present. Their criticisms tend to be more muted. 
A poll in October by a research group at New York University showed Tshisekedi leading the race with 36 percent support. Shadary and Fayulu trailed with 16 and 8 percent, respectively. 
But Shadary, who is under EU sanctions over crackdowns on protests while he was interior minister, is expected to benefit from the ruling coalition's grip on state institutions, including state media. 
Victory for Shadary could help Kabila maintain influence behind the scenes. Opposition candidates say they will make a clean break with the Kabila era but have offered few specific policy proposals and many Congolese are not convinced they can bring about real change.
""Our politicians are incapable of telling the truth,"" said Christian Boka, a 24-year-old student who was selling power to recharge mobile phones in Kinshasa. 

""Our politicians are mainly concerned about their own personal interest but want us to believe they care about the common interest.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean court said on Thursday it will hear a case against a businessman accused of hoarding statues, historic rifles and indigenous artifacts allegedly stolen from public parks, cemeteries and museums at his posh estate south of Santiago.
Raul Schuler, an agricultural entrepreneur from San Francisco de Mostazal, a small town ringed by wineries and fruit plantations, was charged with violating Chilean environmental laws that protect national monuments as well as regulations governing the possession of weapons, according to court filings.
Schuler could not be reached immediately for comment.
The stolen loot discovered at the 74-year old business magnate's estate included 13 pre-Columbian artifacts discovered in the piano room as well as fossils, pre-Columbian textiles, rifles from Chile's War of the Pacific, ceramics and other indigenous artifacts from various regions of Chile. 
Schuler also displayed twenty marble statues in courtyards at his home. Many had recently been on display in public spaces in Santiago.
The total haul was valued at around $400,000, according to court documents.

King Salman ordered a restructuring of the intelligence service in October after the authorities, following initial denials, acknowledged that Khashoggi had been killed inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate by a team of Saudi intelligence and security agents.
Saudi officials have said, without providing proof, that the 15-man team was put together by the deputy head of the General Intelligence Presidency, Ahmed al-Asiri, whom the king fired along with royal adviser Saud al-Qahtani.
The new government departments - for strategy and development, legal affairs, and performance evaluation and internal review - are meant to ensure that intelligence operations align with national security policy, international law and human rights treaties, state news agency SPA reported.
They were created by a committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's defense minister. He has denied accusations of ordering the hit against Khashoggi, a royal insider who became a critic of the crown prince.
Western allies have called on Riyadh to hold those responsible for the murder accountable. The Saudi public prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five suspects, as the kingdom tries to contain its biggest political crisis for a generation.
The U.S. Senate last week blamed Prince Mohammed for the murder, in a rare rebuke to President Donald Trump, who has said he wants Washington to stand by the 33-year-old de facto leader, despite a CIA assessment it was likely he ordered the killing.

""As a respectable person, I will have to do this at some point,"" Putin said, smiling.
Putin was married to Lyudmila Putina from 1983 until their divorce, announced in 2013. 
Their daughters, Katerina and Maria, both in their early 30s, are not involved in politics and have stayed firmly out of the limelight.
Since he divorced his wife Lyudmila, rumors have swirled around Putin's personal life. One Russian newspaper report said he was in a relationship with Alina Kabaeva, a former Olympic gymnast, though Putin rejected the assertion.

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian MPs passed a law on Thursday that could force the Moscow-backed church in Ukraine to add ""Russian"" to its name, aimed at curbing the influence of priests whom the authorities call a threat to national security. 
Ukraine on Saturday created a new Orthodox church independent from Moscow, which leaders have lobbied for since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and Kiev says is a vital step to blunt Russian meddling in its affairs. 
The move incensed Moscow, and prompted President Vladimir Putin to warn of possible bloodshed in his annual press conference. Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Moscow's seizure of Crimea in 2014. 
The Kiev authorities have cracked down on priests in the church known widely as the Moscow Patriarchate, which has been beholden to Russia for centuries, whom they accuse of spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda and aiding separatist fighters. The church strongly denies doing this.
The Moscow Patriarchate typically calls itself the ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church"" and sees itself as the only true church in Ukraine. 
It opposes the creation of a new church and has labeled those wanting to join the new church as ""schismatics"".
Thursday's legislation obliges a religious organization, whose governing center is based abroad in a country waging war against Ukraine or occupying its territory, to change its name to reflect that. The new law could, for example, force the church's name to be changed to the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine. 
""For more than 300 years, generations of Ukrainians have dreamed of a Ukrainian church. This is a broader question than a religious one, this is a question of the security and defense of our country,"" Speaker Andriy Parubiy told parliament.
""There is no question that the church that blesses weapons, the killers of Ukrainians, should not bear the name of Ukraine,"" he said. 
The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) called on President Petro Poroshenko to veto the bill, which it said was discriminatory and could ""lead to unpredictable consequences in society"".
""As we see, this bill does not mention the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, but from public statements it is known that the intention is to apply it to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in order to please the newly formed religious association 'Orthodox Church of Ukraine', which wants to take its name.""
Other laws are also in the works, including one by which a religious organization must consult with the authorities on its leaders and on visitors from abroad. 
Another law would make it easier for a religious community to switch its affiliation, potentially making it easier for parishes to join Ukraine's new national church and abandon the once-dominant Moscow Patriarchate.
Some MPs opposed the laws and lawmakers briefly came to blows after the vote. Vadim Novinsky of the Opposition Bloc, the heir to pro-Russian former President Viktor Yanukovich's Party of Regions, said ""these are bills aimed at the destruction of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church."" 
The Moscow Patriarchate earlier dominated in Ukraine but has been challenged by a rival known as the Kiev Patriarchate formed after the 1991 break-up of the Russian-dominated Soviet Union.
Support for the Kiev Patriarchate swelled after the annexation of Crimea. It supported church independence and Ukraine's closer integration with the West. 
Metropolitan Oleksandr, a high profile defector from the Moscow Patriarchate to the new church, estimates between 40-70 percent of Moscow Patriarchate churches will join. 
The Moscow Patriarchate says only a tiny fraction will, and last weekend pointed to that fact that only Oleksandr and one other high-ranking church official had joined the council that met to form the new church, which will include the Kiev Patriarchate.

862,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>","As Ebola threatens mega-cities, vaccine stockpile needs grow","By Kate Kelland
LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Doubts are growing about whether the world’s emergency stockpile of 300,000 Ebola vaccine doses is enough to control future epidemics as the deadly disease moves out of rural forest areas and into urban mega-cities.
Outbreak response experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) and at the vaccines alliance GAVI are already talking to the leading Ebola vaccine manufacturer, Merck, to reassess just how much larger global stocks need to be.
""We're actively engaged with the World Health Organization and with groups like GAVI, the U.S. government and others to try to understand what will be an appropriate sized stockpile in the future,"" Merck's head of vaccines clinical research, Beth-Ann Coller, said in a telephone interview.
Supply of the Merck shot, which is currently being used to fight a large and spreading outbreak of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, is not a problem right now, according to the WHO's deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, Peter Salama.
But the nature of Ebola outbreaks is changing, he told Reuters. As the virus finds its way out of rural villages into populous urban settings, plans for how to contain it in future must change too.
""What I'm concerned about is the medium- to long-term stockpile. The figure of 300,000 was very much based on previous Ebola outbreaks where you never really had huge numbers of cases because they were in isolated, rural, populations. But now, we increasingly see Ebola in mega-cities and towns."" 
""We need to view it now as an urban disease as well as a rural one - and therefore one requiring a different order of magnitude of preparations, including vaccines,"" he said.
Merck's experimental Ebola vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV, is the furthest ahead in development. Another potential vaccine being developed by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) could also eventually become part of the stockpile, global health officials say. 
Congo's two Ebola outbreaks this year illustrate the shifting nature of the threat.
The first was relatively contained, infecting up to 54 people and killing 33 of them in an area of DRC's Equateur Province that is remote and sparsely populated. 
Several of the eight outbreaks before this one in Congo - including one in 2014 and another in 2017 both also in Equateur - were also quickly contained and limited in size. 
But this year's second outbreak in Congo - and the country's tenth since the virus was first identified there in 1976 - is concentrated not in rural villages but in urban areas of the North Kivu and Ituri provinces. 
It has already infected more than 450 people, killed more than 270, and last month spread to Butembo, a densely populated city of about one million.
This kind of prospect means global health emergency responders must ""review our assumptions around Ebola"", Salama said. ""If it were to take off in Butembo, or Goma, or, even worse, Kinshasa, we'd be talking about a totally different issue in terms of ... vaccine supplies required.""
Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI vaccines alliance which has an agreement with Merck to ensure a current stockpile of 300,000 rVSV-ZEBOV doses, told Reuters that around 40,000 doses had been used so far in the Congo outbreak. 
The emergency response is based on ""ring vaccination"" which aims to control an outbreak by identifying and offering the vaccine to contacts of anyone likely to be infected. This method uses relatively small numbers of vaccine doses and forms a human buffer of immunity to try to prevent spread of the disease.
For now in Congo, Berkley said, there is no immediate need to boost the stockpile. But looking towards future inevitable outbreaks, the numbers would likely need to change.
""The challenge we would have - and this has been under discussion - is if we started to do community-based vaccination in urban and semi-urban areas. That's when the numbers would start to get quite big quite quickly,"" he told Reuters. 
Merck's shot has proven safe and effective in trials in West Africa but has yet to be approved for a license by U.S. and European regulators, so is being used in the Congo outbreak under special emergency rules for experimental products.
When it gets approval, which Coller hopes would be in 2019, it will be made at a newly built manufacturing plant in Germany.

Coller said Merck is not yet clear how many doses a year, or a month, the German facility could churn out once it is in production, but she stressed the company would ""work collaboratively with the public health agencies to do our best to support their needs"".

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that British Prime Minister Theresa May had no choice but to implement Brexit and steer clear of a second referendum or risk undermining faith in British democracy.
Putin's comments, made at his annual news conference, are likely to irk some British politicians who have suggested Russia may have meddled in the 2016 Brexit referendum because it wants to weaken the European Union and the West. 
Russia has flatly denied that allegation and said it favors a strong EU. 
Putin on Thursday said Brexit was a matter for the British people and that London would accuse him of something if he commented on the matter, but that he thought May did not have any choice but to deliver Brexit. 
""In terms of Brexit, if it is carried through to the end, I can understand the position of the prime minister who is fighting for Brexit ... There was a referendum after all. What can she do? She must enact the will of the people, expressed during the referendum.""
Putin said holding another referendum was risky. 
""Is that democracy or what? What will critics of this process say if and when they spit on Brexit and hold more referendums until such time as somebody is not unhappy. What then would a referendum be for?""
With just under 100 days until Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, deep divisions in parliament have raised the chances of leaving without a deal and increased calls for a second referendum to break the deadlock.
Putin, who said Russia's own relations with Britain were deadlocked but that Moscow was interested in improving them, characterized Brexit as an example where Western democracy was starting to show cracks.
""Brexit happened,"" he said. ""(But) nobody wants to implement it. They aren't recognizing the results of elections. Democratic procedures are being degraded, destroyed, their value is being destroyed.""
Putin also held up opposition to the election of U.S. President Donald Trump as evidence that democratic processes in the West were fraying.
Trump's foes have called for his impeachment and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating allegations of collusion with Russia. 
Putin cast the opposition to Trump as a symptom of ""deep, tectonic changes"" underway in what he described as the Anglo-Saxon world.

""Trump won - this is an obvious fact and no one disputes this, but they don't want to recognize the victory. This is clearly disrespectful towards voters,"" he said.

Moves to overhaul judicial legislation and oust chief prosecutors and judges have dominated the public agenda since the Social Democrats came to power in early 2017, and threats to judicial independence could intensify a creep away from democratic values in some of the EU's eastern member states. 
Changes to criminal codes and other judicial bills raised criticism from the European Commission, the U.S. State Department, thousands of magistrates, and triggered the country’s biggest street protests in decades. 
Social Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea, who has a suspended jail sentence in a vote-rigging case and has appealed a separate conviction for abuse of office, has been pushing Prime Minister Viorica Dancila's government for further changes, including an emergency decree that would grant prison pardons and amnesty.
The centrist opposition, which pushed for the no confidence vote, said the ruling party and its junior coalition partner ALDE were a threat to the rule of law and economic stability in one of the EU's most corrupt states.
""Every hour spent with Dragnea and Dancila in power is a threat for Romania,"" Dan Barna, the leader of the opposition Save Romania Union said. ""The motion is not about the political fight, but about the future of our children.""
But only 161 lawmakers from the fragmented opposition supported the motion, well short of the 233 votes - 50 percent of deputies plus one - required under the constitution for no confidence motions to succeed.
""I will not resign because I have the certainty that Romania is on the right path, that Romanians are appreciating the measures we are taking,"" Prime Minister Dancila told lawmakers.
On Tuesday, the government announced plans to enforce a tax on bank assets from January, cap gas prices, introduce turnover taxes for energy and telecoms firms as well as enable Romanians to withdraw from a mandatory private pension scheme.

The planned emergency decree, which was presented without impact assessments and without notifying unions and business associations, caused losses across Central European markets and the Bucharest blue chip index had its second-worst day on record on Wednesday.

Theresa May's government has issued a string of technical notices in recent months with advice on what needs to be done before the country leaves the world's largest trading bloc on March 29. They cover everything from the movement of organs, blood and sperm to nuclear regulation and organic food.
The notices had originally referred to the ""unlikely"" chance that Britain leaves the EU without a deal. The documents now refer to simply a ""no deal scenario"". 
""Delivering the deal negotiated with the EU remains the government's top priority. This has not changed,"" one notice on aviation rules says.

With just under 100 days until Britain is due to leave the EU, deep divisions in parliament have raised the chances of leaving without a deal. 
May has struck an agreement with Brussels on the terms of the divorce but she was forced to pull a parliamentary vote on the proposal last week after admitting it would be defeated. 
A spokeswoman for Britain's Brexit department said the language had been updated after the government started to step up its plans for a no-deal exit.
""We fully expect to get a deal and believe that is the most likely outcome - that is what we are focused on delivering,"" she said.

Fazliddin Parpiyev, former cleric at one of the capital Tashkent's mosques, was the first dissident to leave Uzbekistan under Mirziyoyev who has largely sought to liberalize the former Soviet republic and encouraged emigres to return.
The 32-year-old iman wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) this week that he had been summoned by state prosecutors and no longer felt safe in Uzbekistan. He did not disclose his and his family's location, but said it was thousands of kilometers away.
In a case showing the limits of Uzbekistan's newly-proclaimed tolerance, Parpiyev was sacked after a Facebook video saying that despite recent reforms, Muslims were still being oppressed over religious symbols like hijabs and beards.
Security services detained several other bloggers who had criticized the school uniform regulations.
In his Facebook post on Thursday, Parpiyev said despite his flight, he still supported Mirziyoyev and policies such as cracking down on corruption. 
""I wanted to contribute to his reforms,"" he said. ""I followed his call for criticism. I still have confidence in him.""

A spokeswoman for the prosecutor general's office said it had summoned Parpiyev for a 20-minute conversation to warn him that one of his posts could breach laws against ethnic hate speech. She said the conversation involved no psychological intimidation and there was no criminal investigation.

A court in Stuttgart had in 2015 sentenced Ignace Murwanashyaka to 13 years in prison for assisting in war crimes. He became president of the ethnic Hutu FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda) group in 2001.
The FDLR fled to Congo after the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which 800,000 ethnic Tutsis were killed.
The FDLR played a major role in Congo's 1998-2003 conflict, in which 5 million people died, and has continued mass rapes, torture and killing in the east of the country, according to civil society groups.
Murwanashyaka, who grew up in Rwanda but has lived in Germany since the 1980s was arrested in 2009. From Germany, he acted as the FDLR's top international representative while coordinating its activities and was in contact with the group's political and military leadership in Rwanda. 
The original trial, which lasted four years, was possible under a German law allowing German courts to try people for crimes committed abroad.
The appeals court in Karlsruhe said the verdict required serious legal consideration.
""It is not substantiated or proven that the accused objectively ... supported or facilitated the crimes that the (Stuttgart) court viewed as premeditated behaviour,"" said the appeals court. 
Specifically, Murwanashyaka had been convicted of the premeditated abetting of several attacks on Congolese settlements in 2008 and 2009 in which numerous civilians were killed and many houses were burned, said the court.
He made available telephones and equipment for satellite phones for military use. 
A different court will now have to consider the case again and decide whether he abetted war crimes and he may have his sentenced reduced. 
The appeals court did, however, uphold Murwanashyaka's conviction as being a ringleader of a terrorist organization. 
It also upheld the conviction of his deputy, Straton Musoni, who had been sentenced to eight years behind bars for being a ringleader of a terrorist organization.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Heads turn when An Hui and Ye Jianbin walk down a street in the Chinese city of Shenzhen with their triplets, who were conceived with help from a human egg donor and a surrogate mother.
People are mostly curious about their unconventional family, said An, adding that it was not always the case in China where gay couples have long battled conservative Confucian values. 
""I'm lucky because I was born in China during a period of rapid change. Today's society is far more tolerant,"" the investment manager told Reuters at his office in Shenzhen's financial district.
""If I had been born during the Cultural Revolution, I would be dead,"" said An, 33, who met his partner Ye in 2008.
The two men wanted a family and began exploring the option of in vitro fertilization (IVF), with help from a human egg donor and a surrogate mother.
In 2014, a Thai woman gave birth in Hong Kong to three boys – An Zhizhong, An Zhiya and An Zhifei - who were conceived using human eggs provided by a German fashion model, according to An.
He declined to identify the women or the surrogacy company that organized the procedures.

The issue of lesbian and gay couples having access to medically-assisted reproductive treatments such as IVF has stirred political debate in several countries, including more recently in France and Israel.
China's government has not stated a clear position on the country's LGBT community, Yanzi Peng, Director of LGBT Rights Advocacy China, a group based in Guangzhou. 
""The best word to describe the attitude of the Chinese government is 'ignore',"" said Peng.
""It's hard to gauge their exact attitude. They don't outright object to the LGBT community because that would really go against international attitudes on this issue,"" Peng added.  
Other advocates for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community say China should relax laws that limit childbearing to heterosexual couples.
""Homosexual couples have no way to legally use reproductive technology. Many people must go abroad to pay an extremely high fee to have children,"" said Bin Xu, director of Beijing-based rights group LGBTI+.
After decades of Communist prudery about sex of all kinds, LGBT Chinese have in recent years been openly tackling bureaucracy, legal uncertainty and entrenched social norms to assert their place in society.
While large Chinese cities have thriving gay scenes and same sex relations are not illegal, the government has shown no interest in legalizing same sex marriage, and launches periodic crackdowns on gay content online or elsewhere.
An Hui, who is a member of the ruling Communist Party, said its time to rethink traditional views of family and marriage as China grapples with an aging population and declining birth rate.
China moved in 2016 to allow couples to have a second child, relaxing curbs dating back nearly four decades. State media said this year the government was considering scrapping all limits on the number of children a family can have. 
""In China, lots of people say a family is a bond between a man and a woman, but that's not necessarily the case,"" An said.

""If a single man has children, a single woman has children, two men have children or two women have children, then for these people they have a family,"" he said. ""A family needs love for it to be a family. It has nothing to do with sexuality.""

In a news conference that lasted more than three hours, Putin also backed U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria, said British Prime Minister Theresa May had no choice but to implement Brexit and that Western democracy was under serious strain.
The annual event, the 14th of its kind, is used by Putin to burnish his leadership credentials and send messages to foreign allies and foes.
This year, he made clear his biggest worry was what he called a dangerous new arms race, something he accused the United States of stoking by turning its back on arms control.
Washington has threatened to pull out of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) which bans Moscow and Washington from stationing short- and intermediate-range, land-based missiles in Europe.
Putin said the move, if it happened, would have unpredictable consequences.
""We are essentially witnessing the breakdown of the international arms control order and (the start of) an arms race,"" Putin told more than 1,000 reporters.
""It's very hard to imagine how the situation will develop (if the United States quits the INF treaty). If these missiles appear in Europe what should we do? Of course, we'll have to ensure our own security.""
Putin has previously said that Russia would be forced to train its own missiles on any European countries that host U.S. rockets. 
Another U.S.-Russia treaty, the New START pact, which limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads each side can have, expires in 2021. Putin said he was worried that Washington didn't appear to be interested in discussing its future.
""No talks on extending this are yet being held. Are the Americans not interested, do they not need them? Ok, we'll survive and will ensure our own security, which we know how to do. But in general, this is very bad for humankind because it takes us closer to a dangerous threshold."" 
GROWING THREAT
The Russian leader, who said Moscow had developed nuclear weapons which he believed gave it an edge over other countries, warned the threat of a nuclear conflict was growing as a result of the U.S. moves. He also cited the dangerous tendency of lowering the threshold for using nuclear weapons and the idea of using ballistic missiles with conventional warheads. 
""If, God forbid, something like that were to happen, it would lead to the end of all civilization and maybe also the planet,"" said Putin.
But though Putin criticized Washington, he made clear that he still hoped to meet Trump sometime soon, saying it was important the two leaders discussed issues such as arms control.
With relations between Moscow and Washington strained by everything from Ukraine to hacking allegations, Putin said he did not know when a meeting with Trump might take place however. 

Putin won a landslide re-election victory in March, giving him six more years in power. Although he faces no serious political threat for now, plans to sharply raise the pension age saw his approval rating fall to below 60 percent for the first time in five years.

875,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 08:24AM ET</span>",A bank divided: Yemen's financial crisis hits food imports,"By Maha El Dahan and Jonathan Saul
ADEN/LONDON (Reuters) - The central bank of Yemen, split into two rival head offices reflecting a country divided by war, has been slow to finance imports of food needed to fend off widespread hunger, sources with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters.
Saudi Arabia agreed in July to lend $2 billion to the central bank office located in the southern port of Aden, the seat of the Riyadh-backed government, to help finance imports of basic goods.
The loan would enable importers to exchange Yemeni rials for dollars to buy food for a country where a collapse in the currency has left many unable to afford basic foodstuffs. 
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PpX3eI) 
But an Aden central bank document circulated in November, seen by Reuters and corroborated by two of the sources, made clear that only a little over $170 million had been authorized for payment.
Deputy Governor Shokeib Hobeishy told reporters last week that the total had risen to $340 million, but it was unclear how much had reached companies wanting to import food.
""There were a lot of regulations that we needed to complete but we have overcome that,"" he said at his office in the Aden central bank. A sniper perched on a rooftop across the street to provide security.
The rival central bank headquarters in Sanaa, the national capital now controlled by the Houthi group that has been fighting a coalition led by the Saudis for almost four years, did not receive any funds from the Saudi loan.
That was to be expected, given the realities of the war. But with the Saudi loan going to Aden, money has been directed away from Houthi-controlled areas in the north where most food imports arrive.
Traders who previously did business through the central bank in Sanaa are now scrambling to work through Aden, a switch that has created more hold-ups and payment problems.
Some traders say the Aden office favors government-held areas. Hobeishy denied that, saying there was no question of his bank issuing letters of credit to those doing business in some areas of the country and not others.
He also cast doubt on the status of the central bank in Sanaa. ""There is no such thing as two central banks in Yemen, there has always been just one bank and we moved to Aden,"" he said.
The government moved the central bank to Aden in 2016, accusing the Houthis of squandering $4 billion of bank reserves on the conflict. The Houthis say the funds were used to finance food and medicine imports.
Officials at the Sanaa central bank could not be reached, while a Houthi spokesman had no immediate comment.
A senior official at the Aden central bank, who declined to be named, said the bank was having difficulties. 
""There is confusion at the central bank level ... no one has a clue about the whole landscape,"" the official said. ""This is happening because there is no senior leadership or oversight.""
TRUCE BRINGS HOPE
In a move that could make it easier to bring in food, the two sides agreed at United Nations peace talks last week on a truce and troop withdrawal from the Houthi-held port of Hodeidah.
Opening Hodeidah was a vital starting point to get imports flowing, a U.N. official told Reuters.
""Then we need to solve the other problems like access, in particular, to currency from the central bank,"" said Abdessalam Ould Ahmed, the FAO's Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Near East and North Africa.
Hodeidah handles 70 percent of Yemen's imports of commercial goods and aid. It is a lifeline for 15.9 million people facing severe hunger in the impoverished nation of 30 million.
The World Food Programme said the truce should allow access to 51,000 tonnes of its wheat stocks cut off since September due to fighting. 
One big importer, who declined to be named, said it was not possible to ship new wheat cargoes to the ports of Hodeidah and Salif due to lack of payment. The importer was still waiting for over $50 million in foreign currency.
A second grain importer had yet to receive about $20 million in foreign currency and had stopped new shipments.
""Private traders have to pay for the goods before they are even shipped out, so they are already out of pocket,"" the second trade source said. 
RESERVES DWINDLE
The United Nations said Yemen needs billions of dollars in external support to avoid another currency collapse.
The central bank is struggling to pay public-sector wages as foreign exchange reserves dwindle. It has access to a Federal Reserve account of $200 million while around 87 million pounds are frozen in a Bank of England account. The Bank of England declined to comment.
Authorities sought to boost liquidity last year by printing money. Since then the rial has halved in value.
The United Nations and the International Monetary Fund are working to reunite the rival central banks.
The chairman of Yemen's Gulf of Aden Ports, Mohammed Alawi Amzerbah, said around 85 percent of goods arriving in Aden can make it to Houthi-held areas. But a day later, a celebration at a location two hours from Aden to launch a road to transport goods northwards was canceled for security reasons. 
Yemen's problems go further than importing food. In Aden's fish market onlookers cheered as a fisherman displayed his catch, a small shark, but customers were scarce. 

""Before, you could buy that shark for 2,000 rials. Now you need 7,000 rials,"" said Nasser Bureik Nasser, a fisheries ministry employee.

876,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 08:15AM ET</span>",Health ministry pick to widen Hezbollah role in Lebanese state,"By Laila Bassam
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah's role in the Lebanese government stands to widen when it names the new health minister though it will not be putting a party member in the job, sources say, as the United States extends sanctions against the Shi'ite Muslim movement.
The new national unity government to be led by Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri is expected to be clinched in the next few days, ending more than seven months of deadlock between rival groups over cabinet seats.
Hariri, who enjoys Western backing, lost more than a third of his lawmakers in the May 6 election but kept his post as the leading Sunni Muslim and so will return as premier, a position reserved for his sect under Lebanon's sectarian system of rule.
But the election produced a parliament tilted in favor of Hezbollah thanks to gains by groups and individuals that support its possession of a major arsenal. Together, they won more than 70 of the 128 seats. 
By picking the health minister, Hezbollah will be moving beyond the marginal role it played in past governments: this ministry has the fourth biggest budget in the Lebanese state, outgoing Health Minister Ghassan Hasbani says.
Hasbani told Reuters that recent foreign aid to his ministry included $120 million from the World Bank to be spent over five years from 2019. The ministry also receives a lot of medicine from the World Health Organisation and European Union, he said.
Two sources familiar with Hezbollah's choice said the new health minister would be Jamil Jabak, a Shi'ite doctor who they said is not a member of the heavily armed, Iranian-backed group. Hezbollah will also run two less significant ministries.
RISING HEZBOLLAH CLOUT
The United States proscribes Hezbollah as a terrorist group. Hezbollah fought a war with Israel in 2006 and has been involved in neighboring Syria's conflict on the side of President Bashar al-Assad against mainly Sunni rebels and militants. 
A U.S. State Department official said on Tuesday Washington hoped Lebanon's next government would be willing to work with it and expressed concern over Hezbollah's rising political clout.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has made Hezbollah a target of its policy to isolate Iran. Washington has hit Hezbollah leaders with new sanctions and tightened legislation seeking to sever their funding channels worldwide. 
The composition of Lebanon's new government is expected to broadly reflect the election outcome, with the share of cabinet seats held by Hariri's Future Movement, which opposes Hezbollah's arms, set to fall.
And while the Christian, staunchly anti-Hezbollah Lebanese Forces (LF) nearly doubled its number of MPs in the election, it was unable to secure all the cabinet seats it wanted, ceding ground to Christian rival President Michel Aoun and his Free Patriotic Movement, who are political allies of Hezbollah. 

To help safeguard peace in Lebanon, government posts are parceled out based on sect: the president must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shi'ite Muslim. Posts in the cabinet of 30 ministers must be split equally between Christian and Muslims.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters in Atbara city in northeastern Sudan rallied against rising food prices and corruption on Thursday, chanting anti-government slogans and setting fire to car tires as police tried to disperse them with tear gas. 
Economic conditions in Sudan have deteriorated sharply in recent months. A decision to reduce bread subsidies earlier this year sparked rare nationwide protests after prices doubled. Inflation now stands at 69 percent and severe shortages of fuel and bread have forced people in the capital and other cities to queue at bakeries and petrol stations. 
At a demonstration in Atbara attended by hundreds on Wednesday, protesters set fire to the local headquarters of the ruling party, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency and a curfew.
""I went out to protest because life has stopped in Atbara,"" a 36-year-old man, who had participated in Wednesday's demonstration and asked not to be named, told Reuters on Thursday.
He said he had not been able to buy bread for four days because it was no longer available in the shops.
""Prices have increased and I have still not been able to withdraw my November salary ... because of the liquidity crisis. These are difficult conditions that we can't live with, and the government doesn't care about us."" 
Smaller protests were also held in the cities of Dongola, Sennar and al-Qadarif on Thursday, residents said. In Dongola, protesters set fire to the local headquarters of the ruling party, and at a local market shop owners closed their stores.
In Atbara, historically a center of anti-government protests, protesters who used scarfs to cover their faces chanted ""freedom"" and set car tires alight. 
""Protesters are walking in most of the city's streets,"" a Reuters witness in Atbara said. ""They are chanting against corruption and expensive prices and asking for freedom, peace and justice.""
Sudan's economy was hit hard when the south of the country seceded in 2011. With the secession, Sudan lost three-quarters of its oil output, a crucial source of foreign currency.
In October, Sudan sharply devalued its currency after the government asked a body of banks and money changers to set the exchange rate on a daily basis.
The move led to further price increases and a liquidity crunch, while the gap between the official and black market rates has continued to widen. 
""The protests began peacefully and then turned to violence and vandalism,"" Hatem al-Wassilah, governor of the Nile River state, said of Wednesday's demonstrations on Sudania 24 TV.
Prime Minister Motazz Moussa said on Wednesday that Sudan's 2019 budget included 66 billion pounds ($1.39 billion) in subsidies, 53 billion of which was for fuel and bread.

""There has been a ninth death, this morning in Agen, by a roundabout. It was a 'Yellow Vest' who was protesting outside but was not following roadway safety instructions,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told reporters.
Local officials said the latest victim, a man aged about 60, was hit by a truck near a motorway where demonstrators had been gathering.
Most of the nine deaths have occurred as a result of road accidents, since protesters have been blocking off roundabouts and damaging motorway toll booths.
The ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) protesters - named after the high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their cars - launched their demonstration in mid-November to rally against fuel tax increases.

But the movement has since evolved into a wider backlash against the economic reforms of President Emmanuel Macron, and protests in Paris this month were marred by major outbreaks of violence and vandalism.

France is a leading member of the U.S.-led coalition fighting militants in Syria and Iraq and has around 1,000 troops including special forces based in the north of the country, deployed alongside local Kurdish and Arab forces.
French diplomats told Reuters on Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw all its 2,000 troops from the region had taken Paris by surprise. U.S. officials justified the decision by saying Islamic State had been entirely defeated.
""It shows that we can have different priorities and that we must count on ourselves first,"" Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau told C-News television. ""For now, of course we are staying in Syria because the fight against Islamic State is essential.""
France is especially sensitive to the Islamic State threat after several major attacks on its soil in recent years. Hundreds of French nationals have joined the group in Syria. 
Defence Minister Florence Parly acknowledged on Twitter that the militant group had been weakened and lost some 90 percent of its territory, but said the battle was not over.
""Islamic State has not been wiped from the map nor have its roots. The last pockets of this terrorist organization must be defeated militarily once and for all,"" she said.
President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Trump on Wednesday, diplomats said. In April, when Trump previously announced a U.S. withdrawal, Macron persuaded the U.S. leader that Washington should stay engaged by citing the threat of Iran in the region.
French officials are scrambling to find out from U.S. agencies exactly what Trump's announcement means. The United States has been unclear on when the troops will be withdrawn.
""We’re used to it now with the Trump administration. The devil is in the detail,"" said one French diplomat.
France has about 1,100 troops operating in Iraq and Syria providing logistics, training and heavy artillery support as well as fighter jets to strike targets. 

Its presence in Syria also includes dozens of special forces, military advisers and some foreign office personnel.

885,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",UK media watchdog says Russian broadcaster RT broke impartiality rules,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's media regulator Ofcom said Russian broadcaster RT had broken impartiality rules in news and current affairs programs aired in March and April, including coverage of the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.
""Taken together, the seven breaches represent a serious failure of compliance with our broadcasting rules,"" Ofcom said on Thursday. ""We have told RT that we are minded to consider imposing a statutory sanction."" 
RT said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by Ofcom's conclusions and would decide its next steps shortly.
The channel, which is broadcast by TV-Novosti and funded by the Federal Agency for Press and Media Communications of the Russian Federation, provides a Russian perspective on UK and global news and current affairs.
Ofcom said RT's mission was to make available an alternative point of view on world events, especially Russia-related ones, but RT recognized that did not require presenting a Russian point of view as if it were the only point of view.
But it said RT had failed to give sufficient weight to a range of views in seven current affairs discussion or news items.
Two cases involved discussions of the Skripal poisoning on current affairs program ""Sputnik"", co-presented by former British lawmaker George Galloway, it said.
Britain has accused Russia's GRU intelligence agency of trying to poison Skripal and his daughter with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March. Russia denies the allegations.
Other programs that Ofcom said broke the rules included a report on the Ukrainian government's position on Nazism and the treatment of Roma gypsies, which it said did not include sufficient challenge to criticism of the government, and four current affairs and news items on the Syrian conflict, which it said failed to include a range of viewpoints. 
RT said the investigations into it were almost all initiated by the regulator. 
""We operate under rules outlined by the regulator and always strive to abide by them,"" a spokesperson said. 
""It appears Ofcom has failed to fully take on board what we said in response to its investigations and, in particular, has not paid due regard to the rights of a broadcaster and the audience.""
Ofcom said it would consider further representations made by the licensee, and could impose sanctions ranging from broadcasting a statement of Ofcom's findings to a financial penalty and, in the most extreme cases, revoking a license.

""Our priority is to employ the local workforce but when it is not possible we will open the way for seeking workers from abroad,"" Labour Minister Marko Pavic told a cabinet session.
The overall number of licenses for foreign workers from countries outside the European Union has been raised to 65,100 from the 38,769 that are valid for this year.
Local employers have recently put pressure on the government to raise the quota, complaining that many businesses cannot find enough workers, mostly in the tourism, construction, retail, manufacturing and transport sectors.
Croatia's economy is growing at slightly below three percent annually and tourism accounts for almost 20 percent of output.
However, many analysts warn that Croatia is not an overly attractive destination compared to more affluent European Union peers, given its proximity to Austria or Germany where many job-seekers from non-EU Balkan states seek work.
An average monthly salary in Croatia in September amounted to 6,195 kuna ($958.13). The unemployment rate in October was 9.1 percent which analysts say is relatively high given the labor shortages.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Any deal for North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenal must include ""completely removing the nuclear threats of the U.S."", North Korean state media said on Thursday, in one of the clearest explanations of how North Korea sees denuclearization.
U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a statement after a historic meeting in Singapore in June reaffirming the North’s commitment to ""work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"" and including U.S. guarantees of security to North Korea.
Conflicting or vague views of what exactly ""denuclearization"" means, however, have complicated negotiations that now appear stalled.
""When we refer to the Korean peninsula, they include both the area of the DPRK and the area of south Korea where aggression troops including the nuclear weapons of the U.S. are deployed,"" the North's state-run KCNA news agency said in a commentary, using the initials of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
""When we refer to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, it, therefore, means removing all elements of nuclear threats from the areas of both the north and the south of Korea and also from surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted.""
The United States deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea from 1958 to 1991. Since they were withdrawn, the United States has extended its ""nuclear umbrella"" of support to Japan and South Korea using bombers and submarines based elsewhere.
North Korea rejects American calls for it to unilaterally denuclearize, and Washington should ""give up its ambition"" to force Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons by ""high-handed practices and pressure"", the news agency said.
The United States needs to understand the phrase denuclearization of the Korean peninsula ""before it is too late"", it said.
A spokesman for South Korean President Moon Jae-in - who has said Kim intends to achieve ""complete denuclearization"" - declined to comment on the North Korean call to lift the U.S. nuclear protection from South Korea, saying there was ""no need to respond to every KCNA comment"". 
'SELF-EVIDENT TRUTH'
The United States has said that it will not lift sanctions on North Korea until more progress has been made toward its verifiable denuclearization.
The United States has also rejected any suggestion that it would reduce its military presence in the region as part of a deal with North Korea.
But in a surprise step after the June summit, Trump announced that the Pentagon would cancel most of its largest military exercises conducted with the South Koreans.
The exact definition of denuclearization is likely to be raised again as Trump has said he is working to meet again with Kim sometime early next year.
""It is a self-evident truth that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is a joint work which can never come true unless the DPRK and the U.S. make joint efforts,"" KCNA said in the commentary, arguing that U.S. threats had forced North Korea to develop a nuclear deterrent.
""It would be proper to say that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula means 'completely removing the nuclear threats of the U.S. to the DPRK', before it means the elimination of its nuclear deterrence.""
At a press briefing in Washington on Tuesday, U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said he would not ""split words"" when asked about whether the promise of ""denuclearization of the Korean peninsula"" means only North Korea or the broader region.

""We are focused on the denuclearization of North Korea,"" Palladino said. ""We remain confident and we look forward to the commitments that Chairman Kim and that President Trump have made.""

Phan Van Anh Vu, also known as ""Aluminium Vu"", the former chairman of Bac Nam 79 Construction Co, was already serving a nine-year sentence for deliberate disclosure of state secrets.
Thursday's trial found Vu guilty of ""abusing power to appropriate property"".
Vietnam's graft crackdown has seen the Communist-ruled government launch investigations into hundreds of public officials accused of mismanagement.
Several executives at state-owned enterprises, including one former politburo member, have been jailed for mismanagement or embezzlement.
Vu, who fled to Singapore seeking passage to Germany but was arrested in Vietnam earlier this year, was jailed for nine years for deliberate disclosure of state secrets in a separate trial in July.
The court in Ho Chi Minh City on Thursday also sentenced Tran Phuong Binh, former chief executive officer of the local private lender DongA Bank, to life in prison for abusing power to appropriate property and violating state regulations on economic management, the ministry said on its website. 
Vu, Binh and 24 others were found guilty of causing losses of more than 3.6 trillion dong ($154.5 million) at DongA Bank, according to the statement. 
Reuters could not immediately reach lawyers for Vu and Binh to comment. 
Since Vu's arrest in January, Vietnam has arrested or prosecuted several senior officials accused of involvement in businesses or schemes controlled by Vu, including two former chairmen of Danang, a former deputy chairman of Ho Chi Minh City and two former deputy police ministers.

National police chief Tito Karnavian said the detentions were made preventively under a revised anti-terrorism law approved in May, after suicide bombings claimed by Islamic State killed more than 30 people in the city of Surabaya.
""There is no information yet about terror acts over Christmas and New Year's but we are taking proactive steps including these arrests,"" Karnavian told reporters. 
Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, has struggled to contain a resurgence in militancy and scores of Indonesians have traveled to the Middle East to join the Islamic State group.
Near-simultaneous attacks on churches in the capital, Jakarta, and elsewhere on Christmas Eve in 2000, killed nearly 20 people. Ever since, authorities have stepped up security at churches and tourist spots for the holiday.
Karnavian did not identify any of the suspects but said they were detained in various parts of the country. 
Under the revised law, anyone suspected of planning an attack can be held for up to 21 days for an initial inquiry and for up to 200 days for a formal investigation.

896,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Both candidates in Madagascar presidential run-off claim victory,"ANTANANARIVO (Reuters) - Both candidates competing to become Madagascar's next president claimed victory after an election runoff, even though only a small percentage of the results have yet been declared.
Two former presidents contested Wednesday's second round - Marc Ravalomanana and the man who ousted him in a 2009 coup, Andry Rajoelina - and the nation is hoping for a peaceful outcome with no repeat of the political chaos of almost a decade ago.
Madagascar's electoral body said results from 5 percent of all polling stations showed Rajoelina, whose candidate number on the voting list was 13, leading with 57 percent.
Rajoelina and Ravalomanana - whose nickname is ""Papa"" - promised to put the past behind them when they entered the race, and both said they would accept the result as they cast their ballots in the capital, Antananarivo.
Nevertheless they pre-empted the final results on Wednesday night, although they also promised to await the official outcome.
""We have seen the results. Even if they are not official they are part of the results: Papa wins,"" Ravalomanana told supporters.
That drew a response from Rajoelina. ""My competitor said he has won but the fact is that number 13 has won in the whole of Madagascar,"" said Rajoelina, who led protests that forced Ravalomanana out of office before going on to become president. 
Soldiers who were deployed across the island to ensure security during the polls were still seen on the streets.
In the first-round election last month, Rajoelina got 39.23 percent and Ravalomanana 35.35 percent of the vote. Hery Rajaonarimampianina, who has been president since Rajoelina stepped down in 2014, came a distant third. 

Provisional results in the run-off are expected before the end of the year.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China denounced the United States on Thursday for passing a new law on restive Tibet, saying it was ""resolutely opposed"" to the U.S. legislation on what China considers an internal affair, and it risked causing ""serious harm"" to their relations.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed into law the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act. 
The law seeks to promote access to Tibet for U.S. diplomats and other officials, journalists and other citizens by denying U.S. entry for Chinese officials deemed responsible for restricting access to Tibet.
Beijing sent troops into remote, mountainous Tibet in 1950 in what it officially terms a peaceful liberation and has ruled there with an iron fist ever since.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily briefing that the law ""sent seriously wrong signals to Tibetan separatist elements"", as well as threatening to worsen bilateral ties strained by trade tension and other issues.
""If the United States implements this law, it will cause serious harm to China-U.S. relations and to the cooperation in important areas between the two countries,"" Hua said.
The United States should be fully aware of the high sensitivity of the Tibet issue and should stop its interference, otherwise the United States would have to accept responsibility for the consequences, she added, without elaborating.
Rights groups say the situation for ethnic Tibetans inside what China calls the Tibet Autonomous Region remains extremely difficult. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in June conditions were ""fast deteriorating"" in Tibet.
All foreigners need special permission to enter Tibet, which is generally granted to tourists, who are allowed to go on often tightly monitored tours, but very infrequently to foreign diplomats and journalists.
Hua said Tibet was open to foreign visitors, as shown by the 40,000 American visitors to the region since 2015. 
At the same time, she said it was ""absolutely necessary and understandable"" that the government administered controls on the entry of foreigners given ""local geographic and climate reasons"". 
Tibetan rights groups have welcomed the U.S. legislation.
The International Campaign for Tibet said the ""impactful and innovative"" law marked a ""new era of American support"" and was a challenge to China's policies in Tibet.
""The U.S. let Beijing know that its officials will face real consequences for discriminating against Americans and Tibetans and has blazed a path for other countries to follow,"" the group's president, Matteo Mecacci, said in a statement.
Next year marks the sensitive 60th anniversary of the flight into exile in India of the Dalai Lama, the highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism, after a failed uprising against Chinese rule.

China routinely denounces him as a dangerous separatist, although the Dalai Lama says he merely wants genuine autonomy for his homeland.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 03:35AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Detained Canadian in China also Hungarian, Hungary seeks access - sources","By Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - A former Canadian diplomat detained in China amid a growing row over a Chinese executive arrested in Vancouver also has Hungarian nationality, sources familiar with the matter said, potentially raising the stakes by pulling the EU into the case.
Chinese state security agents detained Michael Kovrig, who works for the International Crisis Group think-tank, in Beijing last week on suspicion of endangering China's national security. A second Canadian, businessman Michael Spavor, was detained a few days later for the same reason.
The detentions of the Canadians followed the Dec. 1 arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], at the request of the United States, which is engaged in a trade war with China.
Both Canada and the United States have expressed deep concern about the detention of the two Canadian men. Canadian diplomats have held at least one meeting with each of the men but it was unclear where they are being held or whether they will eventually be charged. 
Several sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that Kovrig also has Hungarian nationality, a factor that could escalate the situation and put further pressure on China by involving the European Union, China's largest trading partner. 
Two of the sources said that the Hungarian embassy in Beijing has been seeking access to Kovrig too.
""It's not been granted yet,"" one of them said.
The second source said the Hungarian embassy in Beijing is treating it as a consular case and going through the ""normal process"", also confirming consular access had not been granted yet.
Kovrig spent much of his 20s in Budapest, singing in a rock band, teaching English and writing for a city newspaper, a third source said. 
China's Foreign Ministry, in a statement sent to Reuters, said: ""At present what we can confirm is that Michael Kovrig entered the country on a Canadian passport. If there are other issues, China will handle them in accordance with the law and rules"".
The ministry did not elaborate.
Neither the Hungarian nor Canadian governments responded to requests for comment. 
The EU embassy in Beijing, in a separate statement to Reuters, did not directly address the Hungarian nationality issue.
""The arrest and detention in China of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, both Canadian nationals, and the declared motive for their investigation raises concerns about legitimate research and business practices in China,"" it said.
""The denial of access to a lawyer under their status of detention is contrary to the right of defense. The EU fully supports the efforts of the Canadian Government on this matter.""
CLOSE TIES
As a Hungarian national, Kovrig is also an EU citizen. The EU has been involved in another case of an EU citizen detained in China, Swedish citizen and Hong Kong-based bookseller Gui Minhai.
A fourth source said the EU had directly raised the issue of Kovrig with China's foreign ministry, and was in close touch with the Canadian ambassador in Beijing.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and the EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini may speak by telephone in coming days on Kovrig, the source added.
Another source noted that Kovrig was in China on his Canadian passport, meaning access for Hungarian diplomats was unlikely. Kovrig has also requested Canadian consular services, the source added. China does not recognize dual nationality. 
Another issue is that Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban has cultivated close ties with China, and the country has been unwilling to criticize Beijing for rights concerns under his leadership.
All of the sources declined to be identified, citing the extreme sensitivity of the situation.
China's Foreign Ministry on Thursday confirmed a third Canadian had been detained, naming her as Sarah McIver and saying she was undergoing ""administration punishment"" for working illegally.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday it was ""a very separate case"" from Kovrig's and Spavor's.

Trudeau also urged caution and said he would not be ""stomping on a table"" about the detentions.

Chinese state security agents last week detained two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, saying they were suspected of endangering state security.
The detentions of the Canadians followed the Dec. 1 arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. [HWT.UL]. Meng was arrested at the request of the United States, which is engaged in a trade war with China.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying identified the third Canadian as Sarah McIver, who was serving ""administrative punishment"" due to ""illegal employment"". She did not elaborate.
""What I can tell you is that China and Canada are maintaining clear consular communication,"" Hua told a daily news briefing. 
When asked if McIver's case was connected to that of Kovrig and Spavor, Hua pointed out that the nature of the cases were different, given the other two were accused of endangering national security.
Hua referred further questions on McIver to the Ministry of Public Security. That ministry did not immediately respond to requests for further comment. 
The Canadian government has not identified the third Canadian, though Canadian media has said the person is McIver and said she was an English teacher being held because of ""visa complications"". 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged caution on Wednesday and said he would not be ""stomping on a table"" after China detained the third Canadian.
Trudeau said he was asking China for more information on the detentions. 
He said the latest incident was ""a very separate case"" from the other two.
The Canadian government has said several times it saw no explicit link between the arrest of Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, and the detentions of Kovrig and Spavor. 
But Beijing-based Western diplomats and former Canadian diplomats have said they believed the detentions were a ""tit-for-tat"" reprisal by China.
China has demanded Meng's immediate release and summoned in the Canadian and U.S. ambassadors to complain about the case.
Meng is accused by the United States of misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. 

She was released on bail in Vancouver, where she owns two homes, while waiting to learn if she will be extradited to the United States. She is due in court on Feb. 6.

Trump's decision to pull out completely was confirmed by U.S. officials and is expected in the coming months. The move stunned U.S. lawmakers and allies and upends American policy in the Middle East. For NATO ally Turkey, however, the news is likely to be welcome.
The two countries have long had their relations strained by differences over Syria, where the United States has backed the Syrian Kurdish YPG in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 
""Now we have Manbij and the east of the Euphrates in front of us. We are working intensively on this subject,"" state-owned Anadolu news agency on Thursday reported Defence Minister Hulusi Akar as saying during a visit to a Qatari-Turkish joint military base in Doha. 
""Right now it is being said that some ditches, tunnels were dug in Manbij and to the east of the Euphrates. They can dig tunnels or ditches if they want, they can go underground if they want, when the time and place comes they will buried in the ditches they dug. No one should doubt this.""
It was not clear when Akar was speaking.
President Tayyip Erdogan said this week that Turkey may start a new military operation in Syria at any moment, touting support from Trump even though the Pentagon had issued a stern warning to Ankara.
The Pentagon had said that unilateral military action by any party in northeast Syria, where U.S. forces operate, would be unacceptable. 

Turkey has already intervened to sweep YPG and Islamic State fighters from territory west of the Euphrates over the past two years. It has not gone east of the river, partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces.

905,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 01:29AM ET</span>",El Salvador's top cop pursues politicians; now some want him gone,"By Christine Murray and Nelson Renteria
SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - When El Salvador's legislative assembly confirmed little-known Douglas Melendez as attorney general in 2016, many here thought it was business as usual in a country where high-level corruption has long gone unpunished.
But in less than three years, Melendez has put one former president in prison, investigated another and has a third in his sights. He has also jailed his predecessor, a judge and a top businessman, among others. 
Some in El Salvador's political class have seen enough.
Congress must vote before January 5 on whether the 52-year-old career prosecutor can stay on for another three-year term. Despite international support, Melendez has powerful opponents in the ruling leftist party. El Salvador's lawmakers could make their decision as soon as this week.
Even if he survives that vote, the backlash is likely to continue. Melendez said he has received death threats. And the leading candidate in February's presidential contest has talked of jail time for Melendez.
The U.S. government has paid for bulletproof cars for Melendez's team. His family now travels with body guards.
""We do not have a lot of allies,"" Melendez said in an interview at his offices in a wealthy area on the edge of San Salvador. ""Often the public servant that does, or tries to do, their job independently makes people uncomfortable, and that brings repercussions.""
Growing pressure on Melendez is the latest sign that an anti-corruption drive that swept parts of Latin American in recent years may be faltering.
Judges and prosecutors across the region have made strides to clean up the region's notoriously greasy politics. In addition to El Salvador, Peru, Guatemala and Brazil have all charged and imprisoned former presidents.
But those high-profile purges have bred resistance among political players whose power is threatened by their work.
In Guatemala, conservative President Jimmy Morales declined to renew the mandate of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a United Nations-backed body investigating him for corruption. Set up to assist Guatemala's justice system stem decades of impunity, CICIG helped topple his predecessor over another graft case, and it won a 15-year jail sentence for a former vice president convicted of fraud and influence peddling.
Morales has said CICIG violated Guatemala's constitution and due process, and that it was a ""threat to peace"".
In Honduras, the head of a MACCIH, a similar body backed by the Organization of American States, resigned over lack of support from authorities.
""There are good things happening but it's incredibly fragile,"" said Eric L. Olson, a Latin America expert at the Seattle International Foundation, highlighting pushback across the region.
""There's been a tremendous backlash against the attorney generals who attempt to be independent,"" he said.
Tiny El Salvador borrowed practices from its neighbors for its anti-corruption drive. Similar to graft-busters in Honduras and Guatemala, Melendez created a separate unit called the ""Group Against Impunity"", which now has some 25 handpicked prosecutors working on the most high-profile corruption cases.
Local civil society has criticized the attorney general's office for its lack of investigative ability, pointing out that successful cases have often relied on evidence gathered by others, such as the Supreme Court or journalists.
Melendez says he is working with a lean budget, and the attorney general's office was infiltrated by organized crime when he arrived. He is currently prosecuting his predecessor Luis Martinez for money laundering, illicit negotiations and a slew of other crimes. 
Martinez allegedly accepted bribe payments in cash, trips and cars from powerful people to protect them. Martinez denies the charges. His lawyer declined to comment.
POWERFUL CRITICS, INTERNATIONAL BACKING
Melendez grew up in a humble town in eastern El Salvador, a country of just 6 million people. He helped the attorney general's office set up its first anti-corruption unit.
Media-friendly Melendez has at times broken unwritten rules of propriety to grab headlines, earning him criticism.
Conservative former President Antonio Saca, who is now serving 10 years in prison for embezzlement and money laundering, was taken into custody at his son's black-tie wedding in an upscale part of San Salvador.
Melendez famously insulted the partner of leftist former President Mauricio Funes, comparing her to a public works project because so much taxpayer money allegedly was spent on her upkeep, including for plastic surgery.
Funes said no public money was spent on plastic surgery, and that Melendez's comment was sexist.
The attorney general is currently trying to extradite Funes from Nicaragua, where he fled to escape charges of embezzlement and money laundering.
Like Funes, many of the political figures Melendez has pursued are linked to the ruling Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front or FMLN, the former leftist guerilla army that became a political party at the end of the country's civil war in 1992. Party members say that is evidence of his bias.
In an email to Reuters, Funes said Melendez got witnesses to implicate him falsely through plea-bargain deals while letting conservative politicians linked to graft off the hook. 
""The case against me is a clear example of the use and manipulation of criminal justice by the right,"" Funes said. ""For that reason I decided to stay in Nicaragua.""
Melendez defends his record saying that people will always push back against being investigated, and that politicians on both the left and right think he is biased against the other.
The center-right candidate leading the polls to become El Salvador's next president, Nayib Bukele, is certainly no fan of the attorney general.
Melendez has investigated Bukele for a variety of allegations, including violence against women, but never charged him. The two men regularly trade barbs publicly.
Bukele delivered a sharp warning to his nemesis earlier this year at a speech to supporters in the United States, where around a quarter of Salvadorans live.
""The lesson...should be clear for this attorney general,"" Bukele said. ""Do not abuse power if you do not want to end up in [prison] being abused.""
Still, Melendez has some powerful backers of his own, particularly in the international community. Foreign governments and international bodies including the United Nations have offered support and funding for his work.
The United States gave $72.8 million in bilateral assistance to El Salvador in 2017, an official at the U.S. State Department said, supporting security, justice and violence-prevention initiatives in the attorney general's office as well as other institutions.
""Corruption is one of the principal inhibitors of economic growth in El Salvador and a key driver of illegal immigration to the United States,"" the official said.
Melendez has been tougher on corruption than any top cop in El Salvador's modern history, said veteran Justice Sidney Blanco, who recently stepped down from the Supreme Court.
""It is really difficult to predict what a new attorney general would do if they do not reelect [Melendez],"" he said. ""Right now we are living a crucial moment.""
As for Melendez, he says his effectiveness is what ultimately may work against him.

""I think future governors in this country will think twice about stealing money,"" Melendez said. ""That makes you want to carry on, but in the end it will be the politicians that decide.""

906,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 12:25AM ET</span>",Hundreds of South Koreans sue government over wartime labor at Japan firms,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hundreds of South Koreans have sued the government for compensation over their forced labor at Japanese firms during World War Two, representatives said on Thursday, in a fresh twist to one of several historical disputes between the two sides. 
Seoul and Tokyo have been struggling to contain fallout from a landmark ruling in October by South Korea's Supreme Court that Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp must compensate four South Korean forced laborers as their rights to reparations were not terminated by a 1965 treaty that normalized diplomatic ties. 
Under the deal, South Korea received around $800 million in economic aid and loans from Japan in exchange for Seoul considering all pre-treaty compensation issues settled. And the money was spent to rebuild its infrastructure and economy ravaged by the 1950-53 Korean War.
Similar verdicts in favor of the forced laborers followed suit, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in said last week that he respects the decision upholding their individual rights to compensation. 
A group of 1,103 former forced laborers and their families said it filed a lawsuit in a Seoul court on Wednesday, demanding the South Korean government provide 100 million won ($88,500) to each of them in compensation because it had received funds from Japan. 
The case adds to three suits previously raised by a total of 283 victims and their families. 
""The government should compensate us first, taking responsibility for using the money it took from the 1965 treaty,"" the group told a news conference in Seoul. 
The two countries share a bitter history that includes Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean peninsula, the forced mobilization of labor at Japanese companies and the use of comfort women, Japan's euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels.
The rows over wartime history have long been a hurdle for relations between the neighbors at a time when there is a need for concerted efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

907,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>",An online battle for 900 million hearts and minds: India braces for election,"By Aditya Kalra
JAIPUR/TONK, India (Reuters) - When India votes in a general election next year, it will be the world's largest democratic exercise, and the biggest ever test of the role of social media in an election.
As the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) readies for battle with the newly energized Congress party-led opposition in the election that must be held by May, the role of Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp could be crucial in deciding who wins. 
India already has close to 900 million eligible voters, and an estimated half-a-billion have access to the Internet. The country has 300 million Facebook (O:FB) users and 200 million on Facebook's WhatsApp messaging service - more than any other democracy. Millions use Twitter (N:TWTR). 
""Social media and data analytics will be the main actors in the upcoming India elections. Their use would be unprecedented as both parties now use social media,"" said Usha M. Rodrigues, a communications professor at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia, whose research has focused on social media and Indian politics.
The potential for abuse is also immense, with incendiary news and videos capable of fanning violence in the sprawling multi-religious and multi-ethnic nation. 
Fake news and messages circulated on social media have led to more than 30 deaths since last year, data portal IndiaSpend says, mostly rumors about child kidnapping gangs.
Political differences have in the past been no less deadly.
""Social media discourse, already bitter, will turn bilious,"" Milan Vaishnav, a senior research fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, said of the coming campaign for the general election. 
""It will be no-holds barred on social media given that the opposition smells blood and the ruling party has its back against the wall.""
Both the main parties accuse each other of propagating fake news while denying they do so themselves. 
Nevertheless, the battlelines between them are clearly drawn. Congress has attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic policies and his party's Hindu nationalist ideology, while the BJP dismisses the Congress as incompetent liberals out of touch with the people.
This month, Congress won elections in three major states that have been the bastion of the BJP, setting the stage for a tight contest in 2019. Helping the opposition party was a revamped social media strategy. 
WAR ROOMS 
At the last election in 2014, Congress was crushed by the techno-savvy Modi and his array of social media weapons, including a flurry of Tweets from his personal account, a BJP campaign on Facebook and holographic displays of Modi in remote villages. 
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi got a Twitter account only in 2015. But the opposition party is catching up and the playing field has gotten a lot bigger.
India now has 450 million smartphone owners against 155 million at the last election in 2014, according to Counterpoint Research. That's more than the entire population of the United States, the crucible for election campaigns on social media. 
Reuters visited one of the hubs of Congress's online operations in Rajasthan, one of the three states it won this month - a drab three-bedroom apartment up a dimly lit staircase in the city of Jaipur.
Inside, party workers tracked news channels and social media posts on a wall of television screens. A three-member team of audio, video and graphic experts designed campaign material that was posted to public websites, while other volunteers used WhatsApp to send instructions to party workers. 
""We were kids back then, but we are going to outmaneuver them now,"" said Manish Sood, 45, who runs his own social media marketing business and was managing the Congress volunteers at the Jaipur war room.
Still, fighting Modi online isn't easy. With 43 million followers on Facebook and 45 million on Twitter globally, he is among the world's most followed politicians. Congress's Gandhi still only has 8.1 million followers on Twitter and 2.2 million on Facebook.
A request by Reuters to visit the BJP's social media center in Jaipur was declined, but a member of the party's Rajasthan state IT unit, Mayank Jain, said it ran similar social media operations from two city apartments.
""Congress understands social media a bit now, but they do not have the volunteer manpower,"" Jain said in an interview, showing dozens of BJP WhatsApp groups on his phone, one of which was named ""BJP RAJASTHAN'S Warriors"".
RISE OF WHATSAPP
While Twitter and Facebook were embraced by Indian politicians - mainly in the BJP - in 2014, it's WhatsApp that has now become the social media tool of choice.
In Jaipur city and the nearby rural town of Tonk, where traditional methods like public speeches and poster campaigns were widely used during the state poll, Congress and BJP party workers showed a Reuters reporter dozens of WhatsApp groups they were part of and used for campaigning.
Congress said its volunteers managed 90,000 WhatsApp groups in Rajasthan, while the BJP said it controlled 15,000 WhatsApp groups directly, with its workers campaigning through roughly another 100,000 groups.
But WhatsApp has been at the center of controversy. After the false child kidnap messages were spread on the platform in India, it was flooded with falsehoods and conspiracy theories ahead of the October election in Brazil.
WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption allows groups of hundreds of users to exchange texts, photos and video beyond the purview of authorities, independent fact checkers or even the platform itself.
""WhatsApp is the biggest challenge for us right now on the social media front,"" said Nitin Deep Blaggan, a senior police officer in charge of monitoring online content in Jaipur.
WhatsApp has limited the number of messages a user can forward in one go to 20 but in India specifically the ceiling was fixed at five. The company blocked ""hundreds of thousands"" of accounts in Brazil during the election period, and the same was expected ahead of India polls, a source aware of the company's thinking said this month.
""We have engaged with political organizers to inform them that we will take action against accounts that are sending automated unwanted messages,"" Carl Woog, WhatsApp's head of communications, told Reuters in a statement. He did not name any parties.
A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was ""committed to maintaining elections integrity"" and making efforts to ""weed out false news"". Twitter said it had made efforts to protect the electoral process and better detect and stop malicious activity.
During the Rajasthan election, police ran a 10-man social media monitoring unit, tracking tweets and Facebook posts related to the state polls. Inside the monitoring room, the posts were shown on wall-mounted screens and automatically filtered into neutral, positive or negative sections. 
The negative posts received special attention - they were manually checked and, sometimes flagged to senior police officers for further investigation and action.
The sole aim, members of the monitoring team said, was to ensure that no online post spilled into violence. 
One of the posts flagged by police when Reuters visited was a video from a Congress leader's rally where people appeared to be shouting slogans in favor of Pakistan, India's old enemy. 

Congress' nearby war room had already debunked the video they said was doctored. Within hours, party workers posted what they said was an ""original"" video, that showed that nobody shouted such slogans at the rally.

908,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",South Korea seeks smaller military drills with U.S. amid North Korea talks,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea wants to hold smaller joint military drills with the United States next year, the defense ministry said on Thursday, scaling back larger exercises as part of an effort to boost nuclear diplomacy with North Korea.
The allies have suspended a number of combined military exercises this year as tensions on the Korean peninsula eased and Washington began talks to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear program.
The North has denounced the annual drills, which in the past involved hundreds of thousands of troops, warships and aircraft, as a ""rehearsal for war."" 
With nuclear talks under way, Seoul and Washington are discussing scaling back their regular field exercises, including Foal Eagle in early 2019, and hold two computer-simulated command post drills next year, the defense ministry said. 
U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said last month the Foal Eagle exercise would be ""reorganized a bit to keep it at a level that will not be harmful to diplomacy"" with North Korea.
The defense ministry delivered its plan to President Moon Jae-in on Thursday as part of its annual policy briefing. 
""Joint field exercises would take place all year round after adjusting the scale,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
The plan is also expected to affect a major summer exercise known as Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which the allies suspended last year for the first time in 28 years.
In his opening remarks at the briefing, Moon said South Korea's strong defense had underpinned ""a new chapter of history of peace on the Korean peninsula.""
""But it's only provisional peace,"" he said. ""We have to establish unwavering, lasting peace next year.""
Relations improved this year between the Communist North and rich, democratic South, technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.
They have held three leaders' summits and signed a pact to establish a no-fly zone, remove landmines and guard posts near their heavily-guarded border. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also met U.S. President Donald Trump in June at a historic summit in Singapore. They vowed to work toward denuclearization, but both sides have made little progress since then.
Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea, said on Wednesday humanitarian aid to North Korea could be expedited in a move seen aimed at reviving the stalled nuclear talks.
The larger military drills could be revisited if there is no progress in the talks, said Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. 

""If no progress is made by the summer, the United States would face substantial pressure at home and could try to restart the Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise,"" he said.

909,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 10:45PM ET</span>",North Carolina political consultant cited in probe of 2016 election: documents,"By Brendan O'Brien and Letitia Stein
(Reuters) - A North Carolina political consultant at the center of a probe into possible election fraud in a Congressional contest last month appeared to have paid for the collection of absentee ballots in a 2016 contest, which would be a violation of state election laws, according to documents released on Wednesday.
Interviews with voters led to information ""strongly suggesting"" that Leslie McCrae Dowless paid individuals to solicit absentee request forms and to collect absentee ballots from Bladen County voters in 2016, newly released records from a prior investigation by the state's election board showed. 
Possession of an absentee ballot for delivery to a voter or for return by anyone other than the voter, the voter's near relative, or the voter's legal guardian is a felony, investigators wrote. 
Dowless is currently a person of interest in a probe of possible absentee ballot fraud in a disputed U.S. congressional election in November, North Carolina’s board of elections said two weeks ago.
Dowless' attorney, Cynthia Singletary, did not respond to requests for comment by phone and by email from Reuters on Wednesday about the new disclosure.
On Tuesday, Singletary, in a statement posted on Twitter in response to the probe into last month's disputed congressional election in North Carolina, said her client has not violated state or federal campaign laws. 
""Mr. Dowless is a highly respected member of our community who is routinely sought after for his campaign expertise,"" she said.
The board has refused to certify Republican Mark Harris as the winner of the Nov. 6 election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as it investigates possible fraud involving absentee ballots from two rural counties.
If fraud is uncovered, the board could order a new election. Harris edged out Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes, but McCready withdrew his concession on Dec. 6. 
The North Carolina State Board of Elections opened an investigation in the fall of 2016 after receiving three complaints of possible fraud involving the handling of absentee ballots, according to the documents released on Wednesday. 
One of the documents released on Wednesday was handwritten testimony during the investigation from one of the individuals who worked for Dowless. He wrote that Dowless promised to pay him half of $225 when he turned in 20 absentee ballot request forms and the remaining half when he gave him the 20 signed absentee ballots in 2016. 
The ballots were part of the federal and state elections in 2016 that included the presidential race won by Donald Trump.
Two women have told WSOC-TV in North Carolina that Dowless paid them to collect absentee ballots and deliver them to him in 2018. 
Lorrin Freeman, the district attorney in Wake County, who is handling the case because the district attorney in Bladen County had cited a conflict of interest, said her office was investigating concerns arising from the 2016 election when her office became aware of new allegations regarding the 2018 elections.
“We certainly hope to bring it to conclusion quickly but it has been one of those things that during the course of the investigation it has continued to grow in scope,” she said to Reuters. 
Freeman said as recently as this week that her office began looking into voting irregularities in Columbus County, which neighbors Bladen County. She said her office was not identifying any individuals targeted in its investigation. 
    The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Eastern North Carolina in an email to Reuters said it had no comment.

910,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",Kindertransport survivor sees German payments as history acknowledged,"By Simon Thompson
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - For 93-year-old Paul Kester, the sum of $2,800 offered him by the German government for his childhood ordeal during the Nazi era can never replace what he lost, but he welcomes the payment as recognition that ""this history is not forgotten.""
Kester, who spent his early years in Germany, was just 13 when he was sent away by his parents to Sweden as part of the Kindertransport, a rescue mission that allowed some 10,000 Jewish children to flee Nazi-occupied Europe in the late 1930s.
He is now one of a rapidly diminishing number of living Kindertransport refugees eligible for a one-time payment of 2,500 euros - just over $2,800 in U.S. dollars - approved by the German government this week for survivors of that humanitarian effort.
""It's a goodwill gesture,"" Kester said of the compensation offer during an interview with Reuters at the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust, which opened an exhibit on the Kindertransport this year marking its 80th anniversary. ""The amount is something that doesn't mean much to me. But the gesture does.""
Only about 1,000 of the Kindertransport evacuees, now in their 80s and 90s, are still believed to be alive worldwide, though the precise number is uncertain, a museum spokeswoman said. 
About a half dozen are known to reside in the Los Angeles area, including Kester, a retired accountant who settled in the United States in 1948 with his wife, Susanne, also a German refugee. They met during his 10 years in Sweden. She has since died.
As a boy, Kester lived in Wiesbaden, Germany, where his father managed a family-owned clothing store. But after the widespread violence and destruction of the anti-Jewish Kristallnacht pogroms that swept Germany in November 1938, Kester's parents arranged for him to flee the country.
He ended up in a January 1939 Kindertransport evacuation to Sweden, which took in about 500 of the children who were relocated. Most of the 10,000 were sent to Great Britain, but some went to Switzerland and other countries.
""I was lucky to make it,"" he said. His parents ultimately perished at the Auschwitz death camp. 
The payment from Germany ""does not replace what was lost,"" Kester said. ""But it is, I guess, the only way, one of the ways, that Germany can show that this history is not forgotten, and that hopefully it won't be forgotten in years to come."" 
Compensation for Kindertransport refugees was especially late in coming because of a debate, since settled, over whether they should rightfully be considered Holocaust survivors, said the Holocaust Museum President Paul Nussbaum.
""These children were ripped away from their parents,"" Nussbaum said. ""They left a world that was destroyed, and they went alone with other children to a new reality, which was not a family environment by and large.""
Both Kester and Nussbaum said the payments could help carry a broader message about the consequences of unchecked intolerance and hatred at a time of rising xenophobia around the world.
Kester, who once gave talks to German high school students about the Holocaust, said he was frequently asked whether they bore any of the guilt, to which he always answered ""no."" 
But, he recounted telling them: ""You have an obligation to know your own history, the history of your country, and to make sure that something like that will never happen again, and make tolerance one of your primary purposes in life.'""

911,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 08:35PM ET</span>","As U.N. mulls how to back Yemen truce, U.S. wants to call out Iran","By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States wants the United Nations Security Council to condemn Iran in a draft resolution being negotiated to back a ceasefire deal in Yemen's Hodeidah region, but Russia has rejected the move, diplomats said on Wednesday.
After a week of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden, the Iranian-aligned Houthi group and Saudi-backed Yemen government foes agreed last Thursday to stop fighting in the Red Sea city of Hodeidah and withdraw forces. The truce began on Tuesday.
The 15-member Security Council is now considering a British-drafted resolution to endorse the deal and ask U.N. chief Antonio Guterres to submit proposals on how to monitor the ceasefire and redeployment of forces.
The initial draft text, seen by Reuters, condemns ""the supply, from whatever source, of weapons and associated materiel in contravention of the arms embargo provisions,"" but does not name any countries. 
The United States wants to specifically condemn Iran, according to diplomats and a revised draft seen by Reuters, but Russia has objected to the language. Diplomats have said the aim is to try to adopt a resolution this week. 
In February, Russia vetoed a U.S.-led attempt to have the council call out Tehran in a resolution on Yemen. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain to pass.
U.N. chief Antonio Guterres has reported to the Security Council that the debris of several ballistic missiles fired by the Houthis at neighboring Saudi Arabia appear to be Iranian. Iran denies supplying weapons to the Houthis.
A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to back government forces. The United Nations and Western countries have criticized the coalition for killing a high number of civilians, including children. 
The draft council resolution condemns indiscriminate attacks and targeting of civilians. It does not mention the Saudi-led coalition. 
U.N. diplomats also said some countries wanted the current draft resolution on Yemen to be specifically focused on the ceasefire deal reached in Sweden and for language addressing the humanitarian crisis in the country to be removed. 
The conflict has pushed impoverished Yemen to the verge of famine, and millions of people rely on food aid. More than 80 percent of Yemen's imports used to come through Hodeidah port, but that has slowed to a trickle.

Kuwait's U.N. ambassador, Mansour al-Otaibi, said on Wednesday that council members were still working on the draft resolution and ""some concerns have not been met.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has begun what will be a total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, declaring on Wednesday they have succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State and were no longer needed in the country.
A decision to pull out completely, confirmed by U.S. officials and expected in the coming months, coincides with the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops finishing up a campaign to retake territory once held by Islamic State militants. 
But it could leave the United States with few options to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State. It could also undercut U.S. leverage in the region and undermine diplomatic efforts to end the Syrian civil war, which is now in its eighth year. 
""They're all coming back and they're coming back now. We won,"" Trump declared on Wednesday in a video posted on Twitter.
https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075528854402256896 
News of a full withdrawal drew immediate criticism from some of Trump's fellow Republicans, who said that leaving strengthened the hand of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al Assad.
It may also leave exposed an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which has been among the most effective against Islamic State but is under threat as Turkey weighs a new offensive in Syria.
U.S. commanders on the ground, who have developed strong ties to SDF leaders, had voiced concerns about what a fast withdrawal would mean for the U.S-backed forces and were surprised by the decision, U.S. officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
But Trump said that he considered the mission in Syria over given Islamic State territorial losses.
Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, was slow to get involved in Syria's civil war, fearing being dragged into another open-ended foreign conflict like the one in Afghanistan. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict, which has displaced around half of Syria's pre-war 22 million population.
But in a campaign to defeat Islamic State in Syria, Obama ordered air strikes from September 2014 and then troops into the country the following year.
The White House declined to offer a timeline for withdrawal. 
One U.S. official said Washington aimed to withdraw troops within 60 to 100 days and said the U.S. State Department was evacuating all its personnel in Syria within 24 hours. A second official said they could leave even sooner.
TRUMP'S WARINESS
Trump is wary of open-ended foreign conflicts and his decision on Syria raises questions about whether he may also reconsider the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan, where American forces have been fighting since 2001. 
Trump reluctantly agreed to a troop increase last year but U.S. officials have privately acknowledged a sense of urgency and are increasingly focused on securing a peace deal with a resurgent Taliban.
Some of Trump's Republican allies in Congress railed against the pullout decision. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, often a Trump ally but generally a foreign policy hawk, said a withdrawal would have ""devastating consequences"" for the United States in the region and throughout the world.
""An American withdrawal at this time would be a big win for ISIS, Iran, Bashar al Assad of Syria, and Russia,"" Graham said in a statement, using the acronym ISIS for Islamic State.
The surprise decision also raised eyebrows abroad.
A British defense minister said he strongly disagreed with Trump that Islamic State had been defeated in Syria. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would study the decision and would ensure its own security. 
In Russia, TASS news agency quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria created prospects for a political settlement.
SPECIAL FORCES
Many of the remaining U.S. troops in Syria are special operations forces working closely with the SDF.
The partnership with the SDF has helped defeat of Islamic State in Syria but has outraged NATO ally Turkey, which views Kurdish YPG forces in the alliance as an extension of a separatist militant group fighting inside Turkey.
Ankara is threatening a new offensive in Syria. To date, U.S. forces in Syria have been seen as a stabilizing factor and have somewhat restrained Turkey's actions against the SDF.
A complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria would leave a sizeable U.S. military presence in the region, including about 5,200 troops across the border in Iraq. Much of the U.S. campaign in Syria has been waged by warplanes flying out of Qatar and other locations in the Middle East.
Still, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and State Department officials have long fretted about leaving Syria before a peace agreement can be reached.
Islamic State is also widely expected to revert to guerilla tactics once it no longer holds territory. The United States has not ruled out that Islamic State's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi could still be alive.
A U.S. withdrawal could open Trump up to criticism if Islamic State reemerged.
Trump had lambasted Obama for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq that preceded an unraveling of the Iraqi armed forces. Iraqi forces collapsed in the face of Islamic State's advance into Iraq in 2014.
A senior administration official rejected the comparison to Iraq, where the United States had many more troops and would have stayed if Baghdad had provided legal protections for the American forces. 
""That's an apples and oranges comparison given the scope and scale of our engagement in Iraq,"" the official said. 
LAST 1 PERCENT
Islamic State declared its so-called ""caliphate"" in 2014 after seizing large swathes of Syria and Iraq. The hardline group established its de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe.
According to U.S. estimates, the group oversaw about 100,000 square kilometers (39,000 square miles) of territory, with about 8 million people under Islamic State control. It had estimated revenues of nearly one billion dollars a year.
A senior U.S. official last week said the group was down to its last 1 percent of the territory it once held. It has no remaining territory in Iraq.
Hajin, the group's last major stronghold in Syria, is close to being seized by U.S.-backed SDF forces.
After losing Hajin, Islamic State will control a diminishing strip of territory along the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in the area where U.S.-backed operations are focused. Militants also control some desert terrain west of the river in territory otherwise controlled by the Damascus government and its allies.
U.S. officials have warned that taking back the group's territory would not be the same as defeating it.

""The Coalition has liberated the ISIS-held territory, but the campaign against ISIS is not over,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement.

913,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 07:36PM ET</span>","In Syria retreat, Trump rebuffs top advisers and blindsides U.S. commanders","By Steve Holland and Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump overrode his top national security aides, blindsided U.S. ground commanders, and stunned lawmakers and allies with his order for U.S. troops to leave Syria, a decision that upends American policy in the Middle East.
The result, said current and former officials and people briefed on the decision, will empower Russia and Iran and leave unfinished the goal of erasing the risk that Islamic State, or ISIS, which has lost all but a sliver territory, could rebuild.
Trump was moving toward his dramatic decision in recent weeks even as top aides tried to talk him out of it, determined to fulfill a campaign promise of limiting U.S. involvement militarily abroad, two senior officials said. 
The move, which carries echoes of Trump's repudiation of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate change accord, is in keeping with his America First philosophy and the pledge he made to end U.S. military involvement.
A former senior Trump administration official said the president's decision basically was made two years ago, and that Trump finally stared down what he considered unpersuasive advice to stay in.
""The president won. His inclination was always not to be there,"" said the former official who is close to the White House, saying a variety of senior advisers had all argued against pulling out.
In meetings with top advisers, Trump would ask: ""What are we doing there? I know we're there to fight ISIS, but we did it. Now what?"" said the former official.
Trump understood, but rejected, arguments by senior advisers that U.S. troops were not on the front lines, numbered only 2,000 and markedly strengthened anti-Islamic State local forces, saying he wanted to get out once Raqqa and other ISIS strongholds fell. 
QUALMS IN THE PENTAGON 
A U.S. defense official said Trump's decision was widely seen in the Pentagon as benefiting Russia as well as Iran, both of which have used their support for the Syrian government to bolster their regional influence. Iran also has improved its ability to ship arms to Lebanese Hezbollah for use against Israel.
Asked who gained from the withdrawal, the defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, replied: ""Geopolitically Russia, regionally Iran.""
Another U.S. defense official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S military commanders had expressed concerns with the administration about what a rapid withdrawal would mean for U.S.-backed local forces fighting Islamic State. 
The official said the plan to withdraw had caught the commanders by surprise.
Trump ""destroyed ISIS safe haven in Syria & will lose the peace by withdrawing,"" tweeted retired Army Vice Chief of Staff Jack Keane, who has been seen as a possible successor to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. ""ISIS will re-emerge, Iran a greater threat, will own all of Syria, Israel more in danger.""
Like other experts, Keane, who is also a Fox News analyst, said that by pulling out, Trump will surrender Washington's ability to play a major role in framing a settlement of the Syrian civil war.
Charles Lister, an expert with the Middle East Institute thinktank, agreed. ""It completely takes apart America's broader strategy in Syria,"" he said, ""but perhaps more importantly, the centerpiece of the Trump administration policy, which is containing Iran.
""Syria is the jewel in the crown of Iran's regional strategy,"" he said.
The Trump administration dismissed that argument.
""These troops that we had in Syria were never there to counter Iran. They were always there to destroy the territorial caliphate of ISIS,"" said a senior administration official. ""And so I think the president was perfectly justified when he judged that mission was at an end.""
FRUSTRATION AMONG REPUBLICANS, ALLIES 
Lawmakers from both parties complained that they were not briefed in advance of the decision. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Reuters that GOP senators expressed their frustration ""in spades"" during a lunch with Vice President Mike Pence.
French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were scrambling to find out exactly what the announcement meant and how it will affect their participation in U.S.-led coalition operations against Islamic State. 
""If this turns out to be as bad as it sounds, then it’s a serious problem for us and the British because operationally the coalition doesn’t work without the U.S.,"" said one French diplomat. 
Syria's civil war, which began in 2011, has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced around half the country's pre-war 22 million population and defied all efforts at diplomatic resolution.
The pull-out may be an especially bitter pill for Jim Jeffrey, the U.S. special representative for Syria, who was the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad when former President Barack Obama decided to withdraw U.S. forces, undercutting his leverage.
As recently as in September, Jeffrey told reporters, ""We are not in a hurry to pull out.""

914,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 06:34PM ET</span>",Honduran migrant gunned down shortly after U.S. deportation,"By Gustavo Palencia
TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - A Honduran migrant who had recently been deported from the United States was shot and killed a few blocks from his home, his family said on Wednesday, in another sign of the dangers faced by migrants fleeing Central American gangs.
Nelson Espinal, 28, was shot 15 times on Tuesday night shortly after leaving his home in the capital Tegucigalpa, said his sister, Patricia Espinal. The neighborhood is dominated by the Barrio 18 gang, one of the country's most dangerous.
Espinal was deported from the United States in late November and barred from returning for five years, according to documents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
Nevertheless, Espinal, who worked in construction, planned to make another attempt to enter the country in January, his sister said.
""He said that if he did not leave, they were going to kill him,"" Patricia Espinal said as her mother, Sara Matamoros, wept. ""That's why he left following the caravan.""
Espinal was detained after crossing the border illegally in Arizona, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He did not appear to be part of the migrant caravans trekking from Central America to the United States and did not seek asylum, the agency said.
On Wednesday, a U.S. federal judge struck down Trump administration policies aimed at restricting asylum claims by people citing gang or domestic violence in their home countries. 
In Mexico, authorities are investigating the deaths of two migrant teenagers from Honduras who were killed in the border city of Tijuana last weekend.
The youths, believed to be about 16 or 17 years old, showed signs of having been stabbed and strangled. It could not be determined immediately if the victims had planned to apply for asylum.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters on Wednesday his government would seek ""fair treatment"" for migrants.
More than 2,000 mainly Honduran immigrants who traveled with the caravan remain in a shelter in Tijuana, Lopez Obrador said. U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted that they will not be allowed into the United States, but a few asylum seekers have already crossed the border.

The killings could fuel criticism of a policy proposal that Mexico and the United States discussed earlier this year to have Central American migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum claims are processed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States imposed fresh Russia-related sanctions on Wednesday, expanding a blacklist of individuals allegedly involved in a Kremlin-backed campaign to meddle with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, among other misdeeds.
The U.S. Treasury Department twinned that development with an announcement that it would lift sanctions on major aluminum company Rusal and two other firms tied to Oleg Deripaska after a deal was struck to sever the Russian oligarch's control over them.
Deripaska himself will remain under sanctions, Treasury said.
The fresh sanctions targeted 15 members of a Russian military intelligence service and four entities involved in the alleged election interference, the hacking of the World Anti-Doping Agency and other ""malign activities"" around the world, the Treasury said in a statement on its website.
The action, which followed sanctions in April on Deripaska and six other oligarchs, were ""in response to Russia's continued disregard for international norms,"" the statement from Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said.
The move also comes on the heels of U.S. President Donald Trump's signing of an executive order in September to impose sanctions on any country or person that tries to interfere in U.S. elections. Trump issued the order amid criticism over his handling of Russian election meddling.
""The administration hasn't taken its eye off the Russian intelligence service and the role they play in malign activities around the world,"" said Michael Dobson, who worked on sanctions policy toward Russia at OFAC and is now at the Morrison & Foerster law firm. ""I think it's definitely a strong action.""
The sanctioned individuals include several intelligence officers who were allegedly engaged in the hacking of Democratic Party officials and in campaigns to sow discord over social media with the aim of disrupting U.S. elections.
The list includes Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, who was charged in October in Virginia for attempting to interfere in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, and who has been named in court papers as the accountant for a collection of Russian companies indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller earlier this year.
Treasury also singled out Victor Boyarkin for his ties to Deripaska. Boyarkin is a former intelligence officer who reports directly to Deripaska and helped provide ""Russian financial support"" to a Montenegrin political party ahead of elections in Montenegro in 2016, Treasury's statement said. 
The Treasury sanctioned several individuals for their alleged roles in the hacking of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and other organizations between 2016 and 2018.

It also sanctioned two Russian intelligence officers, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, for their alleged role in the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in March.

917,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 06:07PM ET</span>",Brazil chief justice suspends Lula ruling until next year,"By Brad Brooks and Lisandra Paraguassu
SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - The chief justice of Brazil's Supreme Court late on Wednesday knocked down a colleague's ruling that would have freed from jail former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, but said the full court will take up the contentious case in April.
Chief Justice Dias Toffoli wrote in his ruling that it would be up to all 11 justices to make a decision. The case considers whether a defendant convicted of a non-violent crime can be jailed after a first appeals court confirms a guilty verdict, which is the situation with Lula, convicted on corruption and facing six more graft trials.
A leftist icon, Lula is one of Brazil's most popular politicians, but is also reviled by the right, who blame him for years of corruption, botched economic policies and rising crime. 
Dias Toffoli said the case would be heard on April 10, a debate that will delve into a deeper constitutional discussion that could have wide-reaching implications for Brazil's corruption investigations and criminal justice system. 
If Lula is released in April, it would galvanize Brazil's demoralized left, still reeling after October's election of far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who has vowed to reverse policies instilled during Lula's two terms.
Lula, 73, was jailed in April after being sentenced to more than 12 years in prison, and faces six other trials over corruption allegations. He maintains his innocence, insisting he is a political prisoner, jailed in a bid to block him from running for the presidency.
His argument gained traction when the crusading anti-corruption judge Sergio Moro, who led the sweeping probe that helped put Lula behind bars, accepted an offer from Bolsonaro to be Brazil's next justice minister. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 1.
Earlier Wednesday, Justice Marco Aurelio Mello issued a shock ruling that suspended a Supreme Court decision from 2016 that allowed for convicts to be jailed after their sentence was upheld on first appeal. 
""My conscience led me to this decision,"" Mello, who voted against the court's 2016 ruling, told Reuters. ""I had to act."" 
IMPUNITY RETURNS? 
Critics have said reversing the 2016 ruling would result in the return of de facto impunity for the rich and powerful, who have been hobbled in recent years by several corruption investigations that revealed stunning levels of graft in the upper echelons of Brazilian society.
But several supreme court justices have been clamoring to revisit their 2016 ruling, arguing that lower courts have in practice made it mandatory to send non-violent convicts to prison after a failed first appeal. Won by a narrow 6-5 margin, the decision has been in justice's cross-hairs and the subject of much constitutional deliberation that could see it revisited.
Nonetheless, leaders of Brazil's anti-corruption drive, including Moro, told Reuters that overturning the decision would seriously damage the country's battle against graft.
A reversal of the 2016 ruling would not only free Lula, but also release many other leading politicians and businessmen serving time for corruption. 
Additionally, other powerful figures, like President Michel Temer, who is under investigation, could also benefit if eventually found guilty.
""It's impossible to read the Brazilian Constitution ... in the sense that it aims to guarantee impunity for the powerful, even when their crimes are proven,"" Moro told Reuters earlier this year when asked about the chance the top court could reverse its 2016 ruling. ""We are a republic, after all, not a society of castes."" 
Rodrigo Janot, Brazil's former prosecutor general who remains an influential prosecutor, told Reuters allowing convicts to remain free until they exhaust appeals deprive investigators of their best weapon in combating corruption - the ability to reach plea bargain agreements, which Brazilian law only began to allow in 2013.

""Nobody will want to turn state's witness if they know they will not face punishment,"" Janot said.

Albania did not identify the two, and did not say when they were expelled or if they had left the NATO member country, but told Reuters it had consulted its alliance partners on the decision. 
An Iranian diplomat contacted by Reuters did not answer questions, and phone calls to the Iranian Embassy in Tirana went unanswered.
U.S. national security adviser John Bolton, who played a major role in U.S. President Donald Trump's order in May to pull the United States out of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, publicly supported Albania's decision.
""Prime Minister Edi Rama of Albania just expelled the Iranian ambassador, signaling to Iran's leaders that their support for terrorism will not be tolerated,"" Bolton said in a Twitter post. ""We stand with PM Rama and the Albanian people as they stand up to Iran's reckless behavior in Europe and across the globe.""
Since Albania took in about 3,000 members of the banned Iranian opposition group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq, it has entered an arena of propaganda clashes between its members and Iranian efforts to discredit them.
Bolton and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, now one of Trump's lawyers, have visited the group in Albania, where it built a big camp near the village of Manze on the Adriatic Sea.

RABAT (Reuters) - A man suspected in the killing of two female tourists from Norway and Denmark in Morocco's Atlas Mountains belongs to a militant group, a prosecutor said on Wednesday, without identifying the group.
The women's bodies were found on Monday in an isolated area near Imlil, on the way to Toubkal, North Africa's highest peak and a popular hiking destination.
The man was arrested in Marrakech, Morocco's main tourist hub, and police were hunting other individuals identified as suspects.
""We are working to bring before justice three other suspects on the run,"" said police spokesman Boubker Sabik.
The two tourists, Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, of Denmark and 28-year-old Maren Ueland of Norway, were killed in an unguarded area in hard to reach mountains, he said. 
Investigations are also going on to authenticate a video tape shared on social media claiming to show the killing of one of the tourists, the general prosecutor said in a statement. 
The video purportedly showed the killing, with a woman screaming while a man cuts her neck with what appears to be a kitchen knife.
A source from Imlil said one of the victims was found dead inside her tent while another was found outside.
Citing a security source, Morocco's public TV channel 2M said on its website that investigations showed that the slaying of the two tourists was militant-related. It did not elaborate. 
Morocco has been largely insulated from the militant attacks that plagued other countries in North Africa. The latest bomb attack in the country dates back to April 2011 when 17 people were killed in a restaurant in Marrakech.
Morocco has stepped up its effort to counter militant groups with the creation in 2015 of its own version of the FBI. The Central Bureau for Judicial Investigations has so far broken up 57 militant cells, including eight in 2018.

More than 1,000 Moroccan youths, predominantly from the north of the country, have joined militant groups in the Middle East.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged caution on Wednesday and said he would not be ""stomping on a table"" after China detained a third Canadian amid a diplomatic dispute over the arrest of a Chinese technology executive.
The detentions of the Canadians - including one revealed on Wednesday - followed the Dec. 1 arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. [HWT.UL]. The arrest was made at the request of the United States, which is engaged in a trade war with China.
Trudeau has been under pressure to take a more robust stand on the detentions but said at a news conference, ""Political posturing or political statements aren’t necessarily going to contribute. They might actually hinder Canadians’ release. We’re going to take every situation carefully and seriously.
""Canadians understand that even though political posturing might be satisfactory in the short term to make yourself ... feel like you're stomping on a table and doing something significant, it may not directly contribute to the outcome we all want, which is for these Canadians to come home safely.""
Trudeau said he was asking China for more information on the detentions. No details have been given on the latest, but Trudeau said it was ""a very separate case"" from last week when former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were detained amid the diplomatic quarrel triggered by Meng's arrest.
Huawei is the world’s biggest supplier of telecoms network equipment and second-biggest smartphone seller. The United States has been looking since at least 2016 into whether Huawei shipped U.S.-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of U.S. export and sanctions laws, Reuters reported in April.
The Canadian government has said several times it saw no explicit link between the arrest of Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, and the detentions of Kovrig and Spavor. But Beijing-based Western diplomats and former Canadian diplomats have said they believed the detentions were a ""tit-for-tat"" reprisal by China.
Bob Rae, Canada's special envoy to Myanmar and a former Liberal Party leader, tweeted on Wednesday that ""there are no coincidences"" and said the detentions look ""too much like hostage taking."" 
An official at the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa said the embassy had no information to release on the issue.
Meng is accused by the United States of misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. She was released on bail in Vancouver, where she owns two homes, while waiting to learn if she will be extradited to the United States. She is due in court on Feb. 6.
U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters last week he might intervene in the case if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.
The comments upset Canada, which warned the United States against politicizing extradition cases.
Trudeau said a decision on whether to use Huawei equipment in Canada's 5G mobile network should be made by experts and not influenced by politics.
BUYING TIME
A source with direct knowledge of the situation said senior officials at the Canadian Foreign Ministry had held many meetings about the detainees but that a formal task force had yet to be created.
""At this point, Canada is trying to buy time by stressing it has a rules-based order and an independent judiciary,"" said the source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.
A second source said Canada was concerned that the detainees were in the hands of the powerful security authorities.
""Even if there were voices of reason in the Chinese system saying, 'Are you crazy? The Canadian government cannot order a judge to release Ms. Meng,' the security voices are going to trump them,"" the source said.
Philip Calvert, a former diplomat in China and now a research fellow at the University of Victoria, said at least the first two detentions were indicative of ""the way China often engages internationally in situations like this.""
""The people making the decisions in Beijing really think when push comes to shove, they can put pressure on Canada to override the system,"" he said.
Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association said on Wednesday he has spoken with a few Chinese automakers who are now delaying a decision to set up production facilities in Canada. The automakers, which Volpe declined to name, had been weighing whether to sell cars built in Canada to the North American market.
The last time Canadians were detained in China for security reasons was in 2014 when Kevin and Julia Garratt, who ran a coffee shop in northeastern China, were held near the border with North Korea. She was released and left the country while her husband was charged with spying and stealing state secrets before being released and deported two years later.

The arrest of the Garratts came shortly after a Chinese businessman was picked up on a U.S. warrant in Canada.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Former Blackwater guard convicted of murder in Iraq shooting spree,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A 35-year-old former Blackwater security guard was found guilty of first-degree murder on Wednesday for shooting a civilian at a crowded traffic circle in the Iraqi capital Baghdad in 2007, an incident that drew worldwide condemnation.
Nicholas Slatten was convicted of killing Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia'y, one of 14 civilians slain when Blackwater guards opened fire in Nisur Square (NYSE:SQ) on Sept. 16, 2007, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said in a statement.
Slatten is being held pending sentencing and faces a mandatory life prison term, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
His murder conviction came a year after a federal appeals court vacated his initial 2014 conviction, saying he should have been tried separately from three other Blackwater guards involved in the incident.
Prosecutors allege that Slatten, of Sparta, Tennessee, fired the first shots and intentionally set off a shooting rampage that killed or wounded 31 civilians, beginning with the death of the driver of a white Kia, Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia'y, 19. The dead included 10 men, two women and two boys, ages 9 and 11.
The shooting stood out for its brutality even in a city in the grips of a bitter sectarian war, and sparked debate over the role of private security contractors such as Blackwater working for the U.S. government in war zones.
Slatten and his fellow guards were traveling in a heavily armed, four-truck Blackwater Worldwide convoy and had been trying to clear a path for U.S. diplomats after a nearby car bomb.
At Nisur Square, they opened fire on Iraqis, including women and children, with machine guns and grenade launchers.
The U.S. Justice Department has long pursued accountability for the Nisur Square shooting.
The Justice Department's case against Slatten hinged on him having fired the first shots because of a general animosity toward Iraqis. But some evidence suggested an unnamed co-defendant might have fired the initial shots.
The appeals court also ordered the three other Blackwater guards to be resentenced, saying their 30-year terms were too long. That resentencing is pending, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Slatten had received life in prison in the initial conviction.
Blackwater, which was founded by former Navy SEAL Erik Prince, the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was later sold and now operates as Virginia-based Academi.

922,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 03:39PM ET</span>",Bipartisan senators call for U.S. 'genocide' label of Myanmar killings,"By Ginger Gibson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Wednesday called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to designate the Myanmar military's campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority a genocide. 
More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar's Rakhine state for neighboring Bangladesh since August last year, when attacks on security posts by Rohingya insurgents triggered a military crackdown that the United Nations, the United States, Britain and others described as ethnic cleansing.
Myanmar denies the accusations of ethnic cleansing.
""We are deeply concerned that despite clear evidence of genocide amassed by the Department's own report ... that the Department has not made a formal determination that the crime of genocide has been committed,"" said a letter to Pompeo from the senators, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. 
In September, leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee called on the Trump administration to declare the military campaign a genocide, days after a State Department report stopped short of that description.
A declaration of genocide by the U.S. government could have legal implications of committing Washington to stronger punitive measures against Myanmar's government, which is led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. This has made some in the Trump administration wary of issuing such an assessment.
The areas where the Rohingya lived in Myanmar's western Rakhine State before the army ousted them were being dramatically transformed, making their return increasingly unlikely, Reuters reported on Tuesday. 
The senators asked Pompeo to provide a formal determination about the actions of Myanmar's military. 
""There is no question that the violence in northern Rakhine State – intended to terrorize, drive out, and exterminate Rakhine's Rohingya population – meets the definition of genocide,"" the letter said.
Led by Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the letter was also signed by Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Susan Collins and Democratic Senators Ed Markey, Tim Kaine, Ben Cardin and Jeff Merkley.
Failing to officially label the actions a genocide would ""deny truth-telling and accountability"" for the Rohingya and ""... would leave an indelible stain on our nation's legacy of promoting and advancing human rights, dignity, and accountability,"" the letter said.

The United Nations Security Council is mulling a resolution that the council could consider further steps, including sanctions, if there was not enough progress made by Myanmar in returning refugees, diplomats said.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Leading Sudanese opposition figure Sadiq al-Mahdi returned to Sudan on Wednesday from nearly a year in self-imposed exile and called for a democratic transition before thousands of supporters.
Mahdi was Sudan's last democratically elected prime minister.
He was overthrown in 1989 by an alliance of Islamists and military commanders that still form the nucleus of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's all-powerful National Congress Party.
""The regime has failed and there is economic deterioration and erosion of the national currency's value,"" Mahdi, who heads Sudan's opposition Umma party, said.
He was speaking at a public square in Omdurman, which sits across the Nile from Khartoum before 7,000 of his supporters who chanted slogans including: ""The people want a new regime"" and ""No to war, yes to peace"".
Sudan has been facing an economic crisis since the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of Sudan’s oil output. The opposition says Bashir must go to improve the country’s image abroad and attract crucial investment and aid.
Sudan is due to hold a presidential election in 2020.
Unless the constitution is changed, Bashir, in power since 1989, is not permitted to stand again when his present term ends, having won two elections since a 2005 constitutional amendment took effect imposing a two-term limit.
But a majority of lawmakers earlier this month backed a constitutional amendment that would allow him to seek reelection.
""The prescription is to call for a memorandum of national salvation signed by all the sons of the nation and representatives of the parties and civil society,"" Mahdi said.
The memorandum would commit to a ceasefire, ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and launch public freedoms. 
He also called for the formation of a transitional consensus government that would be tasked with reforming the economy and holding a constitutional conference on peace, human rights and democratic governance.
In October, Sudan sharply devalued its currency from 29 pounds to the dollar to 47.5 after a body of banks and money changers set the country’s exchange rate.
The move led to further price increases and a liquidity crunch, while the gap between the official and black market rates has continued to widen.
About 310 km north of Khartoum, a state of emergency and 12-hour curfew was declared in the city of Atbara after protests against price increases broke out.

Port Sudan, the capital of the state of the Red Sea, also saw limited protests, witnesses told Reuters.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday struck down Trump administration policies aimed at restricting asylum claims by people citing gang or domestic violence in their home countries and ordered the U.S. government to bring back six deported migrants to reconsider their cases.
The ruling is the latest legal setback for the White House on immigration. Last month, a judge in San Francisco ordered a halt to a policy that prevented those entering illegally from Mexico from seeking asylum.
The policy at the center Wednesday's ruling sought to limit the ability of immigrants to fight expedited deportation by narrowing the grounds for claiming ""credible fear"" if they returned home, the first step in a long asylum process. 
The policy was challenged in a District of Columbia lawsuit brought by a dozen adults and children. U.S. Judge Emmet Sullivan said in a 107-page opinion the policy violated both immigration and administrative law.
""And because it is the will of Congress - not the whims of the executive - that determines the standard for expedited removal, the court finds that those policies are unlawful,"" Sullivan wrote. 
In a statement, the Department of Justice said administration policies sought to follow Congress' requirement that asylum be limited to those with a fear of persecution based on their race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a social group.
The DOJ filed a request to stay the court's orders while the government appealed the ruling. Sullivan had not responded to that request.
Sullivan, an appointee of U.S. President Bill Clinton, made headlines on Tuesday for his fierce criticism of Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, for lying to FBI agents.
For the last three months of 2017, the most recent numbers, the government conducted about 6,000 credible fear interviews monthly. The vast majority passed those interviews, allowing them to make their case for asylum in front of a U.S. immigration judge.
Jennifer Chang Newell, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who represented the asylum seekers, said the ruling ""is a defeat for the Trump administration’s all-out assault on the rights of asylum seekers.""
The ruling clears the way for four mothers and two children to be returned to the United States, according to Newell.
The administration has said that the asylum process is being abused by people who have frivolous claims but are able to stay in the country while their cases are being decided.
At a separate hearing, U.S. District Judge John Tigar in San Francisco said he would likely rule on Wednesday whether to extend his previous order that blocked Trump's policy to bar those entering illegally from Mexico from seeking asylum.
Tigar noted that his November order had been subsequently upheld by a federal appeals court and said he is now bound to follow that reasoning in deciding whether to extend it. 

On Tuesday, the United States committed billions of dollars toward development in Central America and Mexico as part of a plan to curb illegal immigration.

Ukraine and Russia have been at loggerheads since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea, with more than 10,000 people dead in battles between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists. 
The dispute deepened when Moscow last month seized two small Ukrainian gunboats and one tugboat - with a combined crew of 24 - off Crimea, accusing them of illegally entering Russian waters as they headed from the Black Sea via the Kerch Strait.
The United States and European Union have demanded the sailors' release, and President Donald Trump canceled talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in protest. 
""Russia's aggression will not stop our plans to create a naval group in the Sea of ​​Azov,"" Oleksandr Turchynov, secretary of the Ukrainian government's national security and defense council, said in an interview with the local BBC branch.
""If we stop and retreat, Russia will actually fulfill its task of capturing the Sea of ​​Azov, present the world with self-determined new sea borders in the Black Sea, de facto legalizing the occupation of Crimea,"" BBC News Ukraine quoted him as saying.
Turchynov said Kiev would invite representatives of the transatlantic military alliance NATO and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on board next time to prove Ukraine was not violating any regulations.
He did not say when ships might next attempt to pass, although he added it should not be long.

Responding to the comments, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Ukraine's intention to send warships back through the Kerch Strait was a ""provocation"".

Brazil's President-elect Jair Bolsonaro had criticized Cuba's involvement in a government healthcare program, saying that Cuban doctors were being used as ""slave labor"" because Havana took 75 percent of their salaries.
Cuba's government in response pulled out of the cooperation agreement, which provided medical care for millions of Brazilians in poor and remote areas, leaving more than 8,000 doctor positions vacant.
While Brazil said last month it had filled more than 90 percent of the vacancies, 2,439 out of 8,411 new recruits had failed to report to their work locations by a Tuesday deadline, a Health Ministry spokeswoman said. The positions will be opened up for new applications on Dec. 20 and 21, she said.
The information was earlier reported by news portal G1.
Cuba generates major export earnings by dispatching more than 50,000 health workers to more than 60 countries. The money the doctors earned in Brazil under the program was considered good by Cuban standards, even after the government took its portion.
Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, has positioned himself as a fervent anti-communist and plans to align Brazil more closely with the United States. On Tuesday, he said that he would take all action ""within the rule of law and democracy"" to oppose the governments of Venezuela and Cuba.

Lul Ruai Koang, South Sudan's military spokesman, said his office was not aware of the alleged incident.
The monitors - army officers from neighboring African countries that endorsed the September accord - had traveled to an area some 20 km (12 miles) west of the capital Juba on Tuesday to investigate an alleged violation of the deal when the incident occurred, the Juba-based group's report said. 
National Security Service personnel detained the monitors and their driver, blindfolding and handcuffing them after forcing them to strip to their underwear, the report read. 
The female member of the team was forced to strip naked. They were robbed of money and a wedding ring and detained for five hours before being released, it said.
The report by the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism (CTSAMM) called the treatment of its monitors ""inhumane"" and said the incident was a ""grave violation"" of the peace deal.
CTSAMM was set up in 2014 to monitor a previous ceasefire in South Sudan by IGAD, a bloc of regional countries. CTSAMM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""This is a critical moment for IGAD and the peace process. The response to these early violations will set the tone for the rest of the peace implementation,"" said Alan Boswell, South Sudan analyst at Brussels-based International crisis Group. 
South Sudanese President Salva Kiir signed a peace agreement with rebel factions in September to end the civil war that erupted in 2013 and killed some 400,000 people, with a third of the population forced from their homes.

""Truth and lie are muddled in his texts,"" Der Spiegel said on its website.
Some of the roughly 60 stories Relotius had written since 2011 were accurate but others were ""completely invented or embellished with manipulated quotes or other fact-fantasy,"" it said.
Among the fabricated stories were articles about a wrongfully detained Guantanamo inmate, about children kidnapped by Islamic State, and about a woman attending the execution of a death sentence as a witness in the United States.
Spiegel said it had immediately terminated his work contract. Relotius, who is 33-years-old and started writing for Der Spiegel in 2011, was not available for comment. 
Der Spiegel said Relotius' senior editors confronted him after a fellow journalist at the magazine voiced suspicions. Relotius then admitted that he had fabricated content a number of articles he had written, it said.
Der Spiegel said the incident marked a ""low point in the 70-history"" of the magazine and apologized for his actions.
It cited Relotius as saying that at least 14 of the articles he wrote for Spiegel, some of which won awards, did not meet journalistic standards. 
""Claas Relotius acted with intent, methodically and with a high level of criminal energy,"" Der Spiegel said, adding that he had written about and cited people he had never met or spoken to.

Relotius most recently won an award in early December, for a story about a child in war-torn Syria. The German reporters' association, which handed out the award, said it was ""aghast"" and ""angry"" about the news.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The number of Russians who regret the break-up of the Soviet Union has risen to its highest since 2005, amid rising economic concerns and nostalgia for the Soviet welfare system, the Levada pollster said on Wednesday. 
President Vladimir Putin famously dubbed the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century and he and many Russians have long lamented the blow its demise dealt to Moscow's great power status. 
The number of Russians pining for the Soviet past has been steadily rising under Putin since he returned to the presidency in 2012, poll data issued by the independent Levada Center on Wednesday showed. 
In the survey, 66 percent of Russians said they regretted the Soviet break-up, a level not seen since 2005 when Levada recorded 65 percent and Putin was on his second term in the Kremlin.
The number of nostalgic Russians fell gradually from 2004, reaching a low of 49 percent in 2012, before rising to its current level, the pollster found, on a par with the 1990s after the Soviet collapse. 
Karina Pipiya, a sociologist at Levada, said that in the past such feelings were often triggered by loss of international prestige and questions of national identity.
""Now the nostalgia is more determined by economic factors and regret that there used to be more social justice and that the government worked for the people and that it was better in terms of care for citizens and paternalistic expectations,"" she said.
Ordinary Russians have faced stagnating incomes, a weaker rouble and inflation since 2014, when the Russian economy entered recession amid falling oil prices and Western sanctions. 
To help balance state coffers, the Kremlin this year raised the retirement age for both men and women in a highly unpopular measure that dented Putin's popularity rating.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov brushed off the findings of the nostalgia poll.

A total of 508 people, most of them children, sought treatment in Quintero and nearby Puchuncavi in August after residents reported a strong smell in the air. Chilean law enforcement officials are investigating Iranian crude oil as a possible source of the odour. [nL1N1YM1TA]
On Wednesday, the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) denied any links between its crude exports to Chile and the noxious fumes. NIOC said international inspectors monitor the flow, loading and export of its oil and issue certificates which allow continuation of the exports.
""Iran's export terminals are equipped with state-of-the-art laboratories and devices for checking and measuring the quality and amount of the oil, and the quality of the export oil is always being examined at different times of the day,"" NIOC said in a statement published by the oil ministry news agency SHANA.
Last month the United States reimposed sanctions against Iran’s oil sector after pulling out of world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, saying Tehran was continuing to develop ballistic missiles and interfere in Middle Eastern conflicts.

935,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 11:33AM ET</span>",Number of journalists deliberately killed nearly doubles in 2018: report,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of journalists killed around the world in reprisal for their work nearly doubled in 2018 to at least 34 people, reflecting an increase in deliberate attacks on journalists in Afghanistan, according to a report released on Wednesday.
That was up sharply from 18 murdered for their work in 2017, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
The jump this year reflects 10 reporters killed in Afghanistan, as well as four journalists slain in a June attack at Maryland's Capital Gazette newspaper.
Overall, some 53 journalists died on the job worldwide from Jan. 1 through Dec. 14 -- including those killed inadvertently in combat or on other dangerous assignments -- a 13 percent increase from 47 deaths in 2017, said CPJ, a U.S. nonprofit that promotes press freedom.
CPJ cited insufficient international standards for journalists' rights as another reason for the uptick in murders.
The report criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's refusal to blame the crown prince of Saudi Arabia for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, despite a CIA assessment that the prince had ordered the killing. The CPJ said Trump's stand signaled a dangerous lack of leadership in the protection of journalists.
The spike includes the deadliest attack on the U.S. media in recent history, when a gunman who had filed a failed defamation lawsuit against the Capital Gazette newspaper in Maryland killed four journalists and a sales associate in June.
CPJ included the four slain journalists in its total of 34 reporters murdered during the year. The slain sales associate factored into a separate tally of seven media support workers who died on the job in 2018, down from eight in 2017.
Sixty-two percent of the journalists killed covered politics, which the report deemed the most dangerous beat.
Last week, CPJ reported that a near-record number of journalists around the world are in prison this year because of their work, including two Reuters reporters in Myanmar.

Khashoggi, the reporters at the Capital Gazette, and the imprisoned Reuters' journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were featured last week in Time Magazine's Person of the Year issue, honoring ""The Guardians and the War on Truth.""

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh’s main opposition alliance has written to the Election Commission seeking action to end what it says are violent attacks against its workers by ruling party activists and the arrests of candidates on trumped up charges.
At least 14 candidates in the Dec. 30 election under the National Unity Front alliance have been arrested in ""fictitious cases"" in recent weeks, the alliance said in a letter dated Tuesday, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. 
Some 1,500 opposition workers have suffered injuries since Dec. 2, an alliance spokesman said separately.
Elections in Bangladesh are often marred by violent clashes, but the opposition alliance says the ruling party is trying to cripple its campaign by locking up, threatening and attacking its workers. 
“We demand immediate release of these candidates on bail and also request issuance of instructions that no further candidates be arrested with an intention to harass,” the alliance said, also accusing the police of aiding the attacks, often dressed in plainclothes. 
“The Higher Court must issue directives on forbidding any law enforcers performing duties in civil dress,” it said. 
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League, which is seeking a third straight term in power, has denied the allegations.
Police spokesman Sohel Rana said people could file complaints and ""we will look into the allegation and take proper action"".
Chief Election Commissioner KM Nurul Huda did not respond to calls requesting comment. 
The opposition letter comes after Mahbub Talukdar, one of the five commissioners that make up Bangladesh's Election Commission said there was ""no level-playing field at all"" between contesting parties. His comments were dismissed as ""untrue"" by Huda.
Hasina’s government, while credited for improving Bangladesh’s economy, has been criticized by rights groups for suppressing dissent and sweeping arrests of opposition workers. 
Violent clashes have broken out across the country since campaigning began last week, and two Awami League workers have also died. 
More than 20,000 paramilitary troops have been deployed and the army is scheduled to be deployed on Dec 24.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptians on social media have been poking fun at comments from President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi calling out Egyptians for being overweight - the second time the former general has picked up on the subject in as many months.
When Health Minister Hala Zayed presented new numbers on the weight of Egyptians on Saturday, Sisi interrupted her.
""Why are we doing this to ourselves?"" Sisi asked from the audience, referring to Egypt's high obesity rate. He then spoke for almost 20 minutes about how Egyptians should exercise more.
Since then, memes imagining a security crackdown on corpulence have multiplied. 
One pictured a woman being taken away by a police officer and telling him: ""What's wrong? I only gained two kilos.""
Of about 17 million Egyptians who had their height and weight measured in a hepatitis C campaign, around 75 percent were found to be overweight, Zayed said in her presentation.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says that 63 percent of Egyptians are overweight, including nearly 36 percent who are obese, one of the highest rates in the world.
Sisi said he sometimes sees obese people and thinks: ""Why is she not taking care of herself?"" and ""can you walk like that?"" 
Nearly 30 percent of Egypt's population, which now numbers 98 million, live under the poverty line. 
There is a clear correlation between poverty and obesity, the WHO says. Obesity can lead to noncommunicable diseases, which account for most deaths in Egypt, WHO's Egypt office said.
Sisi, who has been pictured several times on his bike in sports gear, told a youth conference in November that too many students were overweight. At the same event, he triggered a social media backlash after telling citizens to ""build (the) country"" rather than fixating on sharply rising potato prices. 
His words hit a nerve with citizens struggling to get by following austerity measures brought in under an IMF-backed economic reform program.
Sisi's comments on body weight are likely to be viewed in a similar vein, said Timothy Kaldas, non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.

""Most will understandably see the president's comments about the importance of losing weight as a way of deflecting concerns about the dramatic pace of inflation,"" he said.

938,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 11:13AM ET</span>",UK to prioritize high-skilled workers in post-Brexit immigration plans,"By Kylie MacLellan and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - The British government set out the biggest overhaul of its immigration policy in decades on Wednesday, ending special treatment for European Union nationals while promising to give businesses time to adapt to its post-Brexit plans.
In a long-awaited policy paper on how Britain intends to approach immigration after its exit from the EU, the government said the system would prioritize skilled workers and treat EU and non-EU citizens alike.
Concern about the long-term social and economic impact of immigration helped drive Britain's 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU, but Prime Minister Theresa May's promise to end free movement of the bloc's nationals has left some business leaders worried about the ability to hire the staff they need.
The policy paper did not spell out a specific target for annual net migration, but said it would reduce the number to ""sustainable levels as set out in the Conservative Party manifesto"". The pledge in that 2017 election manifesto was to reduce the annual number to below 100,000. 
Skilled workers coming to Britain under the new system will have to be sponsored by a company and will be subject to a minimum salary threshold, the level of which will be set following a consultation with businesses over the next year.
There will not be a cap on the number of skilled workers.
TEMPORARY WORKERS
There will also be a transitional temporary worker scheme, which will allow EU nationals and workers of any skill level from other ""low risk"" countries, to come to Britain without a job offer for up to 12 months at a time.
""Our new route for skilled workers will enable employers ... to access the talent they need,"" interior minister Sajid Javid said in the foreword to the document.
""But we understand this is the most significant changes to the immigration system in more than 40 years, and so employers will need time to adjust.""
Javid said the temporary workers scheme would ""ensure businesses have the staff they need and to help employers move smoothly to the new immigration system"".
The temporary workers scheme would be ""tightly constrained"", the government said, with no rights to settle, bring dependents or access certain public funds. The scheme will be reviewed by 2025 and could be closed if economic conditions warrant it.
Workers under this scheme must leave Britain for a 12 month ""cooling off period"" before they can seek to return on another temporary worker visa, the policy paper said. 
The government, which will introduce its post-Brexit immigration legislation to parliament on Thursday, said it planned to speed up the processing of work visas and reduce the burden on businesses sponsoring workers. 
EU nationals will not need a visa for a tourist visit to Britain of up to six months, the policy paper said, and Irish citizens will continue to be able to travel and work freely in Britain.
The new system will be phased in from the start of the post-Brexit implementation period, currently set to run until the end of December 2020.
A report by the Migration Advisory Committee in September recommended Britain should not give preferential treatment to EU workers.
With just 100 days until Brexit, May is yet to win the support of a deeply divided parliament for the divorce deal she struck last month with EU leaders to maintain close ties with the bloc.

Tito, who led former communist Yugoslavia from the end of World War Two until death in 1980, was criticized as a totalitarian dictator by some at home and abroad. 
But many of his people saw him as a benevolent ruler who kept peaceful co-existence of diverse ethnicities. The six-republic Yugoslavia started collapsing in wars a decade after his death. 
The monument in Podgorica - named Titograd between 1946-1992 in his honor - was placed in a park on the initiative of the city hall and a group of World War Two communist veterans. 
One of three identical statues made by sculptor Antun Augustincic in 1948, the life-size statue showing Tito in military uniform with greatcoat slung over his shoulders had been stored in a commemorative room at an army barracks.
City mayor Ivan Vukovic said it was reinstated in honor of Montenegro's fundamental values. ""Our country remains faithful to anti-fascist traditions,"" he said. 
During the unveiling, dozens of Tito admirers and veterans waved the former Yugoslavia's flag with a red star on it and Communist Party colors, as well as singing revolutionary songs from World War Two.

A 2016 Gallup poll showed 65 percent of Montenegrins believed the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s was wrong.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Thousands of high school teachers took to the streets of Tunis on Wednesday to demand better pay and conditions, at a time when the government is under pressure from international donors to cut spending.
The teachers, from different provinces of Tunisia, gathered in front of the education ministry before marching towards the central Habib Bourguiba avenue, chanting ""no to the humiliation of teachers"" and ""the people want fiscal justice"".
They called for the resignation of education minister Hatem Ben Salem, whom they blamed for stalled negotiations.
""We want to improve teachers' living conditions following the rise in prices ... as well as the improvement of educational institutions and working conditions,"" said Farah, from Kasserine, more than 100 miles (160 km) to the southwest. 
Tunisia has been in turmoil since autocrat Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled in 2011 in the first ""Arab Spring"" uprising, sparked by anger at unemployment and poverty.
The North African country struck a deal in 2016 with the International Monetary Fund on a loan programme worth around $2.8 billion that required steps to cut chronic deficits and trim bloated public services, but progress has been slow.
Parliament recently rejected a draft law to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62.

""We started negotiations six months ago and made efforts and concessions to ensure their success but the government is foot-dragging in dealing with teachers,"" said Al Assad El Yaqoubi, secretary general of the high school teachers’ union, in a speech at the protest.

942,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 10:25AM ET</span>",German cabinet approves immigration laws to ease worker shortage,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet passed new immigration laws on Wednesday to make it easier for lower-skilled foreigners to seek work in Germany and offer rejected asylum seekers who can't be deported a path to residency.
The laws are risky for Merkel's conservatives and their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners, who have been losing voters to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) over her 2015 decision to welcome almost 1 million refugees.
Approval of the laws shows a willingness to risk political fallout from liberalizing immigration rules in order to ease a labor shortage that companies say could hurt future growth.
The new rules are designed to allow workers from outside the European Union with lower qualifications to search for work in Germany for a period of six months, if they have the means to fund their stay and have knowledge of the German language.
Under old rules, that opportunity was reserved for highly qualified workers like doctors, engineers, IT professionals and academics.
Nine years of growth, low unemployment and falling birth rates have created a record 1.2 million job vacancies in almost all sectors in Europe's economic powerhouse, including leaving shortage of plumbers, electricians and carpenters.
""Germany has a very open system for highly qualified migration, but was quite closed for medium-qualified,"" said Thomas Liebig of the OECD group of industrialized nations. ""This is the area where labor shortages are particularly strong. The new law opens up in the mid-skilled segment.""
The BDA association of German employers welcomed the immigration law, urging parliament not to amend the blueprint before it ratifies the law next year.
A separate law approved by the cabinet seeks to find a solution to the 180,000 ""tolerated persons"" or Geduldete, migrants whose asylum applications have been rejected but can't be deported.
Such migrants would be allowed to apply for a work permit of 30 months if they have been working for 18 months and are able to prove they can support themselves without financial help from the state.
If they are still working once their work permit expires and their German language skills have improved they can apply for a residency permit.
The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) said the new laws would encourage migrants to come to Germany seeking asylum with the hope of finding a job, which would allow them to stay even if their applications are rejected.

""Even cleaners at the Doner Kebab joint have an employment contract,"" said AfD lawmaker Lars Herrmann. ""Germany needs an immigration law that regulates and limits immigration.""

943,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 10:18AM ET</span>",Anger in UK parliament as Corbyn accused of calling PM 'stupid woman',"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's House of Commons erupted in anger on Wednesday when Labour opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared to mouth the words ""stupid woman"" after a lively exchange with Prime Minister Theresa May.
Corbyn's remark was captured by television cameras during the question-and-answer session in parliament that British leaders have to endure every Wednesday.
He had been peppering May with hostile questions about her decision last week to postpone a parliamentary vote on a long-awaited divorce deal with the European Union.
In reply, May had suggested Corbyn might not enjoy the support of his own lawmakers over the EU and, taking a well-worn line from Christmas pantomimes, said: ""I've got some advice for the Right Honourable Gentleman - look behind you!
""They are not impressed and neither is the country!""
Corbyn then shook his head and appeared to mutter ""stupid woman"" under his breath.
A spokesman for Corbyn later said: ""He did not call her a stupid woman, so I don’t think there are any grounds for an apology. As I understand it, he said 'stupid people'""
A session that had begun with lawmakers wishing each other a Merry Christmas and peaceful New Year soon descended into an unholy row as female lawmakers in particular demanded that Corbyn be censured.
As lawmakers shouted at each other across the debating chamber, Commons Speaker John Bercow said he had not seen or heard the alleged incident and could not rule on it.
May told lawmakers: ""I think that everybody in this house, particularly in this 100th anniversary of women getting the vote, should be aiming to encourage women to come into this Chamber ... and should therefore use appropriate language."" 
Lip readers were called in earlier this month to decipher what May herself said in an apparently ill-tempered exchange with European Commission leader Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels.
They reported that May was berating Juncker for apparently having called her Brexit plans ""nebulous.""
It was not the first time a row had blown up over the alleged use of the phrase ""stupid woman"" in parliament. In June, Bercow was alleged to have applied it to cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom.

The Commons standards watchdog decided he should not be investigated.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Lawmakers in a volatile region of Somalia elected the federal government's preferred candidate as its leader on Wednesday after a popular former al Shabaab leader was barred from running in the vote seen as test of the country's political progress.
As part of an internationally backed attempt to end decades of lawlessness by spreading power more widely among the multiple clans, states are meant to be more independent of central government, with the authority to select their own leaders. 
But any sign that that is being subverted in practice or a sense that a leader is being imposed by stealth by the central government could further stoke instability and violence.
At least 11 people were killed last week in the South West state capital of Baidoa in clashes that erupted following the arrest of Mukhtar Robow, the former Islamist militant leader who had tried to contest in the thrice-delayed poll.
The South West state parliament selected Abdiasis Hassan Mohamed, who has held two national cabinet posts, giving him the necessary two thirds of the vote. State parliaments, not the wider public, vote for regional presidents in Somalia. 
Analysts say Mohamed is likely to find it difficult to exert his authority because of his perceived allegiance to the federal government, said Hussein Sheikh-Ali, chairman of the Mogadishu-based think tank Hiraal Institute. 
He said the arrest of Robow, a native of South West who was widely expected to win the election, also undermined efforts to end the al Shabaab insurgency.
The federal government could not immediately be reached for comment on the election.
Al Shabaab has been fighting for more than a decade to topple the weak central government and implement strict Islamic law, often sending suicide bombers against civilian targets. 
""The attacks on Robow have shredded this election's credibility,"" said Judd Devermont, Africa director at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). 
Somali authorities backed by Ethiopian troops detained Robow after accusing him of bringing Islamist militants and weapons back to Baidoa, a charge his representatives denied. Many in South West state saw the move as aimed at blocking his candidature.
“Mogadishu tilted terrain in his favor by off-ramping Robow and providing resources to Mohamed. The hard part will be getting him local clan support,” said Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa Project Director at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based thinktank.

Similar elections for state leaders are due early next year.

Opposition politicians Jamaan al-Harbash and Waleed al-Tabtabai forced their way into parliament in 2011 after lawmakers were prevented from questioning then prime minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah about corruption allegations.
They were tried and sentenced for that last year, but had already left Kuwait. In October, parliament defied the government and voted to keep on the pair, who have a large political following.
The court ruled that the article requiring a vote to strip legislators of membership was ""unconstitutional"", state news agency KUNA reported. 
There was no immediate reaction to the ruling from the opposition or either of the two lawmakers, whom opposition sources say are in Turkey. Kuwait's highest court in July reduced their jail terms to 3-1/2 years from an original five.
U.S. ally and OPEC member Kuwait avoided mass Arab Spring-style unrest, though citizens held protests in 2012 after Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber al-Sabah changed electoral law.

While Kuwait allows more freedom of speech than some other Gulf states, the emir has the last say in state affairs.

JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) - The World Food Programme (WFP) is to cut food aid next year to about 190,000 poor Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank due a shortage of funds, the WFP's senior official for the Palestinian Territories said on Wednesday.
The moves follows the slashing of U.S. aid funding to humanitarian agencies working in the territories by the Trump administration.
""WFP has been forced, unfortunately, to make drastic cuts to the number of people that we support across Palestine, both in Gaza and the West Bank,"" WFP country director Stephen Kearney told Reuters in Jerusalem.
From Jan. 1, the United Nations agency will suspend food assistance to 27,000 people in the West Bank. In addition, food aid to 165,000 people in the Israeli-occupied territory and in the Gaza Strip would be reduced by 20 percent from $10 to $8 per person each month.
The U.S. cuts affected 40 per cent of total WFP funding, Kearney said.
""The major donor that we have had in the past years has been the U.S. They have cut funding, not just to UNRWA, who work with the refugees in Gaza, but also to the rest of the humanitarian community, including WFP,"" he said.
Kearney said Gaza's underlying problems would remain as long as Israel maintained its blockade and Palestinian factional infighting continued, preventing a political solution.
A spokesman for the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, declined comment.
In Gaza, Fawzi Barhoum, spokesman for the ruling Hamas group, urged the United Nations to ""continue to provide the needs of the Palestinian people until they regain their freedom.""
ECONOMIC CHAIN
Most of the help provided by WFP is through electronic cards, which people use to buy food at a network of 185 shops.
Palestinians and humanitarian workers fear the cuts will cause a downward spiral, as people buy less from businesses, and they in turn purchase less from suppliers.
In the Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, shopkeeper Mohammad Al-Dirawi said he had gained about 400 new customers since he joined the program and employed three new workers.
""We depend 90 per cent on the work with the WFP,"" he said.  
""God forbid, if it stops, we may not be able to continue in the supermarket."" 
Aref Abdel-Jawwad, owner of a dairy in Deir Al-Balah, said he sells 50 to 70 per cent of his products to WFP-approved shops. He fears he will have to cut the hours of his employees, each earning around $300 per month.
Mustafa Kassiha, a dairy farmer in Rafah, said Abdel-Jawwad's dairy buys all his milk.

""This is our only income. There is no alternative to it,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Environmental group Greenpeace said on Wednesday it could halve its workforce in India to 30 early next year due to a block on its bank account after accusations of illegal donations.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nationalist government has tightened scrutiny of non-profit groups over the past four years. It says they often act against India's interests and has revoked licenses for thousands of foreign-funded groups.
Known for its campaigns against India's coal-fired power plants, Greenpeace has been barred from receiving foreign donations since 2015.
The Enforcement Directorate, India's financial crime investigating agency, froze its main bank account on Oct. 5.
Greenpeace, which denies wrongdoing, said it only had funds to pay employees for about two more months, meaning half of the staff of 30 locals were at risk of losing their jobs.
""There are multi-pronged attacks on us,"" said Greenpeace spokesman Nandikesh Sivalingam, blaming the coal lobby.
""The coal industry is strong and powerful even if governments do want to move away from coal, including for climate change reasons.""
It was not immediately possible to contact the Enforcement Directorate and a spokesman for the Finance Ministry, under which it operates, declined comment.
Asok Dasgupta, president of lobby group Independent Power Producers Association of India, said it was unfair to blame power producers for action against Greenpeace.
""I don't understand this opposition to coal,"" he told Reuters. ""Renewable power can't take over coal for many, many years. Fortunately we have got good coal reserves and we should use them.""
Since Modi took office in 2014, India has canceled registration of nearly 15,000 non-governmental groups under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act.
Critics say the government has been using the foreign funding law as a tool to silence non-profit groups which have raised concerns about the social costs of India's rapid economic development or questioned its human rights record.
In October, Indian authorities froze the bank accounts of rights watchdog Amnesty International after a raid on its office. Amnesty regularly accuses India of violations in the restive Himalayan region of Kashmir.

LONDON (Reuters) - A Russian mafia whistleblower, who died after going out for a run near his home in southern England six years ago, probably died of natural causes, a British coroner found on Wednesday.    
Alexander Perepilichny, 44, was found dead near his luxury home on the exclusive gated St George's Hill estate in Weybridge, Surrey, southwest of London, after he had been out jogging in November 2012.
The sudden nature of the death of Perepilichny, who had sought refuge in Britain in 2009, and his role in helping a Swiss investigation into a Russian money-laundering scheme sparked speculation that he might have been murdered.
""I am satisfied on the evidence I have heard I can properly and safely conclude that it was more likely than not that he died of natural causes, namely sudden arrhythmic death syndrome,"" Coroner Nicholas Hilliard said.
""There really is no direct evidence that he was unlawfully killed.""
Police said there was no evidence to suggest foul play but one pre-inquest hearing was told traces of a rare and deadly poison from the gelsemium plant had been found in his stomach.
Hilliard said an unidentified compound found in his stomach had no link to the gelsemium plant species and was widely occurring. 
He said London police had contacted him this month to confirm they were not conducting an investigation into his death and that there was no evidence of ""any hostile state actor"" being involved.
Perepilichny's death was also re-examined after the nerve agent attack in March on ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, southern England, which Britain blamed on Moscow. Russia denied any wrongdoing. 
His widow, Tatiana, told the inquest that she did not believe her husband had been murdered and said she had cooked him a bowl of sorrel soup just before his death.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis accepted the resignation of a bishop in Los Angeles accused of sexually abusing a minor, the Vatican said on Wednesday, in the latest case of clergy misconduct to shake the U.S. Catholic Church.
A brief Vatican statement said Alexander Salazar, 69, an assistant bishop in Los Angeles, was stepping down. It also distributed a letter on the Salazar case written by the current Archbishop of Los Angeles, Jose Gomez.
The U.S. Catholic Church is still reeling from a U.S. grand jury report that found that 301 priests in the state of Pennsylvania had sexually abused minors over a 70-year period.
There will be a major meeting at the Vatican in February on the global sex abuse crisis.
Gomez's letter to the faithful said that in 2005, a year after Salazar became bishop, the archdiocese had become aware of an accusation that Salazar had engaged in ""misconduct with a minor"" when he was a priest in a parish in the 1990s.
Police investigated but the Los Angeles district attorney did not prosecute, Gomez's letter said, adding that Salazar, a native of Costa Rica, ""has consistently denied any wrongdoing"".
The archdiocese's independent Clergy Misconduct Review Board found the allegation ""credible"" and informed the Vatican.
The archbishop's letter did not explain why the process between the initial accusation and Wednesday's resignation took 13 years.
A statement from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles said Salazar's name resurfaced after Gomez became archbishop in 2011, and ordered a review of past allegations of abuse.
The archdiocese's statement disclosed that Gomez's predecessor, Cardinal Roger Mahoney, sent the case to the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), which investigates abuse cases.
The CDF ""permitted Bishop Salazar to remain in ministry subject to certain precautionary conditions, which he has respected"". The statement did not elaborate on what the conditions were or why he was allowed to return to ministry.
Benedict XVI was pope between 2005 and his resignation in 2013.
Pope Francis has summoned the heads of some 110 national Catholic bishops' conferences and dozens of experts and leaders of religious orders to the Vatican on Feb. 21-24 for an extraordinary gathering dedicated to the sexual abuse crisis. 

Victims of clergy sexual abuse are hoping that the meeting will finally come up with a clear policy to make bishops themselves accountable for the mishandling of abuse cases.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - The governor of Congo's capital Kinshasa on Wednesday ordered a halt to campaigning in the city ahead of Sunday's presidential vote for security reasons, a move opposition supporters said was an attempt to meddle in the race.
The decision by Governor Andre Kimbuta, a member of the ruling coalition, follows crackdowns by security forces on opposition supporters last week that killed at least seven people and a fire that destroyed thousands of voting machines.
The long-delayed election is meant to choose a successor for President Joseph Kabila, who is due to step down after 18 years in power. If successful, it would be Democratic Republic of Congo's first democratic transfer of power. 
""The information in our possession attests that in all the political camps of the main presidential candidates, extremists have prepared and are preparing for a street confrontation in the city of Kinshasa during election campaign activities,"" Kimbuta said in a statement, without giving further details.
Kinshasa is an opposition stronghold, where security forces have killed dozens of people during protests against Kabila's refusal to step down when his mandate officially expired two years ago. 
Campaigning was due to end at midnight on Friday in the race between Kabila's preferred successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, and two main challengers, Felix Tshisekedi and Martin Fayulu. Fayulu had scheduled a rally in Kinshasa on Wednesday.
""Kimbuta's only objective is to prevent Martin Fayulu's rally. This hasty cancellation, while the crowd is already mobilized, is dangerous and shows the regime's fear,"" opposition leader Moise Katumbi, a Fayulu supporter, wrote on Twitter.
Opposition leaders say the government is trying to rig the results in Shadary's favor with new electronic voting machines and falsified voter registrations. The government denies it has engaged in fraud. 
Governor Kimbuta said the only way presidential candidates could campaign in Kinshasa would be through the media, where Shadary has a clear advantage due to sizeable campaign funds and state or ruling party control of many media outlets. 
However, a rare national opinion poll in October showed Tshisekedi leading the race with 36 percent, well ahead of Shadary's 16 percent. Fayulu had 8 percent. 
Congolese hope the election can help draw a line under decades of conflict and authoritarian rule. 
Millions are estimated to have died in two wars around the turn of the century and dozens of militia remain active near the country's eastern borders. 
Rwanda and Uganda intervened in the region during the earlier wars and there are important deposits of minerals such as tin and coltan, which is used in electronic devices such as mobile phones. 

More than 100 people have died in clashes this week between rival ethnic groups in the normally peaceful northwest, local activists told Reuters.

955,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 08:22AM ET</span>",Special Report: Fading Icon - What happened to Aung San Suu Kyi?,"By Andrew R.C. Marshall and Poppy McPherson
YANGON/LONDON (Reuters) - Aung San Suu Kyi was once a global hero. Today, her reputation is sullied. What happened?
See the full interactive photo essay https://reut.rs/2Lq64z5
She won a Nobel Peace Prize for her defiance of Myanmar's military junta. She emerged from years of house arrest in 2010 a near-mythical figure, admired for her strength and integrity. She was swept into power in a landslide 2015 election that many around the world hoped would bring greater freedom and stability to her country.
Three years later, Aung San Suu Kyi is isolated and besieged by critics. The United Nations accuses Myanmar's military of a ""genocidal"" campaign against Rohingya Muslims, and says Suu Kyi and her government did nothing to prevent it. She is no longer hailed as a moral icon, but condemned for forsaking the oppressed. 
How did one of the world's most admired leaders reach this pass? Reuters spoke to friends, advisers, diplomats and other long-time observers of Suu Kyi. They describe a politician who is principled and devoted but also flawed and alone, burdened with limited powers and impossible expectations.
Some say she hasn't been sympathetic to ethnic minorities and was slow to grasp the scale and brutality of the military's campaign against the Rohingya. Others say she has been scapegoated for the military's crimes, then rejected by the international community when she needed it most.
Suu Kyi did not respond to questions sent to her spokesman.
""What is it that makes people hate?"" Suu Kyi asked Ann Pasternak Slater, an old friend, when they met in November 2017. At the time, Pasternak Slater said, she had assumed Suu Kyi was referring to the violence against the Rohingya. 
""But actually,"" said Pasternak Slater, ""it occurred to me long after that she was thinking about herself: 'Why has everybody turned against me?'""
In this visual history, Reuters traces the journey of Suu Kyi and her troubled nation.
BORN TO LEAD (1945-1989)
She is born in 1945, the daughter of General Aung San, Myanmar's independence hero and the founder of its modern military. 
He is assassinated when she is two years old. She studies at Oxford University, where she meets her future husband, the British scholar Michael Aris. They have two sons. 
She returns to Myanmar to care for her dying mother in 1988 and gets swept up in nationwide protests against decades of military rule. 
""I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to all that was going on,"" she tells a vast crowd at Yangon's Shwedagon pagoda. This photo is taken two days later. https://reut.rs/2SZKlRf
The national reverence accorded her late father, pictured here https://reut.rs/2rN3aeY, helped launch Suu Kyi's political career. 
""People were longing for somebody who resembled General Aung San,"" recalls Khin Ohmar, a veteran activist who was a 19-year-old student during the 1988 protests. ""I was inspired, full of hope."" But the military crushes the protests, killing thousands, and puts Suu Kyi under house arrest in 1989.
HOUNDED BY THE JUNTA (1989-2003)
Detained in her lakeside home in Yangon and allowed few visitors, Suu Kyi gains fame and influence. She wins a Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 which, with her essays and letters, raises her status alongside icons such as Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama.
She is released in 1995 and regularly speaks to large crowds outside her gates. See photo https://reut.rs/2GsfyLC
In the United Kingdom, her husband is diagnosed with cancer. She chooses not to leave Myanmar to see him in case the junta blocks her return. He dies in 1999.
For her compatriots, such as these protesters in Bangkok in 1999, Suu Kyi is the best hope for an end to Myanmar's dictatorship. But her battle with the military is one-sided. She is detained again in 2000, this time for 19 months. Then she is released and, in 2003, attacked by pro-junta thugs who kill several of her supporters. Afterwards, she is placed under her last and longest spell of house arrest. See photo https://reut.rs/2Lssakz
Charles Petrie, then the most senior U.N. official in Myanmar, visited her in detention in 2003. Years of grueling seclusion ""helped define her sense of sacrifice and commitment"" but also gave her a false sense of infallibility, he says. ""It can explain the unwavering positions she is able to hold against all odds.""
MILITARY MANEUVERS (2004-2010)
Suu Kyi's dilapidated home is again her prison. See photo https://reut.rs/2BsKq8W Until its roof is repaired in 2010, she writes, the monsoon months are spent moving ""bowls, basins and buckets around my bedroom like pieces in an intricate game of chess, trying to catch the leaks."" She also reads, meditates and plays the piano. The U.S. Embassy says she requests, via her doctor, an IT dictionary ""to become more familiar with recent information technology.""
A dramatic rise in fuel prices in 2007 triggers anti-government protests led by Buddhist monks – the so-called ""Saffron Revolution."" See photo https://reut.rs/2BulY6V
Flanked by riot police, Suu Kyi briefly greets the monks at the gates of her home – the first public sighting of her since 2003. This energizes the demonstrations, which the military soon quashes. 
Suu Kyi dislikes street protests, says Pasternak Slater, a friend since her Oxford days: ""It's not the way she thinks that one can achieve a lasting and peaceful development. It's too dangerous.""
Veteran activist Khin Ohmar says Suu Kyi was always aloof from the grassroots protests she inspired. ""She did not lead the mass movement in 1988. It was the students who organized.""
In 2008, the military junta holds a sham referendum to ratify a constitution drafted to guarantee it sweeping powers. See photo https://reut.rs/2A7QjZa
In 2010, it holds a general election, which Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), boycotts because it says the laws governing the poll are ""unjust."" A party created by the military wins by a landslide. 
The military then installs a quasi-civilian government led by a former general, Thein Sein. A few days later, Suu Kyi is released to global jubilation. But the political architecture to constrain her is now in place.
FROM PRISON TO PARLIAMENT (2010-2012)
Suu Kyi addresses supporters outside her gate on the day of her release in November 2010. See photo https://reut.rs/2POE4pl
The hopes of a nation – and the world – now rest upon a slight, seemingly indomitable figure with a fresh flower in her hair. In August 2011, Suu Kyi meets President Thein Sein for the first time, marking the start of her pragmatic engagement with a government of ex-soldiers. 
Hillary Clinton arrives in Myanmar in November 2011, the first visit by a U.S. secretary of state for over 50 years. The two women hug during a press conference at Suu Kyi's home. See photo https://reut.rs/2R4frde
It's the beginning of the end of Myanmar's isolation; most Western sanctions are scrapped in 2012. President Thein Sein lifts censorship, frees hundreds of political prisoners and launches a series of reforms.
Kevin Rudd, the former Australian prime minister and foreign minister, met Suu Kyi in Yangon in 2011. She and her entourage arrived in ""two beaten-up Toyotas with what passed for her personal security detail,"" says Rudd. ""She didn't have a lot of time for small talk because the issues she was dealing with were so great."" 
Suu Kyi decides to contest by-elections in April 2012, despite fears that her participation will legitimize a political system skewed in the military's favor. Huge crowds greet her nationwide campaign. See photo https://reut.rs/2QCrGyd
Her NLD party wins 43 of the 44 parliamentary seats it contests, and Suu Kyi becomes MP for Kawhmu, a small town near Yangon. Amnesty International calls Suu Kyi a ""human rights superstar.""
In May 2012, Suu Kyi takes her place in Myanmar's parliament in the capital, Naypyitaw, watched by unelected soldier-MPs in uniform. See photo https://reut.rs/2GtzygL
The constitution grants the military a quarter of parliamentary seats, plus control over key ministries that oversee the army and police. Kevin Rudd says Suu Kyi hoped to change this rigged system from within. ""Her resolve was to throw everything at it and see how much she could extract,"" he says.
THE HALO SLIPS (2012-2015)
In early June 2012, clashes between Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State kill at least 80 people. Thousands of homes are burned down. See photo: This Rakhine man with homemade weapons walks near houses set alight during the fighting https://reut.rs/2AfYIKr
For years, the Rohingya have endured apartheid-like conditions in western Myanmar, with limited access to health, education and other basic services. By 2012, the United Nations estimates about 265,000 Rohingya are sheltering in neighboring Bangladesh, driven there by violence and poverty in Myanmar.
On June 13, with parts of the Rakhine state capital Sittwe still smoldering, Suu Kyi departs on a five-nation tour of Europe. In London, she meets David Cameron, then Britain's prime minister. See photo https://reut.rs/2Cnh0ur In Norway, a journalist asks her: ""Are the Rohingya citizens of your country or are they not?"" She replies: ""I do not know.""
The Rohingya bear the brunt of a second, deadlier bout of violence in Rakhine State in October, but Suu Kyi refuses to speak up for them. ""Now, if I were to take sides in the situation ... it would create more animosity between the two communities,"" she tells the BBC in an interview aired in January 2013. ""Violence has been committed by both sides."" Many of her supporters abroad wonder why a voice of moral clarity has faded.
Her halo also slips at a copper mine in northern Myanmar, where she is confronted by weeping and angry protesters. See photo https://reut.rs/2rLGf3r They want the mine closed for environmental and other reasons, but a government inquiry, led by Suu Kyi, says it should be kept open to encourage foreign investment.
An extremist Buddhist monk called Wirathu fans anti-Muslim sentiment nationwide. See photo https://reut.rs/2SY0W7P Religious violence spreads far beyond Rakhine State. Buddhist mobs kill dozens of Muslims in Meiktila, in central Myanmar, in March 2013. More riots, killings and arson attacks follow in nearby towns. 
Suu Kyi, a devout Buddhist, is again criticized for not publicly defending Muslims. ""She is a woman of absolutely scrupulous moral standards,"" says her old friend, Pasternak Slater. ""She is not going to make public statements simply because she's been pressured by journalists.""
But Suu Kyi's silence ""broke my heart,"" says activist Khin Ohmar. ""Her moral authority is what people follow,"" she says. ""That's where her real power lies. She has forgotten it or lost it.""
Her silence on the plight of the Rohingya and other minorities allows her to preserve her political popularity with the Buddhist majority. See photo https://reut.rs/2EwbN4Y
In November 2015, the NLD wins a general election by a landslide thanks to what Rudd calls ""the galvanizing figure and force of Aung San Suu Kyi."" She assumes power in the specially created role of state counselor amid renewed hopes that her government will fix Myanmar's troubled democratic transition.
INFERNO (2016-2018)
On Aug. 25, 2017, Rohingya militants launch attacks across northern Rakhine State. This triggers a military-led campaign of murder, rape and arson that drives more than 700,000 Rohingya into neighboring Bangladesh. The refugees flee on foot and by rickety boats. Some, like this Rohingya baby cradled by his distraught mother, die after their boats capsize - see photo https://reut.rs/2Bw2FKN
Min Aung Hlaing is the diminutive commander-in-chief of Myanmar's military and the public face of the brutal crackdown against the Rohingya, who he calls ""Bengalis."" At the height of the operations, on Sept. 1, he says: ""The Bengali problem was a long-standing one which has become an unfinished job."" He and Suu Kyi live and work within miles of each other in Naypyitaw, where this photo was taken, yet they seldom meet. See photo https://reut.rs/2LobJWm
Multiple investigations into the Rakhine crackdown blame the military for massacres, gang rapes and the systematic torching of hundreds of villages, including the Rohingya homes pictured here. See photo https://reut.rs/2R9TyZK
The military denies committing abuses, saying it mounted legitimate counter-insurgency operations against Rohingya militants. Senior members of Suu Kyi's government concur. Thaung Tun, Myanmar's national security advisor and a Suu Kyi appointee, tells the U.N. Security Council that reports of atrocities are ""malicious and unsubstantiated chatter.""
On 19 Sept. 2017, Suu Kyi addresses the Rakhine crisis in a speech in Naypyitaw that seems disconnected from events. See photo https://reut.rs/2R9TCZu
She says, for example, that military operations are over, even as Rohingya flee and villages burn across northern Rakhine State.
""Most world leaders have a team of advisers and confidants to provide fact-based perspectives, and she hasn't had that for many years,"" says activist Debbie Stothard, who visited Suu Kyi during her time under house arrest. ""Tragically, she is surrounded by leftovers of the military regime that attacked her when she was a dissident.""
Pasternak Slater says Suu Kyi still remains ""incredulous of the extent of the violence"" two months later, in November 2017, when the two women meet at Suu Kyi's home in Naypyitaw.
Myanmar is a mosaic of ethnic minorities, but it is dominated by the Bamar, a mostly Buddhist people. Suu Kyi is Bamar, but many ethnic leaders hope she will use her authority to end decades of war between government troops and ethnic armed groups fighting for greater autonomy.
But trust in Suu Kyi among minorities evaporates as the military launches offensives that drive thousands of people, most of them Kachin, from their homes. See photo https://reut.rs/2BEllbl 
Some ethnic leaders say Suu Kyi prioritizes her relationship with the military. Adds Derek Mitchell, a former U.S. ambassador to Myanmar who first met Suu Kyi in 1995: ""She has rarely expressed much sympathy, publicly or privately, for ethnic grievances.""
Myo Nyunt, a spokesman for Suu Kyi's party, notes her efforts to bring warring ethnic groups together. ""It's not true that she doesn't care about ethnic people,"" he says.
In October 2018, three journalists from Eleven Media, Myanmar's largest private newspaper, are arrested for an article criticizing the Yangon regional government. They include Nayi Min, an editor, pictured arriving at court: https://reut.rs/2R4hGNz
The charges are later dropped after President Win Myint intervenes. The case underscores what critics say is deteriorating press freedom under Suu Kyi, once a champion of free speech. Athan, a Yangon-based free speech group, says 44 journalists have been arrested since the NLD took power. They include two Reuters reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, sentenced to seven years after exposing a military-led massacre of 10 Rohingya men.
The arrests further alienate former supporters. Charles Petrie, the former U.N. official, blames Suu Kyi for not giving the country ""moral direction."" But he also blames the international community for not helping Suu Kyi enough, because it was ""basically sycophantic and too wedded to the fairytale it had constructed of her.""
POPULAR BUT ALONE 
Suu Kyi's status as a human rights hero lies in tatters in the West. In Myanmar, Sean Turnell, her economic adviser, says she retains a ""quasi-mystical charisma."" But Win Htein, a former senior adviser, paints a lonely picture of the woman he still regards as Myanmar's ""only hope."" At home in Naypyitaw, he says, she works alongside her dog, a gift from her younger son, Kim Aris. ""It's her only outlet,"" says Win Htein. See photo https://reut.rs/2S7fWjO

Rudd sees this isolation as a prelude to Suu Kyi, now 73, one day standing down as Myanmar's leader. ""What we see is someone who is withdrawing into their own castle,"" he says. “I'm not sure how much longer she'll choose to remain as effective head of government.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Wednesday it would not let the United States inspect a new nuclear-capable cruise missile at the heart of a dispute between Washington and Moscow that risks unraveling a landmark arms control treaty.
Washington has threatened to pull out of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), alleging that the new Russian missile, the Novator 9M729 (called SSC-8 by NATO), violates the pact, which bans either side from stationing short and intermediate-range, land-based missiles in Europe. 
Russia says the missile's range puts it outside the treaty altogether and is not as long as Washington alleges, meaning that it is fully compliant with the INF. It has accused the United States of inventing a false pretext to exit a treaty it wants to leave anyway so as to develop new missiles. 
The United States issued Russia a 60-day ultimatum earlier this month to come clean about the alleged missile violation and return to ""full and verifiable compliance."" That means Moscow is under pressure to scrap the new missile and its launchers.
However, Russia said on Wednesday it had no intention of letting U.S. inspectors look at the missile, which it said had not been tested at the longer range that Washington alleges. 
""We don't feel right now that such a step would be justified from either a political or a technical point of view,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in an interview with the Kommersant daily newspaper published on Wednesday. 
Ryabkov accused Washington of ""extremely intrusive"" attempts to shine a light on Russian rocket manufacturing and said that Washington had in the past rebuffed Russian requests to look inside U.S. submarines under another arms control treaty.
Any such inspections - if they were to happen - should not be unilateral but should take place in both countries, he added.
U.S. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats said on Nov. 30 that Russia has already deployed multiple battalions of 9M729 missiles and that they posed a direct threat to most of Europe and parts of Asia. 

Russian military experts asked their U.S. counterparts several days ago to hold consultations on the missile dispute, but had not yet received any response, Ryabkov said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union on Wednesday urged the United States to nominate a permanent ombudsman by the end of February to investigate complaints about data breaches, an essential element of a landmark data transfer pact agreed two years ago.
EU technology chief Andrus Ansip's comments came after the European Commission wrapped up its second review of the so-called EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which is designed to better protect Europeans' personal data transferred across the Atlantic for commercial use.
More than 3,850 companies have signed up to the pact, which replaced a previous framework known as Safe Harbour, thrown out by Europe's highest court in 2015 because it gave U.S. spies excessive access to personal data.
""We now expect our American partners to nominate the ombudsperson on a permanent basis, so we can make sure that our EU-U.S. relations in data protection are fully trustworthy,"" Ansip said in a statement.
The Commission, the EU executive, said it would take appropriate measures in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if the U.S. government did not nominate an ombudsman by the end of February.
GDPR is a new EU privacy law implemented in May this year, which gives new powers to the bloc's privacy regulators.

962,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 07:23AM ET</span>",Nomads and farmers in fight for Nigeria's heartland,"By Alexis Akwagyiram and Ryan McNeill
MAKURDI, Nigeria - A Reuters analysis of land use data shows how a massive expansion of farming in Nigeria's Middle Belt has cut access to grazing land for nomadic herders and fueled persistent violence.
If the coming dry season in Nigeria follows the pattern of previous years, violence will soon erupt between herders in search of water for their cattle and farmers determined to protect their land.
In the past, authorities have blamed the violence on religion or ethnic divisions. But a close examination of the changes in land use in central Nigeria shows just how much it comes down to a simple clash over resources.
The stakes are high. Amnesty International said the violence has killed more than 3,600 people since 2016, most of them this year. 
Clashes between herding and farming communities in 2018 have killed more people than the conflict involving the Islamist insurgent group Boko Haram, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project.
Reuters journalists have tracked long-term land trends in Nigeria by analysing United States Geological Survey data. 
The analysis of data released publicly only in 2016 shows open grazing land available in Nigeria's Middle Belt declined by 38 percent between 1975 and 2013 while the area dedicated to farming nearly trebled.
That means less land for nomads to feed their cattle, supporting the view of local people that the conflict is based on the availability of land rather than ethnic or religious differences.
The shift toward farming not only reflects Nigeria's rapid population growth, but also successive governments' efforts to diversify the economy away from its heavy reliance on oil.
Violence involving Fulani herders and farmers from other ethnic groups has been widespread since 2011 but most frequent in Nigeria’s Middle Belt, a region where the mostly Christian south converges with the Islamic north.

GRAZING LAND
In 1975, grazing land was plentiful. It made up 52 percent of all land in Nigeria, while farmland made up 23 percent. In the Middle Belt, grazing land was even more plentiful - 61 percent was grazing land, while farmland accounted for 14 percent.
In 2013, Grazing land decreased to 38 percent of the Middle Belt and farmland increased to 42 percent. The trend was similar across all of Nigeria.
Reuters found that between 1975 and 2013, Nigeria’s Middle Belt lost about 84,000 square kilometers of land available to herders.
""There is no single kilometer you go through without seeing farmland, unlike what used to happen in the '50s when the population was less,"" said Samuel Ortom, Benue state governor, referring to the impact of Nigeria's growing population.
The United Nations predicts it will reach 400 million by 2050, more than double the present 190 million. 
USGS data reveals that almost half of the 176,000 square km that changed from grazing land to farmland from 1975 to 2013 in Nigeria was in the Middle Belt.
The central states make up about one third of Nigeria's land area. But the Middle Belt is not strictly defined. Add another 50 km around the borders of these states and the Middle Belt accounts for almost two-thirds of the nationwide switch from grazing land to farmland.
Many of the farmers are Christian and the herders are mainly Muslim, but locals see the land issue as paramount.
""It's a competition for limited land, it's not about ethnicity or religion,"" said Baba Othman Ngelzarma, National Secretary of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders' Association of Nigeria.
NOMADIC WAY OF LIFE
Some argue that anti-grazing laws punish the herders' centuries-old nomadic way of life, which can be seen as cattle and herders traverse the Middle Belt's roads and dusty bush paths. The herders are usually young men and boys - some as young as 9.
Herders travel by foot with their animals - usually cows. They can walk hundreds of kilometers over the course of a few months, often crossing the porous borders that separate Nigeria from its neighbors: Benin, Niger and Cameroon.
But land use has changed, even if herders' customs have not.
The Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast has helped to push herders into central Nigeria, say analysts, while changes in the north's climate also encourage nomadic herdsmen to move further south.
Herders start to move out as fertile land turns into desert because of over-exploitation and drought. 
Springs and streams have dried up across the far northern Sahelian belt, prompting large numbers of herders to seek other pastures and sources of water for their cattle in the savannah of Nigeria's central and southern states.
Farmers say their crops have been destroyed by the herders' cattle. As the fight over fertile land has intensified, so too have disputes over crop damage, water pollution and cattle theft.
The violence between herders and farmers has forced thousands to flee their homes and huge camps have sprung up in Benue and Plateau states. In one outbreak of violence, more than 200 people were killed during a weekend in June.
""We were just cooking. Before we knew it, some gunshots from nowhere,"" said Kangyan Dankye, a resident in a camp in Plateau, describing an attack on her home by herders.
""We just ran away,"" said Dankye, who lost five relatives in the violence.

Ilmars Rimsevics was suspended earlier this year on charges of corruption, leaving Latvia without a vote at ECB policy meetings and challenging a key plank of central bank independence.
Advocate General Juliane Kokott said Latvia had failed to provide evidence of corruption -- which Rimsevics denies -- and urged the court to find Latvia in violation of EU statutes.
""Although the documents contain a description of the acts allegedly committed by Mr Rimsevics, they do not contain any factual evidence capable of establishing that those acts did in fact take place,"" the court said in a statement.
""There is therefore no evidence before the Court that would allow it to ascertain whether the allegations made against Mr Rimsevics are well founded,"" it added.
However, the advocate made no mention of reinstating Rimsevics, possibly leaving the issue to the court, which is expected to deliver a verdict in the coming months.
Although the advocate's opinions are not binding, the court generally follows them and it also has a track record of siding with the ECB, which brought the case along with Rimsevics.
In a case without precedent for the ECB, Rimsevics was detained in February on accusations of soliciting a bribe and was barred by Latvian authorities from working as governor.
Latvia argued that Rimsevics was not formally removed from office, and thus there was no violation, but even that was rejected by the advocate, who said that the Latvian measures constituted being relieved from office.

The ECB declined to comment. Latvian officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

After the alleged assault with an electric cable came to light in August 2017, the South African government granted Grace Mugabe diplomatic immunity. 
That immunity was overturned by a South African court this year after the alleged victim, model Gabriella Engels, challenged the decision.
""I can confirm that a warrant for the arrest of Grace Mugabe was issued last Thursday,"" South African Police Service spokesman Vishnu Naidoo said, adding that police were seeking Interpol's help to enforce the warrant.
There was no immediate comment from Mrs Mugabe or from authorities in Harare.
Mrs Mugabe was seen as a potential successor to her 94-year-old husband Robert, who ruled Zimbabwe from 1980 until he was ousted in a coup late last year, at the time of the incident in a luxury hotel in Johannesburg's Sandton district.
She has denied assaulting Engels with an electric cable, saying an ""intoxicated and unhinged"" Engels attacked her with a knife after the model had gone to see the Mugabes' sons at the hotel.
South African advocacy group Afriforum, which represented Engels, has dismissed Mrs Mugabe's denial as a lie.

Mrs Mugabe has retreated from the limelight in Zimbabwe since her husband was ousted in the November 2017 coup.

The fighting in Mai-Ndombe province is some of the worst to hit the normally peaceful area in years and comes days before Sunday's long-delayed presidential, legislative and provincial elections, which many fear could turn violent.
The fighting between the Batende and Banunu ethnic groups broke out on Sunday over the disputed location of a Banunu chief's burial, said Jules Bango, an activist in the town of Yumbi, on the banks of the Congo River. 
""Today we have identified almost 120 deaths, and there are 71 others wounded in the hospital,"" Bango told Reuters. Many people had fled across the river into neighboring Congo Republic, he added. 
Another local activist, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the death toll could rise as high as 150. He said the upcoming elections, in which Batende leaders are supporting the ruling coalition and Banunu leaders are backing opposition candidates, have raised tensions between the two groups.

Brothers Mehmet, Agron and Ylli Bytyqi had traveled from the United States to join the 1998-1999 Kosovo Albanian fight for independence from Serbia. In 1999 they strayed over the Kosovo border into the neighboring area of Serbia in 1999, were arrested and sentenced to a short prison term.
After being released from prison, they were picked up by Serb security forces, taken to a police training camp and executed there, according to the records of a Serbian court from 2013. 
In a news release late on Tuesday, the State Department said it had ""publicly designated"" Goran Radosavljevic and his immediate family and banned them from entering the United States. 
""Radosavljevic was credibly implicated in the 1999 murder of the Bytyqi brothers,"" it said. 
The bodies of the brothers were found in 2001 in a mass grave in Serbia, alongside the remains of other Kosovo Albanians.
No comment was immediately available from Radosavljevic on Wednesday. In 2007 testimony, he said he had been on vacation at the time of the detention and killings of the Bytyqi brothers and denied any involvement. 
The Bytyqi case is still being investigated by Serbia's War Crimes Court and remains an issue in relations between Serbia and the United States. 
Radosavljevic took part in the Kosovo war which ended in 1999 when a NATO bombing campaign forced Serb troops to end their counterinsurgency against independence-seeking Kosovo Albanians. 
After the ouster of Serbia's strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 2000, Radosavljevic commanded the elite Serbian Gendarmerie with the rank of general. 
He was the key field commander in Serbia's 2000-2001 counterinsurgency against ethnic Albanian rebels in southern Serbia's Presevo valley. 
Radosavljevic retired in 2005 and in 2010 joined the ruling Serbian Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party of President Aleksandar Vucic. He is rarely seen in public.

The Pentagon said on Tuesday that the U.S. State Department had approved a possible $3.5 billion sale of Patriot air and missile defense systems to NATO-ally Turkey, after notifying Congress of the certification.
Russia and Turkey have already concluded a deal for Ankara to buy the rival Russian S-400 system with deliveries expected to begin next year despite the United States and NATO member countries, already wary of Russia's presence in the Middle East, warning it is not compatible with NATO defenses.
Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Russian and U.S. transactions should be seen as separate from each other, and that Russia was in the process of fulfilling the terms of the deal to supply Ankara with S-400s. 
""These are not connected processes. In this case, we are fulfilling agreements that we have with our Turkish colleagues. You know that the contract is being fulfilled. This will be continued,"" Peskov said. 
He said that Russia trusted Turkey not to disclose secrets about the S-400 system to its NATO partners. 
""We don't see any grounds not to trust our Turkish colleagues,"" Peskov said, when asked if Moscow had concerns Ankara might share sensitive data about the S-400s with the Americans. 
U.S. and NATO officials have repeatedly warned Ankara that the Russian system cannot be integrated into the NATO air and missile defense system and that purchasing the S-400 system would jeopardize Turkey's purchase of  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) F-35 fighter jets and possibly result in Washington imposing sanctions. 

Turkey said last month that its purchase of the Russian missiles was a done deal and could not be canceled. It said it needed to buy further defense hardware however, which could be bought from the United States.

973,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 03:56AM ET</span>",U.S. seeks to expedite aid for North Korea amid stalled nuclear talks,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. officials will try to expedite humanitarian aid to North Korea, a U.S. envoy said on Wednesday, as Washington and Pyongyang struggle to find a breakthrough in stalled talks aimed at ending the North's nuclear program.
Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea, made the announcement as he arrived in Seoul for four days of talks with South Korean officials.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to work toward denuclearization at his landmark summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June but the two sides have since made little progress.
With Washington doubling down on sanctions enforcement, humanitarian aid for North Korea has nearly ground to a halt this year, despite warnings of a potential food crisis and improving relations with Pyongyang, aid groups say.
International sanctions imposed over North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs technically do not cover humanitarian activities, and over the summer the United Nations adopted a U.S. proposal designed to streamline approval for aid shipments.
But strict interpretations of U.N. sanctions curtailing banking and shipping transactions with Pyongyang, as well as a travel ban for U.S. citizens, have effectively shut down the North Korea operations of most relief groups, according to a dozen officials at U.N. agencies and civilian organizations.
""I'll be sitting down with American aid groups early in the new year to discuss how we can better ensure the delivery of appropriate assistance, particularly through the course of the coming winter,"" Biegun told reporters in Seoul, noting that the United States would work with the United Nations in reviewing how it grants sanctions exemptions for aid.
He acknowledged that the travel ban - which requires American aid workers to obtain special permission from the U.S. State Department before traveling to North Korea - ""may have impacted the delivery of humanitarian assistance"". 
Early next year, U.S. officials will review how they grant that permission for the ""purposes of facilitating the delivery of aid"", Biegun said.
Part of the catalyst for the review was the expulsion of an American citizen who had illegally entered North Korea in October, he said.
North Korea handled the man's case ""expeditiously and with great discretion"", giving American officials ""greater confidence about the safety and security of Americans traveling"" to North Korea, Biegun said.
STALLED TALKS
Biegun's visit to Seoul comes as negotiations between the United States and North Korea appear stalled, with the two sides yet to reschedule talks between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol after abruptly cancelling a meeting in November.
Trump has said a second summit with Kim is likely to take place in January or February, though he wrote on Twitter last week that he is ""in no hurry"".
North Korea has for years pursued nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions but the bellicose rhetoric from both Pyongyang and Trump that raised fears of war has eased this year.
The stalled negotiations have also had an impact on inter-Korean ties, with the North aloof toward the South's plan to host Kim Jong Un in Seoul this month as agreed at his summit with President Moon Jae-in in Pyongyang in September. 
Kim's trip was unlikely to take place this year, Moon's press secretary said last week.
South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon, who is due to meet Biegun on Friday, said the nuclear talks would face a critical moment between February and March. 
""I think it is fair to say that the denuclearization process is not yet on track in earnest,"" Cho was quoted by the Yonhap news agency as telling reporters. 
""Next year, we can see whether they will have a chance to get closer to the objectives.""
North Korean state media has credited Trump for his ""willingness"" to continue dialogue but has also slammed Washington for stepping up sanctions, accusing the State Department of being ""bent on bringing the DPRK-U.S. relations back to the status of last year which was marked by exchanges of fire"".
The report referred to the North by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
The State Department said communication between both sides was ""ongoing"" but sanctions relief would come after they achieved the goal of a ""final, fully verified denuclearization"".
""The sooner North Korea denuclearizes, the sooner sanctions can be lifted,"" deputy spokesman Robert Palladino told a news briefing on Tuesday in Washington. 
Biegun was scheduled to hold talks on Thursday with his South Korean counterpart, Lee Do-hoon, ahead of their session on Friday of a working group launched last month to boost coordination on North Korean policy. 
Biegun is expected to discuss inter-Korean issues with Cho amid U.S. concerns that Seoul may be moving too quickly with Pyongyang relative to the lackluster progress on denuclearization. 

The two Koreas plan to hold a ground-breaking ceremony on Wednesday for their project to reconnect rail and road links, which would need U.S. sanctions exemptions.

974,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 03:44AM ET</span>","Japan PM Abe's search for Russia peace pact: best chance, last chance?","By Linda Sieg and Kiyoshi Takenaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - As Prime Minister Shinzo Abe enters a seventh year in office, he is chasing the holy grail of Japanese diplomacy: a breakthrough in a decades-old territorial row with Russia that has stymied a formal peace treaty since the end of World War Two. 
Abe, who has signaled he is keen to strike a deal, is expected in Moscow next month for his 25th summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Veterans of past negotiations say 2019 may be the best and last chance for Abe, who sees a treaty as a potential political legacy, to end the row over a group of windswept islands seized by Soviet troops in the final days of the war.
""Abe has only two years and nine months left in his term. If he wants to do this himself, it is a fight against time,"" said Muneo Suzuki, a former negotiator and Abe confidant.
""If it goes on like this, it will end with nothing,"" he told Reuters. 
Putin may be open to a deal now, expecting that better ties will act as a counter-balance to China and attract more Japanese investment and technology, some experts say.
Others doubt Putin really wants any agreement, partly because a majority of the Russian public is opposed to returning any of the islands, known in Japan as the Northern Territories and in Russia as the Southern (NYSE:SO) Kurils.
""I don't believe there will be an agreement before 2021 when Abe's stint ends,"" said Valery Kistanov, head of the Center for Japanese Studies at Moscow's Institute of Far Eastern Studies.
Hopes for an agreement have been dashed before. 
A two-day summit in December 2016 ended with promises of economic cooperation but no big breakthrough on the islands.
In September, Putin caught Abe off guard when, on stage with the Japanese leader at a conference in Vladivostok, he suggested signing a peace treaty by year end ""without any pre-conditions"".
Abe later rejected the proposal, repeating Japan's stance that the question of sovereignty must be settled first.
""TWO-PLUS-ALPHA""
After the two met again in Singapore in November, Abe told reporters they had agreed to speed up negotiations based on a 1956 joint statement in which Moscow agreed to transfer the two smaller islands to Japan after a peace treaty was concluded. 
""The President and I completely share the strong determination that we will not put off this problem ... but will put an end to it with our own hands,"" Abe said.
Retired diplomat Kazuhiko Togo said the remarks showed Abe was determined to clinch a deal.
""If you read Abe's statement after the Singapore meeting ... Abe was saying very clearly, 'I am going to do it',"" Togo said.
Suzuki said a likely deal was one in which Russia gives up the two smaller islands and retains the two larger ones, but allows Japan some access -- a formula known as ""two-plus-alpha"".
A peace treaty could be signed in June when Putin is likely to visit Japan for a Group of 20 meeting, but negotiating the handover of the smaller isles would take more time, he said.
Japan has claimed sovereignty over all four islands, so a ""two-plus-alpha"" deal would likely be unpopular with conservative voters who make up Abe's core political base.
In a sign of its sensitivity, Foreign Minister Taro Kono ignored questions about the islands at a recent news briefing. He later apologized, saying he should have replied ""No comment"".
Moscow's conditions for a deal could be too much for Abe to swallow. Among them is a guarantee that Tokyo will not allow U.S. military deployments on any returned islands.
Russia, which has strengthened its military presence on the larger islands, said on Monday it had built new barracks for troops and planned more facilities for armored vehicles, prompting a protest from Japan.
Hours later, though, ministers from the two countries met in Tokyo to discuss economic cooperation.
Any transfer of sovereignty to Japan would have to address the role of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and Washington's right to establish military bases on the islands.
""Abe seems to want to get away with a verbal statement that no U.S. facilities would be allowed,"" said James Brown, a professor at Temple University's Japan campus. ""That's not good enough for the Russian side.""
Efforts to break the deadlock have floundered before, but failure now would be significant for Abe, said Togo.

""This is the last opportunity,"" he said. ""Abe has insisted for five or six years that this is his priority issue. If there is a setback, it will be weightier than in the past.""

Madagascar is hoping for a second peaceful election since upheaval in 2009, when Ravalomanana was forced out of office by protests led by Rajoelina in what the African Union and other international organizations said was a coup.
Voting began early on Wednesday. Provisional results were expected before the end of the year.
""I hope that the next president of the republic will bring the development for the country, bring security and allow the children's education,"" said 21-year old student Haja Hasina after voting.
Rajoelina cast his ballot in the capital, Antananarivo, and said he would accept the result.
""Even if it is a rainy season, the sun is shining today. I hope the sun shall shine on Madagascar,"" Rajoelina said after voting.
""In case of vote rigging, it won't be from our side, I am a democrat and if I lose I will accept the decision.""

978,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2018 12:39AM ET</span>",Officials say two Honduran migrant youths killed in Mexico,"By Christine Murray and Lizbeth Diaz
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The bodies of two slain Honduran migrant youths were found in the Mexican border city of Tijuana at the weekend, officials said on Tuesday, in a sign of the dangers facing Central Americans in Mexico as they seek to enter the United States.
The prosecutors' office in Tijuana said in a statement it was investigating the deaths of the two youths, who showed signs of having been stabbed and strangled. The victims were believed to be about 16 or 17 years old, the office said.
The victims, who were staying at a shelter for migrant youths in Tijuana, were headed to another shelter when they were intercepted by people who apparently intended to rob them, it said. A third boy survived.
The incident did not appear to be related to organized crime, said Jorge Alvarez Mendoza, a prosecutor in Tijuana.
Thousands of Central American migrants have reached Tijuana in recent months hoping to gain entry to the United States. Many have been waiting in Mexico while they seek asylum under a system known as ""metering,"" which limits how many can apply each day.
It could not be determined immediately if the victims planned to apply for asylum.
Mexico and the United States have been discussing the possibility of returning Central American migrants to Mexico from the United States while their asylum claims are processed.
The proposal has been widely criticized by rights groups who say keeping asylum seekers in Mexico’s border towns puts them in danger. No new advances have emerged since it was reported in the media.
Alden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador to Mexico, said the teens were from Honduras and that the attack on them took place on Saturday afternoon.
""At the moment, all we can say is that the three boys were taken to a place,"" Rivera told Reuters. ""Two of them were brutally murdered and one of them is a survivor of the incident, who is being protected by Mexican authorities.""
He said he did not know why the Honduran government was not notified until Monday and said Honduras had urged Mexican officials to deepen their investigation into the crime.
""The conditions in which the murder of the two youths occurred are really terrible,"" Rivera said. ""We are truly dismayed by everything that has happened.""
Mexico's foreign ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment. A spokesman for the foreign minister said earlier on Tuesday before the news was published that Mexico couldn't control how many migrants the U.S. let in.
""Obviously it has us very worried ... we have been looking for solutions,"" he said.
The crime highlights the precarious position of migrants, particularly minors, in Tijuana, said Vicente Sanchez, a professor of public administration at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana, although he also said he did not expect such incidents to become commonplace. 
""In a violent environment, young people are the most vulnerable,"" he said.

Fox News said in a statement that the conservative commentator has been the target of far-left activist organizations since he made the remarks on his show on Thursday. 
""We cannot and will not allow voices like Tucker Carlson to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts,"" it said.
""While we do not advocate boycotts, these same groups never target other broadcasters and operate under a grossly hypocritical double standard given their intolerance to all opposing points of view,” the network added.

It said all the advertisers that left were moving to other shows on the network and no revenue has been lost.
Republican President Donald Trump has made immigration reform one of his priorities and has promised to crack down on illegal crossings at the southern U.S. border with Mexico. 
Carlson took up the topic again on his show on Monday, saying unregulated mass immigration from Mexico has hurt the natural landscape of the United States. 
""Those who won't shut up get silenced,"" he said. ""The enforcers scream 'Racist!' on Twitter until everybody gets intimidated and changes the subject ... We are not intimidated."" 
Several media reported at least 11 advertisers had stopped running spots on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" since he made the remarks last week, including IHOP, Voya Financial Inc (N:VOYA), Just for Men and Nerd Wallet. 
Other advertisers that pulled spots included Zenni Optical, Minted and Pacific Life, the media reported. 
""As a company, we strongly disagree with Mr. Carlson's statements. Our customer base and our workforce reflect the diversity of our great nation, something we take great pride in,"" Pacific Life said in a statement on Twitter.
Activists have previously used Twitter to post the home address of Carlson, the news site Mediaite reported Nov. 9. Demonstrators have targeted Carlson's home in Washington with a protest and shouted threats, he told the Washington Post.
“Attempts were made last month to bully and terrorize Tucker and his family at their home,"" the network said in its statement on Tuesday. ""He is now once again being threatened via Twitter by far left activist groups with deeply political motives.”

In March, at least 12 companies pulled their advertisements from Laura Ingraham's show on Fox News after the conservative pundit mocked a teenage survivor of the Florida school massacre that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Parkland suburb of Fort Lauderdale.

980,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 09:21PM ET</span>","U.S. pledges billions in aid to develop Central America, curb migration","By Anthony Esposito
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States is committing billions of dollars toward development in Central America and Mexico as part of a plan to strengthen economies in the region and curb illegal immigration, the U.S. and Mexican governments said on Tuesday.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been seeking to persuade U.S. counterpart Donald Trump to work with Mexico to develop Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, as well as Mexico's impoverished south, to stem the flow of people.
Trump's threats to slash aid to the region if illegal immigration is not contained raised doubts about how much the United States would provide, however.
Much of the new aid pledged on Tuesday is private investment that will depend on the viability of the projects and some of it was a reaffirmation of existing pledges.
But Tuesday's announcement defied expectations among some skeptics who thought Trump, a Republican, and Lopez Obrador, a leftist, would clash.
""Finally, we see that Mexico and the U.S. are on the same page in understanding and tackling migration from Central America as a regional issue, not something that one country can handle on its own,"" said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington.
Since much of the money will come through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and will not cost U.S. taxpayers, it is ""the creative solution that was found that makes this much more palatable to the Trump administration,"" Wilson said.
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Washington is committing $5.8 billion to development in Central America and increasing public and private investment in Mexico via OPIC by $4.8 billion.
Of the OPIC amount, $2 billion would go to southern Mexico, he said. Ebrard's government has pledged to find $25 billion to develop the south over the next five years.
""The agreements established here mean more than doubling the foreign investment in the south of Mexico from 2019,"" the minister told a news conference in Mexico City.
Mexico and the United States have been in talks over what to do about Central American migrants moving through Mexico. Washington has pushed for Mexico to keep the migrants while their asylum claims are processed, but no deal has been struck.
The Mexican government has pledged to offer migrants work visas if they qualify to stay in the country and Lopez Obrador wants the United States to do the same.
Roberto Velasco, a spokesman for Ebrard, said in the coming days Mexico aimed to announce a change in immigration policy incorporating the existing plans for work visas for migrants.
The State Department said in a statement it wanted to recognize ""Mexico's willingness to develop a framework to ensure migration occurs in a legal, orderly, and safe manner."" 
It said the two countries would organize a business conference early in 2019 to discuss investment opportunities.
The U.S. pledges include $1.8 billion Washington has spent or allocated between 2015 and 2018, as well as the budget requested for next year, the State Department said. The sums also incorporate OPIC's current projects and potential pipeline worth $2.8 billion, and the U.S. government's current Millennium Challenge commitments.

""We announced today that OPIC could make another $2 billion available for southern Mexico if commercially viable projects are presented,"" a State Department official said.

HAVANA (Reuters) - The commission in charge of writing Communist-run Cuba's new constitution has revised an original draft to remove the concept of marriage altogether after originally amending it to open the doorway to same-sex unions.
The first draft of the new constitution, that was unveiled in July, included Article 68 redefining matrimony as gender neutral rather than between a man and a woman, a project promoted by the daughter of Communist Party head Raul Castro.
Controversy over that amendment in the macho country dominated a nationwide, three-month public consultation on the new constitution designed to update a Soviet-era one.
The most vocal critics of Article 68, the evangelical churches, threatened to shoot down the entire constitutional revamp over that single issue in the referendum on the final version scheduled for early next year.
The commission told the National Assembly on Tuesday the issue of matrimony should be addressed instead in the family code that is set to be updated shortly after the new constitution has been approved.
The National Assembly is set to vote this week on the final version. Then it heads to the popular referendum.
""The commission proposes ... removing the concept of matrimony from the project of the constitution as a way to respect all opinions,"" the assembly wrote on its Twitter account. ""Matrimony is a social and legal institution.""
Cuba has made great strides over the past decade on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights and many younger, urban Cubans and LGBT activists welcomed Article 68.
A majority of Cubans nonetheless appeared to reject it and evangelical churches mobilized the discontent in an unusually strong non-governmental political campaign for Cuba, gathering signatures to petition against it and holding services in protest. 
From August to November, nearly 9 million of Cuba's 11.2 million citizens attended more than 130,000 community-level meetings nationwide to give their feedback on the constitutional draft, state-run outlet Cubadebate wrote on Tuesday.
The government has called the process participatory democracy at its best while opponents have branded it a fraud given that the fundamentals of Cuba's one-party socialist system were never up for debate.
Article 68 proved to be the most polemic, with the majority of those expressing their opinion on it rejecting the amendment, Cubadebate wrote.
The second-most debated issue was the term and age limits on the presidency, as well as the mode of election of the president. More than 11,000 Cubans called for the direct election of the president.
The revised draft keeps the amendments limiting presidents to only two consecutive terms and requiring them to be no older than 60 at the start of their first term, according to Cubadebate.

The commission, headed by Castro, made a total of 760 changes to the draft constitution, from tweaking a single word to incorporating a full new article, the outlet wrote. The final version has 219 articles, five more than the original one.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said his office would shortly launch a new website, Twitter account and Youtube channel as part of his bid to harness the digital era to better communicate government policy to an ever-more connected people.
Connectivity in Communist-run Cuba, a tech laggard, has surged in recent years as the government opened cybercafes, Wi-Fi parks and this month launched mobile internet - although few homes are connected to the web.
Diaz-Canel, who took office from the media-shy Raul Castro in April, has said it is important for the government to advocate for its policies online as Cubans increasingly connect to the web.
The 58-year-old Diaz-Canel opened his own Twitter account in October, with a slew of government officials following suit. Before becoming president, he had already struck a contrast from his octogenarian comrades by carrying tablets to government meetings. 
""We cannot ignore the networks where there is an ideological battle going on,"" Diaz-Canel on Monday told a commission of the national assembly that is holding its twice-annual, week-long session. His comments were published in state-run media on Tuesday.
Diaz-Canel said he wanted his government to communicate openly with the people like Raul's older brother and late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.
He has already demonstrated a much more open style of leadership, making daily televised albeit tightly managed appearances meeting with citizens and inspecting state institutions and companies nationwide.
""We owe the people coherent and direct information and should between us do what Fidel did on his own,"" Diaz-Canel was quoted as saying.
A charismatic orator, Fidel Castro was known for lecturing the press and Cubans in public for hours and often spontaneously on every aspect of the economy and society, from the breeding of cows to the threat of climate change.
Diaz-Canel, who has only given one interview since becoming president, to Venezuela-based television station Telesur, has taken a more conventional and conservative approach.
In a country where the state has a monopoly on mass media, he said he had asked all ministers to appear on a televised roundtable before the meeting of the national assembly this week to be held accountable for their work.
Ministers of labor and economy have explained new rules on the private sector while the transport minister presented plans to improve Havana's creaking public transport, though presenters did not grill them too hard on policy failings.

On Twitter, a few government officials have even entered into lengthy exchanges with Cuban citizens, encouraging them to believe the country is entering an era of greater openness.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 07:45PM ET</span>",U.S. reverses policy in move to speed release of migrant children,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration is reversing a controversial policy that required extensive background checks of all adults living with sponsors of migrant children, in a move that could lead to faster release of migrant minors from shelters.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which cares for children who cross the border alone, said on Tuesday the policy of fingerprinting all adults living with the sponsors enacted in June had increased the time children were in government custody without turning up more red flags. The number of immigrant children in government-run shelters has ballooned to a record 14,700 as of Dec. 17, according to HHS.
U.S. laws limit the time migrant juveniles can be detained, so those caught crossing the border without a parent or legal guardian are often released to adult sponsors in the United States. The children are then expected to show up to immigration court to fight their deportation cases.
""The children should be home with their parents. The government makes lousy parents,"" said Lynn Johnson, Assistant Secretary at Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families told NPR. ""We're finding it (the extra screening) is not adding anything to the protection or the safety of the children,"" she added.
Advocates have pointed to delays in fingerprint processing as a reason so many children are currently in U.S. government custody. Another reason, they say, is that information about potential sponsors is now shared with the Department of Homeland Security, which enforces immigration law. That is scaring relatives from coming forward to claim the children, they say. 
From now on, only the sponsors themselves will be fingerprinted.

Last week, DHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) said about 80 percent of potential sponsors that they conducted checks on in the five months to late November were in the United States unlawfully. ICE said the data sharing had led to 170 arrests.

A day after her government said it would implement plans for a no-deal Brexit in full, May was due to stress how her deal works for all parts of Britain, her office said.
""I am confident that what we have agreed delivers for the whole of the UK,"" she was due to say ahead of the meeting. 
""That’s why it is more important than ever that the devolved administrations get behind this deal and listen to businesses and industry bodies across all four nations who have been clear that it provides the certainty they need.""
May is due to meet the First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, new First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford and representatives of the Northern Ireland Civil Service at her Downing Street office.
She will update them on plans being made for every eventuality including leaving the EU without any kind of a deal, plans that include setting aside space on ferries to ensure a regular flow of medical supplies and keeping 3,500 armed forces personnel on standby to support contingency plans. 
With just 100 days until Britain is due to leave the EU, May has yet to win the support of a deeply divided parliament for the deal she struck last month with Brussels.
She has said a delayed vote on her deal will take place in mid-January, prompting some lawmakers to accuse her of trying to force parliament into backing her by running down the clock as the March 29 exit day approaches.
Sturgeon, leader of the independence-minded Scottish National Party (SNP), has accused May of not listening to Scottish opinion and has likened her Brexit deal to taking a blindfolded leap off a cliff.
The Welsh Assembly also rejected the deal in a symbolic vote earlier this month. Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017 when the governing parties, Sinn Fein and May's allies at Westminster, the DUP, split after a fierce row.
A so-called backstop plan to avoid the reintroduction of a hard border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland remains one of the principal obstacles to parliamentary agreement on May's deal. 

""From the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and  Diageo  (LON:DGE) , to Airbus and Manufacturing Northern Ireland, business and industry right across the UK want to us to deliver this deal as it gives them the clarity and stability they need to protect jobs and living standards,"" May was due to say.

Bolsonaro, who takes power Jan. 1, is a fervent anti-communist who has praised his country's 1964-1985 military regime. He frequently targets Venezuela and Cuba for verbal attacks, a drastic change from Brazil's governments under the leftist Workers Party that ruled from 2003 to 2016 and had warm relations with those regimes. 
Brazil's incoming president did not provide any details during the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) live video when he made his most recent comments on Venezuela and Cuba. 
The United States is counting on Brazil under Bolsonaro to be a strategic ally. 
In late November, U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton met Bolsonaro in his Rio de Janeiro home to help cement ties.
Bolton said Bolsonaro's election was a ""historic opportunity"" for Brazil and the United States to work together on security, economics and other issues.

Bolton hailed Bolsonaro's election as a positive sign that Brazil would support U.S. pressure on Venezuela's left-wing government of Nicolas Maduro, which he describes as part of ""the troika of tyranny"" in the Americas, alongside Cuba and Nicaragua.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium Prime Minister Charles Michel offered to resign on Tuesday after opponents tabled a no confidence vote in a political crisis triggered by differences over immigration. 
In office since 2014, Michel lost the support of the biggest party in his coalition, the Flemish N-VA, last week in protest at his support of a U.N. pact to foster cooperation over the world's 21 million refugees. 
On Tuesday, the 42-year-old lawyer sought backing from left-wing opposition parties so he could hold on to power until parliamentary elections in May.
Instead, the socialists and greens tabled a motion of no confidence in parliament, triggering his offer to quit.
""I must respect the situation. I therefore take the decision to offer my resignation and will go to the king,"" Michel, who has been in politics since winning a provincial councilor post at 18, told parliament. 
Belgium's King Philippe has not taken a decision on whether to accept his offer, the royal palace said. 
The king may ask Michel to stay as a caretaker but with limited powers, potentially hampering efforts to rein in the budget and reform social security. He could also speak to other political leaders to try and resolve the issue, or dissolve parliament and trigger an early vote in 40 days. 
Belgium's political crisis comes as Europe heads into election mode next year, with seven EU countries plus the European Parliament all going to the polls.
The bloc has been grappling with an upsurge of migrants since 2015 when more than 1 million people entered Europe, many fleeing civil war in Syria and poverty in Africa. 
The United States and some other nations, mostly in former communist Eastern Europe, have opposed this year's U.N. pact, arguing it could encourage immigration.

After the N-VA's departure, Michel's slimmed down three-party coalition consisted of his French-speaking liberal MR and two Flemish parties.

One resident told Reuters the blasts sounded like artillery shelling on the eastern and southern outskirts of the Red Sea port city, vital for food and aid supplies to Yemen. Other residents said they had heard similar explosions.
It was not immediately clear which side was responsible. Houthi-run al-Masirah TV accused Saudi-led coalition forces of breaking the truce. A coalition spokesman was not immediately available to confirm whether there was a resumption in fighting.
Fighting persisted before coming to a halt when the truce went into effect at midnight (2100 GMT) on Monday, but Hodeidah had been calm throughout the day on Tuesday.
The Houthi group and the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi had agreed to cease fighting in the Houthi-held city and withdraw forces amid Western pressure to the end the nearly four-year conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and left millions of Yemenis threatened by starvation.
The United Nations, which led the peace talks in Sweden, is trying to avert a full-scale assault on Hodeidah after the coalition launched an offensive this year to try to seize the seaport that handles the bulk of Yemen's commercial goods and aid supplies.
The Western-backed Sunni Muslim Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in the civil war in 2015 against the Houthis to restore Hadi's government, which was ousted from the capital Sanaa in 2014.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday banned the high-power gun attachments of the type used in last year's Las Vegas shooting massacre of 58 people, giving the owners of ""bump stocks"" 90 days to turn in or destroy the devices and blocking owners from being able to register them.
President Donald Trump's Republican Party typically supports gun ownership, and its members have fiercely fought off perceived threats to the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment guaranteeing Americans the right to bear arms.
His administration, though, is sidestepping any potential debate in Congress in issuing a final rule on Tuesday that adds bump stocks to a definition of machine guns written 80 years ago, during the heyday of gangsters' use of ""tommy guns.""
The attachments use a gun's recoil to bump its trigger, enabling a semiautomatic weapon to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, which can transform the firearm into a machine gun.
The Justice Department's regulation follows the lead of many states and retailers that imposed stricter limits on sales of guns and accessories after a deadly shooting in February at a Florida high school. 
Gun Owners of America said on Tuesday that it was going to court to fight the new rule and would seek an injunction. The group said the department was attempting to rewrite laws, the regulation would lead to bans on other weapons, and bump stocks do not qualify as machine guns.
On an earlier call with reporters, senior Justice Department officials said they were ready for any possible lawsuit and confident in the review of case law they conducted while writing and revising the regulation. The department received nearly 190,000 comments on its proposal for the regulation.
The websites for the most well-known bump stock manufacturers, Bumpfire System and Slide Fire, displayed notifications on Tuesday that they had already ceased direct sales of the devices. RW Arms, which both manufacturers described as a leading retailer, was not immediately available to comment on the ban.
While bump stocks are not widespread, they are still plentiful in the market, with high sales over the internet and in big-box stores, the officials said on the call.

Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc stopped selling assault firearms and accessories in 2015. After the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the retailer raised the minimum age for buying guns at its stores. Other retailers, including Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, have also raised the minimum buying age.

The Sao Paulo state police's internal investigations unit worked with state prosecutors who focus on combating the powerful First Capital Command (PCC) drug gang to gather what prosecutors said in a statement was proof of collaboration between officers and the cartel. 
The PCC has rapidly grown in strength in recent years, investigators say, now largely controlling cocaine and gun shipments into Brazil and also the flow of drugs grown in neighboring countries and shipped to Africa and Europe through Brazilian ports. 
By late afternoon, 53 members of the 22nd Battalion of the Sao Paulo state police were under arrest - nearly 10 percent of that battalion's entire force, according to state prosecutors. Three suspected PCC members are also in custody. 
Battling Brazil's rampant crime and ever-growing drug gangs is a top priority for President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who campaigned on a law-and-order platform and openly calls for police to assassinate suspected drug gang members. 
Tuesday's operation in one of Brazil's safest states, however, underscored the complexity of the country's security situation, with poorly paid and trained police routinely being found to tip off drug gangs about police raids, or being active members of paramilitary militias that battle the drug gangs for turf.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has sent a letter to Kosovo counterpart Hashim Thaci urging him to do everything to reach a longstanding deal with Serbia two decades after their war ended, according to Thaci's official website.
Serbia and its former province of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, committed in 2013 to a European Union-sponsored dialogue meant to resolve all unsolved issues but little progress has been made. 
""Failure to capitalise on this unique opportunity would be a tragic setback, as another chance for a comprehensive peace is unlikely to occur again soon,"" says the text of the letter posted on Thaci's website on Tuesday.
""The United States has invested heavily in the success of Kosovo as an independent, sovereign state,"" it said.
In Washington, the White House had no comment. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. Embassy in Kosovo's capital Pristina. 
Serbian-Kosovar tensions rose anew last week when Kosovo's parliament voted to approve the creation of a 5,000-strong standing army - only a week after Serbia's premier suggested such a move could provoke military intervention by Belgrade.
In June this year, Thaci said he would seek a solution with Serbia by ""correcting borders"", but politicians and analysts in Kosovo said that means land swaps.
But his plan rang alarm bells among Balkans neighbors and some Western governments who saw it as a move to take three Serbian municipalities inhabited mainly by ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
If there would be a land swap then Serbia would get part of northern Kosovo populated mainly by minority Serbs who refuse to recognize the authority of the Pristina government.
Britain and Germany have said they do not favor border changes but the United States said if these were agreed by Serbia and Kosovo, it would respect such a deal.
The United Nations Security Council publicly discussed the issues between the two countries and recent tensions on Monday at a meeting attended by the presidents of Serbia and Kosovo. 
The letter posted by Thaci's website said Trump would welcome hosting the Kosovo and Serbian presidents at the White House as part of such an ""historic accord"".
Kosovo is recognized by more than 110 countries, including the United States, but not by Serbia, Russia or China.
Washington remains the biggest supporter of Kosovo both politically and financially.

It was under U.S. command that NATO bombed Serbian forces in 1999 to halt killings and expulsions of Kosovo Albanians during a counter-insurgency operation.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala has taken steps to expel 11 foreign investigators for a U.N.-backed anti-corruption body from the country, it said on Tuesday, further stripping power from the group whose leader was forced out by President Jimmy Morales several months ago.
The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, was established over a decade ago with the authority to conduct independent investigations and work with the country's prosecutors. It has often clashed with Morales. 
The CICIG brought down Morales' predecessor, Otto Perez, with a corruption probe and sought to prosecute Morales over illegal financing allegations. Morales and Perez have both denied wrongdoing.
In September, Morales banned CICIG's head, Ivan Velasquez, from entering the country and said the entity's mandate would end in a year. Critics called the actions a ""constitutional crisis."" 
Guatemala's Foreign Ministry published in an official gazette on Thursday that it had revoked visas and immunity for 11 CICIG investigators and two relatives. 
It was not clear if that represented all the CICIG investigators in the country. A CICIG spokesman could not be reached immediately for comment.
One of the targeted CICIG officials, Cesar Giron, led a fraud case against the president's brother and son, which led to a trial that began last year and is still ongoing. 
CICIG said the investigators pursue ""high-impact cases"" and could be targeted for criminal prosecution without immunity protection. 
""This measure seeks to affect the independence of their work against the illegal and clandestine security apparatus,"" CICIG said in a statement, referring to shadowy groups that developed in Guatemala's civil war and continue to play a role in organized crime and human right violations. CICIG's mandate is to weaken such organizations.

993,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 02:21PM ET</span>",Hungary protests spark opposition coalition - but will it last?,"By Gergely Szakacs and Krisztina Than
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Week-long protests in Budapest have forged fragmented opposition parties into a rare coalition against Viktor Orban, drawing young Hungarians into the streets to demonstrate against what they see as his increasingly authoritarian rule.
Passage of two laws last week backed by the prime minister's Fidesz party angered a variety of domestic voter groups, galvanizing the weak and divided opposition to act with a unity rarely seen in his eight years in power.
The protests in Budapest raised the question of whether such fledgling cooperation can last long enough to put down roots and offer viable opposition to a charismatic politician normally adept at side-lining dissent.
While no substantial shift in Hungary's domestic balance of power appears on the cards for now, there is a sense among some Hungarians that Orban overplayed his hand by pushing through the two laws that drew such a concerted opposition response.
One law, dubbed the ""slave law"", allows employers to ask staff to work up to 400 hours per year of overtime.
Another would set up new courts controlled by the justice minister, which critics say could lead to political meddling.
Denes Hubicsak, an engineer, 24, joined almost all the protests since Dec. 12 and came to the state television building on Monday night, ignoring freezing cold, to demand independent public media and courts.
""I'm here because I want to live here in 10 years' time as well,"" he said. ""Many people here are protesting because of the slave law now, but they sometimes forget the other one: the law about administrative courts.""
Hubicsak said he did not have high hopes of the EU reining in what critics see as the increasingly authoritarian policies of Orban, as this has not happened in the past eight years.
""I cannot see the pressure from the EU or from the European People's party that could influence them a little, or make Orban or Fidesz just think twice,"" he said.
The demonstrations, which peaked at around 10,000 on Sunday, pose no immediate threat to Orban as Fidesz enjoys strong voter support, ever since his third straight election win in April. 
But if the protests persist and leftist parties and the nationalist Jobbik party can turn the latest cooperation into a lasting campaign, such concerted activism might erode Fidesz' widely expected win at European Parliament and municipal elections next year, some analysts said.
There were many students among the protesters on Sunday, and some also joined on Monday night. This is the so-called Generation Y -- Hungarians in their 20s and 30s -- for whom Orban and his policies are not an appealing choice.
They are very unhappy about the government's education policies which they say fail to prepare them for life in the 21st century by too rigidly focusing on rote-learning.
""What they do in higher education is really bad,"" said Dora, 16, who did not want to give her full name. ""I am worried I won't have a good college to go to in Hungary and I don't want to go abroad ...I also oppose the labor law.""
RARE UNITY
Orban has clashed with Brussels over his policies to curb the media and courts, has tweaked the election system to favor Fidesz and put loyalists at the head of several institutions. 
Orban has projected himself as defending Hungary's Christian culture against Muslim migration into Europe, an image which resonates with millions of voters, especially in rural areas.
Fidesz had 38 percent support in a November poll by pro-government think-tank Nezopont, while all the opposition parties had about 25 percent combined. 
Csaba Toth, director of liberal think tank Republikon, said the opposition was now working in rare unity and could build on this next year when Hungary holds European and municipal polls.
""But if they are not able to come up with something forward-looking in the next few days before Christmas, the whole (protest sentiment) could collapse,"" he said.
A government spokesman dismissed the protests as a desperate attempt by a weak opposition and foreign-paid activists. 
""Citizens have the right to protest as long as they don't break the law. But beware when a small minority of foreign-trained activists, representatives of losing political parties and, yes, Soros network putschists emerge hell-bent on toppling a popular, democratically elected government,"" Zoltan Kovacs wrote in a blog on Monday.

A spokesperson for George Soros' Open Society Foundations said on Monday that Soros had not stoked the protests.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh’s ruling Awami League unveiled its election manifesto on Tuesday, making sweeping promises to eradicate poverty and boost the economy as it seeks to retain power for a third straight term.
The 88-page manifesto released by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina promised to increase the country’s gross domestic product to 9 percent from the 7.8 percent the government reported for the 2017-18 fiscal year, partly driven by a more competitive presence in international markets. 
The Awami League is up against the National Unity Front, a coalition of smaller parties that have formed what they say is a movement to restore democracy in Bangladesh.
Ahead of elections due on Dec. 30, violent clashes have broken out across Bangladesh since campaigning began last week, and candidates of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which is part of the coalition, have been attacked. The Awami League has denied involvement.
The coalition and human rights groups have criticized Hasina’s government for being increasingly authoritarian and imposing curbs on free speech and the media. 
Hasina’s rule is credited for an improved economy, over 80 percent of which depends on a robust garments export sector. But her government has been criticized for cracking down on dissent, going after journalists by introducing tough new laws, and locking up opposition workers.
The Awami League manifesto touted the country's improving international image under Hasina, who has been lauded for providing refuge for hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who have fled violence and persecution in Myanmar.
The opposition alliance's manifesto released on Monday took aim at the rights abuses Hasina’s government has been accused of, saying it would allow freedom of expression and would punish police officials involved in “politically motivated” arrests. (https://reut.rs/2R3mbaZ)
The BNP also released its manifesto on Tuesday, saying it would modernize education for madrassas, or Islamic religious schools, and offer “honorable allowances” to mosque leaders. 
Hasina and BNP leader Khaleda Zia share a bitter rivalry and Hasina has criticized the BNP for its links to the Jamaat-e-Islami, a group that opposed Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan. Khaleda is in jail on corruption charges she says were aimed at keeping her away from politics. 

Jamaat’s registration as a political party has been revoked under Hasina’s rule but at least 22 of its members are contesting the elections under the BNP banner.

PARIS (Reuters) - French ""yellow vest"" protesters occupied highway toll booths, setting a number on fire and causing transport chaos in parts of the country just days before the Christmas holidays getaway. 
France's biggest toll road operator, Vinci Autoroutes, said there were demonstrations at about 40 sites along its network and that some highway intersections had been damaged, notably in tourist towns such as Avignon, Orange, Perpignan and Agde.
Protesters set fire overnight to the Bandol toll station, forcing the closure of the A50 highway between Marseille and Toulon, said Vinci, whose network is mainly in southern and western France. The Manosque station was also torched. 
Some 20 people were arrested on Tuesday following the blazes, while four others remain in custody following fires on Saturday. 
""Motorists should take utmost care as they approach toll gates and motorway access ramps due to the presence of numerous pedestrians,"" Vinci said in a statement. 
Several people have died in roadside accidents at yellow vest roadblocks in recent weeks, mostly at the many roundabouts blocked by groups of demonstrators.
The ""yellow vests"" protesters - named after the fluorescent jackets French motorists must have in their cars - have blocked roads and roundabouts across France since mid-November.
The demonstrations began as a protest against fuel tax increases, but have morphed into a wider backlash against the liberal economic policies of French President Emmanuel Macron.
Protesters took to the streets of Paris and other cities on Saturday in a fifth weekend of demonstrations, though they were noticeably smaller than in previous weeks after Macron announced tax and salary concessions.
COSTLY DAMAGE
Protesters angry about high fuel costs and new speed limits have also damaged or torched hundreds of traffic radars.
Radars-auto.com estimated that by the middle of last week some 1,600 - about half of all French traffic radars - had been damaged. More than 250 have been entirely destroyed, it said. 
The French state will also lose several tens of millions of euros in revenues, it said, adding that in 2017 the radars had yielded on average 84 million euros ($96 million) per month.
The interior ministry declined comment on the number of radars damaged, but said that minor damage cost on average 500 euros per radar to repair, with major damage costing up to 200,000 euros.
Fines for damaging radars can run as high as 75,000 euros.
""Even wrapping a radar in plastic or a yellow vest... without destroying it is an offense,"" a ministry official said. 
Vinci estimates the damages since the start of the protests will cost it ""several tens of millions"" of euros, not including lost revenue, as the protesters have allowed thousands of motorists onto the highways for free. 
It dropped a plan to send invoices to motorists who drove through toll booths without paying and whose license plates were captured on cameras following government criticism.

996,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Italy parliament approves corruption crackdown in win for 5-Star,"By Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - The Italian parliament on Tuesday approved a package of measures to crack down on public sector corruption and improve the efficiency of the justice system, two problems which have long dogged the euro zone's third largest economy.
The bill bans people definitively convicted of corruption from participating in future government tenders and increases sentences for offering or taking bribes. 
It allows the police to pursue corruption using undercover operations, previously only allowed for mafia or terrorism, and contains provisions to encourage public sector whistle-blowers.
The legislation is the latest attempt by Italy to crackdown on graft and follows laws approved in 2012 and 2015 that have appeared to make little headway against the scourge.
The bill was presented in September by Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement which governs with the right-wing League party. It was approved in the Chamber of Deputies by 304 votes to 106, having already been passed in the upper house Senate.
""Italy is tired of corruption,"" 5-Star lawmaker Giulia Sarti told the Chamber ahead of the vote. ""The era of bribes ends here, we are introducing an era of legality and transparency."" 
Fighting graft has been a 5-Star clarion call since it was founded nine years ago, and a mainstay of its appeal to voters.
Italy came 54th in Transparency International's latest Corruption Perceptions Index, referring to 2017, one of the lowest-ranked European Union countries and behind many less developed countries such as Georgia, Rwanda and Namibia.
Among several measures aimed at increasing transparency, the value threshold above which parliamentarians must declare donations is lowered to 500 euros per year from 5,000 euros.
The bill also loosens time limits on the prosecution of many crimes, including corruption, responding to complaints by magistrates who say it is all but impossible to reach a definitive verdict within the prescribed time frame.
The statute of limitations, which scraps cases that do not reach a verdict within the set period, will from 2020 be frozen at the end of an initial trial to ensure the appeals process can continue unabated.
Under Italian law, defendants have a right to two appeals before a verdict becomes definitive. According to the latest data available, 145,637 cases fell by the wayside in 2016 after hitting the time out.
The change will only kick in from 2020 at the insistence of the League, which says it must be preceded by a reform to speed up the justice system so that trials do not drag on too long.

The latest EU data shows Italy has the slowest legal system in the bloc, with more than 1,400 days needed on average to complete civil and commercial cases. The vast majority of countries needed under 400 days to wrap up trials.

KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - U.S. and Taliban officials have discussed proposals for a six-month ceasefire in Afghanistan and a future withdrawal of foreign troops as talks aimed at setting up peace negotiations went into a second day, Taliban sources said.
The meeting in Abu Dhabi is at least the third time that U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has met Taliban representatives as diplomatic efforts to end the 17-year war have intensified this year.
Taliban officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. delegation was pressing for a six-month truce as well as an agreement to name Taliban representatives to a future caretaker government.
However the Taliban negotiators were resisting the ceasefire proposal as they felt it would damage their cause and help U.S. and Afghan forces.
There was no comment from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.
In a statement issued late on Tuesday, the Taliban said the talks had mainly concentrated on the ""U.S. occupation"", adding: ""Nothing about interim government, ceasefire, election or other internal issues has been discussed"".
""Talks revolved around withdrawal of occupation forces from Afghanistan, ending the oppression being carried out by the United States and her allies,"" the movement's main spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a separate statement.
An Afghan government delegation traveled to the city and met Khalilzad as well as officials from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan.
However, despite U.S. insistence that any peace settlement must be agreed between Afghans, the Taliban have refused to talk directly with officials from the Kabul government, which they consider an illegitimate, foreign-appointed regime.
The Taliban, seeking to reimpose strict Islamic law after their 2001 overthrow, say the presence of international forces in Afghanistan is the main obstacle to peace. Even as the peace process gathers momentum, fighting has continued with heavy casualties on both sides. 
SENIOR OFFICIALS
The latest round of diplomacy comes about a year after the United States sent thousands of extra troops to Afghanistan and stepped up air strikes to record levels, with the aim of pushing the Taliban into accepting negotiations.
The Taliban delegation was led by Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, head of the movement's political office in Qatar, and included members of the leadership group based in Quetta, Pakistan and the chief of staff of Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada.
The presence in the delegation of senior officials close to the Taliban leader underscored the importance of the talks, which are shaping up as the most serious attempt to open negotiations since at least 2015.
""It's a well coordinated meeting where members from the political commissions and Quetta shura are both participating for the first time,"" said one peace activist in close contact with the Taliban side at the meeting.
An Afghan government team traveled to Abu Dhabi ""to begin proximity dialogue with the Taliban delegation and to prepare for a face-to-face meeting between the two sides"", government spokesman Haroon Chakansuri said in a statement.
But there was no sign from the Taliban they were ready to accept talks with the government, and the Kabul delegation were based in an Abu Dhabi hotel away from the location of the talks.
The United States says the aim of the talks is to facilitate an Afghan-led process and the inclusion of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Pakistan in the talks reflects a U.S. desire to bring in countries with an interest in Afghanistan.

Previous meetings were held in Qatar, where the Taliban maintains a political office, but a push to include Saudi Arabia, which is hostile to the gas-rich Gulf state, prompted a change of venue to Abu Dhabi.

998,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>","Salini, Fincantieri to rebuild Italian bridge after deadly collapse","GENOA, Italy /MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's biggest builder Salini Impregilo and shipbuilder Fincantieri have won the contract to rebuild a bridge that collapsed in August, killing 43 people, in the port city of Genoa.
The project will cost 202 million euros ($230 million)- excluding value added tax - and be completed in 12 months, Marco Bucci, the special commissioner appointed by the government to oversee the reconstruction, said on Tuesday, confirming what sources told Reuters earlier in the day.
The concrete bridge, the responsibility of infrastructure group Atlantia's unit Autostrade per l'Italia, collapsed on Aug. 14, severing part of a motorway linking Genoa with southern France.
That put at risk the activity of the port, which last year accounted for 1.5 percent of Italy's gross domestic product. 
""Twelve months to help re-launch Genoa ... that is the dream that we are hoping to give the Genoese before Christmas in memory of the victims of this terrible tragedy,"" said Pietro Salini, chief executive of Salini Impregilo.
Public works will kick start the economy and create jobs again, Salini added. 
Famed Genoa-born architect Renzo Piano, who donated a proposal for the new viaduct, has agreed to supervise the works, Bucci, who is also the mayor of Genoa, said during a news conference.
The government blamed Autostrade for the disaster and decided to exclude the business from the reconstruction project, even though it will have to pay for it. 
Autostrade and some of its top managers are under investigation for the collapse. Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, has put aside 350 million euros to cover the estimated cost of rebuilding.
""We promised the families of the victims that Autostrade would not even place a stone and that's the case,"" Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said in Rome.
Autostrade is planning to file a legal challenge against the government decree that excludes it from rebuilding the viaduct.
Italferr, a unit of state-owned railway company Ferrovie dello Stato, will also be involved in the project, the transport ministry said in a statement.

999,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 01:26PM ET</span>","Russia, Iran, Turkey back new Syria constitution body but fail to agree makeup","By Stephanie Nebehay and Ali Kucukgocmen
GENEVA (Reuters) - Russia, Iran and Turkey, supporters of the main sides in Syria's complex civil war, on Tuesday failed to agree on the makeup of a U.N.-sponsored Syrian Constitutional Committee but called for it to convene early next year to kick off a viable peace process. 
In a joint statement read out by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after the trio met U.N. Syria peace envoy Staffan de Mistura in Geneva, they said the new initiative should be guided ""by a sense of compromise and constructive engagement"".
The foreign ministers of the three nations had hoped to seal their joint proposal on a committee - which could usher in elections - and win U.N. blessing for it.
But the statement by the three made no mention of the composition of the panel, pointing to lingering disagreement over lists of candidates submitted by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his rebel adversaries.
Mevlut Cavusoglu, speaking to Turkish state media, said only that the three powers had made ""important contributions"" to the creation of the panel and that suggested names were assessed. 
""The U.N. will of course carry out necessary work on the nominated names in the coming process,"" Cavusoglu said.
De Mistura, addressing a separate news conference, made clear the three powers had not nailed down a workable political forum yet, after years of abortive attempts at ending a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced around half of Syria's pre-war 22 million population.
""EXTRA MILE""
""I believe there is an extra mile to go in the marathon effort to ensure the necessary package for a credible, balanced and inclusive constitutional committee, and for including a balanced chairing arrangement and drafting body and voting threshold - to be established under U.N. auspices in Geneva.""
De Mistura, who steps down on Dec. 31 after four years, has struggled since January to clinch a deal on the identity of 150 members of the committee.
He said he would brief U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday and the U.N. Security Council on Thursday. He expected his successor Geir Pedersen to build on his work and ""focus on the purely political aspect"" at the conflict's end.
President Bashar al-Assad's government and the opposition fighting to topple him have each submitted a roster of 50 names. But Russia, Iran and Turkey have haggled over the final 50 members from civil society and ""independent"" backgrounds.
Assad, whose forces have reclaimed most of Syria with Russian and Iranian support apart from Idlib, a northwestern province, has clung to power throughout the conflict and is widely seen as being loath to yield power after it ends.
The Damascus government has previously brushed off U.N.-led efforts to set up a constitutional committee. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Tuesday: ""We (have) always insisted on a political solution led and owned by Syrians. The West has now been compelled to accept this. But it needs to facilitate; not dictate.”
Turkey supports rebels who control part of northwest Syria. 
A year ago, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan described Assad as a terrorist and said it was impossible for Syrian peacemaking efforts to continue with him.
Cavusoglu said on Sunday that Turkey and other nations would consider working with Assad if he won a democratic election.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations will convene Yemen's warring parties by video link on Wednesday to discuss the redeployment of all forces from Hodeidah city and three ports under a ceasefire deal agreed last week, a U.N. spokesman said.
It will be the first meeting of a Redeployment Coordination Committee that oversees the ceasefire and withdrawal of forces, said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric. 
""It will include military/security representatives from the two sides,"" Dujarric told reporters. 
After a week of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden, the Iranian-aligned Houthi group and Saudi-backed Yemen government foes agreed last Thursday to cease fighting in the Red Sea city and withdraw forces. The truce began on Tuesday.
""The full mutual redeployment of all forces from the city of Hodeidah and the ports of Hodeidah, Saleef and Ras Isa shall be completed within a maximum period of 21 days after the cease-fire enters into force,"" Dujarric said. 
The committee will be chaired by retired Dutch Major General Patrick Cammaert who will leave New York later this week to travel to Yemen with a team.
The U.N. Security Council is considering a resolution that asks U.N. chief Antonio Guterres to submit proposals by the end of the month on how to monitor the ceasefire and redeployment of forces.
Diplomats said it would likely be voted on later this week. 

The conflict has pushed Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, to the verge of famine, and millions of people rely on food aid. More than 80 percent of Yemen's imports used to come through Hodeidah port, but that has slowed to a trickle.

1001,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 01:15PM ET</span>",France's Macron turns to Sarkozy amid 'yellow vest' protests,"By Marine Pennetier and Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - In the midst of the biggest political crisis of his presidency, Emmanuel Macron is enlisting the help of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, in a sign that the right-wing ex-leader's influence on Macron is on the rise.
In the space of three weeks, Macron, who has struggled to quell a month-long revolt against his reforms, has made two gestures toward Sarkozy, who led France from 2007 to 2012 on a hardline law-and-order platform.
Macron, 40, lunched with Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace on Nov. 30, an Elysee source said, just before the most violent weekend of demonstrations by ""yellow vest"" protesters who have caused havoc in some of the poshest districts of Paris.
Macron and Sarkozy discussed public order, as well as one of the tax measures Macron announced last week - a tax exemption for overtime work - which was a key plank of Sarkozy's own program while he was president, Le Figaro reported.
Last Sunday Macron sent Sarkozy to Tbilisi to represent France at the swearing-in of Georgia's new president, a move that caused a stir in French political circles.
Sources close to Sarkozy see it as a way for Macron to send a signal to right-wing voters in France who have been shocked by images of burning cars in up-market areas of Paris and Macron's decision to try to buy off the protesters with costly handouts.
""Emmanuel Macron has understood the personal and political benefit he could draw from (Sarkozy),"" said one source close to the 63-year-old former president, whose defeat in conservative primaries in 2016 marked his exit from the political stage.
""In a time of crisis, it's a good idea to keep up relations with those you have points in common with,"" the source said.
""CORDIAL"" RELATIONS
An Elysee official said Macron and Sarkozy had a ""cordial, and respectful"" relationship, adding that the former president's role during the 2008 Georgian crisis - when he mediated between Russia and Georgia - justified the honor.
But Francois Patriat, a senator and close ally of Macron, suggested the president also had a more immediate political goal in mind.
Only six months ahead of European elections, Macron is keen to undermine Laurent Wauquiez, leader of the conservative Republicans, the biggest opposition party, to which Sarkozy also belongs.
""By sending this signal, Macron is taking a pop at Wauquiez,"" Patriat said.
Sarkozy has refrained from criticizing Macron publicly since his 2017 election, unlike another former president, Socialist Francois Hollande. Macron served as economy minister under Hollande and then ran for the presidency as an independent, all but dashing his boss's hopes of winning a second mandate.
For Sarkozy, whose rivals suspect he still harbors political ambitions, Macron's overtures are also useful.

""It's a way for Sarkozy to appear at the center of the game, while stinging Wauquiez,"" said Damien Abad, a senior official in the Republicans.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Tuesday that an American plan to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians brings ""brings new elements to the discussion, taking advantage of the new world of technology that we live in.""
However, during a U.N. Security Council meeting on the Middle East Haley gave no details of exactly what was in the long-awaited, unpublished plan, which has been prepared by U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.
""It is much longer. It contains much more thoughtful detail,"" Haley told the council of the plan, which she said she has read. ""It recognizes that realities on the ground in the Middle East have changed in powerful and important ways.""
The Palestinians are skeptical and have accused the Trump administration of siding with Israel on the core issues relating to the decades-old conflict. They have refused to participate in the U.S. effort since December 2017 when Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved the U.S. embassy there.
""The Palestinians have everything to gain by engaging in peace negotiations,"" Haley said. ""This plan will be different from all previous ones. The critical question is whether the response to it will be any different."" 
She also accused Arab countries of not making the Palestinian people a priority: ""Because if they were, you would all be in a room helping bring both sides to the table."" 
British U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce welcomed Haley's remarks as confirmation that a U.S. peace plan is ready.
European countries have been long been pushing Washington to release its peace plan. Swedish U.N. Ambassador Olof Skoog lamented to the council on Tuesday that ""hopes are evaporating with no peace process in sight.""
Washington has spoken with Israel about presenting the plan at the start of next year, Israel's U.N. envoy has said.
More than four years after the last round of U.S.-sponsored peace talks broke down, the sides remain as divided as ever, with frequent flares-up of violence in the occupied West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem.
A poll published by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research on Tuesday found that 74 percent of Palestinians believe their leadership should reject Trump's peace plan, if offered, while 21 percent want it accepted. 
Israelis' views on Trump are far warmer, but there has been skepticism about peace prospects even within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative coalition government.
""I think that the gap between the Israelis and Palestinians is much too big to be bridged,"" Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked told a Jerusalem conference last month. ""I think personally it (a Trump peace plan) is a waste of time.
It was Haley's last appearance at the monthly Security Council meeting on the Middle East. For the past two years she has generally used the meeting to target Iran over U.S. accusations that it is meddling in the region. 
Haley will step down at the end of the year. Trump has nominated U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert to replace her.

(This corrects 13th paragraph to show Israeli Justice Minister's remarks were last month, not last week.)

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 01:05PM ET</span>",Even Brazilian military must compromise on pensions: incoming minister,"By Lisandra Paraguassu
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Every Brazilian, including current and former members of the armed forces, will have to compromise under the next administration's pension reform plan, a former general set to become government minister said in an interview. 
Retired General Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz told Reuters in Brasilia last week that it was ""inadmissible"" in today's world for some Brazilians employed in the public sector to retire in their 40s or 50s.
On Dec. 4, right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro said he planned to tackle the overhaul of Brazil's fiscally burdensome pension system with piecemeal reforms that can pass Congress, starting with an increase in the minimum age of retirement.
Many economists say cuts to Brazil's social security system are essential to controlling a huge federal deficit and regaining Brazil's investment-grade rating.
""There are some professions that will need to cede some things, as is the case with the justice system workers, the prosecutor's office, and all public sector employment,"" Santos Cruz said. ""The military is in the same situation. The idea of retirement, for example, is going to have to be tweaked."" 
One of a group of former army generals who have become close advisers to Bolsonaro, Santos Cruz will be Bolsonaro's main liaison with Congress, state and local governments, when he takes office on Jan. 1. 
Brazil would have to take a long hard look at the age people stop working in order to protect public finances, said Santos Cruz, who is 66.
Bolsonaro, a former army captain and staunch defender of Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, had pledged to protect military pensions and retirement rights, but the realization that they are responsible for nearly half of the pensions deficit led his economic advisers to push him to rethink that stance. In recent comments, Bolsonaro has said he is willing to countenance a minimum age for military retirement. 
Santos Cruz also said any austerity measures should be leveled against top-earning public workers, for whom the pain is relatively less, rather than lower paid employees.

Merz's loss to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel's protege, in the leadership contest this month, highlighted deep divisions in the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) that the party is eager to heal ahead of four regional elections next year.
Merz told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that he and Kramp-Karrenbauer had discussed how he might work in the CDU, though he refused to divulge details.
""I have renewed my offer once more to really go into politics with all my strength and to give up my previous work as well,"" Merz told the newspaper in an interview released on Tuesday.
Merkel, German chancellor for the last 13 years, decided in October to step down as party leader after the CDU haemorrhaged support in another regional vote. 
She still hopes to stay on as chancellor until 2021, but further poor performances next year would further weaken both Merkel and her ruling coalition.
Merz appeals to the right of the CDU and party officials in eastern Germany would like him to play an active role in campaigning to head off the far-right.
Three of next year's regional votes will be in eastern states - Brandenburg, Saxony and Thuringia - where the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is particularly strong.
A trained lawyer who holds numerous non-executive company board positions, Merz returned for the leadership contest after a decade in the political wilderness. 
Asked whether he could imagine taking on a ministerial role, Merz told Frankfurter Allgemeine: ""I think I would be up to such a role given my experience in the economy and politics.""
But he stressed any decision was up to Merkel.
Merz, 63, lost out to Merkel in a power struggle in 2002 and has been out of the Bundestag since 2009. On his return to politics to seek the CDU leadership, he was backed by party members tired of Merkel's consensual politics.
In a run-off vote at a party congress in Hamburg on Dec. 7, Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, favored by the party elite, won 517 votes out of 999 votes cast by delegates. Merz won 482 votes.
Kramp-Karrenbauer immediately began trying to unite the CDU by promoting another right-winger, Paul Ziemiak, to replace her as secretary general - a role in which he will organize the party, election campaigns and congresses, and support her.

Workers in Valparaiso, a key port for fruit shipments, first walked off the job in mid-November, demanding a bonus, more formal contracts and improved working conditions. Workers' representatives and Terminal Pacifico Sur (TPS), which operates Valparaiso's port, have met several times over the 32-day strike but have yet to reach agreement. 
Protests spread briefly to several other ports overnight on Monday, according to statements from unions posted on Twitter and local media accounts. 
Jorge Martinez, regional intendent for Valparaiso, told reporters on Tuesday that the Chilean police had raided union offices in Valparaiso to tame protests late on Monday after about 20 people were seen throwing Molotov cocktails from its roof.
""The country does not deserve this level of violence over a disagreement that should have been dealt with quickly,"" Martinez said. ""This is something that can affect our economy, tourism, our international reputation. We need an agreement now.""
Neither the union nor Terminal Pacifico Sur were immediately available for comment.
Local daily newspaper El Mercurio reported on Tuesday that the strike had caused fruit exports from Valparaiso to fall by 95 percent from the same period last year, according to statistics from Chile's Federation of Fruit Producers (Fedefruta). 
Valparaiso's port handles approximately 55 percent of Chile's fruit exports, including blueberries, nectarines, cherries, apples, kiwis and pears, according to the Chilean Blueberry Committee.

1009,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 11:05AM ET</span>",Catholic bishops told to act on sex abuse or lose all credibility,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Roman Catholic Church's leading experts on sexual abuse told bishops on Tuesday finally to take responsibility for a global clerical abuse scandal and go and speak personally to victims, or risk seeing the Church lose its credibility worldwide.
Pope Francis has summoned the heads of some 110 national Catholic bishops' conferences and dozens of experts and leaders of religious orders to the Vatican on Feb. 21-24 for an extraordinary gathering dedicated to the sexual abuse crisis.
Victims of clergy sexual abuse are hoping that the meeting will finally come up with a clear policy to make bishops themselves accountable for the mishandling of abuse cases.
""Absent a comprehensive and communal response, not only will we fail to bring healing to victim survivors, but the very credibility of the Church to carry on the mission of Christ will be in jeopardy throughout the world,"" the conference's steering committee said in a letter to all participants.
""But each of us needs to own this challenge, coming together in solidarity, humility, and penitence to repair the damage done, sharing a common commitment to transparency, and holding everyone in the Church accountable,"" said the letter, which was released by the Vatican.
The committee is made up of Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago, Cardinal Oswald Gracias of Mumbai, Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, the Vatican's leading sex abuse investigator, and Father Hans Zollner, an abuse expert based in Rome.
""The first step must be acknowledging the truth of what has happened,"" they said.
Each bishop was asked to visit survivors of clergy sex abuse in their area to learn first-hand the suffering that they have endured.
""PUTTING VICTIMS FIRST""
""This is a concrete way of putting victims first, and acknowledging the horror of what happened,"" said Vatican spokesman Greg Burke, adding that the February gathering would focus on responsibility, accountability and transparency.
Last month, when U.S. bishops held their annual assembly in Baltimore, the Vatican asked them to wait until the February meeting before voting on a series of corrective measures.
The proposals included a telephone hotline to report accusations of mishandling of cases of abuse by bishops, a review board made up of non-clerics to handle accusations against bishops, and a bishops' code of conduct.
Victims' groups and some bishops saw the Vatican intervention as a setback. But the Vatican said it wanted to see if some of the U.S. proposals could be applied worldwide, not just in the United States.
The Church is also facing sexual abuse scandals in Chile, Australia and Germany.
In September, a study commissioned by the German Bishops' Conference showed that 1,670 clerics and priests had sexually abused 3,677 minors, mostly males, in Germany over a 70-year period.

A U.S. Grand Jury report in August found that 301 priests in the state of Pennsylvania had sexually abused minors over a similar period.

No deaths were reported from the blaze, which authorities said may have been triggered by a pressure cooker explosion. Four people were injured, and more than 2,000 people were forced to flee, Amadeu Soares, head of the Amazonas state security ministry, told reporters at the scene. 
Soares said preliminary information from residents pointed to a kitchen incident involving an exploding pressure cooker as the possible cause, though a full investigation was under way.
Television images showed desperate scenes of residents trying to flee through tight, labyrinthine alleyways. Firefighters spent several hours trying to control the blaze, but struggled to prevent houses from going up in flames. 

Such fires are common in poorer neighborhoods and slums in Brazil, where scant government planning during decades of rapid urbanization resulted in informal settlements sprouting up, housing millions who sought jobs in urban centers.

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>","For Poland's nationalists, retreat on judiciary revamp under EU pressure only tactical","By Marcin Goclowski
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's government has cast its defeat to the European Union over judicial appointments as only a tactical retreat on the way to cementing its nationalist, euroskeptic agenda.
Late on Monday, President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party, signed into law amendments to contentious legislation that will allow some Supreme Court judges to remain in their posts after having been forced into early retirement.
Duda's move brought Polish rules in line with an injunction by the EU's top court that is part of a broader EU investigation into political changes in Warsaw that Brussels says undermine democratic checks and balances required of EU member states.
Other disputed reforms the PiS has introduced since coming into power in 2015, including creeping state control of public media, remain in place, however, and party leaders have questioned whether European treaties give the European Court of Justice (ECJ) the right to intervene in Polish affairs.
The PiS, which commands strong support in conservative small towns and villages but is unpopular among educated urbanites, says a clear-out of parts of the judiciary is needed to remove vestiges of the 1945-89 Communist era.
Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said after the ECJ decision last month that PiS's revamp of the judiciary remained legitimate. ""We will continue to eradicate pathologies with fire,"" he added, referring to judges who once served under Communist rule and under the PiS's center-left predecessor. 
TACTICAL RETREAT
Duda suggested that Poland was implementing the injunction only to relieve pressure from Brussels for now, not because it agreed with the decision politically, and that the ruling would not derail the government's program.
""I've decided that it is necessary to comply with the injunction, irrespective of whether it should have been given by the (ECJ)...and whether it goes beyond the tribunal's competencies,"" Duda told the state agency PAP.
He added that the fact some Supreme Court judges had returned to work even before the amendments took effect amounted to a breach of the constitution. ""We have a situation where some elitist judges consider themselves to be above Polish law just because they do not like it,"" he added. 
If the PiS wins a second term it will have more time and flexibility to complete reforms designed to cement its power as a virtual state party, analysts say.
""There so many areas that need to be modernized, even plowed up, that to make Poland a modern country free from the burden of the past, we need not two but at least three terms,"" PiS chief Jaroslaw Kaczynski, seen as Poland's de facto leader, told right-wing Gazeta Polska daily earlier this year.
Polish authorities have adopted over a dozen laws allowing the government and parliament to assert control over the running of the judiciary from top to bottom. The new Supreme Court law allowed the PiS to hand-pick Poland's top judges.
The EU investigation, launched under Article 7 of the bloc's treaty, could in theory lead to Poland losing voting rights in the bloc, though in practice any concrete penalty is unlikely as that would require unanimity among EU governments. Hungary, itself under an Article 7 investigation, has repeatedly said it would not back any sanctions against Poland.
Warsaw's U-turn on its Supreme Court reform is unlikely to resolve the crisis in its relations with Brussels, critics say.
""The question of the Supreme Court and retirement age of judges is only one problem and we should closely watch all the others that fall within the scope of Article 7,"" European Commission deputy chief Frans Timmermans said.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Members of a group of Honduran migrants, which included a mother who had been photographed running with her daughters from tear gas several weeks ago, began seeking asylum at the U.S. border with Mexico on Monday, according to a Reuters witness and lawyers for the group.
The group comprised mostly teens but also included Maria Meza and her children, the lawyers said. The family appeared in a widely circulated photograph taken by Reuters as they fled tear gas thrown by U.S. authorities during a protest at the border last month when some migrants rushed the U.S. fence.
Sandra Cordero, from advocacy group Families Belong Together, which accompanied the migrants, said eight unaccompanied minors were being processed for asylum. Meza and her family were also being processed, Cordero said.
A system dubbed ""metering"" limits how many can ask for asylum each day at U.S. ports of entry, leading to months-long waits in Mexico for thousands of migrants fleeing violence in Central America.
Sometimes U.S. border authorities allow individuals considered vulnerable, such as unaccompanied minors, be processed more rapidly. Activists said the group on Monday fit that category.
Democratic U.S. Representatives Jimmy Gomez and Nanette Barragan, along with lawyers, accompanied the group at the Otay Mesa port of entry in Tijuana, Mexico, on Monday afternoon, the Reuters witness said. 
U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents had said the port of entry was full, Gomez said. Surrounded by advocates and lawyers, the migrants sat by a metal turnstile, having gone beyond a sign marking the division between Mexico and the United States. 
But by Monday evening, after more than four hours waiting, CBP officials came to let several unaccompanied minors pass through.
The asylum seekers had been part of groups of thousands of migrants known as caravans that left from Central America and arrived in Tijuana in recent months.
U.S. President Donald Trump declared the caravans an ""invasion,"" and sent several thousand troops to ""harden"" the border, including with barbed wire.
Activists say metering is intended to deter asylum applicants by making the process arduous, while U.S. officials maintain the system only exists to manage overcapacity at ports of entry.
CBP said in response to questions that this year it had seen a more than 100 percent increase in asylum seekers processed at ports of entry and that it processed people as quickly as possible.
""As we have done for several years, when our ports of entry reach capacity, we have to manage the queues and individuals presenting without documents may need to wait in Mexico as CBP officers work to process those already within our facilities.” 
Lawyers from Al Otro Lado were also with the children. The organization has accompanied vulnerable groups to the border in order to request asylum, bypassing the semi-formal list system that controls the numbers of migrants who try to enter each day.

Earlier this month, a single mother and her 9-year-old daughter were able to ask for asylum at the San Ysidro port of entry only after a congresswoman - who was touring the port at the time - stepped in and told CBP officers they were required to process them by law, according to Lindsay Toczylowski, executive director at the Immigrant Defenders Law Center.

1015,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Deadly pesticide in temple food that killed 15 in India,"By Rahul Singh and Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A toxic pesticide that a U.N. agency wanted India to ban a decade ago contaminated food that killed at least 15 people at a temple last week, police said on Tuesday.
More than 100 also had to go to hospital after devotees consumed portions of tomato rice blessed at the Hindu temple in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
A senior police officer told Reuters laboratory tests showed the presence of monocrotophos - a pesticide which attacks the nerves - in food and vomit samples.
""We are trying to find out how the food got contaminated and not ruling out foul play. We have detained a few people and are enquiring further,"" said Chamrajnagar district police superintendent Dharmender Kumar Meena, without specifying the number of arrests.
The same pesticide was responsible for the death of 23 schoolchildren in the eastern state of Bihar in 2013, one of India's worst mass poisonings.
That was caused by cooking oil kept in a container previously used to store monocrotophos.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), swallowing just 120 milligrams of monocrotophos - the weight of about five grains of rice - can be fatal.
In a 2009 report, the U.N. health agency urged India to ban the pesticide, as the United States, European Union and various other Asian nations have done. 
Its import is now illegal in at least 46 countries.
But India plans to continue allowing its use in non-vegetable crops because it is effective and cheaper than alternatives, said a senior government official.
Monocrotophos costs only about 50 rupees (70 U.S. cents) a kg, while a similar patented alternative would cost as much as 20,000 rupees, said Pranjib Kumar Chakrabarty, assistant director general of the state-run Indian Council of Agricultural Research.
""Farmers want to keep using it,"" Chakrabarty told Reuters. ""It's safe as long as best practices are followed and they are not used in vegetables.""

Monocrotophos controls a range of pests from aphids to caterpillars, mites, moths, stem borers and locusts on crops such as cotton, rice and sugarcane. Poisoning symptoms can include sweating, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision and foaming at the mouth.

The massacre took place on Monday in a rural area of Mapiripan, in southeastern Meta province, a region where criminal gangs frequently clash over trafficking, the commander of the army's seventh brigade, General Jairo Alejandro Fuentes, told Reuters.
President Ivan Duque condemned the killings and ordered troops to the area to investigate.
In 2017, there were 10 massacres across Colombia that left 47 people dead, according to the Ministry of Defense.
After a 2016 peace agreement with the rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) armed violence was curbed, but Marxist guerrillas from the National Liberation Army (ELN), FARC dissidents and crime gangs - made up of right-wing paramilitaries - still fight for strategic drug-producing territories.
Drug trafficking continues to be a lucrative business that finances illegal armed groups. Colombia has some 209,000 hectares (516,450 acres) of coca crops and the potential to produce 921 tons of cocaine per year. It is considered one of the main suppliers of cocaine worldwide.

The approval of the ministers brings Abdul-Mahdi one step closer to completing his cabinet, but major divisions over who will fill the remaining five posts have highlighted the weakness of his position.
Intensifying disagreements between the rival Islah and Bina blocs, led by populist Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Iran-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri, have prevented the formation of a full government -- which currently has just 17 out of 22 ministers. 
Nuri al-Dulaimi, Qusay al-Suhail and Abdul Ameer al-Hamdani were confirmed to be ministers of Planning, Higher Education and Culture. They were approved after the Islah and Bina blocs agreed to allow a vote on five ministries.
The nominees for Minister of Education and Minister of Displacement and Migration -- the only women to be nominated for cabinet positions so far -- both failed to get enough votes, highlighting the continuing disarray over Abdul-Mahdi's appointees.
At the heart of the weeks of fierce political infighting are the nominations of the ministers of interior and defense.
""We voted for the ministries which were not shrouded in disagreements,"" said Sabah al-Ugaili, a lawmaker with the bloc led by Sadr.
""Three won confidence, and two did not because we are not satisfied the candidates were fit for the job. Now the ball is in Abdul-Mahdi's court, to replace them with other names -- including the defense and interior ministries.""
The deadlock over forming a cabinet has raised the prospect of further unrest as the country struggles to rebuild and recover after three years of war with Islamic State. 
The last time parliament attempted to vote on the nominees on Dec. 4, angry MPs disrupted the session, banging on tables and shouting ""illegitimate"" before forcing it to end.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian lawmakers approved draft legislation that would make it a jailable offense to call on teenagers to attend unauthorized street protests, a move Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said on Tuesday was designed to frustrate his own activity. 
Navalny, a 42-year-old lawyer who says he wants to succeed Vladimir Putin as president, has tried to win the support of a young demographic, including teenagers, some of whom have attended his nationwide anti-Kremlin protests.
Police have sometimes dispersed his rallies using force and jailed hundreds of attendees, including teenagers, whose presence has drawn sharp criticism from the Kremlin which has accused Navalny of manipulating minors for political gain. 
The new legislation proposes introducing fines of up to 50,000 rubles ($750) or a jail sentence of up to 15 days for anyone calling on people aged under 18 to attend unauthorized protests. Companies or organizations that encourage minors to attend could be fined up to 500,000 rubles under the new law. 
Opposition activists who want to protest already face an array of restrictions, including a requirement to seek the authorities' advance approval for the time and place of any rally. Authorities often flatly decline such requests for technical reasons or propose alternative venues in remote locations far from the public eye. 
Navalny wrote on Twitter that the draft bill showed how the authorities were moving to give themselves a new lever to hamstring his opposition activity. 
""They passed the law specially for me, but it's them that should be jailed for it,"" he wrote. 

The bill was approved in its third and final reading on Tuesday. It must be approved by the upper house of parliament before it is signed into law by President Putin, something that is normally a formality.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>",Explainer: Brexit basics - What is Brexit and why does it matter?,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019. The date is set in law - the 2018 Withdrawal Act - but the divorce has been plunged into chaos.
Below is an explainer of the Brexit basics:
BREXIT?
A blending of ""Britain"" and ""exit,"" it is the description of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union. The word was coined by former lawyer Peter Wilding four years before the vote took place. 
The EU, initially an attempt to tie Germany and France together and prevent another major European war, is now a group of 28 countries which trade and allow their citizens to move between the countries to live and work.
In the June 23, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 52 percent, backed leaving while 16.1 million, or 48 percent, backed staying in the bloc.
The campaign was among the most divisive waged in Britain with accusations of lying and scare-mongering on both sides. 
Supporters of remaining in the EU were accused of exaggerating threats to the economy. The pro-Brexit camp was accused of misleading voters about how much extra money could be spent on healthcare and stoking fears about immigration. 
A week before the vote, a pro-EU member of parliament died after being stabbed and shot in the street. 
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
Pro-Europeans fear Britain's exit will weaken the West as it grapples with Donald Trump's unpredictable U.S. presidency and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. It weakens Europe's economy and removes one of its only two nuclear powers.
A disorderly Brexit would hammer the United Kingdom's economy, the world's fifth largest, and could disrupt trade in Europe and beyond. The shock of a chaotic Brexit would roil financial markets.
Brexit supporters say while there may be some short-term disruption, in the long-term the UK will thrive outside what they cast as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending.
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
The vote to leave the EU followed decades of discussion about how close the United Kingdom should be to the bloc.
Britain refused to join the forerunner to the EU, the European Economic Community, when it was founded in 1957. When it did decide to join, its attempts were vetoed twice by France.
The UK became a member in 1973, only to have a crisis of confidence that led to an exit referendum two years later. Britons voted 67 to 33 percent to stay in the club in 1975.
But opposition, which partly reflected an ambivalence grounded in Britain's imperial past, stiffened as European leaders sought greater economic and political integration. Britain never joined Europe's currency, the euro, or participated in the EU's Schengen Area open-borders agreement.
Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to halt payments to the EU unless Britain got a refund. But her opposition to greater European integration led to her being ousted in a party coup. 
In an attempt to end splits in his Conservative Party, the former Prime Minister David Cameron held the 2016 ""in-out"" referendum.
WHO ARE BREXITEERS? 
Supporters of Brexit. They say leaving will give the United Kingdom back control over its own destiny and allow it to exploit global economic opportunities beyond Europe.
They argue the United Kingdom will save billions of pounds in membership fees, regain control of its economic policies and regulations and the right to restrict immigration from countries in the EU. 
WHO ARE REMAINERS?
Opponents of Brexit. They say leaving will hammer the British economy and diminish the United Kingdom's global clout.
As a bloc, the EU is Britain's most important trading partner and its greatest source of foreign direct investment. Remainers say an exit will disrupt trade and dislocate supply chains in Europe and beyond.
SO WHY THE CHAOS?
After months of negotiation, British Prime Minister Theresa May reached agreement on the terms of Britain's departure with EU leaders. But her plan to accept EU customs rules on goods while ending free movement of people has drawn criticism from both pro-Brexit and pro-EU lawmakers, the Northern Irish DUP party, which props up her minority government, and members of the opposition.
May says the choice before parliament is her deal, no deal or no Brexit.
CAN BREXIT BE STOPPED?
The lack of support in parliament for May's divorce deal has stirred interest in the possibility that Britain may hold a second vote on whether to stay or leave.
May has ruled out a second referendum. The main opposition Labour Party is also skeptical, fearing another vote would divide supporters.
If parliament did agree to hold another referendum, Britain would have to ask for an extension to the timetable for leaving the EU to allow enough time to hold the vote.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Three lawmakers from Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena's party defected to the government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday after a dispute between the two leaders.
The island nation was plunged into crisis in October after Sirisena replaced Wickremesinghe with ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, without the backing of parliament, leading to protests and downgrades of Sri Lanka's debt.
Rajapaksa, best known for crushing a long-running insurgency in the north of the country and drawing Sri Lanka closer to China, failed to win a parliamentary majority and resigned on Saturday as a government shutdown loomed.
Wickremesinghe was then sworn in as prime minister for the fifth time in a remarkable comeback.
""We joined the government... as the party and the country have been dragged into a difficult position,” Vijith Wijayamuni Soysa, one of the three lawmakers told parliament.
With the latest defections, Wickremesinghe has the backing of 120 legislators in the 225-member parliament.
On Thursday Sri Lanka's Supreme Court ruled that Sirisena's decision to dissolve parliament before the end of its term was unconstitutional, a judgment that eventually led to the return of Wickremesinghe as prime minister.

Members of his ruling United National Party and at least six opposition MPs want to oust Sirisena through an impeachment, though that needs a two-thirds majority in parliament.

The United States delivered Russia a 60-day ultimatum earlier this month to come clean about what Washington says is a violation of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty between Moscow and Washington.
The pact keeps intermediate-range U.S. and Russian missiles out of Europe. Washington has spoken of quitting the treaty altogether unless Russia returns to what it calls ""full and verifiable compliance."" 
Moscow denies it is in breach of the treaty and accuses the United States of violating it. 
Both sides have noted that other countries remain free to develop weapons banned under the treaty, and the United States has in particular raised concerns about China with U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton warning Moscow that Chinese missiles have the capability to strike the Russian heartland. 
""Yes, it is true, there are certain problems with this agreement (the treaty) - other countries that possess intermediate and short range missiles are not part of it,"" Putin told top military officials at a Defence Ministry meeting. 
""What is stopping (us) from starting talks on them joining the current agreement or starting to discuss parameters for a new accord?"" he asked. 
Putin also said that Russia could easily make and deploy land-based intermediate-range missiles if the United States made good on its threat to quit the treaty.

Although he denied his country was in violation of the agreement, he said it had developed powerful airborne and sea-based cruise missiles and could easily roll out land-based missiles if Washington walked away from the pact.

Rodong Sinmun published an article citing a ban on phones in classrooms in France and reports of technology-enabled cheating in India and argued that mobile devices were spreading ""decadent and reactionary ideological culture"".
""Erotic notices, fictions and videos, as well as violent electronic games, are spreading through the mobile phones without limits,"" the newspaper wrote. 
""This means that mobile phones are used as tools to instill unhealthy ideas in minors.""
North Korea's authoritarian government maintains a tight grip on communications, with almost no ordinary citizens allowed to connect by phone or internet to the outside world.
Still, since 2008, the government has rolled out tightly controlled cell networks for communication within the country, with an estimated 3 million subscribers.
South Korean officials estimate that there are about 6 million mobile phones in North Korea, a country of 25 million people.
Analysts say there are signs that the government is slowly allowing more communications technology, even if it remains restricted to networks within North Korea.
According to a report on Dec. 3 by the 38 North website, which monitors North Korea, state media recently broadcast reports of the first outdoor Wi-Fi network in downtown Pyongyang.
Defectors who have left North Korea report that many people secretly watch foreign media, especially South Korean entertainment.
Several North Korea security agencies police communications devices, often randomly inspecting computers, phones, and other devices for banned foreign media or the capability to receive international signals, the U.S. State Department said in a report on censorship and human rights in North Korea released last week.
""North Koreans caught with illicit entertainment items such as DVDs, CDs, and USBs are at a minimum sent to prison camps and, in extreme cases, may face public execution,"" the State Department said in the report. 
Some North Koreans living along the border with China have turned to smuggled Chinese devices to make international calls, but human rights activists say North Koreans caught with illicit phones risk being sent to prison camps.

The decision marks a blow for the anti-immigration party, which has heavily campaigned against Merkel's migration policy - an issue which helped it win seats in the national parliament for the first time in the September 2017 election.
The AfD said Germany should have sent back asylum seekers, many of whom came from Syria via the Balkans, as they made their way into Germany in 2015 and the government should have sought parliamentary approval to open the borders. 
The party asked the court to state that an approval by Germany's Bundestag would have been necessary to justify Merkel's - in its view - far-reaching decision. The court rejected this argument, saying that the AfD only gained representation in parliament two years later. 
The court said a constitutional claim brought by a parliamentary group against the government could not be used to determine whether or not a government decision was constitutional, unless it affected the party in its own right.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 07:55AM ET</span>",Special Report: Myanmar's moves could mean the Rohingya never go home,"By Poppy McPherson, Simon Lewis, Thu Thu Aung, Shoon Naing and Zeba Siddiqui
NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Myanmar's leaders are promising to bring home hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled a brutal military crackdown. But the government, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, is taking steps that make their return increasingly unlikely.
The areas where the Rohingya lived in Myanmar's western Rakhine State before the army ousted them are being dramatically transformed. The northern reaches of this region were once a Muslim-majority enclave in the overwhelmingly Buddhist nation.
Hundreds of new houses are now being built in villages where the Rohingya resided, satellite images show. Many of these villages were burned, then flattened and scraped by bulldozers. The new homes are being occupied mainly by Buddhists, some from other parts of Rakhine. The security forces are also building new facilities in these areas.

A clear picture of the changes on the ground has been elusive, however, because of restrictions on travel to the region. To document Myanmar's plans for the Rohingya, Reuters analyzed satellite photographs of construction work in the region from the past year and an unpublished resettlement map drafted by the government. Reporters also interviewed national and state-level government officials in charge of resettlement policy, aid workers, refugees in the camps in Bangladesh, and Rohingya still living in northern Rakhine.

The government is both building some of the new homes and helping to facilitate the Buddhist resettlement push, according to local officials and new settlers. The campaign is being spearheaded by Buddhist nationalists who want to establish a Buddhist majority in the area.
And the Rohingya resettlement map drafted by the government, described here for the first time, reveals that many refugees who do return to Rakhine won't go back to their homes or even their original villages. The map shows they would be herded into several dozen Rohingya-only settlements, segregating them from the rest of the population.

Many of the Rohingya who stayed behind say conditions are growing intolerable. A scattered community of more than 200,000 Rohingya remains in northern Rakhine, according to an internal U.N. document reviewed by Reuters. More than two dozen people who recently fled to Bangladesh told Reuters they faced intimidation and beatings by security forces, as well as curfews and travel restrictions that made it difficult to work or obtain food. The result is a continued flow of Rohingya into Bangladesh. Almost 15,000 have fled so far this year, according to the United Nations.
Yanghee Lee, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said the Reuters findings showed the actions of the authorities in Myanmar were making the expulsion of the Rohingya irreversible. The aim, she said, is to change the terrain by removing ""any remnants"" of Rohingya villages. ""For people to go back to their places of origin, identify landmarks to go back to, it's become impossible.""
The Myanmar authorities ""wanted to get everyone out,"" she added. ""Now they've got them out, they sure aren't going to give it back to the Rohingya.""
Myanmar has been ready to take back the refugees since January, the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement said in reply to questions from Reuters. The government was investing ""all physical (efforts) and wisdom to overcome the challenges that we faced in Rakhine State,"" it said in a statement.
REMAKING RAKHINE
Aung San Suu Kyi told an audience in Singapore in August that Myanmar is pursuing ""the voluntary, safe and dignified return"" of the displaced Rohingya. A return of some refugees is possible, to be sure, as Myanmar tries to ease international pressure over the crisis. 
Across the border in Bangladesh, however, refugees are skeptical. Plans to begin the repatriation on Nov. 15 with a group of some 2,200 Rohingya collapsed when they refused to go unless they were granted citizenship and allowed back to their original homes.
Myo Nyunt, a spokesman for the ruling National League for Democracy, said the Rohingya were to blame for delays in their return because of their demand for citizenship as a prerequisite for their repatriation. ""We absolutely can't accept this,"" he said.
He also said that bureaucratic obstacles in Bangladesh were holding up repatriation. ""The longer it takes for people to return, the greater the possibility that other people will take their place,"" he said.
Hussein Ahmed says if he can't recover his land, there's no point returning. Sitting in a shack in Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, he examines satellite photos of Inn Din, the village where he was born 73 years ago and fled during the army crackdown last year.
It's almost unrecognizable. All the Muslim homes are gone. The Buddhist homes remain. Hussein Ahmed points to where his once stood, a newly built two-story structure. In its place, there's a long, red-roofed building.
""This was my village,"" says Hussein Ahmed, who was the village chairman in Inn Din. ""All our homes were burned,"" he said. ""The army has occupied our land. So I don't think we'll get it back.""

Myanmar was ruled for half a century by a succession of repressive military leaders. The junta yielded in 2011 to a nominally civilian government, now led by the National League for Democracy of Suu Kyi. The military retains great power, however, and the generals and Suu Kyi's cabinet have shown a united front on Rohingya policy.
Northern Rakhine is home to multiple ethnic groups. The two largest are the Rohingya and a Buddhist people, the Rakhine, who share the name of the state. The junta tried for decades to alter the population balance by bolstering the number of Buddhists there. The aim was to stop ""an incursion of people,"" said Sai Tun Nyo, a spokesman for the military-controlled Ministry of Border Affairs, referring to Muslims. ""We need a human fence to stop it.""
The Rohingya trace their roots back centuries in the Rakhine area, a reading of history supported by independent scholars. Buddhist nationalists see the Rohingya as Muslim interlopers who invented an ethnic identity after migrating from the Indian sub-continent. They want to curb the number of Muslims in northern Rakhine.
The expulsion of the Rohingya on Suu Kyi's watch has gone a long way to achieving that goal. There is now more or less numerical parity between Buddhists and Muslims in northern Rakhine, according to the internal U.N. document.
The Rohingya exodus has produced the world's biggest refugee camp, the result of ""ethnic cleansing"" with ""genocidal intent,"" according to the United Nations. An offensive by Myanmar security forces last year in northern Rakhine that has driven out more than 730,000 Rohingya included mass killings and gang rapes, the United Nations said. Myanmar rejects these accusations, saying the crackdown was a legitimate response to ""terrorism.""
In August last year, a group of Rohingya insurgents attacked security posts in the region, killing 13 members of the security forces. Almost 400 Rohingya villages were damaged or destroyed in the ensuing military-led offensive.
With many of the villages still smoldering, the government signaled its intent to reshape northern Rakhine.
Win Myat Aye, the minister responsible for resettlement, invoked a law on natural disasters under which, he said, ""burnt land becomes government-managed land,"" according to state media.
Within a few months, the government sent in bulldozers to flatten what was left of Rohingya homes, mosques and other buildings in dozens of villages, satellite images showed. In aerial photographs taken over northern Rakhine in February, scrape marks in the sand from the bulldozers are visible.
A U.N. fact-finding mission said reports about the destruction of villages raised ""serious concerns"" that Myanmar was trying to destroy evidence of its actions. The government says the bulldozing was done with good intentions - to make way for new development and improved living conditions for the Rohingya. 
""When the news of that misunderstanding came out, we were surprised,"" said Win Myat Aye, the minister in charge of resettlement.
One of those villages is Inn Din, the site of a massacre of 10 Muslim men amid the 2017 offensive that was reported by Reuters this February. The 6,000 Rohingya who lived there, almost 90 percent of the population, are all gone. So are their homes.
INN DIN
Satellite images of Inn Din (See the images https://reut.rs/2A6ozUK) reveal that more than a dozen rectangular, red-roofed buildings have been built on land where thatch-roofed Rohingya homes and at least one mosque stood. Visitors to the village said the new structures are a border police facility.
The road running through Inn Din has been widened. Satellite images show new roads and infrastructure are being built across northern Rakhine.
The Rakhine state government is building 100 new homes in the village for Buddhists, according to local officials.
More new dwellings in Inn Din, also earmarked for Buddhists, have been built by a group called the Ancillary Committee for the Reconstruction of Rakhine National Territory in the Western Frontier. The group, made up of Buddhist nationalists, has resettled more than 130 families from elsewhere in Rakhine. 
These families are now in Inn Din and Koe Tan Kauk, another village that also had a large Muslim majority until the Rohingya fled.
""Muslims are a worldwide disease. Anyone who says different is lying,"" said Than Tun, one of the group's founders. ""My desire, and what any Rakhine would say, if I'm not being diplomatic, is that we only want Rakhines.""
Than Tun is one of many Rakhine Buddhist leaders who strongly oppose any repatriation of Rohingya to Inn Din and the surrounding coastal region along the Bay of Bengal. They say it is a strategically important part of northern Rakhine - a buffer separating Muslim-majority Bangladesh and Myanmar's Buddhist heartland.
A senior official in Rakhine's General Administration Department told Reuters that his office signed off on the resettlement of families vetted by Than Tun's committee and that the group was operating with government approval. The department falls under the central government's Ministry of Home Affairs, which is controlled by the military.
Kyaw Soe Moe, Inn Din's administrator, said he was helping newly arrived Buddhists to settle on what he said was ""vacant land"" in the village.
'WE LOST EVERYTHING'
Across the Bangladeshi border in Kutupalong refugee camp, Noor Islam lives with 20 members of his extended family in a shack. He said he carried his 90-year-old mother for much of the journey to Bangladesh. 
In Rakhine, he used to own several pharmacies. ""My shops were filled with medicines when I fled,"" he said.
Now, he sells medicines from a rickety bamboo table.
His home was Taung Bazar, a cluster of hamlets named after a ""mountain market"" that once drew large crowds. 
This is what the village looked like before the Rohingya fled https://reut.rs/2R70Spn.
The village was home to both Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, who were the majority.
Now, only a small Rohingya community remains and hundreds of Buddhists have moved in. On the eastern edge of Taung Bazar, the Ministry of Border Affairs has built 63 mint-green houses with blue roofs. These new homes, for mostly Buddhist ethnic groups, are on paddy fields formerly farmed by Rohingya.
More Buddhist homes have been built on the banks of the Mayu River running through the village.
After many residents fled, a Buddhist village administrator began selling off the riverfront land to Buddhist families, starting early this year, according to three Rohingya villagers on the ground who spoke by phone.
Maung Lone, the village administrator, said the riverfront land belonged to the Rakhine Buddhist community. He helped Buddhists move into the new homes there, he said, and also allowed them to live temporarily in empty Rohingya homes. He did not take any money for this, he said.
In Kutupalong refugee camp, Noor Islam recently flipped through receipts that show the tax he paid on two acres of the land where he says the mint-green houses now stand. ""We lost everything,"" he said.
See Video: 'Now we are living under the tarpaulins' https://reut.rs/2ChZisr 
An official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation in Naypyitaw told Reuters that Noor Islam's tax receipts looked genuine. Nonetheless, the official, Than Htut, said that since Rohingya aren't citizens in Myanmar, they would have to ""negotiate"" with local authorities to recover their land or receive compensation.
REMAPPING RAKHINE
In her speech in Singapore in August, Suu Kyi said her government had ""mapped out potential sites for the resettlement of returnees."" Bangladeshi officials told Reuters her remark contradicted an agreement they had signed with Myanmar for the repatriation of the Rohingya. That deal stipulated that the Rohingya could return to their homes or nearby places of their choosing.
The plan flagged by Suu Kyi is moving forward, however. Officials in the ministry responsible for resettlement, at the behest of the minister, showed Reuters a map that plots the location of new settlements that will be built for returning refugees. The ministry says there will be 42 of these settlements.
The map reflects a broad plan to redraw the ethno-religious boundaries of northern Rakhine. Besides demarcating settlements for the Rohingya, the map also includes settlements for mainly Buddhist ethnic groups, as well as sites, marked with black circles, where only Hindus will live. The Rohingya are referred to as ""Bengali"" on the map, a pejorative term that suggests they are foreign interlopers.
See the resettlement map https://reut.rs/2CkrSJD
The new settlements will be an improvement on their original villages, Win Myat Aye, the minister in charge of resettlement, said in an interview. ""The situation will be better, with electricity, roads and bridges.""
Refugees whose houses were destroyed would be given the option of living in a ""temporary tent"" at one of the resettlement sites while building their own homes as part of a ""cash-for-work"" program, the ministry for resettlement said in a statement to Reuters.
Asked whether the Rohingya could return to their old villages, Win Myat Aye replied: ""If their house is still there and if they want to go, they can.""
Many villagers won't have that option. In Inn Din, for example, all the Muslim homes were burned down, and the map shows no resettlement site is planned in the village.
The map also reveals the government doesn't plan any resettlement sites for Rohingya in Rathedaung, one of the three townships that make up northern Rakhine. It was home to tens of thousands of Muslims before they fled. Only a few Rohingya villages remain now.
Myo Nyunt, the ruling party spokesman, said the reconstruction push in northern Rakhine has been driven by ""security and administrative"" needs.
""If we rebuild exactly as before, it would be difficult to control for security reasons,"" he said. ""So for security, we have to build systematically so that terrorists can't hide.""
Yanghee Lee, the U.N. human rights rapporteur, said the government's plans revealed an attempt to ""socially re-engineer Rakhine"" and would create ""an apartheid-like situation"" in the region. ""They want to put all the Rohingya in one or several areas which will be more like long-term internment camps where they can monitor very closely,"" she said.
Dozens of refugees told Reuters they want to return to the homes they left. Many expressed the fear that the new settlements are part of a government plan to control their movements and will become de-facto internment camps. 
There is a precedent: Close to 130,000 Muslims have been living in camps in Rakhine since a bout of communal bloodshed in 2012. Their homes were burned down by their Buddhist neighbors and some 200 people were killed, most of them Rohingya.
The government has pledged to close the camps, but most remain open. The Rohingya refer to them as ""open-air prisons."" Residents are barred from leaving, conditions are squalid, and inhabitants have limited access to education and healthcare.
Christopher Sidoti, a member of the United Nations fact-finding mission on Myanmar, said the fears expressed by the refugees were ""entirely reasonable.""
""The Rohingya still in Myanmar are living in isolated camps or urban or village ghettos, are unable to move, are cut off from their livelihoods, have no health services and inadequate, if any, access to schooling for their kids,"" said Sidoti.
Resettlement plans also appear to have been drawn up for Rohingya who remained behind, people in Rakhine say.
Near the village of Gu Dar Pyin, authorities have begun building new houses for Muslims on a river bank, according to Rohingya residents and a Buddhist elder. The work is moving ahead, they said, despite protests from the 76 Rohingya families still living in the village who didn't want to move.
'BACK TO GRADE ONE'
A major obstacle to the return of the Rohingya is Myanmar's requirement that the refugees accept National Verification Cards, a residency document that conveys a status short of citizenship. The Rohingya vehemently oppose the card, known as the NVC. They say the credentials brand them as new arrivals undeserving of citizenship, despite being born in Myanmar.
In the five decades the generals ruled Myanmar, they increasingly tied citizenship to ethnicity and race. Today, Suu Kyi's government adheres to a list of 135 ""national races"" - a legacy of the junta period - in determining who counts as a citizen. The Rohingya aren't on the list.
Their status has eroded over time. In 2015, the quasi-civilian government then ruling Myanmar stripped the Rohingya of their temporary ID documents, known as ""white cards,"" depriving them of the right to vote in national elections that year. Now, the government is urging the Rohingya to accept the NVC as a ""first step"" to citizenship.
""How can we accept the NVC?"" said Noor Islam, the pharmacist from Taung Bazar.
He has kept his family's old identity documents, including the papers of his father and grandfather, as proof they once shared the same citizenship status as other Burmese. ""It's as if the student has passed matriculation and he is then asked to go back to grade one,"" he said. 
More than a dozen recent arrivals at the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, said the official pressure to accept the identity cards was why they ultimately fled. They gave accounts of being beaten by soldiers and border police for refusing to accept the cards, and being blocked from traveling for lack of one.
These restrictions and a nightly curfew mean many Rohingya can't reach the fields they till or the markets where they buy food. Four refugees who arrived in Bangladesh in recent months said they had resorted to begging for food before they left. Five Rohingya men said they performed forced labor for the military.
Mohammed Rafiq, 20, who arrived in the camps in September, said he was forced to work at the barracks of Light Infantry Battalion 565 in Buthidaung township. He dug holes, cleaned the compound and cut the grass.
""If anyone slacked in their work, the soldiers would aim their guns and threaten them,"" he said. ""I thought we could survive there, and things would improve. But I couldn't keep doing forced labor. So I came here.""
In the camps, many of the Rohingya still dream of going back.

Noor Islam hopes, for his children's sake, that they will ultimately return to their homes in Myanmar. ""We want to go back for our children,"" he said. ""Our children have lost their future.""

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",India's Gandhi ratchets up pressure on PM Modi to waive farm loans,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi pressed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday to write off farm loans to help growers reeling from lower food prices, ratcheting up demands for debt write-offs ahead of a general election that must be held by May.
Gandhi's Congress party, which last week beat Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in three key state elections, on Monday waived farm loans, a poll promise, in the central states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
Congress is also likely to write off farmers' loans in the third of those states - the desert state of Rajasthan.
""My message to farmers is that this country belongs to you and the Congress and other opposition parties will work together to ask Prime Minister Modi to write off your loans,"" Gandhi told reporters in parliament. ""We'll not let him sleep until he waives your loans.""
The prime minister's office did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
India's 263 million farmers and their many millions of dependants form an influential voting bloc, with agriculture employing nearly half the 1.3 billion people and contributing about 15 percent to the $2.6 trillion economy, Asia's third largest.
In 2008, the Congress party-led coalition government announced farm loan waivers worth nearly 720 billions rupees, helping it return to power with a bigger mandate in 2009.
With the national election imminent, both Congress and the BJP are courting farmers who have staged protests in the capital New Delhi and the financial hub Mumbai to complain about rising farm operating costs and falling prices for their produce.
Reuters last week reported that Modi's government is likely to announce loan waivers worth billions of dollars to claw back support among farmers after losing the three state elections.

The plan could see as much as 4 trillion rupees ($56.5 billion) in loans written off, risking straining public finances and undermining already ailing state banks.

Poland's President Andrzej Duda signed on Monday a revamped version of the Supreme Court law that complies with EU demands.
But Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva noted that the new law signed by Duda had not yet been published in Poland's official journal, which meant it was not in force yet.
""The Commission also takes note that the Polish authority's proposal to amend the supreme court law has now been signed by the President yesterday but we note that the law still has to be published,"" Andreeva said.

The euroskeptic and nationalist PiS initially pushed through a range of new powers after coming to power in 2015 that rights groups and EU officials said threatened the rule of law and increased the government's control over Polish courts.

PiS has argued the changes were to improve the efficiency of the courts and rid the country of a residue of Communism.

At least 63 professional journalists around the world were killed doing their jobs in 2018, RSF said, a 15 percent increase on last year. The number of fatalities rises to 80 when including all media workers and citizen journalists.
""The hatred of journalists that is voiced ... by unscrupulous politicians, religious leaders and businessmen has tragic consequences on the ground, and has been reflected in this disturbing increase in violations against journalists,"" RSF Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in a statement.
Khashoggi, a royal insider who became a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and began writing for the Washington Post after moving to the United States last year, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. 
Khashoggi's death sparked global outrage. Saudi officials have rejected accusations that the crown prince ordered his death.
The Paris-based body said that the three most dangerous countries for journalists to work in were Afghanistan, Syria and Mexico. 
Meanwhile, the shooting of five employees of the Capital Gazette newspaper propelled the United States into the ranks of the most dangerous countries.

The media freedom organization said 348 journalists are being detained worldwide, compared with 326 at this time in 2017. China, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt hold more than half the world's imprisoned journalists.

Haifa in northern Israel on the Mediterranean coast is the largest of the country's three seaports. The state has sought to implement reforms at the port for many years to encourage competition and bring down costs, but the union has resisted.
Under the deal that followed months of talks, a tender will be published within six months to sell the port to a strategic investor to prepare it for competition, the Histadrut labor federation and the transportation and finance ministries said.
The plans include upgrading and deepening the port so it can receive bigger container ships in a bid to boost Israel's economy. The Transportation Ministry will also open new access routes to allow for equal competition with other ports.
The port agreed to implement efficiency measures that include a voluntary retirement plan and compensation changes.

Histadrut expects a competing port in Haifa, Israel's third largest city, to open in about two years. It also said it expected a similar agreement to be signed with Ashdod, the country's second-largest port which is in southern Israel.

Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 26, is charged along with Doan Thi Huong, a 30-year-old Vietnamese, of poisoning Kim Jong Nam with liquid VX, a banned chemical weapon, at Kuala Lumpur airport in February 2017. 
Siti Aisyah was originally set to take the stand in January, after the court ruled in August that prosecutors had successfully established a case against her and Huong.
But the trial judge on Tuesday ordered a stay to allow her lawyer to appeal a court decision not to compel prosecutors to turn over copies of statements made by seven witnesses. 
Siti Aisyah's lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng, said the documents were vital to her case, as five of the witnesses had gone missing. 
""Without the police statements, it would compromise my client's defense and be tantamount to a miscarriage of justice,"" Gooi told reporters.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Tuesday condemned nationalist leaders who blame migrants for their countries' problems and themselves fostered mistrust in society by pursuing dishonest gain and xenophobic and racist policies.
The 82-year-old pope, who has made defense of migrants a plank of his papacy, made the comments in his message for the Catholic Church's World Day of Peace on Jan. 1. It is sent to heads of state and government and international organizations.
It comes at a time when immigration is one of the most contentious issues in countries such as the United States, Italy, Germany and Hungary. Francis has sparred with U.S. President Donald Trump and Italian right-wing league leader Matteo Salvini over the rights of migrants.
""Political addresses that tend to blame every evil on migrants and to deprive the poor of hope are unacceptable,"" said the pope, who did not mention any countries or leaders.
He said today's times were ""marked by a climate of mistrust rooted in the fear of others or of strangers, or anxiety about one's personal security.""
Francis said it was sad that mistrust was ""also seen at the political level, in attitudes of rejection or forms of nationalism that call into question the fraternity of which our globalized world has such great need.""
Last week, the pope praised the United Nation’s first Global Compact on Migration, which sets objectives for how the management of migration can be improved. A number of nations, including the United States, Italy, Hungary, and Poland did not attend the meeting in Morocco.
Francis denounced a list of ""vices"" by politicians who he said undermined authentic democracy and brought disgrace to public life through various forms of corruption. 
Among these he included misappropriation of public resources, dishonest gain, xenophobia, racism, lack of concern for the environment, and plundering of natural resources.
He proposed eight ""Beatitudes of the Politician"" - first formulated by the late Vietnamese Cardinal Francois-Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan - as a guide for the behavior of public office holders.

These, he said, would set goals for politicians who, among other qualities, should have a deep understanding of their role, personally exemplify credibility, work for the common good and accomplish radical change.

Below is a timeline:
WAS BRITAIN A FOUNDER MEMBER OF THE BLOC? 
No. Britain declined to join the European Union's forerunner, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), when it was founded in 1952.
Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee told parliament in 1950 his party was ""not prepared to accept the principle that the most vital economic forces of this country should be handed over to an authority that is utterly undemocratic and is responsible to nobody.""
There was also concern it might make close ties with the Commonwealth and the United States more difficult. Britain also stayed out of the European Economic Community when it was formed from the ECSC in 1957. 
Conservative Prime Minister Harold MacMillan reversed this position in 1961 and sought membership of the EEC. 
With Europe divided in the Cold War, he said the promotion of European unity and stability through the bloc was ""so essential a factor in the struggle for freedom and progress throughout the world.""
But France led resistance to Britain's membership in the 1960s, with Charles De Gaulle blocking Britain's accession in 1961 and 1967, accusing the British of ""deep-seated hostility"" to the European project.

WHEN DID BRITAIN FINALLY JOIN?
Britain joined the EEC in 1973 after France dropped its objection's following De Gaulle's resignation in 1969.
As he signed the treaty taking Britain into the common market, Conservative Prime Minister Ted Heath said ""imagination will be required"" to develop its institutions while respecting the individuality of states.
1975 - BRITAIN'S FIRST EUROPEAN REFERENDUM
In 1975, new Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson, faced with splits among his ministers on Europe, decided to hold an ""in-out"" referendum on membership. He backed staying in after saying a renegotiation on terms of membership had ""substantially though not completely"" achieved his objectives.
Britons voted 67 percent to 33 percent to stay in the European Union in 1975.
WAS THE QUESTION OF EUROPE SETTLED AFTER THE 1975 VOTE?
No. Although new Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher backed the campaign to stay in the bloc in 1975, her premiership saw her party become increasingly divided by the issue and her own relationship with EU leaders was tense at times.
She attacked the idea of a single currency and too much power being centralized in EU institutions, telling the then-Commission President Jacques Delors ""no, no, no"" over his plans for more European integration in 1990.
However, days later she was challenged for the leadership of the party by pro-European Michael Heseltine, and was forced from office when she failed to beat him outright in November 1990.
Her successor, John Major, was forced to pull sterling out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) on so called ‘Black Wednesday’, Sept. 16, 1992. The ERM had been intended to reduce exchange rate fluctuations ahead of monetary union.
Major was also beset by divisions over Europe, describing three euroskeptic cabinet ministers as ""bastards"" in 1993 after narrowly surviving a confidence vote over the EU Maastricht Treaty. 
After Labour's Tony Blair won the 1997 election, his finance minister, Gordon Brown, effectively ruled out euro entry by setting out five economic tests that had been worked out with his top aide, Ed Balls, in a New York taxi.
CAMERON'S GAMBLE BACKFIRES
The tenure of the next Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, was also, ultimately, defined by Europe. 
The Conservatives returned to office in 2010 after 13 years of Labour government.
In a bid to shore up support for the Conservatives in the face of a split party and the small but staunchly euroskeptic UK Independence Party (UKIP), Cameron promised an ""in-out"" referendum on a renegotiated deal on membership in the party's 2015 election manifesto.
Cameron said he was satisfied that negotiations with the EU gave Britain enough for him to back a ""remain"" vote.
But though Britain's biggest parties backed the campaign to stay in, the people voted to leave by 52 to 48 percent on June 23, 2016. Cameron resigned the morning after the vote and was replaced by Theresa May.
MAY DAYS
May triggered Article 50, the formal EU divorce notice, in March 2017, setting the exit date of March 29th, 2019 for Britain to leave - with or without a deal.
In a bid to gain backing for her Brexit plan, she called a snap election for June 2017. The gamble backfired. She lost her parliamentary majority and formed a minority government, supported by the euroskeptic Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
On Nov. 13, she reached agreement on the terms of Britain's departure from the bloc with EU leaders.
But her plan to accept EU customs rules on goods while ending free movement of people has drawn criticism from both pro-EU and euroskeptic lawmakers from her own party, the DUP, and the opposition.
Last week May pulled a vote on her deal from parliament, prompting a vote of no confidence in her leadership of the Conservative party.

She survived that, but with the 100 day countdown to Brexit about to begin, Britain still doesn't know on what terms it will leave the bloc, whether May will be in office to see it through or whether it will be forced to delay or revoke the Article 50 process.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - British Airways will resume flights to Pakistan next year after a 10-year absence following an Islamist militant truck bomb that killed more than 50 people at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, the carrier and a British official said on Tuesday.
It will be the first Western carrier to restart flying to Pakistan, where a new airport in the capital has helped ease congestion and concerns about air travel security, since its pullout in 2008.
One of the most high-profile attacks in Pakistan's history took place during a period of devastating Islamist militant violence that swept across the nuclear-armed South Asian nation.
But security has improved, with militant attacks sharply down in the mainly Muslim country of 208 million people. In Islamabad, a web of road checkpoints dotted across the city for more than a decade has mostly been dismantled.
Thomas Drew, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, said BA's return was a ""a reflection of the great improvements"" in security.
BA, which is owned by Spanish-registered IAG (LON:ICAG), is due to begin the London Heathrow-Islamabad service on June 15, with three weekly flights by the airline's newest long-haul aircraft, the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner.
At present, only loss-making national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flies directly from Pakistan to Britain, but its aging fleet of planes is a frequent source of complaints by passengers.
Middle Eastern carriers Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates [EMIRA.UL] have a strong presence in Pakistan and have been eating into PIA's dwindling market share. Turkish Airlines also lays on a regular service to Pakistan.
Islamabad has been running international advertising campaigns to rejuvenate its tourism sector that was wiped out by Islamist violence that destabilized the country following the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.
Pakistan was formed at partition at the end of British rule in India in 1947 and more than a million people of Pakistani origin live in Britain.
Robert Williams (NYSE:WMB), Head of Sales for Asia Pacific and the Middle East for British Airways, said the carrier believes the route ""will be particularly popular with the British Pakistani community who want to visit, or be visited by, their relatives"".

""The links between Britain and Pakistan are already extraordinary – from culture and cricket, to people, politics and education,"" Drew added in a statement. ""I see this launch as a vote of confidence in the future of those links.""

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 03:09AM ET</span>","Japan to buy more U.S.-made stealth jets, radar to counter China, Russia","By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will accelerate spending on advanced stealth fighters, long-range missiles and other equipment over the next five years to support U.S. forces facing China's military in the Western Pacific, two new government defense papers said.
The plans are the clearest indication yet of Japan's ambition to become a regional power as a military build-up by China and a resurgent Russia puts pressure on its U.S. ally. 
""The United States remains the world's most powerful nation, but national rivalries are surfacing and we recognize the importance of the strategic competition with both China and Russia as they challenge the regional order,"" said a 10-year defense program outline approved by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government on Tuesday.
The United States, followed by China, North Korea and Russia, are the countries that most influenced Japan's latest military thinking, the paper said. 
China, the world's second biggest economy, is deploying more ships and aircraft to patrol waters near Japan, while North Korea has yet to fulfill a pledge to dismantle its nuclear and missile programs. 
In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Japan was ""singing the same old tune"" and making ""thoughtless remarks"" about China's normal defense activities.
""What Japan is doing here is neither conducive to improving and developing China-Japan relations, nor to the broader picture of regional peace and stability,"" Hua told a news briefing.
""China expresses strong dissatisfaction and opposition at this and has already lodged stern representations with Japan,"" she added.
Russia, which continues to probe Japan's air defenses, said on Monday it built new barracks for its troops on islands seized from Japan at the end of World War Two. 
MORE STEALTH FIGHTERS
Japan plans to buy 45  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) F-35 stealth fighters, worth about $4 billion, in addition to the 42 jets already on order, according to a separate five-year procurement plan approved on Tuesday. 
The new planes will include 18 short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) B variants of the F-35 that planners want to deploy on Japanese islands along the edge of the East China Sea.
The islands are part of a chain stretching past Taiwan and down to the Philippines that has marked the limit of Chinese military dominance east of the disputed South China Sea.
""Japan's decision to acquire more F-35s is a testament to the aircraft's transformational capability and its increasing role in promoting regional stability and enhancing the US-Japan security alliance,"" Lockheed Martin said in a statement.
The navy's two large helicopter carriers, the Izumo and Kaga, will be modified for F-35B operations, the paper said. 
The 248-metre (814 ft) long Izumo-class ships are as big as any of Japan's aircraft carriers in World War Two. They will need reinforced decks to withstand the heat blast from F-35 engines and could be fitted with ramps to aid short take-offs, two defense ministry officials told Reuters.
TRADE WAR THREAT
The new F-35 order may also help Japan avert a trade war with the United States. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose tariffs on Japanese car imports, thanked Abe for buying the F-35s when the two met at a summit in Argentina this month. 
Other U.S.-made equipment on Japan's shopping list includes two land-based Aegis Ashore air defense radars to defend against North Korean missiles, four  Boeing Co  (N:BA) KC-46 Pegasus refueling planes to extend the range of Japanese aircraft, and nine  Northrop Grumman  (N:NOC) E-2 Hawkeye early-warning planes.
Japan plans to spend 25.5 trillion yen ($224.7 billion) on military equipment over the next five years, 6.4 percent higher than the previous five-year plan. Cost-cutting will free up another 2 trillion yen for purchases, the procurement paper said.
Japan only spends about 1 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense, but the size of its economy means it already has one of the world's largest militaries. 
""The budget is increasing and there has been an acceleration to deploy capability as soon as possible,"" Robert Morrissey, head of Raytheon Co's (N:RTN) unit in Japan, said this month. 
Wary of North Korean promises to abandon ballistic missile development, Japan's military is buying longer-range Raytheon SM-3 interceptor missiles able to strike enemy warheads in space.
The defense papers assessed non-traditional military threats as well. A new joint-forces cyber unit will bolster Japan's defenses against cyber attacks.

More electronic warfare capabilities are planned, and the air force will get its first space unit to help keep tabs on potential adversaries high above the Earth's atmosphere.

Efforts to form a new government led by Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri have been obstructed by rival groups' conflicting demands for seats in a cabinet that must be formed in line with a finely balanced sectarian political system.
Heavily indebted and suffering from a stagnant economy, Lebanon is in dire need of an administration that can set about long-stalled economic reforms to put public debt on a sustainable footing.
""Matters in the government file are moving in a positive direction. If the situation continues with this positivity we will have a new government within a few days,"" Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil was cited as saying by al-Manar TV, which is run by the powerful Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah.
The Hariri-owned al-Mustaqbal newspaper reported a ""positive atmosphere"" which indicated the government formation effort ""was close to reaching its hoped-for conclusion"". ""The road to the government has become open to a very large degree,"" it reported. 
The final logjam has been over Sunni Muslim representation, with a group of Hezbollah-allied Sunni MPs demanding a cabinet seat to reflect gains in the May election in which Hariri lost more than a third of his lawmakers.
Hariri, who remains Lebanon's leading Sunni despite his losses, had ruled out ceding one of his cabinet seats to any of the six Hezbollah-allied Sunnis, who are also known for their ties to the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad.
Under a compromise taking shape, the Hezbollah-allied Sunnis are expected to put forward names of ministerial candidates acceptable to them for inclusion in the government rather than insisting that they themselves should get the seat.

This Sunni minister is expected to be named among a group of ministers allotted to President Michel Aoun, representing a compromise on the part of his Free Patriotic Movement which had been trying to secure control of 11 ministerial portfolios - more than one third of the new cabinet.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Explainer: What's at stake in Congo's presidential election?,"By Juliette Jabkhiro
DAKAR (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo will vote on Dec. 23 in a long-delayed election that could enable the vast Central African country's first democratic transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960.
President Joseph Kabila is due to step down after 18 years in the office he inherited from his assassinated father, and two years after his constitutional mandate officially expired. 
Here's what is at stake:
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
Congolese hope the election can help turn the page on a violent history - or at least head off an even darker turn. 
Starting with the Belgian- and American-backed overthrow of independence leader Patrice Lumumba in 1960, every transfer of power has come at the barrel of a gun. That included autocrat Mobutu Sese Seko's overthrow in 1997 after 32 years in power and his successor Laurent-Desire Kabila's assassination in 2001. 
Two regional wars between 1996 and 2003, triggered in part by the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, sucked in a half-dozen regional armies and resulted in millions of deaths.
Since then, Congo has remained a violent place and fighting between the government and rebel militia has sent hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing across its borders. 
Regional powers such as Angola and Rwanda pushed for Kabila to step down after his refusal to do so when his mandate expired in 2016 caused violent protests and worsened militia violence.
WHAT ABOUT FOR INVESTORS? 
Congo is the world's biggest producer of cobalt, a key component in batteries for electric cars and mobile phones. It is also Africa's top copper miner and a significant producer of gold. 
That makes the election of keen interest to mining companies such as  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), Randgold (LON:RRS) and China Molybdenum, which are in dispute with the government over a new mining code passed this year that hikes taxes and royalties.
Kabila's preferred candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, would be likely to continue the recent hard line with foreign investors. His main challengers have said little on the subject.
WHO'S GOING TO WIN? 
Twenty-one candidates will appear on the presidential ballot, but only three are considered serious contenders.
Shadary, a former interior minister, was little known before Kabila named him in August to run. But he has strong support from government institutions and a sizeable campaign war chest.
He faces a divided opposition, which agreed last month to back former ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) manager Martin Fayulu as its candidate, only for Felix Tshisekedi, the president of Congo's largest opposition party, to back out of the deal. 
A rare national opinion poll in October showed Tshisekedi on 36 percent, with 16 percent for Shadary and 8 percent for Fayulu. 
Besides the presidential race, voters will also elect representatives for provincial and national assemblies. 
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
A lot. 
Violence last week in which security forces killed at least seven opposition supporters and a fire that destroyed thousands of voting machines were timely reminders of how quickly things can turn sour. 
The disputed results of prior elections in 2006 and 2011 sparked violent protests, and there is every indication that losing candidates will again cry foul. 
Congo is sub-Saharan Africa's largest country and has a population somewhere around 80 million (the last official census was in 1984). The lack of roads across vast expanses of its forested interior, attacks by dozens of eastern militia groups and a worsening Ebola outbreak there mean the underfunded electoral commission (CENI) faces a Herculean task. 
The government's decision to turn down international help, saying it would undermine national sovereignty, has not helped.
CENI is rolling out tablet-like voting machines for the first time and they could be a source of controversy. Opposition candidates say they are vulnerable to rigging and could be compromised by unreliable power supplies.
WHAT CHALLENGES WILL THE NEW PRESIDENT FACE?
The new president will have his hands full. Nearly 13 million Congolese don't have enough to eat, militia continue to massacre civilians in the east, and the Ebola outbreak, already the second deadliest in history, isn't expected to be brought under control until at least mid-2019.

There is also the question of what Kabila will do after leaving the presidency. If Shadary wins, analysts say Kabila could try to pull the strings from behind the scenes. If an opposition candidate wins, he will have to contend with institutions stacked with Kabila loyalists.

Maduro's speech to militia members, broadcast on state television, came less than a week after the socialist leader, without offering evidence, accused the United States of plotting to invade the South American country, which is experiencing a severe economic crisis.
""We will arm the Bolivarian militia to the teeth,"" Maduro said, without detailing how many of the militia members were actually armed. ""An invading imperialist force may enter a part of our fatherland, but the imperialists should know that they will not leave here alive.""
The National Bolivarian Militia is a reserve force composed of civilian volunteers, founded by former President Hugo Chavez in 2008 to assist the armed forces. 

Maduro noted on Monday that he had given an order in April to boost the size of the reserve force to 1 million members. At the time, he said the militias had ""nearly 400,000"" members.

Imelda Cortez, 20, gave birth in a latrine in April 2017 and left the baby there. When Cortez was treated at a hospital afterward, doctors suspected she had tried to perform an abortion. 
The court determined that Cortez, who had not known she was pregnant, did not try to kill her infant daughter. The child survived.
As she left court, Cortez, who was arrested shortly after the birth, was greeted by cheering relatives and human rights activists holding signs demanding her freedom.
Cortez's stepfather has been arrested and is awaiting trial, Salvadoran prosecutors said.
For the past two decades, El Salvador has had some of the world's most severe laws against women who have abortions or those who are suspected of assisting them, even when the life of the woman is at risk.
Some 22 more women are serving sentences of up to 35 years for aggravated homicide linked to abortion, according to the Group for Decriminalizing Abortion.
""This sentence ... represents hope for women who are still in prison and are also being tried for aggravated homicide,"" defense lawyer Ana Martinez said.
President Salvador Sanchez Ceren in 2017 proposed a law to allow abortions in cases of rape or when the mother's life is at risk, but Congress did not pass it.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council is considering a draft resolution that asks U.N. chief António Guterres to submit proposals by the end of the month on how to monitor a ceasefire agreed by Yemen’s warring parties for the key port city of Hodeidah, diplomats said on Monday.
The Iranian-aligned Houthi group and the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi agreed on Thursday after a week of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden to cease fighting in the Red Sea city and withdraw forces.
The ceasefire begins on Tuesday in Hodeidah.
Britain circulated the draft resolution to back the deal to the 15-member Security Council on Monday. It was not clear when it would be put to a vote. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Britain, China or Russia to pass.
The draft, seen by Reuters, asks Guterres to submit proposals on “how the United Nations will support the Stockholm Agreement as requested by the parties, including, but not limited to, monitoring operations for the ceasefire and mutual redeployment of forces from the city of Hodeidah and the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Issa.”
It also wants to know how the United Nations will play a leading role in supporting Yemen Red Sea Ports Corporation in the management of, and inspections at, the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Issa and how the United Nations will strengthen its presence in those areas.
The Houthis control most towns and cities, including Hodeidah and the capital Sanaa, from where they ousted Hadi’s government in 2014, prompting a Saudi-led military coalition to intervene. The government is now based in the southern port of Aden.
Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Friday that a robust monitoring regime was urgently needed in Hodeidah to oversee compliance. He said retired Dutch Major General Patrick Cammaert would lead the monitoring.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Monday that the monitoring operation led by Cammaert would fall under the authority of Griffiths. He said the logistical and security details were still being worked out.
""It will be part of the existing mandate that Mr Griffiths has ... This is not a peacekeeping mission, they will not be armed,"" Dujarric said. ""We look forward to very strong support from the Security Council.""
The conflict has pushed Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, to the verge of famine, and millions of people rely on food aid. More than 80 percent of Yemen’s imports used to come through Hodeidah port, but that has slowed to a trickle.

The draft resolution “calls on all parties to the conflict to take further steps to facilitate the unhindered flow of commercial and humanitarian supplies including food, fuel, medicine and other essential imports and humanitarian personnel into and across the country.”

1045,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2018 07:21PM ET</span>",Candidates to succeed Kabila after Congo's presidential election,"By Giulia Paravicini
KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo will hold a presidential election on Sunday that could lead to the country's first democratic transfer of power, following decades marked by authoritarian rule, coups and deadly conflict.
The outcome of the long-delayed vote to choose President Joseph Kabila's successor is far from certain, after a campaign marred by violent crackdowns on opposition rallies and the destruction of thousands of the capital's voting machines in a fire last week.
Kabila's preferred successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, is facing a credible challenge from two opposition leaders: Felix Tshisekedi, president of Congo's largest opposition party, and Martin Fayulu, a former  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) manager and businessman.
One poll conducted by New York University's Congo Research Group (CRG) in October showed opposition leaders were favored by about 70 percent of voters. Tshisekedi came first with 36 percent support, ahead of his now coalition ally Vital Kamerhe (17 percent) and Shadary (16 percent). Fayulu ranked fourth with eight percent support.
In all, 21 candidates will be running, including several other prominent Kabila critics, which risks diluting the opposition vote and boosting Shadary's chances.
The results could also be compromised by accusations of fraud similar to those that tarnished the 2011 presidential election. The opposition has already cried foul over the use of untested electronic voting machines that they say will make it easier to rig the results. 
Below are profiles of the main candidates. 
THE INSIDER: EMMANUEL RAMAZANI SHADARY
The 58-year-old former governor of the eastern province of Maniema served as interior minister from late 2016 until this February, when he was named permanent secretary of Kabila's PPRD party.
He is a combative defender of the president and oversaw repeated crackdowns on protesters and pro-democracy groups as interior minister, especially in the aftermath of Kabila's refusal to quit power when his mandate expired in 2016.
In May 2017, the European Union slapped a travel ban and asset freeze on him for his involvement in ""planning, directing or committing acts that constitute serious human rights violations"".
Kabila's choice of a die-hard loyalist suggests that the president intends to remain closely involved in national politics. He will be eligible to run again in 2023.
A Shadary victory is likely to lead to a continuation of Kabila's policies, including a tough line on the mining sector, where foreign investors hope the government will rescind steep tax hikes approved earlier this year.
Shadary and his team did not respond to requests for comment.
THE OPPOSITION SCION: FELIX TSHISEKEDI
Felix Tshisekedi is the 55-year-old president of Congo's largest opposition party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress(UDPS).
He draws much of his political legitimacy from being the son of late veteran opposition leader, Etienne Tshisekedi, who died in Brussels aged 84 last year.
In November, his decision alongside ally Kamerhe to pull out of an opposition agreement to back Martin Fayulu as a common candidate scuppered the opposition's hope of presenting a broadly united front in the race.
Tshisekedi has said he would select Kamerhe as his prime minister if he wins the vote. In return, he will back a candidate from Kamerhe's Union for the Congolese Nation (UNC) party in the 2023 presidential election.
""If I am elected president my priority will be to restore peace and security across the country,"" Tshisekedi told Reuters.
THE BUSINESSMAN: MARTIN FAYULU 
Fayulu, 61, trailed both Shadary and Tshishekedi in the most recent October vote, but his nomination as a common opposition candidate in November may have since won him more public support.
As the common candidate he has the backing of popular opposition heavyweights such as Jean-Pierre Bemba and Moise Katumbi, who have been barred by the authorities from running. 
Fayulu has the most extensive business background of the election frontrunners, having spent almost two decades as a manager at U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil. He has promised, without elaborating, to revise mining and oil contracts as president.
""The people need leaders who will bring them development, who will bring them prosperity,"" Fayulu told reporters in Geneva after his candidacy was announced. ""We are committed to achieving this work so that Congo ceases being the laughing stock of the world.""

Fayulu is the president of the Engagement for Citizenship and Development (ECIDE) party.

Therese Patricia Okoumou, 44, was also convicted of interfering with governmental administration and disorderly conduct before a U.S. magistrate judge in New York City.
Each misdemeanor count carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail, according to Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York. Okoumou, a native of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who the New York Daily News said became a U.S. citizen in 2016, remains free pending her sentencing on March 5, Biase said.
In a statement announcing the guilty verdict, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said Okoumou's actions ""went well beyond peaceable protest.""
""It was a crime that put people at grave risk,"" Berman said, calling her conduct ""dangerous and reckless.""
Okoumou was arrested on July 4 after she scaled the base of the statue and began a three-hour standoff with police that led to the evacuation of the landmark in the midst of the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
She and her lawyer later said her act of civil disobedience was primarily a demonstration against the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from parents who were caught crossing the U.S. border illegally.
Administration officials said the policy was needed to secure the border, but it was ended in June after images of separated youngsters held in cage-like detention facilities sparked a furor both at home and abroad.
Testifying in her own defense on Monday, Okoumou was asked by her attorney, Ron Kuby, whether she would repeat her protest under the same circumstances. She answered, ""Yes.""
""As long as our children are being placed in cages, my moral values call for me to do something about it,"" she said in court, according to Kuby and the Daily News account.

An investigation has been opened to determine the circumstances of the “criminal incident,” the statement said, without providing further details.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council is considering action to push Myanmar to work with the United Nations to address the Rohingya refugee crisis, although China and Russia have so far boycotted talks on a British-drafted resolution, diplomats said on Monday.
The draft resolution aims to put a timeline on Myanmar allowing the return of more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees from neighboring Bangladesh and addressing accountability, said diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Rohingya have fled Myanmar's Rakhine state since August last year, when attacks on security posts by Rohingya insurgents triggered a military crackdown that the United Nations, the United States, Britain and others described as ethnic cleansing.
Myanmar denies the accusations of ethnic cleansing.
The draft resolution would warn that the 15-member Security Council could consider further steps, including sanctions, if there was not enough progress made by Myanmar, diplomats said. It would also ask U.N. officials to report back regularly to the council. 
It was unclear if or when the draft resolution could be put to a vote. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain or France to pass. 
""I think it's inappropriate, untimely and useless,"" Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told Reuters on Monday. 
China's U.N. Ambassador Ma Zhaoxu declined to comment. Myanmar's U.N. Ambassador Hau Do Suan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The draft was circulated to council members late last month and diplomats said that there had been several rounds of discussions. Russia and China attended an initial meeting, but have not taken part in any further talks, diplomats said.
The text would push Myanmar to implement a memorandum of understanding with the U.N. development and refugee agencies that Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's government signed in June, as well recommendations made by the Rakhine Advisory Commission that was led by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan.
The draft resolution does not include a referral of the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court, diplomats said. 
U.N. Security Council envoys traveled to Bangladesh and Myanmar in late April.

In October, China, backed by Russia, failed to stop a Security Council briefing by the chair of a U.N. inquiry that accused Myanmar's military of genocide against Rohingya Muslims. Myanmar has rejected the findings of the U.N. report.

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2018 04:34PM ET</span>",Erdogan says Trump positive on Turkish military plan to push east in Syria,"By Daren Butler and Phil Stewart
ANKARA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Turkey may start a new military operation in Syria at any moment, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday, touting support from U.S. President Donald Trump even though the Pentagon has issued a stern warning to Ankara. 
Last week, the Pentagon said unilateral military action by any party in northeast Syria, where U.S. forces operate, would be unacceptable. 
But Erdogan suggested that Trump was more receptive to Turkish plans to move east of the Euphrates river than his own U.S. Department of Defense.
""We officially announced that we will start a military operation to the east of the Euphrates,"" Erdogan said in a speech in the central province of Konya. ""We discussed this with Mr Trump and he gave a positive response.""
The White House did not respond to requests for comment on Erdogan's assertion but last Friday acknowledged that Trump and Erdogan spoke about Syria during a telephone conversation.
""Given the (Turkish) threats of marching in to deal with this problem themselves, the U.S., at every level has reached out to the Turks,"" said Ambassador James Jeffrey, the special U.S. envoy for Syria engagement. 
Jeffrey added that he believed the situation had ""calmed somewhat.""
""I believe that we're willing to work with the Turks and with the people on the ground to find a way forward,"" he told a forum at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington.
Turkey and the United States have long been at odds over Syria policy, where Washington has backed the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia against Islamic State. Ankara considers the YPG a terrorist organization tied to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), an outlawed group that has waged a three-decade insurgency in southeast Turkey.
Erdogan said last week that Ankara would launch a new campaign within days against the YPG, although he has yet to give a more definitive timeline.
Any new campaign is likely to be complicated by the presence of U.S. soldiers in northern Syria, who have established observation posts along the Turkey-Syria border in a failed effort to assuage Turkish security concerns.
Washington has communicated the positions of those observation posts to Ankara, and warned that American forces will defend themselves if fired upon, officials told Reuters. 
The Pentagon on Monday denied reports that it was sending reinforcements to the border, in a sign that it is comfortable with the risk level to U.S. troops even as Ankara heightens the threat of military action.
""We do not have a major military movement of forces to the northeast border with Syria,"" said Pentagon spokesman Colonel Rob Manning. ""We've got nothing more than what is required to continue our mission at those (observation posts).""
Turkey has already intervened to sweep YPG and Islamic State fighters from territory west of the Euphrates over the past two years. It has not gone east of river, partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces. The Pentagon says it has about 2,000 troops in Syria.
""We can start our operations on Syrian soil at any time from locations that suit our planning. Our heroic army has completed its preparations and plans. As I always say, we may come suddenly one night,"" Erdogan said on Monday. 
Erdogan did not elaborate on Trump's response, but said Turkey would take care to avoid American casualties. 
MORE CONCILIATORY
A source familiar with the Syria issue said Erdogan was urged by the administration to refrain from a military incursion into Syria's Manbij, a town just west of the Euphrates river held by the YPG, and was warned that the United States would defend itself if threatened.
However, Erdogan has said Turkish forces will enter Manbij if the United States does not remove YPG fighters from the town, including targeting the eastern side where the YPG controls an area of more than 400 km (250 miles) along the border toward Iraq.
Manbij is near an area where Turkish and U.S. troops began joint patrols last month. That cooperation has also been complicated as Turkey has shelled Kurdish fighters to the east of the Euphrates.
The shelling prompted the United States to set up observation posts on the border between Kurdish-held northern Syria and Turkey.
Erdogan's comments appeared to be more conciliatory than those of his interior minister Suleyman Soylu, who earlier accused Washington of attempting to stymie Turkey's efforts against the YPG over the last two years.
""The United States thought it could deter us with the men it has nurtured,"" Soylu said during a visit to Pakistan, state-owned news agency Anadolu reported. ""Now, they will try to hold us back east of the Euphrates. Turkey did not, and will not, allow that.""
A spokesman for the Turkey-backed National Army rebel group in Syria said it would ignore a request from Washington to stay out of a campaign east of the Euphrates. ""We have chosen to stand side by side with (Turkey),"" Major Youssef Hamoud said. 

Separately, Ankara has kept up regular air strikes against PKK militants based in Iraq's mountains. Baghdad summoned Turkey's ambassador on Friday after Ankara said it killed eight PKK fighters. But Turkish warplanes have since carried out further strikes.

They told reporters in the southern city of Bari that the man, identified as Omar Moshin Ibrahim, was detained last Thursday and that a magistrate had charged him on Monday with instigating terrorism and supporting terrorism.
Police said Ibrahim was stopped following a month-long surveillance operation as he was about to leave Bari where he worked for a cleaning company.
The investigation, the police officials said, included wiretaps in which Ibrahim was heard telling someone, ""Let's put bombs in all the churches of Italy. Where is the largest church? It is in Rome.""
In another conversation, they said, he was heard praising those who ""killed on the path of Allah"" and hailing last week's shooting at the Strasbourg Christmas market in which a gunman killed five people.
Police added that the man used the alias of Anas Khalil and called himself ""Yusuf"" on social media, and had arrived in Italy in 2016. He was suspected of having been a militant of Islamic State previously.

Italian police have increased security around churches, including St. Peter's, ahead of Christmas, which draws big crowds to the Vatican area.

Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party had already agreed to scrap the law that lowered the judges' retirement age, after the European Court of Justice issued an interim judgment against the legislation in October. Monday's order made the court decision final.
The eurosceptic and nationalist PiS initially pushed through a range of new powers after coming to power in 2015 that rights groups and EU officials said threatened the rule of law and increased the government's control over Polish courts.
PiS originally argued the changes were needed to improve the efficiency of the courts and rid the country of a residue of Communism.
But as it prepares for national elections next year, it has shown signs of softening its position on a number of issues.

President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling party, said late on Monday he had approved revamped legislation to reverse the change to the judges' retirement age.

The military's Africa Command (Africom) said four strikes were carried out on Saturday, killing 34 militants, and two more on Sunday, which killed 28. ""Africa Command and our Somali partners conducted these air strikes to prevent terrorists from using remote areas as a safe haven to plot, direct, inspire and recruit for future attacks,"" Africom said in a statement.
The air strikes, among the deadliest this year, did not kill any civilians, the statement said.
""At this time we assess these air strikes did not injure or kill any civilians.""
The United States carries out regular air strikes in Somalia in support of a U.N.-backed government there, which has been fighting against an al Shabaab insurgency for years.
Last month, the U.S. military said it had killed 37 militants.
In Washington, the Pentagon cited 45 strikes against al Shabaab militants this year, after 35 strikes in 2017. 
As of August 2018, the Pentagon believes there were 3,000 to 7,000 al Shabaab fighters and 70 to 250 Islamic State militants in Somalia, Pentagon spokesman Colonel Robert Manning said during a press briefing.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States found itself isolated in the 193-member United Nations General Assembly on Monday over Washington's concerns about the promotion of abortion and a voluntary plan to address the global refugee crisis.
Only Hungary backed the United States and voted against an annual resolution on the work of the U.N. refugee agency, while 181 countries voted in favor and three abstained. The resolution has generally been approved by consensus for more than 60 years.
However, this year the resolution included approval of a compact on refugees, which was produced by U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi after it was requested by the General Assembly in 2016. The resolution calls on countries to implement the plan.
The United States was the only country to oppose the draft resolution last month when it was first negotiated and agreed by the General Assembly human rights committee. It said elements of the text ran counter to its sovereign interests, citing the global approach to refugees and migrants.
General Assembly resolutions are non-binding but can carry political weight. U.S. President Donald Trump used his annual address to world leaders at the United Nations in September to tout protection of U.S. sovereignty. 
The United States also failed in a campaign, which started last month during negotiations on several draft resolutions in the General Assembly human rights committee, against references to ""sexual and reproductive health"" and ""sexual and reproductive health-care services.""
It has said the language has ""accumulated connotations that suggest the promotion of abortion or a right to abortion that are unacceptable to our administration.""
On Monday, Washington unsuccessfully tried to remove two paragraphs from a General Assembly resolution on preventing violence and sexual harassment of women and girls. It was the only country to vote against the language, while 131 countries voted to keep it in the resolution and 31 abstained.
The United States also failed in trying to remove similar language in another resolution on child, early and forced marriage on Monday, saying: ""We do not recognize abortion as a method of family planning, nor do we support abortion in our reproductive health assistance.""
Only Nauru backed Washington in voting against the language, while 134 countries voted to keep it in the resolution and 32 abstained. 

When Trump came to power last year he reinstated the so-called Mexico City Policy that withholds U.S. funding for international organizations that perform abortions or provide information about abortion.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About 2,000 Hungarians protested at the state television building to demand independent public media and courts on Monday in the latest gathering uniting a fragmented opposition in action against right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Protesters shouted ""Dirty Fidesz"" referring to Orban's ruling party, and held up banners like ""TV has lost its public television character"", saying public TV had become a government mouthpiece. They faced hundreds of police.
Earlier security guards ejected two independent lawmakers from the building after they tried to get into a studio to read out a petition against what they say is an authoritarian regime.
The two lawmakers were among about a dozen members of parliament who spent the night in the building demonstrating against Orban's policies, after a big protest on Sunday that took some 10,000 people to the streets.
""I have mainly come to defend the independent courts,"" said one of the protesters at state TV, Gabor Hacsi, 35, a lawyer. He referred to a law passed last week that would set up new administrative courts that will answer to the government. 
""I hope we will see more protests with several thousands of people and I can only help by coming here."" 
Sunday's march, dubbed ""Merry Xmas Mr. Prime Minister"", in effect united weakened opposition groups in action against Orban for the first time since 2010 when he came to power. 
The protests pose no immediate threat to Orban, who has strong core support which helped him return to power in April. 
But Peter Kreko, director of the think tank, Political Capital, said the government's reaction to the protests showed ""short-sighted arrogance"". He added: ""This is stepping up one level in the regime's authoritarian logic.""
In the petition the opposition lawmakers backed the protest in calling for the withdrawal of a new labor law that boosts overtime hours, for independent public media and courts and for Hungary to join the European Union's prosecutors office.
A Fidesz spokesman criticized the lawmakers for going to the state TV building and said they were abusing their parliamentary powers by seeking to ""meddle in editorial operations.""
Independent lawmaker Bernadett Szel posted video footage on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that showed the security guards tussling with her fellow-MP Akos Hadhazy and pushing him out of the building. Szel said she had also been ejected.
Szel read out the petition to the demonstrators.
Fidesz said on Saturday, in reaction to the protests, that it was ""increasingly obvious that criminals have been part of the street riots organized by the Soros-network.""

A spokesperson for George Soros' Open Society Foundations said that Soros had not stoked the protests.

The arid Sahel region is suffering violence from militant groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, highlighting the difficulty international partners face in restoring regional stability.
The northern region of Burkina Faso, bordering Mali and Niger, has been especially hard hit, leaving the fragile West African state struggling to assert its authority since ex-Burkinabe president Blaise Compaore was ousted in 2014 at the hands of a popular uprising.
""There will be no extra (troop) involvement on the French side,"" President Emmanuel Macron said at a news conference with Burkinabe counterpart Roch Marc Christian Kabore in Paris.
However, he said Paris was ready to send more trainers and military advisers as well as extra equipment.
French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly said the two sides had signed an agreement defining the legal framework for security cooperation, suggesting that French troops could provide help more quickly and easily to Burkinabe forces. 
Paris will provide the local army with 34 pickup trucks.
France, the former colonial power in the region, intervened in Mali in 2013 to drive out Islamist militants who had occupied the north, and has since kept about 4,500 troops in the region as part of Barkhane counter-terrorism operations. It has between 250-400 special forces based in Burkina.
Led by France, Western powers have provided funding to a regional force made up of soldiers from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania to combat jihadists.

But the so-called G5 force has been hobbled by delays in disbursing the money and poor coordination between the five countries while insecurity has escalated.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - The United States supports Bosnia's ambition to join NATO, a senior U.S. official said on Monday, dismissing Bosnian Serb objections and adding Washington would react strongly to any threat to the stability of the country.
Bosnia has long proclaimed integration with NATO and the European Union to be strategic goals. But the pro-Russian leader of Bosnia's autonomous Serb region, Milorad Dodik, has called for the country to remain neutral and stay out of the U.S.-led military alliance.
""We discussed the U.S. position which is as firm as it has ever been, supporting the decision that has been made by this government to pursue membership in NATO,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan said after meeting Bosnia's three-man inter-ethnic presidency.
NATO bombed dominant separatist Serb forces in Bosnia in 1995 to help bring an end to the war there, and the United States brokered the Dayton peace deal that followed. 
This month NATO invited Bosnia to start working on a Membership Action Plan (MAP), which has been blocked for 10 years by the Serbs. 
Dodik said he told Sullivan there was no consensus in the presidency regarding NATO membership. The Muslim Bosniak and Croat members support it.
Russia is strongly against the country's membership in NATO. 
""We in the United States take that decision ... made by the government to pursue NATO membership very seriously,"" Sullivan said when asked about Dodik's reiterated objections.
""We don't want any country, any country to interfere with government of this independent sovereign country,"" he added.
""The U.S. government will always react strongly to any threats to the stability of Bosnia-Herzegovina."" 
The U.S sanctioned Dodik in 2017 for calling for the secession of Bosnia's Serb region.
""There is no change in his status under sanctions,"" Sullivan said. ""We are committed to protect this country's sovereignty and territorial integrity in line with the 1995 Dayton agreement.""

Sullivan said the United States would help Bosnia counter ""external forces that actively seek to make Bosnia ever more vulnerable to internal instability"". He declined to name those forces.

Users looked up the word 74 percent more often than in 2017, said spokeswoman Meghan Lunghi for the website, which claims to be ""America's most trusted dictionary.""
The surge was prompted by specific uses of the word such as ""obstruction of justice,"" after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted in August that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election, the company said in a statement.
""It's often familiar words for abstract concepts that are among the most looked up words,"" said Emily Brewster, associate editor for Merriam-Webster, in the statement. ""When common words like justice are used in contexts that are very specific, technical, or legal, people look them up in the dictionary for the detail and nuance that a definition can provide.""
""Justice"" joined Dictionary.com's ""misinformation"" and the Oxford English Dictionary's ""toxic"" as top words of the year.

The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said it had so far confirmed the existence of four tunnels which the Israeli army discovered in the vicinity of the border demarcation, known as the ""Blue Line"", adding the finds were of ""serious concern"".
Israel says Hezbollah, Lebanon's most powerful armed group, dug the tunnels with the aim of launching attacks into Israel with backing from its regional sponsor Iran. Hezbollah has yet to comment.
""UNIFIL at this stage can confirm that two of the tunnels cross the Blue Line. These constitute violations of UN Security Council Resolution 1701,"" the statement said. 
The U.N. peacekeepers said they would continue their technical investigations, describing the recent discoveries as ""a matter of serious concern,"" requesting ""urgent follow-up actions"" by the Lebanese authorities. 
Israel and Hezbollah have avoided major conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border since 2006, though Israel has mounted attacks in Syria targeting what it said were advanced weapon deliveries to the group.
Israel has said it is up to UNIFIL to deal with the tunnels on the Lebanese side of the border, and its military said it held the Beirut government responsible for breaching Security Council resolution 1701.
President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, has said Lebanon is committed to implementing 1701, which ended the 34-day war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah.
The resolution banned all unauthorized weapons between the Litani River and the U.N.-monitored border between Israel and Lebanon. Under the resolution Lebanon's army is responsible for security on its side of the border in a zone from which any other armed force, including Hezbollah, is banned.

The Agrofert group receives EU subsidies in a combination of non-discretionary direct payments for farming and for business, environmental and other projects. Babis put the group into trusts in 2017.
However, his critics say he is still in control as the trusts are managed by his wife and lawyers.
The European Parliament called on the European Commission on Thursday to suspend EU funding to Agrofert until a full investigation into the suspected conflict of interest had been carried out.
Gunther Oettinger, the EU commissioner for budget and human resources, sent a letter setting out options for Babis to avoid conflict of interests, one of which was to exclude himself from decisions affecting his business interests.
Babis, the second-richest Czech, said on Monday he would choose this option. The others were either for him to cut all ties to Agrofert or for subsidies to the group to be halted.
""We have agreed at the government today that I will resign from the Council for Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) ... effective immediately,"" Babis said after a regular government meeting. 
He added he would also take no part in government decisions on EU funds. 
""We are acting according to the points which the commissioner states as possibilities,"" Babis told reporters.

""We suffer from a judicial process that severely violates our fundamental rights, including the right to the presumption of innocence,"" the Catalan leaders wrote in the letter, which was sent to more than 40 European heads of state and government.

A total of nine Catalan leaders are in jail awaiting trial for their role in the region's failed bid to split from Spain last year. If convicted, they face decades in prison on charges including misappropriation of funds and rebellion.

(Reuters) - Chilean law enforcement officials are investigating the delivery of Iranian crude oil to the state energy company ENAP as a possible source of the noxious fumes that caused hundreds of people to seek hospital treatment in August, the prosecutor's office told Reuters. 
Police and prosecutors raided ENAP's oil refinery and maritime port in Hualpen and Talcahuano, two adjoining towns 315 miles south of Santiago, early on Monday morning, ENAP confirmed.
Enrique Pena, a spokesman for the Bio Bio prosecutors' office, said the prosecutor was examining whether there was a link between the company's transfer of Iranian crude oil to its refineries in Hualpen and Quintero, a town 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Santiago, with chemical intoxications in both areas. 
""At this stage, it as a hypothesis we are looking at,"" Pena said.
A total of 508 people, the majority of them children, sought medical treatment in Quintero and nearby Puchuncavi in August after residents reported a strong smell in the air, Health Ministry figures seen by Reuters confirmed.
The environment minister blamed a chemical leak and the environmental watchdog has said ENAP was responsible, something the company has denied.
The Bio Bio prosecutors' office gave no further details about intoxications it said had also taken place in August in Talcahuano. 
ENAP confirmed the police raid on Monday in a statement sent to Reuters, and said none of its operations had been affected. 
""We have, as always, handed over all information that was required, and reiterate our willingness to cooperate with the authorities,"" it said. 
ENAP is the main oil refiner in Chile, which imports nearly all the fuel it consumes. 
The United States re-imposed sanctions on Iranian oil exports last month to punish Tehran for its involvement in several Middle Eastern conflicts, but relaxed restrictions for some of Iran’s biggest buyers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - amid fears of a price spike. 
ENAP did not respond to questions from Reuters about its Iranian oil purchases.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday it had built new barracks for troops on a disputed chain of islands near Japan and would build more facilities for armored vehicles, a move likely to anger Tokyo after it urged Moscow to reduce its military activity there.
The announcement, from the Ministry of Defence, said Moscow planned to shift troops into four housing complexes on two of the four disputed islands, known as the Southern (NYSE:SO) Kurils in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan, next week.
The news came after the Kremlin said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe might visit Russia on Jan. 21 as the two countries step up a push to defuse the territorial dispute to allow them to sign a World War Two peace treaty, something the disagreement over the Pacific islands has long prevented.
There was no immediate reaction from Japan. Tokyo said in July it had asked Russia to reduce its military activity on the islands, a plea Moscow dismissed as unhelpful megaphone diplomacy at the time.
Soviet forces seized the four islands at the end of World War Two and Moscow and Tokyo both claim sovereignty over them. Diplomats on both sides have spoken of the possibility of reviving a Soviet-era draft agreement that envisaged returning two of the four islands as part of a peace deal. 
President Vladimir Putin and Abe have held numerous face-to-face meetings to try to make progress. 
But tensions have remained high. Tokyo says it is concerned by what it regards as an unhelpful Russian military build-up on the islands - which has included warplane, missile defense and other deployments. Moscow, meanwhile, says it is perturbed by Japan's roll-out of the Aegis Ashore U.S. missile system.
Russian politicians say they fear Japan might agree to deploy U.S. missile facilities on the islands if it ever got any of them back and that Moscow could only countenance a deal if it received a cast-iron guarantee that ruled out such a scenario.
In the meantime, Moscow is fortifying the islands.
The Defence Ministry said on Monday it wanted troops and their families to move into the two new housing complexes on one of the four islands, Iturup (Etorofu in Japan), and into two others on the island of Kunashir (Kunashiri in Japan), on Dec. 25.
It said troops were moved into two such similar facilities last year with three more barracks planned for 2019. 

""Also on both islands we have modern and heated storage facilities for weapons and armored vehicles,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding that more such facilities were planned.

The man's wife subsequently heard of the contact with the priest and lodged a complaint with prosecutors, whose view was that everyone, without exception, had to help in an emergency. 
In concurring, the court handed Stroobandt a suspended one month jail term and ordered him to pay the widow a symbolic euro in damages. His lawyer Jan Leysen said he planned to appeal, arguing that the secrecy of confession was indeed absolute.

Police said the girl was in hospital and her suspected attacker had been arrested.
""Medical aid is being provided to the victim and as per doctors her condition is stable,"" a police statement said. The girl's parents are laborers.
Sunday's alleged assault happened six years after the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in a bus that eventually led to her death. Since the 2012 New Delhi attack, rape laws have been strengthened to deter such crimes, including the introduction of the death penalty for the rape of girls under 12.
""Nothing has changed. Until swiftness and certainty of strong punishment is ensured, nothing will change,"" Swati Maliwal, chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women that fights for women's issues, said.
There were 40,000 rapes reported in India in 2016 and the victims were children in 40 percent of those cases.

ARICA, Chile (Reuters) - In the pitch black of the moonless Chilean desert night, the Cuban man is hard to spot until he is within yards of the border.
Placing a small backpack of clothes on the ground, Yoniel Torres, 31, a father of two, puts his hands up as police approach with flashlights and take him into custody.
""A coyote (people trafficker) left me near (the Peruvian border town of) Tacna and told me to follow the old railway line,"" he tells Reuters as he is led away. ""This is all horrible. The journey was so hard. I just came in search of a better life.""
Scenes like this are replicated every day along Chile's long land border. The country is hardening its stance towards immigration, and refused to sign a United Nations migration pact last week aimed at improving migrant integration and protection.
Global attention largely falls on perilous Mediterranean Sea crossings and the uncertain fate of the Central American caravan at the U.S.-Mexico border. But Chile and other comparatively wealthy Latin American nations are absorbing another wave of mass migration from destitute nations in the region such as Haiti and Venezuela.
Some migrants, like Torres, travel up to 5,600 miles (9,000 km) by air and land to get as far as Chile. The country has the highest GDP per capita in South America, low levels of corruption and the lowest murder rate, according to figures from the World Bank and InSight Crime, a foundation that analyses organized crime. 
They endure Amazonian humidity then extreme temperatures and high altitude in the deserts between Peru, Bolivia and Chile.
Immigration into Chile has increased sixfold in less than 30 years, from 114,500 in the 1992 census, to 746,465 last year.
There has also been a spike in illegal migration. In the dusty Arica region at Peru's southern border, Chilean police say they caught more than 2,200 foreigners attempting to enter the country illegally between January and November, up 80 percent from the previous year.
Guided in many cases by traffickers paid as much as $3,000, police say, the migrants cross in remote areas to avoid border guards, risking a fatal encounter with landmines planted on the frontier decades ago on the orders of former dictator Augusto Pinochet.
Javiera Lopez, Arica's chief prosecutor, says migrants often suffer sexual assault and robberies on the journey.
""There are scars that might never heal, not only from the journey but also once in Chile because they find the situation is totally different to the one they thought they would find,"" he says.
Those who make it to Chile often live a precarious existence. Haitians, Dominicans and Bolivians live cheek by jowl in tumbledown neighborhoods such as Arica's Cerro Chuno, scraping together a living working in restaurants and mines. Racism and job discrimination is common. 
The 29 countries who refused to sign the UN Migration Pact argue that it undermines their sovereignty.
""People have a right to leave their country when they feel it is right,"" Chilean Foreign Minister Roberto Ampuero told a Senate committee last week. ""But ... they cannot go to any country they want to.""

Garcia Marquez's great niece, Melissa Martinez Garcia, 34, was seized at the end of August by a group of armed men who intercepted her vehicle near the northern city of Santa Marta along the Caribbean coast. They demanded a ransom of $5 million for her release.
""In a coordinated operation by the armed forces, Melissa Martinez Garcia was freed,"" Duque told reporters. ""It was an impeccable operation of human and strategic intelligence for several months to preserve her life.""
Martinez Garcia is the granddaughter of Jaime Garcia Marquez, the brother of the writer, who died in 2014 at 87.
The outgoing director of the national police force, General Jorge Hernando Nieto, told local radio that Martinez Garcia had been taken by a group of former right-wing paramilitaries.
He said 15 people were captured during the rescue operation.
Kidnapping for ransom has been a frequent source of funding during Colombia's armed conflict, which has lasted more than 50 years and killed over 260,000 people. Leftist guerrillas, crime gangs and right-wing paramilitaries have seized thousands over the years.
Common criminals also kidnap people in exchange for ransoms in the millions in the Andean nation, which registered about 3,000 kidnappings in the 1990s.
In 2017, 193 kidnappings were reported, according to the Ministry of Defense.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's main opposition group promised on Monday to remove curbs on free speech and the media and to rein in the police if it unseats Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from her decade-long rule in this month's national election.
Presenting its manifesto in Dhaka, the Jaitya Oikya Front, or National Unity Front alliance, also pledged to bring in a series of checks and balances on central government power. 
It would create an upper house of parliament, introduce a rule that would bar a prime minister from running for office for more than two consecutive terms, and give the central bank more autonomy.
The alliance also promised to raise the minimum wage of garment workers and freeze gas and electricity prices for the first year that it is in power.
Hasina, who is Bangladesh's longest-ruling leader and is seeking a third straight term in the election scheduled for Dec. 30, has been accused by the opposition and human rights groups of becoming increasingly authoritarian. 
CRACKED DOWN ON DISSENT
While she is credited for improving the economy and has been lauded internationally for providing refuge to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence and persecution in Myanmar, she has also cracked down on dissent, stifled the opposition and introduced a tough new media law.
With less than two weeks to go before the polls, the opposition alliance has complained of harassment.
""It is doubtful that the election will be free and fair,"" said Kamal Hossain, leader of the alliance that includes the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
""In every district our candidates are being arrested...in the last 50 years of my political life, I have never seen such a situation."" 
Clashes have broken out in several parts of Bangladesh since campaigning officially began last week, and at least six BNP candidates have been injured while they were out seeking votes. The party has called for the army to take over to restore order. 
The BNP alleges scores of its workers have been detained by police on fictitious charges, or even killed, under Hasina’s rule, especially over the past few months, and say that the Election Commission has turned a blind eye. 
Asaduzzaman Khan, minister for home affairs and also a senior leader of Hasina's ruling Awami League, denied the allegations.
""No workers of BNP have been detained or arrested without an arrest warrant or specific charges, the question of killing or murder does not arise at all,"" Khan told Reuters.
The alliance said it would form an independent commission to investigate suspected politically motivated cases under Hasina's rule and punish police involved in them. It also promised to stop disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Khan also called those allegations baseless
""WAR CRIMINALS""
The BNP has close links to the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country’s largest Islamic party, many of whose members have been convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death or life imprisonment under Hasina’s rule. 
Bangladesh's Election Commission scrapped Jamaat's registration following a Supreme Court judgment. Even so, at least 22 members of the party are contesting in the upcoming polls under the BNP banner, and three as independent candidates.
Hossain has said the alliance has no links to the Jamaat, but Hasina has accused the alliance for fielding ""war criminals"". 
The media policy perhaps goes further than most in rolling back Hasina's recent moves.

""There will be no direct or indirect control on mass media, the manifesto said.

President Ivan Duque, who took office in August, has conditioned peace talks to the ELN suspending hostilities, releasing all hostages and locating its fighters in specific geographical area before demobilizing. 
The rebel group, accused of financing its war through kidnapping, extortion, drug trafficking and illegal mining, began peace negotiations with the government of former President Juan Manuel Santos, but Duque postponed the talks until it agrees to his terms. The ELN has so far refused the conditions.
""We will carry out a cessation of offensive operations from December 23, 2018, to January 3, 2019, to contribute to a climate of tranquility at Christmas and the New Year,"" the ELN said in a statement on its social networks.
""The ELN remains committed to the search for a political solution to the conflict and thus we agree with those who are determined for a peace with changes,"" said the ELN, which became the country's largest rebel group after the peace agreement signed in 2016 with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2018 08:08AM ET</span>",Turkey revives ghosts of Gezi protests as elections loom,"By Daren Butler
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Three years after she was acquitted over her role in Turkey's Gezi Park protests, Mucella Yapici was called in last month by police to face more questions about the unrest that had posed a direct challenge to the authority of President Tayyip Erdogan.
Yapici is one of dozens who were involved in demonstrations that brought millions onto Turkey's streets in 2013 to protest against the government and who are now caught up in a renewed investigation, raising concerns among Turkey's Western allies.
Opposition figures say the renewed crackdown is designed to polarize public opinion and rally support for Erdogan's AK Party ahead of local elections in March, when it could face tight races in some of Turkey's largest cities.
""It is a political maneuver,"" Yapici said of her questioning two weeks ago. ""We were tried in Turkish courts and acquitted. And the state did not appeal,"" she told Reuters, adding that authorities had produced no new evidence.
The moves by prosecutors and police have been accompanied by renewed and sharp criticism of the Gezi protesters by Erdogan.
Such attacks have been a hallmark of his election triumphs since he first won power 16 years ago. But they also risk alienating allies such as the European Union and United States at a time when Turkey is trying to resolve diplomatic disputes that helped fuel a currency crisis this year.
Yapici, a 67-year-old architect whose activist group Taksim Solidarity was at the heart of the Gezi protests, was one of 26 defendants acquitted in April 2015 of charges carrying jail terms of up to 13 years.
She said the investigations were an attempt to rewrite social memory of the protests. 
""They are trying to blacken the clear celebration of democracy that was Gezi in the minds of children, youths and society,"" Yapici said. 
She has not been charged again, but last month more than a dozen people were detained as part of an investigation into the Gezi protests and prosecutors have issued warrants for a prominent journalist and an actor, both living abroad.
""Five years later the prosecutor has suddenly remembered the Gezi resistance and started a new witch hunt,"" the Berlin-based journalist, Can Dundar, said after details of his arrest warrant emerged on Dec. 5.
A senior Turkish official said the Gezi incidents were solely a matter for the courts.
""Of course the government does not make any requests in this respect,"" he told Reuters. ""Ultimately courts and prosecutors take various steps in cases based on the evidence which they obtain.""
""It is not a matter of the incidents specially being put onto the agenda five years later,"" he added. ""Ultimately the judiciary will take up these dossiers and reach the necessary verdicts.""    
""PAY THE PRICE""
According to government estimates, 3.6 million people took part in the Gezi protests, which began with a small demonstration against the redevelopment of a park near Istanbul's Taksim Square (NYSE:SQ). It evolved into a demonstration of wide-ranging discontent with the government.
Over the summer of 2013 the chant ""everywhere is Taksim, everywhere is resistance"" resounded in daily protests across Turkey, with many banging pots and pans at their windows every evening. Nine people, eight young protesters and a police officer, were killed in the unrest, and 5,000 injured.
Three years later, following a failed coup against Erdogan, authorities launched a sweeping roundup in which 77,000 people have so far been jailed pending trial. A two-year state of emergency was lifted in July, but arrests linked to the coup attempt have continued alongside the revived Gezi investigations.
Prosecutors have prepared an indictment targeting 120 people over their participation in a Gezi-related protest in Ankara and an investigation into 600 others is continuing, state media says. Pro-government journalists say the probe will widen.
Erdogan blames the protests on billionaire philanthropist George Soros and Osman Kavala, a well-known Turkish civil society leader. Kavala has been in jail for a year awaiting trial on charges of seeking to overthrow the government.
""They are still in solidarity, the operatives of the project to make our country surrender,"" Erdogan said last month in a speech denouncing the two men. Kavala was directed by ""the famous Hungarian Jew, Soros ... who assigns people to divide nations"", he said.
Two weeks ago the Soros-funded Open Society Foundation announced it was closing down in Turkey because it could no longer work there.
Responding to last month's arrest of 13 academics and civil society representatives linked to Kavala, EU commissioner Johannes Hahn said Brussels was troubled by the arrest of journalists, human rights defenders and civil society activists.
""Criminal and judicial proceedings must be based on the presumption of innocence,"" he said after talks in Ankara with Turkey's foreign minister.
""HATRED AND REVENGE""
The leader of the main opposition CHP party, which is challenging Erdogan's AK Party for control of Istanbul and Ankara in the March elections, has said there are no grounds for the latest protest-related arrests.
""If you throw innocent people in jail and then go and see where you can create evidence, there is no justice there. There is a feeling of hatred and revenge,"" Kemal Kilicdaroglu said.
Kilicdaroglu's party say the Gezi arrests are an attempt to divert attention from a slowing economy, high inflation and rising unemployment - significant weak points in Erdogan's election plans after years of stellar economic growth. 
By focusing on perceived security threats, Erdogan could rally support. A survey for the Center for American Progress this year found that around half the public approved of the government's response to the failed coup in 2016, including 80 percent of AK Party voters.
The challenge, however, will be significant. 
Although he strengthened his presidential powers after elections in June, support for Erdogan's AK Party fell to 43 percent, meaning he needed an alliance with nationalists for a parliamentary majority.
A survey by pollster Metropoll last month showed his personal approval had fallen below 40 percent, having been around 50 percent ahead of the June elections.
Aykut Erdogdu, a CHP lawmaker for Istanbul, said trust in Erdogan was declining due to economic hardship.

As things stand ""they know they will lose the local elections. Hence it is necessary to polarize the people,"" Erdogdu wrote on Twitter. ""They are setting up their election stall using Gezi.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Monday jailed for life a leader of the main opposition Congress party for his role in anti-Sikh riots that erupted after the 1984 murder of the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, and killed nearly 3,000 people.
The ruling party hailed the conviction of the former Congress member of parliament, Sajjan Kumar, as a confirmation of justice, just months before a general election when it will face off against the Congress, now led by Gandhi's grandson.
Anti-Sikh riots broke out in Delhi after the assassination of Prime Minster Gandhi, of the Congress party, by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984.
Most of those killed in one of India's bloodiest outbreaks of rioting since independence, were Sikhs, who make up about 2 percent of Hindu-majority India's 1.3 billion people.
At the time, Congress supporters were widely suspected of egging on the mobs.
The Delhi High Court said Kumar, at the time serving the first of three terms in parliament, was convicted of criminal conspiracy and for delivering ""provocative speeches instigating violence against Sikhs"".
The court ordered him to surrender by Dec. 31. 
Kumar, who pleaded not guilty, was not available for comment. His lawyers said they would appeal the conviction in the Supreme Court.
Gandhi's assassination was in revenge for her decision to send the army in against Sikh separatist militants holed up in the Golden Temple — Sikhism’s holiest shrine — in the northern city of Amritsar.
Hundreds of people were killed in the army assault, including the leader of Sikh militants, and the temple was badly damaged.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as well as some Congress leaders welcomed the verdict.
""A delayed vindication of justice,"" Arun Jaitley, India's finance minister and senior BJP leader, said in a tweet. 
""The Congress and the Gandhi family legacy will continue to pay for the sins of 1984 riots.""
Gandhi's grandson, Rahul, is president of Congress and is likely to be Modi's main challenger in a general election due by May.
Rahul Gandhi, heir to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty which ruled for decades, has denounced the horror of the riots and said some Congress members who may have been involved had been punished.
""It's wrong to politicize this matter or try to take political benefit from it,"" Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters.
""Various legal process have been going on for around 20 years in this case. In many cases convictions get overturned during appeals.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - The wives of four of China's most prominent rights lawyers and activists shaved their heads on Monday in protest over what they called the ""persecution"" of their husbands by the government.
Since taking office in 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has overseen a crackdown on dissent, with hundreds of rights lawyers and activists being detained, arrested and jailed.
Four wives of lawyers detained during a July 2015 sweep known as the 709 crackdown gathered in the central park of a sleepy Beijing apartment complex and cut off their hair in front of neighbors and a small group of invited foreign journalists. 
The women took turns shaving each other's heads, placing the hair in see-through plastic boxes alongside pictures of them with their husbands, before heading to China's Supreme People's Court to petition over their husbands' treatment.
Li Wenzu, who says she has been unable to visit her husband, rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang, since he went missing in the 2015 crackdown, told reporters that the act was to protest against the way her husband's case was being handled.
Li said judges in Wang's trial had unlawfully delayed proceedings and prevented her from appointing a lawyer of her choosing.
Wang is being held in Tianjin on suspicion of subverting state power, but both Li and seven lawyers she has appointed to try and represent Wang have been unable to visit him, she said.
""We can go hairless, but you cannot be lawless,"" they announced at the end of the ceremony, a pun in Chinese, as the words for ""hair"" and ""law"" sound similar.
Requests for comment faxed to China's Supreme People's Court and the Tianjin Number 2 Intermediate People's Court, where Wang's case is set to be heard at an unknown date, went unanswered.
Li, Wang and other family members of rights lawyers and activists who have been detained or jailed have in recent years taken up their loved ones' causes and attempting to keep pressuring the government into allowing their release.

The authorities have responded using ""soft"" detention measures, such as house arrest, to keep family members from getting their message out, rights activists have said.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - When Japanese recruiters plucked Liu Xueqin from her provincial hometown 33 years ago to work in an electronics factory in Shenzhen, she was happy to get a well-paid job and unaware of the small role she would play in China's dramatic economic rise.
In 1983, Japanese electronics maker Sanyo set up a factory in the newly established Special Economic Zone in Shekou, at the southern tip of Shenzhen, the city whose transformation is most closely linked with the 40 years since the country began moving toward a market economy, a milestone it celebrates this week. 
Since former leader Deng Xiaoping launched China on its ""Reform and Opening Up"" path in 1978, the southern city has transformed from a market town of less than 50,000 people into a skyscraper-studded high-tech hub that is home to roughly 12 million people and locally grown tech giants like Huawei [HWT.UL], ZTE (HK:0763) and Tencent.
""I came here simply because I wanted to make some money, to improve my life. I was jobless and wasting my time at home,"" Liu, now a 50-year-old retiree, said during a recent visit to the former Sanyo factory building, where an exhibition has been set up to mark the anniversary.
At Sanyo, Liu and her co-workers churned out cassette recorders, pocket calculators and other gadgets, helping to make ""Made in China"" a household label for electronics. At its peak, the Shekou factory employed more than 5,000 people.
For Liu and her fellow migrant workers, Sanyo became their life and Shenzhen their new home. Liu is among the many who stayed, starting a family.
""We celebrated birthdays every month and went on holiday trips twice a year, so Sanyo was like our big family,"" said Huang Huiqun, 54, a former colleague and friend of Liu.
Last year, Shenzhen's economic output surpassed that of its neighbor, Hong Kong, for the first time.
""When we arrived, there was only one road in Shenzhen, Shennan boulevard. It was the only road to Shekou. Sanyo was the only factory there. And all the buildings were low, only 4-5 floors tall. There were no skyscrapers,"" recalled Huang, who was also visiting the old factory building.
Shekou has kept up with Shenzhen's boom and turned into a trendy neighborhood, popular among expatriates and affluent Chinese. Manufacturers have been pushed out, including Sanyo, which closed the Shekou factory in 2009.
Repurposed for the modern era, the former factory is now called E-Cool and houses designers, digital start-ups, luxury boutiques and cafes.

""Looking back, the products we made were ancient and outdated,"" said Huang, who put her daughter through university. ""What we have now is definitely more complex and advanced. Now is the age of internet.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand will soon hold its first election since the military seized power in a 2014 coup and many hope the vote will return Southeast Asia's second-largest economy to democracy.
The government lifted a ban on political activity when it announced the Feb. 24 election last week, but critics say the junta has taken several steps to remain in power after the vote, casting doubt on how credible the poll will be.
""We have seen a systematic manipulation and distortion of the electoral process, of the will of the people, starting from the constitution,"" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst at Chulalongkorn University, referring to the military-drafted constitution that was publicly ratified in 2016, two years after the coup. 
""The reason this (election) has a crooked feel more than others is because it pretends to be democratic, clean and fair when it is completely rigged,"" Thitinan said.
The military government has denied accusations it has been engineering a path to prolong its stay in power.
""If the government wants to extend its power beyond this point then what would be the point of holding an election? This is the roadmap that we have promised to the people,"" said government spokesman Puttipong Punnakan.
But one or more military-backed parties are likely to be in the fray, pitted against the anti-establishment populists led by the Shinawatra family and some smaller centrist parties. 
Some critics say the regime has tried to influence everything from electoral boundaries in favor of pro-junta parties and hand-picking the entire upper house of parliament, down to plans to re-design ballot papers to remove party names and symbols attached to candidates - which will be likely to confuse voters.
The Election Commission is expected to finalize ballot design later this week.
Members of major opposition parties like the Shinawatra-linked Puea Thai Party and the new, millennial-oriented Future Forward Party are among hundreds of government critics who have been slapped with lawsuits under the computer crimes act. 
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has made his long-term political ambitions clear, even going so far as to set up a party with four cabinet ministers, the Palang Pracharat Party (PPRP). 
At least two smaller parties have also declared their support for Prayuth.
One senior government official admitted the aim of the PPRP was to keep Prayuth in office, saying, ""or else everything that this government has done would be wasted"".

Thailand has lurched between civilian and military governments for decades, and has among the highest number of coups of any country - 13 successful ones - since 1932 when the kingdom became a constitutional monarchy.
Since 2001, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his family's allies have regularly rallied the masses for support and today remain a major political force that irks the royalist establishment.
Thaksin-linked political parties, known for their populist social welfare policies like a generous rice subsidy scheme and universal healthcare, have won every general election since 2001. 
Puea Thai faces increasing pressure from the junta which has launched legal cases against members of the Shinawatra clan and pro-Thaksin politicians, and threatened to disband the party pending an Election Commission investigation. 
Still, Puea Thai and several offshoots remain optimistic about their chances.
""We have been under pressure like this before and we have prevailed so this time it is not so disheartening,"" party spokeswoman Laddawan Wongsiwong told Reuters. 
""Puea Thai is not fighting alone against dictatorship."" 
The message is an attractive one for groups like the Future Forward Party, which are likely to fall into an anti-junta coalition appealing to millennials disillusioned with a semi-authoritarian regime and years of instability.
KINGMAKER
Some political groups remain unaligned with either side, the biggest of which is the Democrat Party of former premier Abhisit Vejjajiva, who hopes to offer voters a third alternative.
""The people get to decide the direction of the country in this election,"" Abhisit told Reuters last month.
""Do they want what they have now, or will they go back to the way Puea Thai ran things, or will they be more interested in what the Democrats can offer?"" 
Titipol Phakdeewanich, dean of the faculty of political science at Ubon Ratchathani University, believes Abhisit could play the role of kingmaker, citing his ""willingness to compromise with the military"" and historic rivalry with Thaksin.
No party is likely to muster enough votes on its own to control a parliamentary majority in the 500-seat lower house, pointing to a probable scenario of a coalition government. Nominating a candidate for prime minister requires the support of the majority in both houses of parliament.

The military government is currently in the process of appointing members to the 250-seat upper house of parliament.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Indian police detained separatist leaders in the disputed Kashmir region on Monday and sealed off roads in an effort to stifle protests against the killing of civilians on the weekend.
Unrest has intensified over recent weeks in the Muslim-majority region at the heart of decades of hostility between India and Pakistan, and seven civilians were killed on Saturday when security forces opened fire at a protest over the killing of three militants.
Separatists leaders Mohammad Yasin Malik and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said they were detained as they marched toward an army headquarters in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar. Another leader, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, was under house arrest, police said.
""Indian troops are killing Kashmiris,"" Malik told reporters as police in riot gear took him away in a white vehicle. ""For the last many years they are on a killing spree.""
A senior police official, who declined to be identified, said Malik and Farooq would be released ""once the situation stabilizes"".
A spokesman for India's Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi said he had no comment.
Police and para-military forces put up barricades in various parts of Srinagar, including on roads leading to the army headquarters, and were patrolling in force.
The army warned the population against being used to make trouble.
""Army advises people not to fall prey to such designs of anti-national forces,"" the army said in a statement late on Sunday.
""It's an attempt to pit the civilian population against the security forces"".
One soldier was killed in the Saturday violence.
'DIALOGUE, NOT VIOLENCE'
Shops, government offices and banks were closed in Srinagar and a nearby district and traffic was off the roads. Authorities have also shut down mobile internet and train services.
Pakistan, which like India, claims Kashmir in full but rules it in part, condemned the Saturday killings.
""Only dialogue and not violence and killings will resolve this conflict,"" Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said, adding that his country would raise India's ""human rights violations"" at the United Nations.
Hindu-majority India accuses Pakistan of training and arming separatist militants operating in Kashmir.
Pakistan denies that saying it only offers political support to the people of the Muslim region who are being denied their rights by India's security forces.
Indian forces say they have killed 242 militants this year in the region, while 101 civilians and 82 members of the security forces have been killed, making it the bloodiest year in more than a decade.
Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said Indian authorities should investigate and prosecute those responsible for ""indiscriminate use of force"".

""Security forces are aware that villagers gather, protest during gunfights with Kashmir militants and have responsibility to ensure civilians are not at risk,"" she said in a tweet.

ATHENS (Reuters) - A powerful blast smashed windows and wrecked offices at Greece's SKAI TV in Athens on Monday in what officials called an attack on democracy. No one was injured.
SKAI is one of Greece's biggest TV stations and part of a media group which includes a radio station and is affiliated with the leading daily newspaper, Kathimerini.
Police said a makeshift explosive device went off near the SKAI building at 2:35 a.m. following warning calls to two media outlets. On its website, the station said windows were smashed from the first to the sixth floors. 
""The material damage is big on almost all floors, with the biggest seen on the third and fourth floors, where employees' offices are located,"" it said. 
""The picture is disheartening. Suspended ceilings collapsed to the floor, glass windows broke to pieces.""
There was no immediate claim of responsibility. 
Small-scale attacks on businesses, state buildings, police and politicians are not uncommon in Greece, which has a long history of political violence.
Speaking to SKAI from the scene, Greece's Citizens' Protection Minister Olga Gerovassili said the attack had targeted democracy. 
""Democracy, however, is shielded and of course not threatened,"" she said.
Journalists presenting SKAI's morning show were broadcasting live outside the building. 
Its police correspondent said the device was estimated to have contained about 5 kg of explosives and placed in a narrow alleyway close to the building.
Video footage broadcast on local media showed a cloud of smoke emerging from the building after a loud blast. Footage from within the building showed windows blown out, with desks in offices strewn with glass.

""Press freedom will not be terrorized by anyone,"" New Democracy party spokeswoman Maria Spyraki told SKAI.

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>","Saudi Arabia denounces U.S. Senate resolutions on Khashoggi, Yemen","RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Monday denounced U.S. Senate resolutions calling for an end to U.S. military support for the war in Yemen and blaming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying they were based on unsubstantiated claims.
The votes last Thursday were a rare rebuke to President Donald Trump, but largely symbolic. To become law, they would need to pass the House of Representatives, whose Republican leaders have blocked any legislation intended to rebuke the Saudis.
""The Kingdom categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs, any and all accusations, in any manner, that disrespect its leadership ... and any attempts to undermine its sovereignty or diminish its stature,"" a foreign ministry statement said.
Khashoggi, a royal insider who became a critic of Prince Mohammed and began writing for the Washington Post after moving to the United States last year, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in early October. Saudi officials have rejected accusations that the crown prince ordered his death.
The murder has sparked global outrage and damaged the international reputation of 33-year-old Prince Mohammed, the kingdom's de facto leader, who is pushing economic and social changes in the world's top oil exporter.
Saudi Arabia has also come under increased scrutiny for civilian deaths and a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, where it support the internationally-recognized government against Iranian-aligned Houthis in a nearly four-year-old civil war.
At U.N.-mediated talks in Sweden last week, the warring parties agreed to a local ceasefire to try to avert more bloodshed in the port of Hodeidah, which is vital for food and aid supplies.
Opponents of the Senate resolutions want to maintain the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, which they consider an essential counterweight in the Middle East to Iran.
Administration officials also see Saudi support as a linchpin for an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan yet to be disclosed by the Trump administration. And they have argued that ending U.S. support could complicate Yemen peace efforts.

The Saudi statement said the kingdom ""hopes that it is not drawn into domestic political debates in the United States of America, to avoid any ramifications on the ties between the two countries that could have significant negative impacts on this important strategic relationship.""

Video posted on social media showed flames shooting up into the sky and debris-strewn streets.
""I heard a bang which sounded like thunder, and my condo was shaken,"" a man who lived nearby was quoted as saying by the Japan Times.

U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said on Thursday that China's quest for more power in Africa was evident in nations like Zambia, where China was poised to take over utility company Zesco to collect the $6-10 billion debt.
Zambian presidential spokesman Amos Chanda told Reuters that China was not planning to take over Zesco and that the figure of between $6-10 billion given by Bolton was wrong. Zambia's total external debt was now $9.7 billion including $3.1 billion owed to China, he said.
Speaking in Beijing at a daily news briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said this wasn't the first time a U.S. official had been caught out on this kind of issue, though she gave no details on that.
""I hope the they can learn a lesson and reflect on things, and going forward not blurt things out again,"" Hua said, without elaborating.
Bolton had called the business practices of China and Russia in Africa ""corrupt"" and ""predatory"" and said the United States planned to counter their economic and political influence.
In June, Zambia decided to delay all planned borrowing indefinitely, slowing down the accumulation of new debt amid worries about the risk of debt distress.
President Edgar Lungu said last month Zambia was committed to improving the transparency of its debt management and would ensure that debt levels remain sustainable.
The IMF rejected Zambia's borrowing plans in February, saying they risked making its debt load harder to sustain.

Finance Minister Margaret Mwanakatwe said last month the government plans to send a delegation to China by the end of this year to discuss Zambia's debt and debt restructuring.

OTTAWA/BEIJING (Reuters) - Canadian diplomats gained consular access on Sunday to the second of two men detained by China over the past week, Canada's foreign ministry said in a statement that gave few details, as China said it was ensuring their rights were protected.
John McCallum, Canada's ambassador to Beijing, met Michael Spavor, the Canadian ministry said. Spavor and Michael Kovrig were both picked up after Canada arrested a senior Chinese executive on a U.S. extradition request.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - who said on Friday the detentions were unacceptable - told CTV his government was taking the situation very seriously.
""We have engaged with the Chinese officials to determine what exactly conditions are they being detained under? Why are they being detained?"" he said in an interview aired on Sunday. McCallum met Kovrig for the first time in Friday.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that China should free the two men. China says they are both suspected of engaging in activities that endangered national security, but has given no details.
Speaking in Beijing on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China and Canada had ""smooth"" consular communication on the cases of the two Canadians and confirmed China had arranged consular access for both of them.
""At the same time, the lawful rights of these two Canadians have been guaranteed,"" Hua told a daily news briefing, without elaborating on where they are being held, under what exact charges and under what conditions.
Spavor, a businessman, and Kovrig, a former diplomat now working for a think-tank, were detained after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Dec 1.
U.S. prosecutors accuse Meng of misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder, has said she is innocent.
China has demanded Canada free Meng and threatened unspecified consequences if it does not.
Hua said it did not matter what ""grandiose pretexts"" Canada and the United States came up with, their case against Meng ""showed contempt for the rule of law"" and people around the world were ridiculing it for them.
'CORRECT MISTAKES'
Many Canadians have been writing to the Chinese embassy or writing open criticism in Canadian media to express their opposition to the government's ""irrational, illegal methods"", she added.
""The Chinese side strongly urges Canada to immediately correct its mistakes, and release the detained Chinese citizen.""
A Canadian court last week granted Meng bail.
If a Canadian judge rules the case against Meng is strong enough, Canada's justice minister must next decide whether to extradite her to the United States. 
If so, Meng would face U.S. charges of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, with a maximum sentence of 30 years for each charge. 
On Monday, influential Chinese state-backed newspaper the Global Times said in an editorial that an escalation in the dispute with Canada could be coming.
""In the struggle with Canada, China needs to prepare for the possibility of conflict escalation,"" it said. 
""Beijing must take the contest seriously and maximize the support of international public opinion, leaving Western media no smear to slander its counterattacks as 'degradation of China's opening-up'.""
Trudeau told CTV that Canada would continue trying to build up trading ties with China.

""We need to do so in a way that is true to our values and stands up for Canadians' interests, and getting that balance right is complex. (It) has been made more difficult by recent trends,"" he said.

The decision overturns a 2017 ruling in which a court said the man could not adopt the boy because he was born by a surrogate in the United States through in-vitro fertilization - a procedure not available to unmarried couples in Singapore.
The ruling also comes amid a renewed public push to review Singapore's colonial-era law under which sex between consenting males carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail, after a repeal of a similar law in India this year. 
""We attribute significant weight to the concern not to violate the public policy against the formation of same-sex family units on account of its rational connection to the present dispute and the degree to which this policy would be violated should an adoption order be made,"" chief justice Sundaresh Menon said. 
""However...we think that neither of these reasons is sufficiently powerful to enable us to ignore the statutory imperative to promote the welfare of the child.""
The man, in a homosexual relationship with a partner, paid $200,000 for a woman to carry his child through in-vitro fertilization in the United States after he had learned he was unlikely to be able to adopt a child in Singapore as a gay man.
The district court which initially rejected the application in December 2017 said that the man had attempted to walk ""through the back door of the system when the front door was firmly shut"".

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2018 01:11AM ET</span>","Bowing out as president, Congo's Kabila raises prospect of a return act","By Giulia Paravicini, Aaron Ross and David Lewis
KINSHASA (Reuters) - A month before his scheduled departure after nearly two decades as Congo's president, Joseph Kabila received a procession of foreign reporters at his heavily guarded riverside palace for a rare series of interviews.
If the timing suggested a valedictory, the 47-year-old leader's words indicated otherwise. He vowed to remain in politics and, in one interview after another, left open the possibility of running again in 2023 when the clock resets on presidential term limits.
""My role will be to make sure that we don't go back to square one, square one meaning where we found the Congo 22 years ago,"" he told Reuters inside an ornate reception room with high ceilings and sweeping views of the churning Congo River.
""In politics, in life, you shouldn't rule out anything,"" he said when asked about a potential return. ""There are still other chapters to write."" 
In the 18 years since a youthful, clean-shaven Kabila succeeded his slain father, Laurent, the now bulked-up president sporting a billowy gray beard has traced an unlikely trajectory from accidental and apparently reluctant leader to the defining Congolese figure of his time.
Whether the vote due on Dec. 23 brings down the curtain on the tumultuous Kabila era, which began when Laurent seized power in 1997, or triggers a new phase in which Joseph becomes the power behind the throne of his preferred successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, remains unclear.
It depends in part on how the Congolese reflect on his rule.
There were early accomplishments - ending a regional war and holding the first open presidential elections - but also incessant conflict, lethal crackdowns on pro-democracy protesters and corruption that the government acknowledges siphoned off billions of dollars of potential revenue.
Foreign investment has propelled Democratic Republic of Congo to the status of Africa's top copper producer and the world's leading miner of cobalt, a crucial component of electric car batteries, but militia violence has persisted in the east.
Denis Mukwege, the Congolese doctor who shared this year's Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, said Kabila had a right to remain in politics but hoped voters would remember his broken promises.
""None of the elements needed to install a real democracy have been made during his time in power,"" he told Reuters.
PULLING THE STRINGS
Kabila's critics and some analysts say concerns about his personal security – his assassinated father's mausoleum stands below the presidential palace - and the fortune reportedly amassed by his family could account for a seeming reluctance to cede power.
A report last year by a research group at New York University found his family's businesses are likely worth tens of millions of dollars. Kabila has called such reports ""stupidity"".
He did not specifically respond to a Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/congo-passports that showed nearly a third of the purchase price of Congolese passports goes to a company in the United Arab Emirates whose owner is believed to be a close relative of the president.
Even if Shadary, a former interior minister who many analysts say was chosen for his loyalty and lack of an independent political base, beats his two main rivals, Kabila has reason to worry about his ability to pull the strings.
He need only look next door to Angola, where President Joao Lourenco quickly marginalized Jose Eduardo dos Santos, his powerful predecessor who ruled for 38 years, by accusing family members of corruption.
""Kabila saw what happened in Angola. That's why he chose the person who is the most loyal and, above all, the least threatening to his personal power,"" said Manya Riche, who advised Kabila from 2008 to 2011. 
Referring to an arrangement in which Vladimir Putin remained Russia's dominant leader as prime minister until he could run for president again, she said: ""This isn't Russia. At a certain point here, it's the chief who's in the chair who is the chief.""
COMING TO POWER
Kabila was born in 1971 in eastern Congo in the bush headquarters of his father's rebellion against long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko but spent most of his early years in neighboring Tanzania.  
He returned to Congo to take part in Laurent's Rwandan and Ugandan-backed successful march on the capital Kinshasa. A period of military training in China followed and Joseph was back as army chief when a bodyguard shot his father in 2001.
The country he inherited at 29 was in disarray, fragmented between government and rebel territories, with tens of thousands of people dying each month from conflict, hunger and disease.
A former U.S. official who met Kabila during his first trip to Washington that year described the shy, awkward leader as a ""deer in the headlights"".
With his halting French and virtually non-existent Lingala - the language of the capital and the army - he struggled to connect with many Congolese. But his political instincts were surprisingly good.
He courted Western powers such as the United States and France, which his father's anti-colonial rhetoric had alienated. He passed a liberalized mining code that attracted foreign investment. He revived a stalled peace process, leading to a 2003 power-sharing deal that kept him in the presidency even though rebels remained active in the east.
""He managed to run the country, more or less,"" said Azarias Ruberwa, a rebel leader who joined the power-sharing administration and is now a government minister.
Kabila won both rounds of voting in elections held in 2006, which were generally viewed as fair, as well as the bouts of fighting that erupted after results were announced. 
'LESS TOLERANT'
Those victories, followed by another vote in 2011 marred by widespread allegations of fraud, led to changes in his leadership style, according to people close to him.
""The president became less tolerant of the West,"" a former advisor said on condition of anonymity. ""He saw them as imposing their ideas on him.""
After the death in 2012 of Augustin Katumba Mwanke, his closest advisor and confidant, Kabila moved more assertively to chart his own course.
Kabila rarely speaks in public and is driven by mistrust of almost everyone outside a tight circle of family that includes his twin sister, Jaynet, and younger brother, Zoe, people who have worked closely with him said.
Public frustration with his government mounted as economic growth fueled by copper production failed to deliver a semblance of infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa's biggest country, much of it covered by rainforest and only accessible by barge or motorcycle.
Kabila would occasionally tell collaborators he was frustrated by his inability to transform Congo into something more like other African countries he visited.
Although Kabila put most of the blame on the brutal legacy of former colonial power Belgium, Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi, a current advisor, said he sought to change ""the Congolese mentality from people who like songs and dance and high life to people concentrated on hard work"".
STATE OF SIEGE
As the vote to replace Kabila at the end of his two official terms was repeatedly pushed back - officially due to conflict and logistical challenges - opponents accused him of seeking ways to cling to power and tried to organize protests.
Muted concerns from Western capitals over the flawed 2011 vote gave way to vocal criticism of alleged corruption and the killing of protesters.
Shadary is under European Union sanctions due to crackdowns by security forces. Deals with Israeli billionaire mining investor Dan Gertler, who American prosecutors say paid Congolese officials, including Kabila, more than $100 million in bribes, have received particular scrutiny. Kabila denies ever taking a bribe, and Gertler denies paying them.
Kabila left his options open for as long as he could. Shadary was nominated hours before the deadline to register candidates.
Whether it was Kabila's intention all along to step down, as allies say, or it was a concession to domestic and international pressure, the president's imminent departure thrusts him and his country into the unknown.
For now, Kabila appears serene.

""Look at my face. Do I look worried?"" he told Reuters. ""I am not worried.""

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>","U.N., Palestinians launch humanitarian appeal after funding cuts","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The United Nations and the Palestinian Authority on Monday appealed for $350 million in humanitarian relief for Palestinians next year, saying that they needed more but had to be realistic in the face of ""record-low"" funding.
The 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan outlined 203 projects to be carried out by 88 different groups, including U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations.
The plan prioritized 1.4 million Palestinians most in need of food, healthcare, shelter, water and sanitation, said Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and East Jerusalem.
""Humanitarian actors are facing unprecedented challenges, including record-low funding and a rise in attacks to delegitimize humanitarian action,"" he said in a joint statement issued on Monday, ahead of the appeal's launch in Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Although ""much more assistance is needed"", McGoldrick said, the plan was ""reflecting what we can realistically accomplish in this highly constrained context"".
Over the past year, the United States has slashed its funding to the Palestinians, including to the U.N. agency that provides services to 5 million Palestinian refugees.
The United States promised $365 million to the agency in 2018, but paid only a first installment of $60 million before announcing in August that it would halt all future donations.
The move was widely seen as a means of pressuring the Palestinian leadership to enter peace negotiations with Israel.
The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem - territories that Israel captured and occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. 
U.S.-brokered peace talks between the sides collapsed in 2014 and a bid by U.S. President Donald Trump to restart them has so far showed little progress.
Around 77 percent of the funds sought in the 2019 plan would go to Gaza, the appeal organizers said, because the densely populated coastal strip faced a ""dire humanitarian situation"" after years of an Israeli-led blockade, internal Palestinian political divisions and casualties from demonstrations and recurring hostilities.

""The humanitarian context in the oPt (Occupied Palestinian Territories) is still deteriorating due to the Israeli occupation violations in a time of lack of resources and declining funds because of the politicization of the humanitarian aid,” Palestinian Social Development Minister Ibrahim Al-Shaer said in the statement.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A renewed search for the cockpit voice recorder of a Lion Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29 has been delayed for two days due to bad weather hampering the arrival of a specialized ship, the airline said. 
The crash, the world's first of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX jet, killed all 189 people on board and the main wreckage and second 'black box' were not recovered in an initial search. 
Lion Air said in a statement that it was funding a 38 billion rupiah ($2.6 million) search effort using the offshore supply ship MPV Everest, which had been expected to arrive in the search area on Monday.
Bad weather and heavy rain at the port of Johor Bahru in Malaysia interfered with the equipment and crew mobilization process, delaying the ship's arrival at the crash site until Wednesday, the airline said late on Sunday.
Lion Air's decision to foot the bill for the search is a rare test of global norms regarding search independence, as such costs are typically paid by governments.
A spokesman for the transportation ministry said its obligation was to fund the investigation. The search for the cockpit voice recorder was the airline's responsibility, he said.
Lion Air on Sunday said the search for the cockpit voice recorder was the ""duty and responsibility"" of Indonesia's transport safety committee. The airline on Monday issued a revised statement removing that reference.
In 2007, efforts to recover the black boxes from a crashed Adam Air jet were delayed due to disagreements between the Indonesian government and the airline over who should bear the cost.
Indonesian investigators said last week that bureaucratic wrangling and funding problems had hampered the search for the Lion Air recorder and they had turned to the airline for help.
Safety experts say it is unusual for one of the parties to help fund an investigation, required by U.N. rules to be independent to ensure trust in any safety recommendations.
There are also broader concerns about resources available for such investigations worldwide, coupled with the risk of agencies being ensnared in legal disputes.
The clock is ticking in the hunt for acoustic pings coming from the L3 Technologies Inc cockpit voice recorder fitted to the jet. It has a 90-day beacon, the manufacturer's online brochure shows.

The flight data recorder was retrieved three days after the crash, providing insight into aircraft systems and crew inputs, although the cause has yet to be determined.

Australian Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said he accepted the resignation of Andrew Broad after New Idea Magazine ran an interview with a woman who alleged she met the married Broad at a Hong Kong restaurant last month.

Amy said she agreed to meet Broad at the Hong Kong Restaurant for dinner but left because she did not like his behavior, New Idea reported.
Broad's resignation came just hours after the government forecast the strongest budget outlook in 10 years, arming Prime Minister Scott Morrison with a war chest large enough to allow for possible tax cuts ahead of an election in less than six months.
Morrison's minority government must return to the polls by May 2019, with opinion polls strongly favoring the opposition Labor to easily win the election.

1095,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","Nigeria's farmer-herder clashes have left over 3,600 people dead, Amnesty says","ABUJA (Reuters) - Clashes in Nigeria between farmers and semi-nomadic herders have killed more than 3,600 people since 2016, most of them this year, Amnesty International said on Monday, in a report documenting an upsurge in violence that could sway the results of February 2019 elections.
Muhammadu Buhari is seeking a second term in those elections, but his campaign has taken a hit from accusations he has soft-pedaled justice for one of the sides responsible for the clashes, the herders, many of whom come from the same Fulani ethnic group as the leader.
The presidency has repeatedly denied those allegations.
The violence is often painted as ethno-religious: chiefly Muslim Fulani herders clashing with mainly Christian farmers. But many experts and politicians say climate change and expanding agriculture are creating competition for land that is pushing the farmers and herders into conflict, regardless of faith or ethnicity.
""The Nigerian authorities' failure to investigate communal clashes and bring perpetrators to justice has fuelled a bloody escalation in the conflict between farmers and herders across the country, resulting in at least 3,641 deaths in the past three years and the displacement of thousands more,"" Amnesty said in a statement.
Nigeria's military and police did not respond to request for comment.
Of the 310 attacks recorded between January 2016 and October 2018, 57 percent were in 2018, the rights group said.
After a quieter wet season in the summer, experts now fear clashes could surge again as the dry season begins, forcing herders to move south towards greener land and water supplies, often across farmland. Any increase in violence would coincide with the February 2019 vote.
""These attacks were well planned and coordinated, with the use of weapons like machine guns and AK-47 rifles,"" said Osai Ojigho, Amnesty's Nigeria director.
""Yet, little has been done by the authorities in terms of prevention, arrests and prosecutions, even when information about the suspected perpetrators was available,"" she said.
The farmer-herder conflict killed six times more people than the war with the Boko Haram insurgency in the first half of 2018, the International Crisis Group said in July.
""In some places, because of the failures of the security forces, competition over resources is used as a pretext to kill and maim along ethnic or religious lines,"" Ojigho said.
""The conflict has also been dangerously politicized by some state government officials who have inflamed tensions by embarking on a blame game along political party lines,"" said Osai Ojigho.

The comments represented a notable hardening in tone from Trudeau, who previously said there would be huge penalties for scrapping the $13 billion agreement for armored vehicles made by the Canadian unit of General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD).
Last month, Trudeau said Canada could freeze the relevant export permits if it concluded the weapons had been misused.
""We are engaged with the export permits to try and see if there is a way of no longer exporting these vehicles to Saudi Arabia,"" Trudeau told CTV. He did not give further details.
Political opponents, citing the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi Arabia's involvement in the Yemen war, insist Trudeau should end the General Dynamics deal, which was negotiated by the previous Conservative government.
Relations between Ottawa and Riyadh have been tense since a diplomatic dispute over human rights earlier this year. Ottawa says it has been consulting allies on what steps to take after Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

""The murder of a journalist is absolutely unacceptable and that's why Canada from the very beginning had been demanding answers and solutions on that,"" said Trudeau.

They said the blast came from a detonated car parked close to the busy market in the city only days after similar explosions hit crowded civilian areas in the towns of Azaz, Rae and al Bab near the border with Turkey under the control of Turkish-backed forces. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said last Wednesday his army would launch in coming days an operation against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, whom his country views as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) - a group classified by the West as a terrorist group and that has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey.
Residents and rebels in the mainly Arab-populated rebel-held northwest suspect the YPG are behind the attacks to sow fear and destabilize their zone before the start of the Turkish offensive against areas they control east of the Euphrates in northern Syria.
""The security situation is unbearable. We walk in the streets in fear and avoid any parked cars fearing it could be detonated,"" Ibrahim Darwish, a resident of Afrin, told Reuters.
The Turkish military helped by its Syrian rebel allies seized Afrin, a mainly Kurdish city, from the YPG in March 2018 in a major offensive into the northwest of Syria where Ankara has carved a de facto buffer zone.

Faria drew thousands of Brazilians and foreigners to his spiritual center in Abadiânia.
Faria denied the accusations on Thursday when he visited his center and spoke to a crowd of followers. His lawyer on Saturday said Faria would turn himself in and file an appeal on Monday.

Faria, 76, could face charges of rape, with a prison sentence of 10 years if convicted, and rape of a vulnerable person, which carries a sentence of up to 15 years.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Several hundred Nicaraguan dissidents set off in a caravan on Sunday from Costa Rica's capital en route to the Nicaraguan border to protest against their president, Daniel Ortega, and encourage his domestic opponents.
More than 300 people have been killed as the Ortega administration has responded, often brutally, to months of anti-government protests and attempted to silence his critics in the Central American nation. 
The caravan of buses and a handful of cars left San Jose at around 6 a.m. local time (1200 GMT). The protesters aim to reach the border town of La Cruz in Guanacaste province, almost 270 kilometers (168 miles) north, by the afternoon. 
""We're going to tell the people they're not alone and tell the government we're still alive and fighting to return to a different Nicaragua,"" said one of the protest organizers, Francisca Ramirez, a leader of Nicaraguan farm workers.
Ramirez said she fled Nicaragua in October after being threatened by pro-government forces.
The so-called ""Caravan for Freedom and Justice"" is due to end with a walk of some 4 kilometers from La Cruz. But it aims to stop short of the Penas Blancas border post to avoid problems. Police were waiting on the Nicaraguan side by mid-morning.
Demonstrations in Nicaragua that began in April against planned welfare cuts - later dropped by the government - quickly morphed into a broader protest against the leftist Ortega.
A former Marxist guerrilla leader and Cold War antagonist of the United States, Ortega has held power continually since 2007. Some critics now liken him to the dictator he once fought to oust. He accuses adversaries of plotting a coup to topple him.
As many as 40,000 Nicaraguans have left for neighboring Costa Rica since the protests started, according to Articulacion de Movimientos Sociales, (Articulation of Social Movements), the group organizing the protest caravan.
Monica Baltodano, head of the foundation Popol Na, one of several non-governmental organizations recently raided by the Nicaraguan government, said the protest hoped to get around 1,000 people to the border with Costa Rica.

On Saturday, Nicaraguan police beat at least seven journalists, including one of the country's best known editors, with batons as part of an escalating crackdown on independent media.

President Bashar al Assad welcomed him at the airport, official photos showed. Many Arab countries have shunned Assad since the conflict that began early in 2011 after protests calling for his downfall swept Syria. 
State news agency SANA said later the two leaders held talks in the presidential palace about developments in the region and in Syria.
Assad was quoted as saying his country would remain committed to its ""Arab identity"" despite the conflict in which Syria had accused some Arab countries, led by Saudi Arabia, of fuelling it by arming rebels seeking to overthrow Assad's rule.
The Arab League had suspended Syria's seat in November 2011 in response to the Syrian government's violent attacks on pro-democracy protests. 

Although many Arab countries have closed their embassies or downgraded their ties with Damascus, there have been growing calls in the Arab world in recent months to normalize ties with Syria and give it back its seat in the Arab League.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Around 10,000 Hungarians protested in Budapest on Sunday against a new labor law and what they see as the increasingly authoritarian rule of right-wing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Sunday's protest, called ""Merry Xmas Mr. Prime Minister"" by organizers, was the fourth, and biggest demonstration in a week by leftist opposition parties, student groups and civilians against Orban's government. Trade unions also joined the rally.
Protesters waved Hungarian and European Union flags as they walked from the historic Heroes' Square (NYSE:SQ) towards parliament in crispy winter cold, holding up banners with slogans including ""Don't steal"" and ""Independent courts!"". The crowd swelled to around 10,000 by the time they reached parliament.
""Discontent is growing,"" said Andi, 26, a sociology student who did not want to give her full name. ""They have passed two laws this week which ... won't serve Hungarian people's interest."" 
The new labor law allows employers to ask for up to 400 hours of overtime work per year, leading critics to label it the ""slave law"".
The government also passed a law to set up new administrative courts that will answer to the government and oversee sensitive issues such as electoral law, protests and corruption issues.
""This government ignores us, workers,"" Tamas Szekely, deputy head of the Hungarian Trade Unions' Association said in a speech. ""We must raise our voice and give an answer.""
Orban has often clashed with Brussels as he has built a system that his critics see as autocratic, boosting his control over the courts and the media.
Civil rights watchdogs said the new courts law was the latest erosion of democratic institutions under Orban, who rose to power in 2010.
He has since tweaked the election system to favor his ruling Fidesz party and has put loyalists at the head of public institutions, while his allies have enriched themselves. 
He has rarely angered large voter groups at home. Earlier this week police used tear gas on protesters at parliament.
Orban was reelected in April on the back of a fiercely anti-immigration campaign, facing a weak and fragmented opposition. 
Earlier this month, his government forced a private graduate school, the Central European University, to leave Hungary, as part of Orban's years-long fight with liberal Hungarian-born U.S. billionaire George Soros. 

Fidesz said on Saturday, in reaction to the protests, that it was ""increasingly obvious that criminals have been part of the street riots organized by the Soros-network.""

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - At least 12 Nigerian soldiers were killed and dozens of others are missing after fighting with Islamists in the northeastern state of Borno, three military sources said on Sunday, one of the largest known losses of life by the army in the last month. 
The army said it repelled the attack in which it said one soldier was killed and another injured. 
The fighting followed an attack on Friday by insurgents in Gudumbali local government area - a part of Borno where Boko Haram breakaway group Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) is influential. The sources said the poor communication network in the remote area delayed details of the attack being relayed. 
The attack, which the sources say was carried out on a military base and a nearby community in the Gudumbali local government area, comes as President Muhammadu Buhari's security record has become a campaign issue two months ahead of an election in which he is seeking a second term. 
The three military sources, all of whom are soldiers and did not want to be named, said at least 12 troops were killed and dozens were missing after the fighting. 
The army, in an emailed statement, said the insurgents opened fire on troops while aid materials were being distributed in Gudumbali. 
""The troops, however, fought gallantly and outmanoeuvred the attackers inflicting heavy casualties on them. Unfortunately, a soldier paid the supreme price during the encounter, while another was wounded in action,"" said the army in the statement. 
The biggest loss of military life in the last few months occurred in late November when around 100 soldiers were killed by ISWA militants who attacked an army base in Metele, Borno state. 
One of the sources said 28 militants were killed. 
Nigeria's northeast is home to two Islamist insurgencies: Boko Haram and ISWA which broke away in 2016 and is now considered by security experts to be the stronger of the two.
The Nigerian government in June ordered thousands of people who fled the conflict with Boko Haram to return to Gudumbali, one of the most dangerous areas of northeast Nigeria. Officials cut off food and other aid to those who refused.

TELAVI, Georgia (Reuters) - Georgia's incoming President Salome Zurabishvili vowed to reconcile political divisions and deepen ties with NATO and Europe at Sunday's inauguration that opposition protesters were blocked from reaching.
French-born Zurabishvili, backed by the ruling Georgian Dream party, won 59.5 percent of votes at last month's runoff which the opposition called rigged and international observers said was marred by unfair use of state resources.
Several thousand opposition supporters made for Telavi in a convoy of cars and buses, but police blocked the road, beating some activists with batons, a Reuters reporter said.
Zurabishvili, 66, daughter of Georgian émigrés and now the country's first female president, chose for her inauguration an 18th century palace in the eastern town of Telavi as she lost the vote there but wanted to demonstrate inclusiveness.
""I know different parties have different opinions about recognizing me as president, but I take responsibility to be president for all Georgians,"" she said in her speech.
With the prime minister and government wielding most executive power, the presidency is largely ceremonial but is still the international face of a nation seeking better relations with the West to counter Russia's influence.
""The new constitution of Georgia reflects the will of the Georgian people regarding Georgia's unhindered movement towards the European Union and NATO,"" she said.
""With the assistance of our strategic partner the United States and European friends, I will contribute to this process.""
Having worked in France's diplomatic service before becoming Georgia's foreign minister from 2004-2005, Zurabishvili said she would use that experience to promote her nation's aspirations to join the EU bloc and NATO transatlantic military alliance. 
Wearing a white coat and red shirt in the colors of Georgia's flag, she criticized Russia's occupation of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Russia won a brief 2008 war against Georgia.
""Russia, as a neighbor in the Caucasus, must realize that if it wants to be a full-fledged member of the international community, and intends to restore normal relations in this region, it must prove, both in words and fact, that it recognizes all norms of international law,"" she said.
The ruling Georgian Dream party that backed Zurabishvili was founded by billionaire banker Bidzina Ivanishvili whom critics say rules the nation from behind the scenes.

Guests at Sunday's inauguration included Armenian President Armen Sarkissian and France's former leader Nicolas Sarkozy.

Police said some 5,500 people marched in the bigger protest, organized by Flemish right wing parties in the part of the capital where main European Union institutions are located. 
A separate counter-demonstration of around 1,000 people, organized by left-wing groups and non-governmental organizations, took place in the city center. 
Belgian right-wing N-VA, which is the biggest party in parliament, pulled its ministers from the ruling coalition last week after Prime Minister Charles Michel refused its demand that he not sign the U.N. migration compact in Marrakesh.
Michel had secured a large parliamentary majority in favor of maintaining Belgium’s support of the U.N. text, with support from the opposition socialists and greens. Critics said the N-VA's move was the opening shot in a campaign before federal elections in May.
The U.N. pact was agreed in July by all 193 U.N. members except the United States, but only 164 formally signed it at the meeting last Monday.
It has run into criticism from European politicians who say it could increase immigration to Europe as the bloc has turned increasingly restrictive on accepting refugees and migrants alike since a 2015 spike in arrivals.
Ten countries, mostly in formerly Communist Eastern Europe, have pulled out of the non-binding pact. 

With a record 21.3 million refugees globally, the United Nations began work on the pact after more than one million people arrived in Europe in 2015, many fleeing civil war in Syria and poverty in Africa.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Kremlin-backed candidate is on track to be governor of a region on Russia's Pacific coast, voting results showed on Sunday, after an election process in which the opposition had threatened the Kremlin's usually tight grip on power. 
Sunday's vote in Primorsky region, which includes the port city of Vladivostok, was a re-run of a Sept. 16 election in which a Communist Party challenger claimed he was the rightful winner over the Kremlin's nominee.
But that election was annulled by election officials, citing voting irregularities. Hundreds of people took to the streets at the time, saying the decision robbed the opposition of a rare election win.
Some political commentators said the September election showed fading public support for the Kremlin, the result of a weak economy and an unpopular proposal - since put on hold - to make people work for longer before they receive their state pension.
After the election re-run was announced, the Kremlin ditched its candidate from the September vote. Russian President Vladimir Putin installed as acting governor Oleg Kozhemyako, the governor of a nearby region with chiseled good looks and none of the political baggage of his predecessor. 
Kozhemyako entered the election race, while the Communist challenger from the first round was disqualified from running on the grounds he failed to reach the threshold for winning endorsements from regional lawmakers.
With four fifths of the ballots counted on Sunday, Kozhemyako had a 60 percent share of the vote, according to the central election commission. His nearest rival, from the populist LDPR party, had 26 percent. 
Election officials said there had been no reports of major violations, state television reported.
Kozhemyako's win will restore the Kremlin's familiar tight control over the region, but the circumstances in which the first election was annulled still rankle with some people.
""You've been insulted and humiliated,"" Alexei Navalny, one of Putin's most vocal opponents, said in a video message to voters in Primorsky region before Sunday's vote.

""You voted and elected a person, after which the election was stolen, they spat in your face, and the person whom you elected was not even allowed to enter the election,"" Navalny said.

""The political prisoner Vahid Sayyadi Nasiri, on hunger strike since October 13, 2018 to protest the denial of his right to counsel and inhumane prison conditions..., has died at the Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Qom,"" the U.S.-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said on its website.
ISNA quoted an unidentified source as saying Nasiri had been jailed twice for belonging to a royalist group and planning acts of sabotage including an explosion. He had been taken from prison to a hospital where he died due to a liver disease on Dec. 12, the source said, without referring to a hunger strike.
Mehdi Kaheh, the prosecutor in the city of Qom, earlier said Nasiri had been serving a sentence for ""insulting Islamic sanctities"" on social media when he fell ill and was taken to hospital where he died, the state broadcaster IRIB reported on its website. Kaheh did not refer to a hunger strike.
Iran, whose officials often warn of efforts by foreign enemies to infiltrate state institutions, has detained scores of journalists and social media activists in recent years, and many others have gone into exile.
In November, Reporters Without Borders said Iran had launched a new crackdown on journalists in which several had been questioned and three arrested in connection with social network posts.

May delayed a vote last week on her agreement to leave the European Union because she was set to lose in parliament and has tried to secure ""assurances"" from the bloc to try to better sell it to skeptical lawmakers. Brussels said last week it was ready to help but warned her that she could not renegotiate the deal.
With less than four months before Britain is due to leave in March, Brexit, the biggest shift in trade and foreign policy for more than 40 years, is proving anything but smooth, complicated by the deep divisions in parliament and across the country.
With May facing deadlock in parliament over the deal and the EU offering little so far, more politicians are talking about the possibility of Britain leaving without an agreement or a second referendum that could stop Brexit from happening.
Asked if the government was preparing for a vote, education minister Damian Hinds told Sky News: ""No, a second referendum would be divisive. We've had the people's vote, we've had the referendum and now we've got to get on with implementing it.""
Trade minister Liam Fox also said a second referendum would ""perpetuate"" the deep divisions in Britain, adding that the prime minister was securing the necessary assurances to persuade parliament to back her deal.
He said that would take some time.
""It will happen over Christmas, it's not going to happen this week, it's not going to be quick, it will happen some time in the New Year,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show.
But the longer it takes, voices urging a change of tack are getting louder and the pressure on the main opposition Labour Party to move against the government is rising.
Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign minister, said if Britain wanted to put an ""entirely new"" Brexit proposal forward the government would most likely have to delay its departure.
May survived a no confidence vote among her Conservative lawmakers last week, but opposition parties are calling for Labour to propose a parliamentary motion of no confidence against the government this week.
Labour has repeatedly said it will call such a motion at ""the best time"", or when it knows it can win, and for now will try to force the government to bring its deal to parliament sooner.

Andrew Gwynne, Labour's policy chief for communities and local government, said: ""We will be using whatever mechanisms we have at our disposal next week to try and force the government to bring forward that deal for a vote before Christmas.""

The Iranian-aligned Houthi group and the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi agreed on Thursday after a week of U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden to cease fighting in the Red Sea city and withdraw forces.
The Houthis control most towns and cities, including Hodeidah and the capital Sanaa, from where they ousted Hadi's government in 2014 prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene. The government is now based in the southern port of Aden.
Residents have reported continued skirmishes, mostly at night, on the outskirts of Hodeidah, where thousands of coalition-backed Yemeni troops have massed.
Yahya Sarea, a senior official of the Houthi armed forces, told reporters in Sanaa the ceasefire was set to start on Tuesday. 
""We hope they will be true to their words, otherwise we are ready to respond,"" he added. 
A source in the Saudi-backed government confirmed the date and said it was officially communicated to both parties in a letter from special Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths. 
""While the Hodeidah agreement states an immediate start of the ceasefire, it is normal that it takes 48-72 hours to be communicated at the operational level,"" a U.N. source said. ""We expect the ceasefire to be implemented starting Tuesday.""
The United Nations is trying to avert a full-scale assault on the port, the entry point for most of Yemen's commercial goods and crucial aid supplies. It is a lifeline for millions of Yemenis facing starvation.
The agreement, the first significant breakthrough in peace efforts in five years, was part of confidence-building measures discussed at peace talks that aim to pave the way for a wider truce and a framework for political negotiations.
Under the deal, international monitors would be deployed in Hodeidah and all armed forces would pull back completely within 21 days of the start of the ceasefire. 
A U.N.-chaired Redeployment Coordination Committee including both sides would oversee implementation. The committee is expected to start its work this week, the U.N. source said.
Griffiths has asked the Security Council to pass a resolution backing deployment of a robust monitoring regime to oversee compliance with the truce, headed by retired Dutch Major General Patrick Cammaert.

The combatants are due to hold another round of talks in January to agree on the political framework for negotiations to end the war that has killed tens of thousands of people and spawned an urgent humanitarian crisis.

According to the family's account, masked men in military uniforms came in November 2017 to their door in the town of Peña Blanca, brandishing handguns and giving them two options: leave or be killed. They chose to leave, taking refuge with friends and family for nearly a year, they said, before joining thousands of others in a 2,800-mile (4,500-km) journey to the United States in October. 
The confrontation occurred on Nov. 26, 2017, the night of Honduras' presidential election. Active in the leftist opposition Libre Party, the Pinedas believe their tormentors were loyal to conservative President Juan Orlando Hernandez. 
His security forces killed at least 16 people in major street protests that followed his disputed re-election and nobody has been criminally charged, according to a U.N. report. 
""They told me that for getting people involved in political parties they were going to fill me with lead,"" said Secundina Pineda, 25, one of four sisters living with their 65-year-old father and a toddler inside a tent at a migrant camp in Tijuana, Mexico.
Their story points to the largely overlooked political violence in Honduras that, along with grinding poverty, has helped create a humanitarian crisis at the U.S. doorstep. 
Reuters could not verify the Pinedas' story, which was largely narrated by Secundina. She is the most educated of her family, having studied business administration. A Honduran armed forces spokesman vehemently denied the account or any other political persecution.
But human rights observers in Honduras and immigration lawyers representing migrants from the caravan said they have heard similar stories of security forces entering homes and intimidating opposition political activists.
Military police have conducted arbitrary searches and seizures and broken up opposition demonstrations, the rights observers said, a contention denied by the military.
In a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world, death squads have conducted 38 massacres of five or more people in 2018, said Berta Oliva, director of the human rights group Committee of the Relatives of the Disappeared in Honduras (COFADEH). She contended that political cases are written off as common crime.
""The Honduran armed forces absolutely do not persecute anybody,"" said Captain Jose Domingo Mesa, a military spokesman.
""A lot of people who are trying to get asylum (in the United States) are looking for political justification, a lot of times blaming the armed forces,"" Mesa said. ""We invite this family that says it has been persecuted to return to the country.""
The president's office did not answer a Reuters request for comment.
U.S. immigration lawyer Maritza Agundez estimated 20 to 25 percent of her coalition's clients are Hondurans with credible political asylum cases. She is one of 16 staff attorneys for Los Angeles-based Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) who are handling dozens of cases from the migrant caravan. The Hondurans who report harassment from official security forces vow never to return home, she said.
""They are 100 percent sure that if they return back home that they will be killed,"" Agundez said.
CARAVAN STALLED IN TIJUANA 
Thousands of Central American asylum seekers have been corralled into overcrowded camps for the past month in the northern Mexican city of Tijuana after walking highways and hitching rides since October. They face long wait times to have asylum claims heard, and some frustrated migrants are considering trying to cross the U.S. border illegally, staying in Mexico or agreeing to be sent home voluntarily. 
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has made it harder for migrants to get asylum, eliminating protection for people fleeing gangs or domestic violence and attempting to deny asylum to people who cross the border illegally.
Even before that, less than 14 percent of Hondurans were winning their asylum cases in fiscal year 2018.
The United States is also deporting about 22,000 Hondurans per year back into one of the poorest counties in the Americas. 
Soledad Pazo, representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Honduras, said her mission is monitoring all manner of accusations including kidnapping and disappearances, but Honduran judicial institutions are largely incapable of a proper investigation, Pazo said. 
    ""There is a high level of impunity here,"" Pazo said. ""Many say, 'I don't have confidence in the police when those who I am reporting come from the state.'"" 
Honduras has long suffered political instability, and the situation has deteriorated since a 2009 coup when the army deposed President Manuel Zelaya, now of the Libre Party that was formed in 2011, for taking measures that could have led to running for re-election.
Polarization grew more acute in 2015 when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of presidential re-election despite it still being banned by the constitution, allowing Hernandez to seek the re-election that had been denied Zelaya. 
The election in 2017 was marked by irregularities, and when an early lead for Libre candidate Salvador Nasralla disappeared during the days-long vote count, street protests erupted. 
A U.N. human rights report found 23 people were killed in post-election violence, at least 16 of them shot to death by security forces.
Oliva of COFADEH said human rights have continued to deteriorate with the military police and armed forces involved in the majority of the violations.
""From 2017 until now, Honduras has experienced a breakdown like never before on issues of human rights issues, democracy, on freedom of expression, on issues of truth. This is fundamentally what has made most people decide to migrate like a flock of birds,"" Oliva said.
The Pinedas heard on television about the caravan, which the Hernandez government alleges was instigated by a Libre politician. After a family debate, the Pinedas decided to leave, joining the 300,000 people from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador who abandon their countries each year, according to a U.N. estimate.
Secundina Pineda said she wants to study marketing and learn English, perhaps in Miami where she has a friend. Older sister Leida, 33, said she would take any kind of job, even scrubbing toilets. Jose Melvin Pineda, the patriarch, wants to keep working in construction, even though he is 65 years old.

All of them are terrified of returning to Honduras.""If we're deported,"" Secundina said, ""we'll be eaten alive.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea on Sunday condemned the U.S. administration for stepping up sanctions and pressure on the nuclear-armed country, warning of a return to ""exchanges of fire"" and that disarming Pyongyang could be blocked forever.
The North's stinging response came after the United States said on Monday it had introduced sanctions on three North Korean officials, including a top aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, for alleged human rights abuses.
Denuclearizing North Korea has made little progress since Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump met in Singapore in June in a historic summit. The two sides have yet to reschedule working-level talks between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol, which were canceled abruptly in November. 
While crediting Trump for his ""willingness"" to improve relations with the North, also known as DPRK, Pyongyang accused the U.S. State Department of being ""bent on bringing the DPRK-U.S. relations back to the status of last year which was marked by exchanges of fire.""
North Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement that Washington had taken ""sanctions measures for as many as eight times against the companies, individuals and ships of not only the DPRK but also Russia, China and other third countries..."" 
If the U.S. administration believed that heightened sanctions and pressure would force Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons, ""it will count as (its) greatest miscalculation, and it will block the path to denuclearization on the Korean peninsula forever - a result desired by no one,"" according to the statement. 

The foreign ministry statement was released under the name of the policy research director of the Institute for American Studies.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel signalled displeasure on Sunday with Australia's recognition of West Jerusalem as its capital, with a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying it was a mistake to gainsay Israeli control over the whole city. 
The premier, for his part, stayed silent on Canberra's move at a weekly Israeli cabinet meeting that is usually his opportunity to hold forth in public on major diplomatic developments.
Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in a 1967 war and annexed it as its capital in a moved not recognised internationally. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of the state they hope to found in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
A year ago, U.S. President Donald Trump outraged Palestinians by recognising Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, a designation that did not acknowledge their claim on the east of the city though it left open the question of its final borders.
On Saturday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Canberra formally recognises West Jerusalem as Israel's capital but reaffirmed his country's support for a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem under a two-state peace deal. [nL3N1YK033]
Israel's Foreign Ministry responded tepidly, calling the Australian move ""a step in the right direction"". At the cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu declined to elaborate.
""We issued a statement at the Foreign Ministry. I have nothing to add to it,"" he told reporters at the outset of the meeting.
Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel's minister for regional cooperation and a Netanyahu confidant in the right-wing Likud party, was more openly critical of Australia, though he deemed it a ""deep and intimate friend of many years' standing"".
""To our regret, within this positive news they made a mistake,"" Hanegbi told reporters outside the cabinet room. 
""There is no division between the east of the city and west of the city. Jerusalem is one whole, united. Israel's control over it is eternal. Our sovereignty will not be partitioned nor undermined. And we hope Australia will soon find the way to fix the mistake it made.""
Morrison's move first surfaced in October, when it was viewed cynically in Australia because it came days before a crucial by-election in an electorate a strong Jewish representation. His party lost that poll. [nL3N1X102G]
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said Saturday's move was born of Australian ""petty domestic politics"".

""All of Jerusalem remains a final-status issue for negotiations, while East Jerusalem, under international law, is an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territory,"" he said.

""In Argentina, Trump told Erdogan they were working on extraditing (Fethullah) Gulen and other people,"" Mevlut Cavusoglu said, referring to the G20 summit where the leaders met two weeks ago.
Turkey has long sought the extradition of Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed U.S. exile for nearly two decades. A former ally of Erdogan, he is blamed by Turkish authorities for the failed coup when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and helicopters, attacked parliament and shot unarmed civilians. 
Gulen denies any involvement in the failed putsch. Trump said last month he was not considering extraditing the preacher as part of efforts to ease Turkish pressure on Saudi Arabia over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul.
Erdogan said last week Turkey would start new initiatives abroad to target the financing of Gulen supporters.

""I have recently seen a credible probe by the FBI on how the Gulen organization avoids taxes,"" Cavusoglu told a conference in Doha.

Australia's government announced the decision on Saturday, reversing decades of Middle East policy, but said it would not immediately move its embassy there.
The United States in May opened its embassy in Jerusalem.
The Arab League had issued a statement criticizing the Australian decision as ""blatantly biased towards the positions and policies of the Israeli occupation"".
But Bahraini minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa described the statement as ""mere rhetoric and irresponsible"".
""Australia's stance does not impact the legitimate Palestinian demands, first among them being East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine, and it does not contradict the Arab Peace Initiative,"" he tweeted on Saturday.
Sheikh Khalid has previously said Israel had the right to defend itself against Shi'ite Muslim Iran, which Bahrain blames for stoking unrest in the Sunni-ruled island state. Iran denies interfering in Bahrain.
The status of Jerusalem, home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths, is one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians who want East Jerusalem recognized as the capital of a Palestinian state. 
Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector that it annexed in a move not recognized internationally, after the 1967 Middle East war. The United Nations says the status of Jerusalem can be resolved only by negotiations.
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has on several occasions hinted at warmer relations with Gulf Arab states and made a surprise visit to Oman in October to meet with its ruler Sultan Qaboos bin Said. 

Israel has diplomatic relations with only two Arab states, Egypt and Jordan.

Abbasiyeen Square (NYSE:SQ), where mortars regularly fell, and nearby parts of the city are being decked out with lighting and Christmas trees, while musicians with a local scout troop are preparing for a Christmas march not seen for years.
""We are so happy. The children can now come again to the church without worrying for their safety, and their parents feel more reassured,"" said Aline Droubi, a musician with the scout troop that practices at a church in Abbasiyeen.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2018 04:03AM ET</span>",Wickremesinghe returns as Sri Lanka PM as crisis nears end,"By Shihar Aneez
COLOMBO (Reuters) - Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as Sri Lanka's prime minister on Sunday, making a remarkable comeback weeks after being ousted by President Maithripala Sirisena under controversial circumstances.
Wickremesinghe's reinstatement, which is expected to end a political crisis that began in late October when he was surprisingly sacked, is an embarrassment for the president.
Sirisena had replaced Wickremesinghe with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa following differences over policy matters and other issues. However, Rajapaksa failed to win a parliamentary majority and resigned on Saturday as a government shutdown loomed.
Sirisena had repeatedly said he would not reappoint Wickremesinghe as prime minister. But he had to change his stance to gain parliamentary approval for a temporary budget that is required by Jan. 1.
""It is a victory for Sri Lanka's democratic institutions and the sovereignty of our citizens,"" Wickremesinghe said in a tweet. ""I thank everyone who stood firm in defending the constitution and ensuring the triumph of democracy.""
He later told his supporters at his official residence that he would ensure a ""better economic situation, better standard of living"" for Sri Lankans after first working to ""normalize the country"".
The swearing-in ceremony was closed to the media and only a few lawmakers from Wickremesinghe's coalition were present, an official in the president's office told Reuters. The official did not want to be named.
Wickremesinghe, who has never completed a full term as prime minister, was appointed for the post for the fifth time.
The South Asian island country's parliament had voted to cut the budget for Rajapaksa and his ministers after Sirisena refused to accept no-confidence votes against Rajapaksa, saying that due process was not followed.
Sri Lanka's parliamentarians have already passed a confidence vote in Wickremesinghe as they sought his return as prime minister to defuse a constitutional crisis.
On Friday, Sri Lanka's Supreme Court rejected Rajapaksa's bid for an injunction against a lower court's order that barred him and his Cabinet from performing their roles.
Many foreign countries refused to recognize Rajapaksa's government. Credit rating agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor's downgraded Sri Lanka, citing refinancing risks and an uncertain policy outlook.
Sirisena came to power in 2015 on a pledge to uphold democracy and stamp out corruption. However, his popularity has been hit by a crisis many say he triggered because of personal differences with Wickremesinghe.
Much of the conflict between the two men centered on a dispute over how much to accommodate Indian interests in the country versus Chinese, government officials and foreign diplomats told Reuters last month. 
China has been investing heavily in the country though India is the traditional power in the region.
India welcomed the resolution of the political turmoil in Sri Lanka.
""This is a reflection of the maturity demonstrated by all political forces, and also of the resilience of Sri Lankan democracy and its institutions,"" said Raveesh Kumar, spokesman for India’s Ministry of External Affairs.

""India remains committed to taking forward its people-oriented development projects in Sri Lanka. We are confident that India-Sri Lanka relations will continue to move on an upward trajectory.""

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2018 02:54AM ET</span>",'Nobody will kneel': Tigrayans defiant as Ethiopian leader cracks down,"By Maggie Fick
MEKELLE, Ethiopia (Reuters) - In the birthplace of the armed struggle that propelled Ethiopia's ruling coalition to power 27 years ago, there is growing anger as the country's new prime minister stages a crackdown on the region's once-powerful leaders. 
Although the Tigrayans who inhabit these craggy hills are only a small minority in a country of more than 100 million, they have dominated its power structures since 1991 when the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) drove a Marxist military regime from power.
Now many leading Tigrayans are being detained or sidelined as reformist prime minister, Abiy Ahmed attempts to draw a line under past abuses. One adviser to Abiy told Reuters that the prime minister has sacked 160 army generals for actions he said amount to ""state terrorism"".
In Mekelle, capital of the Tigray region, and in nearby villages, a siege mentality is taking hold among people who say they feel under attack. The frustration could pose a threat to the 42-year-old prime minister as he urges people to back ""reforms, not revolution"".
At street coffee stalls in Mekelle and in fields outside the city, Tigrayans said they would not stand by as national figures disparaged their region and history.
""There are efforts to corner the people of Tigray,"" said Getachew Reda, a senior Tigrayan politician and EPRDF member who served as communications minister under Abiy's predecessor. ""But we don't believe that's going to work because we are steeped in the tradition not just of defending ourselves but also rising up to whatever challenge”.
He accused Abiy, a member of the country's largest ethnic group, the Oromo, of selective justice. 
Tigrayans were angered when 60 officials, many of them from their region, were detained for suspected human rights abuses and corruption, he said. These included senior executives at the army-run METEC industrial conglomerate.
""Abiy controls the international narrative but not necessarily the country,"" Getachew said.
""BACKWARDNESS AND INJUSTICE""
Abiy addressed the accusation in a statement on Wednesday, saying: ""Just like we don't blame a forest for what a single tree has done, we don't blame or point our fingers at any tribe for the crimes individuals committed.""
  Abiy too hails from the EPRDF. He served in the military in Tigray as a teenager and speaks the Tigrinya language. But he has taken a wrecking ball to the institutions the ruling coalition had used to control the country.
In a speech last month, he said the three years of anti-government protests that helped bring him to power in April showed that Ethiopians no longer tolerate ""backwardness and injustice"".
""It is with this understanding that we have been continuously undertaking different reforms in the past months to change our political culture, system and institutions,"" he said.
This is popular with many Ethiopians who resented Tigrayan domination of institutions such as the federal police, which violently repressed the protests. Other larger ethnic groups accused Tigrayans of imposing a federal system based on ethnic identity to ""divide and rule"".
In the capital, Addis Ababa, and other cities, Abiy's face is everywhere: on stickers, t-shirts and posters. But not in Tigray, where he is increasingly unpopular. 
Although the political influence of Tigrayans has diminished under Abiy, they remain a force to be reckoned with.
Decentralized government has allowed the creation of large regional police forces, including in Tigray. The region also has a history of civilians, mostly farmers who own guns, joining militias to defend the group's causes. 
Officials in Mekelle said there was no attempt to build up these regional forces. But security is a growing concern, as seen at checkpoints where Tigray police search vehicles and people for weapons before allowing entry to the city.
Many Tigrayans said they were worried about a surge in ethnic violence elsewhere in the country that has forced more than 1 million people to flee their homes since Abiy took office.
Although Tigray has been largely unaffected – unlike other regions, it is not home to significant numbers of people from other ethnic groups – residents told Reuters that Abiy was not doing enough to stop the bloodshed elsewhere. Several said they had family members who abandoned jobs and businesses to return to Tigray for fear of reprisals, though there have been no reports of major attacks against the community.
""THIS HAS TO STOP""
Others see veiled attempts to blame Tigrayans whenever Abiy decries the way things were before he took the helm or accuses opposition forces of plotting against his reforms. 
People packed a stadium in Mekelle earlier this month to vent their anger at a rally organized by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, a former guerrilla movement turned political party.
""We were expressing that we are isolated, that we are experiencing ethnic discrimination, and that this has to stop,"" said Gush Gebreselassie, a 55-year-old civil servant.
Meressa Tsehaye, a political science professor at Mekelle University, recalled Tigrayans' sacrifices in the 1980s civil war that brought Abiy's EPRDF to power.
He and others said Ethiopians were forgetting the achievements delivered by the coalition. Ethiopia’s economy has grown around 10 percent a year for the past decade, according to government statistics.
""We won them freedom. We brought them electricity. We built them roads,"" said Fitsum Tekele, a 50-year-old farmer, as he crouched barefoot in a field outside Mekelle harvesting teff, the staple crop, with a sickle. ""If they say they were in darkness for 27 years, their minds are not working.""
Two of his brothers left a car hire business in the Amhara region, Fitsum said. ""They came home with nothing.""
Concern was palpable at city coffee stalls, where both the young and those who survived the war agreed that the region would not accept what one man called “humiliation”. Many did not provide their names out of fear of retribution.
""I can't judge whether Abiy directly hates us Tigrayans or is just using techniques to get power over us,"" said a 19-year-old woman who runs a coffee stall. ""If he doesn't accept to have discussions with our leaders, we know our history,"" she said. 
That history of armed resistance looms large in a society where many families lost members in the war. A museum to the ""martyrs"" recounts the bravery of local fighters, and local TV channels broadcast war footage of Tigrayans on the march.

""Nobody will kneel down here,"" a tour guide said.

MANAGUA (Reuters) - Nicaraguan police on Saturday beat at least seven journalists with batons, including one of the country's best known editors, in an escalating crackdown on independent media in the aftermath of protests against President Daniel Ortega.
Earlier this week police occupied the offices of prominent editor Carlos Fernando Chamorro, along with buildings used by several civil society organizations it had banned. 
Journalists on Saturday gathered outside the police headquarters in the capital Managua. Chamorro asked officers outside for information about what he called the illegal raid on his offices, in which officers confiscated equipment and papers.
After his request, policemen in anti-riot gear emerged from the headquarters swinging batons at and kicking Chamorro, his colleagues and reporters who were at the scene to cover the event. 
A Reuters witness counted at least seven journalists from international and national media, including Chamorro, who were grabbed and kicked by the police.
The police chased the journalists, with some calling them ""coup plotters"" and threatening to confiscate cell phones and equipment.
""Three officers beat me,"" said Néstor Arce, a journalist at Chamorro's Confidencial weekly. ""They kicked me in the leg trying to knock me down.""
Since April, Nicaragua has been experiencing one of its worst crises since a civil war in the 1980s. Protests raged for months before a government clampdown reined them in. 
At least 322 people have been killed and more than 500 are incarcerated, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, one of the groups that the government has blacklisted.
Ana Maria Tello, who works with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights' (IACHR) in Nicaragua, expressed concern at the ""increase in repression against NGOs and independent media and journalists.""

The Ortega government did not respond to a request for comment about Saturday's violence. Ortega has called the protests an attempt at a ""coup d'état"".

SAN ANTONIO DE CORTEZ, Guatemala (Reuters) - The 7-year-old Guatemalan migrant girl who died after being detained by U.S. border agents this month was inseparable from her father and had looked forward to being able to send money home to support her impoverished family, relatives said on Saturday.
Nery Caal, 29, and his daughter Jakelin were in a group of more than 160 migrants who handed themselves in to U.S. border agents in New Mexico on Dec. 6. Jakelin developed a high fever while in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and died two days later at a hospital in El Paso, Texas. 
""The girl said when she was grown up she was going to work and send dough back to her mom and grandma,"" said her mother Claudia Maquin, who has three remaining children, speaking in the Mayan language Q'eqchi and betraying little outward emotion.
""Because she'd never seen a big country, she was really happy that she was going to go,"" she added, explaining how her husband had gone to the United States to find a way out of the ""extreme poverty"" that dictated their lives.
Corn stood behind her palm-thatched wooden house and a few chickens and pigs scrabbled in the yard as she spoke, dressed in a traditional blouse with a 6-month-old baby in her arms.
A family photograph at the house showed Jakelin smiling and looking up at the camera, wearing a pink T-shirt with characters from the cartoon series ""Masha and the Bear.""
Deforestation to make way for palm-oil plantations has made subsistence farming increasingly hard for the 40,000 inhabitants of Raxruha municipality, where the family's agricultural hamlet of San Antonio de Cortez lies in central Guatemala, local officials said. That has spurred an exodus of migrants.
Setting out on Dec. 1, Caal and his daughter traveled more than 2,000 miles (3,220 km) so Jakelin's father could look for work in the United States, said her mother, who learned of the girl's death from consular officials.
Almost 80 percent of Guatemala's indigenous population are poor, with half of those living in extreme poverty. The mayor of San Antonio de Cortez described the Caal family as among the worst off in the village.
Mayor Cesar Castro said in recent months more and more families were uprooting to try to reach the United States, often selling what little land they owned to pay people traffickers thousands of dollars for the trip.
""It's not just the Caal family. There are endless people who are leaving,"" Castro said. ""I see them drive past in pickups, cars and buses."" He said most of them came back in the end, often penniless after being dropped off by traffickers, caught by authorities and deported.
Jakelin's death has added to criticism of U.S. of President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies from migrant advocates and Democrats in the U.S. Congress.
The U.S. government defended Jakelin's treatment, and said there was no indication she had any medical problems until several hours after she and her father were taken into custody.
The father, speaking through a representative in Texas, agreed with that account, saying the girl exhibited no sign of distress at the border. The family, in a statement issued by their attorneys in El Paso, disputed as erroneous media reports that the girl had gone for days without food or water or became severely dehydrated.
INSEPARABLE 
Domingo Caal, Jakelin's grandfather, said she had gone on the journey because she did not want to leave her father.
""The girl really stuck to him. It was very difficult to separate them,"" said Domingo, 61, wearing muddy boots and a faded and torn blue shirt.
Jakelin's uncle, Jose Manuel Caal, said he had heard she was ill before she died, but had expected her to recover. ""The girl's death left us in shock,"" he said.
The family hope the girl's father can remain in the United States.
""What I want now is for Nery to stay and work in the United States. That's what I want,"" said his wife.
A Guatemalan consular official told Reuters on Friday that Caal told him he had crossed the border planning to turn himself in to U.S. authorities, and will try to stay.
Record numbers of parents traveling with children are being apprehended trying to cross the U.S. border with Mexico. In November, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers detained 25,172 members of ""family units,"" the highest monthly number ever recorded, the agency said.
Parents with children are more likely to be released by U.S. authorities while their cases are processed because of legal restrictions on keeping children in detention.
Caal remains in the El Paso area, where his daughter died after being flown by helicopter to a hospital there for emergency treatment when she stopped breathing.
A brain scan revealed swelling and Jakelin was diagnosed with liver failure. She died early in the morning on Dec. 8, with her father at the hospital, a CBP official said.

U.S. authorities are investigating the death.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has named a distinguished military leader as its next governor general, who represents Britain's Queen Elizabeth, the country’s head of state, ahead of an election in May.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Sunday that David Hurley, former Australian Defence Force chief and current governor of the state of New South Wales, has been appointed to the office.
""I had only one choice, my first choice and he is standing next to me,"" Morrison said from Canberra in a joint press conference with Hurley.
Hurley, 65, had a 42-year military career in the Australian Army culminating in his appointment as Chief of the Defence Force in 2011.
""I'll be enormously proud to represent Australia in the role of governor general,"" Hurley said.
The largely symbolic governor-general's role has extensive though little-used powers. 
The governor general is commander in chief of the armed forces, appoints ambassadors ministers and judges, gives royal assent to legislation and issues writs to call elections.
The current governor-general, Peter Cosgrove, had been due to finish his five-year term in March.
The opposition Labor party had urged the prime minister to extend Cosgrove's service until after the May federal election so the incoming prime minister could choose the next governor general.
Instead, Morrison both appointed Hurley and said Cosgrove would extend his duties until after the federal election, allowing Hurley to conclude his duties as state governor of New South Wales, which has also has an election in March.
""This will mean that both NSW and Australia will have experienced governor and governor generals in place for the forthcoming elections,"" Morrison said.
Australia is a constitutional monarchy, a legacy of its origins as a British colony.
The prime minister is Australia’s head of government, but formally reports on many matters to the queen’s representative.
The governor general almost always acts on the advice of the prime minister and parliament, but can also dissolve parliament and has done so in the past.
In 1975, when a parliamentary deadlock blocked funds for government expenditure, Governor General John Kerr dismissed Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, replaced him with his conservative opponent and dissolved parliament for a general election.

Australia gained independence from Britain in 1901, but retained Britain’s Westminster parliamentary traditions dating back hundreds of years.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2018 06:36PM ET</span>",Deep in the red: Chinese county pays price for vanity-project binge,"By Shu Zhang and Ryan Woo
RUCHENG COUNTY, China (Reuters) - In the heart of an impoverished village in southern China, a life-sized statue of Mao Zedong sits on a platform adorned with intricate stonework, flanked by a diorama of Red Army soldiers and traditional brick-and-tile homes with curved roofs.
Officials have spent a small fortune on the project that has transformed the village of Shazhou, in Hunan province, into an open-air museum dedicated to the Chinese Communist Party. But few tourists have come to peer at the inscription at the foot of Mao's statue, or take selfies in front of the heroes of the revolution.
The ""red tourism"" project was the brainchild of the former Communist Party chief of the local county, Rucheng, and cost 300 million yuan ($44 million). But it has yet to produce a profit, just like the string of public gardens, town squares and office buildings that the county has built in recent years.
Now the clock is ticking as Rucheng, among China's poorest counties, and with a population of just 420,400 people, is under pressure to resolve $1 billion in debt, following a decade of credit-fuelled vanity projects, three local officials told Reuters. They requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
To raise funds and conserve cash, Rucheng - which doesn't have a train station or an airport - has been slashing public investment in infrastructure projects and increasing government land sales to generate revenue, the officials said. 
Rucheng is not alone - hundreds of other indebted counties in China are in the same boat. In a recent financial stability report, the central bank said that much of China's hidden debt risk is held at lower-tier levels, meaning prefectures and counties like Rucheng.
As China prepares this month to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the economic reforms that transformed it into the world's second-largest economy, fears over local government debt are growing.
China's local governments had 18.4 trillion yuan of outstanding debt at the end of October, and were estimated by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings to have up to 40 trillion yuan in off-budget borrowing.
Of particular concern to the authorities as they tackle risks in the financial system are those governments with tiny revenue streams relative to their debt. Their over-reliance on income from land sales is also driving asset bubbles in China.
Rucheng's free-spending ways came onto Beijing's radar this year when visiting anti-corruption inspectors were shocked by the contrast between the county's newly built but deserted municipal district and cramped older areas where residents drink polluted water from aging pipes.
When the inspectors were in town, numerous anonymous complaints arrived in the mail.
Since 2008, Rucheng has spent billions on 10 office buildings, 11 public gardens and squares and 26 urban roads, the anti-corruption inspectors found. But less than 6 percent of government spending went on investing in industry.
Vanity investments helped drive Rucheng's debt ratio - or borrowing relative to fiscal revenue - to 336 percent last year from 286 percent in 2016, and 274 percent in 2015.
""We must rectify the problem according to what is required of us, otherwise the local people will not trust our government officials anymore,"" said one of the officials.
The head of Rucheng's Communist Party was sacked for profligate spending and ""ignoring the livelihood of the local people"".
Hunan province also placed Rucheng on a ""top-level government debt warning list"" of counties with debt ratios over 100 percent, the Rucheng officials said.
Local governments on the list face restrictions on taking on new debt, launching new projects, hiring employees and traveling overseas, they said.
RUCHENG CUTS BACK
Since the anti-corruption inspection, Rucheng has suspended, canceled and scaled back 79 government projects, cutting investment by 2.1 billion yuan, the officials said. 
All Rucheng officials have been working seven days a week and meeting regularly with local residents, the three officials said. One official died from overwork, they added.
More than 30 million yuan is also being spent on renovating old water pipes in the area.
To resolve the debt problem, Rucheng has to repay 400 million yuan a year in principle and interest to reduce its outstanding government debt, which was around 9 billion yuan at the end of 2017, an official at Rucheng's finance and debt department told Reuters.
Rucheng's debt ratio has since dropped to about 60.6 percent, said the official at its finance department. On Dec. 5, the provincial government lowered Rucheng's government debt warning level from ""first-level"" to ""second-level"", the officials said. 
At the same time, Rucheng officials are under pressure to produce economic growth.
""The higher authorities require us to have zero additional debt but deliver high-quality economic growth,"" said a Rucheng official in charge of the economy.
WASHING VEGETABLES, BOILING EGGS
But the legacy of the vanity spending remains.
A mineral bath tourism spot in Rucheng was deserted during a recent visit by Reuters.
Local residents washing vegetables and boiling eggs in the hot springs said the tourism spot, which had cost about 400 million yuan to build, had done little to improve livelihoods.
In nearby Shazhou, which has a population of 500, residents said they had been pressured to sell land at bargain prices to the government for the red tourism project while getting paid only 100 yuan a day as construction workers at the site.
White elephant projects built by local governments proliferated across China after the central government pumped trillions of yuan into the economy during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.
Beijing has since tried to curtail direct borrowing by local governments for such projects, but officials have found ways around the curbs. One widespread method has been the establishment of shell companies known as local government financing vehicles to obtain funds for infrastructure and real estate projects, from which local officials often can profit.
Rucheng had nine such financing vehicles until recently, said the Rucheng finance official, adding that the number had now been cut to two. More than 1 billion yuan in debt was disposed of in that restructuring, he said.
Rucheng still has another 1.4 billion yuan of ""mid- to long-term payment obligations"", which will take Rucheng 10 years to repay, the official said.
Despite Rucheng's large debts, the officials said the county's 5.36 billion yuan in government bonds presented ""no default risk"" because they would keep issuing so-called refinancing bonds to roll over the debt.
WOBBLY ECONOMY
The crackdown by Beijing in Rucheng was not only painful for local officials, but it also threatened a fragile local economy that is comprised of agriculture, green industries and eco-tourism.
Like other places in China, Rucheng needs to develop its private sector and new industries to counter a slowing regional economy at a time when government investment is severely constrained, the officials told Reuters.
There are signs that some private capital is entering Rucheng.
In September, the Dongguan Electronic Industry Association in Guangdong signed a 10 billion yuan investment plan to create an industrial park in Rucheng, attracted by cheaper land and labor costs.
That would bring in at least 20 mid-sized electronic firms and create 10,000 local jobs, Guo Peng, manager of the association, told Reuters.
But for Rucheng officials, the fear of being punished for increasing government debt risks has extinguished much of their desire to chase higher economic growth.
Rucheng indicated in August that its growth target for the region would be cut to 8 percent from 10.5 percent.
""We are not taking on any new debt illicitly for construction,"" said an official at the county's Communist Party. ""If a local administration raises debt in violation of central government policy, local officials will be held responsible for their entire life.""

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2018 04:25PM ET</span>",Nations agree global climate pact rules after overcoming impasse,"By Bate Felix, Nina Chestney and Agnieszka Barteczko
KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Nearly 200 nations overcame political divisions on Saturday to agree on rules for implementing a landmark global climate deal but critics say it is not ambitious enough to prevent the dangerous effects of global warming.
After two weeks of talks in the Polish city of Katowice, nations finally reached consensus on a more detailed framework for the 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to limit a rise in average world temperatures to ""well below"" two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.
""It is not easy to find agreement on a deal so specific and technical. Through this package you have made a thousand little steps forward together. You can feel proud,"" Polish president of the talks Michal Kurtyka told delegates.
After he struck the gavel to signal agreement had been reached, ministers joined him on the stage, hugging and laughing in signs of relief after the marathon talks.
Before the talks started, many expected that the deal would not be as robust as is needed. The unity which underpinned the Paris talks has fragmented and U.S. President Donald Trump intends to pull his country - one of the world's biggest emitters - out of the pact.
Still, exhausted ministers managed to bridge a series of divides to produce a 156-page rulebook - which is broken down into themes such as how countries will report and monitor their national pledges to curb greenhouse gas emissions and update their emissions plans.
However, an eight-page decision framework text was criticized by some countries and green groups for failing to urge increased ambitions on emissions cuts sufficiently to curb rising temperatures.
""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris Agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, international climate lead at Christian Aid. 
""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up to the urgent call of the IPCC report,"" he added.
A U.N.-commissioned report by the IPCC in October warned that keeping the Earth's temperature rise to 1.5C would need ""unprecedented changes"" in every aspect of society.
Last week, Saudi Arabia, the Unites States, Russia and Kuwait refused to use the word ""welcome"" in association with the findings of the report.
The decision text now merely expresses gratitude for the work on the report, welcomes its timely completion and invites parties to use the information in it.
For many low-lying states and islands who are at risk from rising sea levels, this is not strong enough but had to be accepted grudgingly in exchange for other trade-offs.
""There should be a direct link between the findings of the report and the specific actions that would underpin ambition both in terms of action and finance,"" Simon Stiell, Grenada's environment minister, told Reuters. 
""The challenges will be with some of the bigger players in terms of stepping up to their responsibilities and what is required to truly operationalize the Paris Agreement,"" he added. 

At the eleventh hour, ministers managed to break a deadlock between Brazil and other countries over the accounting rules for the monitoring of carbon credits, deferring a bulk of that discussion to next year.

SAQQARA, Egypt (Reuters) - Egypt unveiled a well-preserved 4,400-year-old tomb decorated with hieroglyphs and statues south of Cairo on Saturday, and officials expect more discoveries when archaeologists excavate the site further in coming months. 
The tomb was found in a buried ridge at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara. It was untouched and unlooted, Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters at the site. He described the find as ""one of a kind in the last decades"".
The tomb dates from the rule of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom.
Archaeologists removed a last layer of debris from the tomb on Thursday and found five shafts inside, Waziri said. One of the shafts was unsealed with nothing inside, but the other four were sealed. They are expecting to make discoveries when they excavate those shafts starting on Sunday, he said. He was hopeful about one shaft in particular. 
""I can imagine that all of the objects can be found in this area,"" he said, pointing at one of the sealed shafts. ""This shaft should lead to a coffin or a sarcophagus of the owner of the tomb.""
The tomb is 10 metres (33 ft) long, three metres (9.8 ft) wide and just under three metres high, Waziri said. 
The walls are decorated with hieroglyphs and statues of pharaohs. Waziri said the tomb was unique because of the statues and its near perfect condition. 
""The colour is almost intact even though the tomb is almost 4,400 years old,"" he said. 
The tomb lies in a buried ridge that has only partially been uncovered. Waziri said he expects more discoveries to be made there when archaeologists start more excavation work in January. 
The Fifth Dynasty ruled Egypt from about 2,500 BC to 2,350 BC, not long after the great pyramid of Giza was built.
Saqqara served as the necropolis for Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt for more than two millennia. 
Ancient Egyptians mummified humans to preserve their bodies for the afterlife, while animal mummies were used as religious offerings. 
Egypt has revealed over a dozen ancient discoveries this year.

The country hopes the finds will brighten its image abroad and revive interest among travelers who once flocked to its iconic pharaonic temples and pyramids but who fled after the 2011 political uprising.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo's parliament voted on Saturday to form a negotiating team to try to resolve outstanding disputes with Serbia, amid growing tensions between the two neighbors.
The two countries committed to a European Union sponsored dialogue aimed at setting all remaining issues between them in 2013, but little progress has been made since.
Relations between Belgrade and Kosovo have been strained since 2008 when Pristina, with the backing of western countries, declared independence from Serbia.
Kosovo's President Hashim Thaci raised concerns at home in June when he announced that he will seek a solution with Belgrade by changing borders.
And on Friday they reached a new low when Kosovo's parliament voted to approve the creation of a 5,000-strong standing army, only a week after Serbia's premier suggested such a move could provoke military intervention by Belgrade. 
Thaci's plan has rung alarm bells among many politicians in Kosovo, its Balkan neighbors and for some western diplomats who see it as an attempt to take three Serbian municipalities inhabited mainly by Albanians.
In return, Serbia would get part of northern Kosovo which is populated mainly by Serbs who refuse to recognize the authority of the government in Pristina.
Kosovo is recognized by more than 110 countries, including the United States, but not by Serbia, Russia or China.
Washington has said it will accept any deal if Serbs and Albanians agree, but opponents of border changes say it would validate ethnic cleansing, which was one of the main causes of the fighting in the Balkans in the 1990s.
""Today we have taken a decision that is important to save our sovereignty and integrity and in partnership with the international community,"" Kadri Veseli, the speaker of the Kosovar parliament, said after the resolution, which will be backed by law within 30 days.
Most opposition MPs boycotted the session to approve the negotiating team, which will have 12 members from government, the opposition and civil society.

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine chose the head of a new national Orthodox church on Saturday, marking an historic split from Russia which its leaders see as vital to the country's security and independence.
President Petro Poroshenko said 39-year-old Metropolitan Epifaniy of the Kiev Patriarchate church had been chosen as head of the church by a council, comparing the move to Ukraine's referendum for independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. 
""This day will go into history as a sacred day ... the day of the final independence from Russia,"" Poroshenko told thousands of supporters, who shouted ""glory, glory, glory"".
""And Ukraine will no longer drink, in the words of Taras Shevchenko, 'Moscow's poison from Moscow's cup,'"" he said, quoting the country's national poet. 
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow's seizure of Crimea in 2014. Ukraine imposed martial law in November, citing the threat of a full-scale invasion after Russia captured three of its vessels in the Kerch Strait. 
The Ukrainian Orthodox church has been beholden to Moscow for hundreds of years, and Ukraine's leaders see church independence as vital to tackling Russian meddling.
Kiev says Moscow-backed churches on its soil are a Kremlin tool to spread propaganda and support fighters in the eastern Donbass region in a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people. The churches strongly deny this. 
Epifaniy was chosen by a council at the St Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, built by the son of Prince Volodymyr whose baptism in 988 led to the spread of Christianity in the region.
A triumphant Poroshenko arrived in the morning, shaking hands with people, clenching his fist and crossing himself. The new church may boost the pro-Western leader, who lobbied hard for its creation and faces a tight election race in March.
""It is a church without a prayer for Russian power and the Russian army that kills Ukrainians,"" Poroshenko told the crowd after the announcement was made. 
But Russia bitterly opposes the split, comparing it to the Great Schism of 1054 that divided western and eastern Christianity. Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill made a last ditch appeal this week against the process.
On Saturday, the Russian church called the council a failure because only two members of the church it supports in Ukraine had attended the meeting, according to Interfax news. 
Spokesman Metropolitan Hilarion said the plan ""to persuade the canonical Ukrainian church to participate in the creation of the new structure failed ...with the exception of two traitors.""
'ROUGH PRESSURE' 
Ukraine won approval for the new church in October from the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul, the seat of the global spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians. 
""We want to support the process of Ukraine's split from Moscow and for us to have our own church, which is not governed from the Kremlin,"" said Lyudmyla Alekseyeva, 66, a pensioner who had come to the event with her daughter and granddaughter.
""The church should not depend on those who fight against us in the Donbass.""
Supporters wore ribbons in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag, with the message ""We are going our own way."" Many had waited outside in freezing temperatures while the council deliberated. 
Religious divisions deepened in Ukraine after 2014 and two Orthodox factions vie for dominance. 
The church known as the Moscow Patriarchate, aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, sees itself as the only legitimate church in Ukraine.
The rival Kiev Patriarchate was born after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its popularity has grown since 2014. It favors European integration and championed the independent church but the Moscow Patriarchate denounces it as schismatic. 
Ukraine's state security service raided Moscow Patriarchate church properties in the run-up to the council, but denied the raids were an attempt to silence opposition to independence.
Patriarch Kirill had appealed to world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, ahead of the council.

""Recently, the intervention of the leaders of the secular Ukrainian state in church affairs has acquired the character of rough pressure ... which allows us to speak about the beginning of full-scale persecutions,"" he said.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>","Kremlin should take the lead on rap music, not shut it down, Putin says","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday the Kremlin should play a leading role in Russian rap music and in youth culture, rather than trying to shut it down.
His comments follow a spate of concert cancellations by venue owners and local authorities across Russia and the brief arrest of a popular rap artist, Husky. The crackdown has sparked considerable discussion in recent months, especially among young people. 
Putin said such heavy-handed measures were often counterproductive, and suggested an alternative approach.
""If it's impossible to stop something, you've got to take charge of it,"" he said during a live broadcast of a meeting of his advisory council on culture and the arts.
""How to do this, how to take charge and guide in the necessary direction... That's the most important issue,"" he said, adding that the question would be discussed further by members of his administration and the culture ministry.
Husky, who raps in Russian and whose songs have at times been critical of the government, said his concerts were under pressure because authorities objected to lyrics they found offensive.
After his concert was canceled in Krasnodar, in southern Russia, he tried to perform from the roof of a car instead, leading to his arrest for hooliganism.
His arrest and sentence to 12 days imprisonment led to a public outcry and the rapper was released early, thanks to the intervention of members of the presidential administration, the editor of state broadcaster Russia Today said on Twitter. 
Putin on Saturday was responding to a statement about rap concert cancellations made by music producer and member of the advisory council Igor Matvienko. Among other suggestions, Matvienko proposed creating a parental advisory guidance system for concerts.
Addressing Matvienko, Putin said, ""You said that rap (rests on) three pillars: sex, drugs and protests. Of all of these, drugs are the most worrying,"" Putin said. ""They are the route to a nation's degradation.""
Putin also addressed the question of how to regulate the musical genre's use of censorious language. 
He said that he had talked about swearing with a linguist.
""She told me personally that it's a part of our language. It's just a question of how you use it,"" he said. 
Matvienko also suggested guidelines on the use of swear words online and in the media, but Putin said this was a sensitive matter as such words are part of Russians' common culture. 

Likening swear words to body parts, Putin joked: ""we have all sorts of body parts, and it's not like we put them on display all the time, whether it's hot or cold.""

A judge on Friday issued an arrest warrant for João Teixeira de Faria, known as ""John of God,"" giving until 2 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Saturday to surrender. His location was unknown as of Saturday afternoon.
In a video broadcast by news station GloboNews, Faria's lawyer Alberto Toron said he will report to authorities but could not say where or when. Toron denied the accusations and said he will file an appeal on Monday.
Faria became a celebrity when Oprah Winfrey broadcast a report of his healing methods in 2013.
He drew thousands of Brazilians and foreigners to the spiritual center he has led since 1976 in Abadiânia, a small town in the central Brazilian state of Goiás where a court authorized his arrest.
Faria denied the accusations on Thursday when he visited his center and spoke to a crowd of followers. He said he would comply with the law.

Faria, 76, could face charges of rape, with a prison sentence of 10 years if convicted, and rape of a vulnerable person, which carries a sentence of up to 15 years.

U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said on Thursday that China's quest for more power in Africa was evident in nations like Zambia, and China was poised to take over Zambia's utility company Zesco to collect the debt.
Zambia's presidential spokesman Amos Chanda told Reuters the figure of between $6-10 billion given by Bolton was wrong. Zambia's total external debt was now $9.7 billion including $3.1 billion owed to China, he said.
""It is regrettable that such information can come from such a high-ranking official. In fact, Zesco is not within the scheme of Zambia's debt to China,"" he added.
Chanda said Zambia valued its relations with both China and the US and would not deal with either of them exclusively. 
Bolton had called the business practices of China and Russia in Africa ""corrupt"" and ""predatory"" and said the United States planned to counter their economic and political influence. [L1N1YI10A]
In June, Zambia decided to delay all planned borrowing indefinitely, slowing down the accumulation of new debt amid worries about the risk of debt distress. 
President Edgar Lungu said last month Zambia is committed to improving the transparency of its debt management and will ensure that debt levels remain sustainable. 
The IMF rejected Zambia's borrowing plans in February, saying they risked making its debt load harder to sustain.

ASADABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - At least 20 Afghan civilians, including 12 children, were killed in an airstrike targeting a Taliban commander in the eastern province of Kunar late on Friday, local officials said.
The strike, against local Taliban commander Sharif Mawiya, was the latest in a series targeting senior insurgents, including the shadow governor of the strategic southern province of Helmand, who was killed on Dec. 2.
Several Taliban military commanders have been killed this month by Afghan forces, backed by U.S. advisers and air power.
The tactic has raised the risk of civilian casualties and Abdul Latif Fazly, a member of the provincial council, said eight women and 12 children were killed and more than 15 others wounded in Friday's airstrike. 
However a spokeswoman for the NATO-led Resolute Support mission denied that there were civilian deaths, although she said some civilians were wounded.
""The Taliban continue to use civilians as shields and barricade themselves inside compounds while engaging the Afghan forces,"" said Debra Richardson of Resolute Support.
She said U.S. airstrikes were supporting the new Afghan army strategy of targeting the entire Taliban organization, from low level fighters to high ranking leaders.
""We have reports over 40 Taliban fighters were killed in the Afghan-led operations, supported by U.S. air strikes in Kunar province,"" said Richardson.
Kunar governor Abdul Satar Mirzakwal said an operation by Afghan forces in Sheltan district killed 38 Taliban and al Qaeda members, including four foreign nationals, and wounded 12 more. He said the operation targeted Sharif Mawiya, a commander believed to be a facilitator with Al Qaeda militants.
He said an unknown number of civilians were hit in the strike but had no casualty details.
""We know that a number of civilians, including women and children have been killed but we are sending a fact finding team,"" he said.
The number of Afghan civilians killed in U.S. and Afghan airstrikes has risen sharply this year as Western-backed forces have stepped up aerial operations with the aim of forcing the Taliban to agree to peace talks.
According to United Nations figures, 313 civilians were killed and 336 wounded in airstrikes by U.S. and Afghan forces in the nine months to the end of September, a 39 per cent increase from the same period in 2017.
Airstrike casualties accounted for eight percent of the total 8,050 civilian casualties during the period. The overall number of civilian casualties was roughly stable.

PARIS (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters took to the streets of French cities on Saturday in the fifth weekend of nationwide demonstrations against Emmanuel Macron's government, despite calls to hold off after a gun attack in Strasbourg earlier this week.
In Paris, police were out in force to contain outbursts of violence. But the demonstrations were noticeably smaller than in previous weeks, possibly a response to the Strasbourg attack or to the cold, rainy weather.
Police fired water cannon and teargas in the afternoon to disperse groups of protesters in sporadic, brief clashes with riot police on the Champs-Elysees and adjacent streets.
A handful of topless feminist activists braved chilly temperatures to face off with security forces, a few meters away from the Elysee Palace, the president's residence.
French media also broadcast footage of clashes between police and protesters in Nantes, western France, and further south in Bordeaux.
The 'yellow vest' movement started in mid-November with protests at junctions and roundabouts against fuel tax increases, but quickly became a wider mobilisation against Macron's economic policies.
Successive weekends of protests in Paris have lead to vandalism and violent clashes with security forces. Despite the protests, several major stores, such as the Galeries Lafayette, opened to lure in Christmas shoppers. 
Loic Bollay, 44, marching on the Champs-Elysees in a yellow vest, said the protests were more subdued but the movement would go on until the demonstrators' grievances were addressed.
""Since the Strasbourg attack, it is calmer, but I think next Saturday and the following Saturdays...it will come back.""
The Interior Minister said around 69,000 police were active on Saturday with a reinforced presence in the cities of Toulouse, Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne. 
According to official figures, 33,500 protesters had been counted in France by 1300 GMT compared to 77,000 at the same time on Dec. 8.
In Paris, more than 2,000 protestors marched in splintered groups in several neighborhoods, and at least 148 were arrested by mid-afternoon, according to a Paris police official.
On Friday, President Macron called for a return to calm in France after nearly a month of protests by the so-called 'yellow vest' movement against his government's policies. The demonstrations have hit growth and caused widespread disruption.
""France needs calm, order and a return to normal,"" Macron said, after a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels.
In a televised address to the nation on Monday, Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners in further concessions meant to end the movement, but many said they would maintain pressure.

The government, as well as several unions and opposition politicians called on protesters to stay off the streets on Saturday, after four people were killed in a gun attack at a Christmas market in the historic city of Strasbourg.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Western tourists, a rarity in Saudi Arabia, visited this weekend under a new visa system, as one of the world's most inaccessible countries tries to open up its society and diversify its economy away from oil.
Thousands of fans flocked to Riyadh's historic Diriyah district for Formula E, a motor sports tournament using electric vehicles, and concerts including by David Guetta and Black Eyed Peas.
Most were Saudis still unaccustomed to such entertainment in their own country, where cinemas and public concerts were banned until changes by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the past two years.
Despite an international outcry over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the Saudi-led war in Yemen, some Westerners also seized the opportunity to visit a country that still largely restricts foreigners to resident workers and their dependents, business visitors, and Muslim pilgrims.
An American named Jason is spending a week here with his German wife, riding quad bikes in the desert and visiting heritage sites in Ushaiger, 200 km (120 miles) northwest of the capital.
""The race sounds interesting but to be honest it was a means to see the country. We're happy to be here,"" he said. ""I've always wanted to come for many, many years... I'm so happy to be here and that they're letting us be here.""
Aaron, a 40-year-old software engineer, travelled from New York for two days. He and a few dozen other adventure travellers seeking to visit every country in the world checked the desert kingdom off their list this weekend.
""Saudi Arabia's always been an exotic place... and I didn't think I'd ever be able to come here,"" he said as circus performers entertained guests in between races.
Some 1,000 foreigners from 80 countries received the new ""sharek"" visa, which is linked to a specific entertainment event, the authorities said.
That is a fraction of what they eventually hope to attract.
""Hopefully we will learn from this and see what we need to do for the future, but I can tell you from now that there is a lot of demand..."" said Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal, vice chairman of the General Sports Authority.
TOURISM TARGETS
Whizzing electric racecars wound through the ruins of Diriyah, the capital of the first Saudi state built by the ruling Al Saud family three centuries ago.
The UNESCO world heritage site is undergoing a multi-million dollar renovation, celebrating a telling of national history that puts the dynasty and its clerical allies front and centre.
Plans to admit significant numbers of tourists from abroad have been discussed for years, only to be blocked by conservative opinion and bureaucracy.
Now the crown prince is seeking to develop new industries to wean the world's top oil exporter off petro-dollars.
Tourism is high on the agenda, despite a shortage of infrastructure. Reforms aim to lift total spending - by locals and foreigners - to $46.6 billion in 2020 from $27.9 billion in 2015.
Such efforts have been overshadowed recently by the murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the crown prince, with the U.S. Senate blaming Prince Mohammed and insisting that Saudi Arabia hold accountable anyone responsible.
Saudi officials have denied Prince Mohammed ordered the hit, but their changing accounts and ties between him and some of the suspects have complicated Riyadh's efforts to move on.
James, another American tourist, said the visit corrected some of his preconceived notions, but he bristled at the idea that visiting a country implied endorsing its government.
""Just forget the politics and you can relate to people all over the world,"" he said. ""That applies to Saudi Arabia, too.""

Stung by Merkel's failure to make the beginning of the Buenos Aires G20 summit on Nov 30, Defence Minister Ursula Von der Leyen announced plans to buy another jet and boost the staffing of the air force VIP transport wing.
In an interview with newspaper Bild am Sonntag (BamS), extracts of which were released on Saturday, Von der Leyen said the government would set aside up to 300 million euros to add another long-range aircraft to the existing Airbus fleet.
""That the Chancellor arrived late to the G20 summit was bitter,"" she said. ""To stop that happening again, we are expanding crews and looking at buying one or two further long-range aircraft.""
Merkel's flight to the summit of leaders of developed and emerging economy leaders was aborted an hour after take-off when communications systems failed aboard her A340 wide-bodied jet, forcing her to fly first class via Madrid the following day.
A switch to the air force's other long-range jet was impossible because the crew had already reached their maximum number of flying hours and no replacement shift was available.
Unlike many other major countries, Germany relies on a fleet of aging used jets to ferry its leaders around the world, reflecting a traditionally cautious approach to military procurement.
Across the armed forces, levels of deployability among military vehicles is low, with aircraft and tanks often out of service for repairs. Successive defence ministers have sought to change this, but have struggled in a country where the post-war culture of pacificism runs deep.

According to BamS, officers aim to buy at least one further long-range aircraft, probably a used A330 or, in a break with the tradition, a modern A350 fresh off the production line.

MALE (Reuters) - Police in the Maldives said they have frozen the bank accounts of former president Abdulla Yameen as they investigate allegations by state bodies that he conducted ""illicit"" deals, some involving Chinese infrastructure projects, whilst leader.
Yameen lost a presidential election in September and the new government of his successor, Mohammed Ibrahim Solih, seen as close to India, has been trying to determine the extent of Chinese loans used to finance a construction boom in the Indian Ocean archipelago.
The police said on Saturday a total of 100 million Maldivian Rufiyaa ($6.58 million) in both U.S. dollars and the local currency have been frozen as a part of the investigations.
Yameen has denied any wrongdoing and said that he took on loans to accelerate economic development. He could not be contacted on Saturday.
""We have noticed that several large transfers of money were conducted along with other transactions during the presidency ... in bank accounts operated under his name,"" the statement said.
""Yameen answered all questions posed to him during today's questioning and said that he will fully cooperate with the ongoing investigation,"" it added.
Critics have alleged that contracts were given to Chinese companies at inflated prices, such as a bridge connecting the capital Male to the main airport of the palm-fringed islands famous for their luxury diving resorts.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Seven civilians died and dozens were injured when Indian security forces opened fire at people protesting the killing of three militants in a gun battle in restive Kashmir on Saturday, police said.
    Defense spokesman Colonel Rajesh Kalia said an operation was launched in the morning in response to intelligence reports about the presence of militants in a village in Pulwama district, south of the state's summer capital Srinagar.
    ""During the operation militants fired upon troops, leading to a gun battle in which three militants were killed,"" he said.
    A senior police officer, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said large numbers of local people then gathered at the site, leading to clashes between them and security forces in which seven people were killed and about 50 injured.
    An eyewitness, Mohammad Ayuob, told Reuters Indian troops fired at the locals when they tried to retrieve the body of a militant.
Jammu and Kashmir is mainly Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state. India and Pakistan both rule the region in part but claim in full. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting trouble in its part of Kashmir, a charge Islamabad denies.
    The Himalayan state has been particularly tense over the past few months as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party pulled out of local government, leaving a power void. 
    Widespread protests have broken out in Srinagar and other parts of Kashmir over the killings. Security has been tightened and troops rushed to potential hotspots. A curfew was imposed in Pulwama town and surrounding areas, according to media reports. 
    The separatist group Hurriyat Conference called for a three-day strike and protests across Kashmir.
    ""Bullets and pellets rain!"" its Chairman Mirwaiz Omar tweeted, adding that their supporters would march towards an army cantonment on Monday so that the Indian government can ""kill all of us at one time rather than killing us daily"".
    Authorities have suspended train services in the Kashmir Valley and shut down mobile internet services to try and prevent the unrest from spreading.

    Indian security forces say they have killed 242 militants this year. In addition, 101 civilians and 82 security officials have also died, according to officials. The total death toll in violence is the highest in more than a decade.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - A military court in Ethiopia on Saturday jailed 66 soldiers for between five and 14 years for marching on Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's palace in October, ruling they had broken military ethics, officials said.
The 66 were among 200 soldiers in fatigues and red berets who descended, armed, on the compounds of Abiy's residence and office on Oct. 10 and met him in what the government initially said was a bid to press for a rise in pay.
But Abiy, who was shown on state television that day doing push-ups with the soldiers, subsequently announced that leaders of the group had ""nefarious aims"" to stop reforms and unnamed members had ""regretted missing out on the opportunity to kill him"".
On Saturday, Colonel Meshesha Areda, head of the military tribunals directorate, told reporters that a military court sentenced one defendant to 14 years in prison, while 65 others were slapped with sentences ranging from five to 13 years, for ""violation of military ethics"". 
""These sentences delivered today will serve as lessons,"" prosecutor Captain Hailemariam Mamo told reporters. 
There has been no word on legal action against other members of the 200-strong group.
The defendants’ lawyer Desalegn Dana said he would lodge appeals for a few suspects. 
Since his appointment in April, 42-year old Abiy has presided over a raft of reforms in the Horn of Africa country, including the pardoning of dissidents long outlawed by the government.
He has also acknowledged and condemned abuses by security forces, even likening them to state terrorism.
But violence has plagued the nation of 100 million people, often pitting different ethnic groups against each other, remains a challenge.

BIHAC, Bosnia (Reuters) - Harsh weather conditions and tight police border controls have stopped thousands of migrants from attempting to cross into Croatia at the European Union's Balkan frontier, leaving them stuck in impoverished Bosnia until spring.
Over 3,000 people have been cramped in three improvised migrant centers in the Bosnian towns of Bihac and Velika Kladusa, on the Croatian border, with emergency workers rushing to provide them with accommodation and food as winter bites.
""Here is a big problem with winter, when it is finished, I'm going to try again,"" said Hamza from Pakistan, echoing the words of others interviewed by Reuters in the Bira center in Bihac. 
A small refugee town has been set up in the giant concrete halls of a former factory, accommodating more than 2,000 migrants and refugees in heated tents and containers. They have three meals a day and access to medical services.
On Friday, some of the 180 unaccompanied minors from the center were enjoying playing in fresh snowfall, taking selfies.
The European Union has allocated more than 9.2 million euros ($10.4 million) to help Bosnia cope with the migrant influx before the winter, channeling funding through the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, officials told Reuters. 
Still recovering from a devastating war in the 1990s, Bosnia was bypassed in 2015 and 2016 when more than a million migrants and refugees passed through the Balkans on their way to the wealthier European countries.
But this year it has become a major transit country for migrants as other countries, such as EU members Hungary and Slovenia, sealed their borders.
More than 23,000 people, mostly from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, have entered the country since January. About 5,000 are now stuck, as the cold winter and Croatian police make it impossible for them to continue their journey.
""This is inhuman, the life of the migrants,"" said Wali Khan from Afghanistan, showing bruises on his hands that he said were inflicted by the Croatian police beating him with batons when he tried to cross the border earlier this week.
Croatia, the EU's newest member, denies accusations its border police are rough handling would-be refugees.
UNHCR, which helps refugees and migrants handle their asylum applications, says procedures in Bosnia are slow and complex.
""It is necessary to simplify and expand the access to the asylum procedure to all who want to seek asylum in Bosnia,"" said Neven Crvenkovic, a spokesman for the UNHCR regional office. 
While local authorities in northwestern Bosnia have limited new arrivals of migrants, saying there was no available accommodation, local people in Bihac, remembering their own plight as refugees during the 1990s, have tried to help.

Warning that a half-finished monetary union could be at risk in the next crisis, Draghi made the case for sweeping changes in how the currency bloc operates and spreads around financial risk. 
""The fascination with illiberal prescriptions and regimes is spreading; we are seeing little steps back in history,"" Draghi said in Pisa, Italy.
""Only by continuing to make progress, freeing up individual energies but also fostering social equity, that we will save (the European Project) through our democracies, with a unity of purpose,"" he added. 
Anti-establishment and often populist parties have made political headway across the globe in recent years, challenging the principles of open trade, multilateral cooperation and even democracy. 
Draghi, credited with saving the euro in the worst of Europe's crisis, called for deeper private risk sharing, the completion of the banking and capital market unions and argued for euro-wide backstops that could help the bloc's weaker members in case of market stress. 
Large institutional reforms have essentially stalled in recent years, mostly due to resistance from Germany, which fears that its taxpayers could be asked to foot the bill for the fiscal irresponsibility and excesses of weaker euro members. 
""Without appropriate backstops at the euro area level, individual countries in a monetary union can be exposed to self-fulfilling dynamics in sovereign debt markets,"" Draghi said in a likely warning to Italy, which has seen sharply higher borrowing costs amid a spat with the EU over spending plans.
But Draghi also said that the euro today is not as rigid as some argue. 
Even if it is too strong for some members and too weak for others, this misalignment has actually declined in recent years, he argued. 

Currency devaluation would also offer few benefits because such a big devaluation would be needed to gain a real advantage, that it would threaten the existence of Europe's single market and the welfare of the poorest members of society.

KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - United Nations' climate talks to agree on the rules of the 2015 Paris Agreement dragged on into an extra day on Saturday as ministers tried to overcome the last political hurdles after working through the night.
The schedule for the closing plenary, when sparks could fly among nations if there are issues in the text still open to opposition, has been repeatedly pushed back to later in the day - a sign a more diplomacy work needs to be done.
Some exhausted negotiators were seen leaving the conference venue in Katowice, Poland, in the early hours of Saturday morning to get a few hours' rest but many ministers worked through the night to try and iron out differences.
Despite this, European climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete seemed optimistic on Saturday morning.
""UN climate talks go into overtime. Latest version of the draft agreement just out...A deal to make the Paris Agreement operational is within reach,"" he tweeted.
The last stumbling blocks have been around the ambition of developed countries' emissions cut pledges which countries more vulnerable to climate change are trying to increase. 
Another sticking point remains over accounting rules for future carbon market mechanisms. A senior negotiator said Brazil still had concerns over the rules aimed at avoiding double counting emissions cuts.
""There are still a range of possible outcomes and Brazil continues to work constructively with other parties to find a workable pathway forward,"" Antonio Marcondes, Brazil's chief negotiator, told Reuters.
Countries are on a self-imposed deadline to produce a ""rulebook"" to flesh out details of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius and which comes into force in 2020.
Talks in Katowice have been going on for two weeks and were due to end on Dec. 14 but they have been clouded by political divisions.
A rift last week over how to express the importance of a U.N. commissioned report on keeping global warming within a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit appears to have been calmed, with language changed to ""note"" rather than ""welcome"" the report.
Talks have also faltered over increasing finance for climate adaptation for poorer countries. Governments have already agreed to raise $100 billion a year by 2020, but developing countries wanted more.

The latest text says a meeting in 2020 will start ""deliberations"" to increase that amount.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's exit from the European Union was heading for an impasse, one senior minister said on Saturday, after a week in which Prime Minister Theresa May failed to win EU assurances on her deal and pulled a vote because UK lawmakers would defeat it.
With just over 100 days until Britain leaves the bloc on March 29, Brexit remains up in the air with growing calls for a no-deal exit, a potentially disorderly divorce that business fears would be highly damaging, or for a second referendum.
May pulled a vote on her deal on Monday after acknowledging it would be heavily defeated over concerns about the ""backstop"", an insurance policy designed to avoid any hard land border for Ireland but which critics say could bind Britain to EU rules indefinitely.
Two days later, she survived a plot to oust her from her those in her own party who support a hardline Brexit, showing the level of opposition she faced.
May herself has acknowledged that Britain's parliament appears deadlocked with no clear support for any option, with the small Northern Irish party that props up her government leading the criticism of her deal.
""Brexit is in danger of getting stuck – and that is something that should worry us all,"" pensions minister Amber Rudd wrote in Saturday's Daily Mail newspaper.
""If MPs (lawmakers) dig in against the prime minister’s deal and then hunker down in their different corners, none with a majority, the country will face serious trouble."" 
At a summit in Brussels, May's attempts to get legal assurances from the EU that the Irish backstop would only be a temporary measure was rebuffed with the bloc's other 27 leaders saying they would not renegotiate the treaty.
However, May insisted at the summit's conclusion on Friday that further clarification was still possible with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying: ""We want to be helpful"".
Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said parliament could still rally behind May's agreement with additional assurances and said such clarifications were likely because EU countries knew no deal would be a disaster for them. 
""When the dust has settled, the only way we're going to get this through the House of Commons ... is to have a version of the deal that the government has negotiated,"" Hunt told BBC radio. ""I don't think the EU could be remotely sure that if we don't find a way through this we wouldn't end up with no deal.""
MINISTERS DIVIDED
However, the Times newspaper reported on Saturday that most of May's ministers thought her deal was dead and were divided over the way forward.
Some were reluctantly leaning towards a second referendum, others favored a closer, Norway-style relationship and a number, including Hunt, were willing to leave with no deal, the paper said. 
One senior minister told Reuters on Friday that the risk of a ""managed"" no-deal Brexit was rising as was the likelihood of a second vote on EU membership.
""We are not ready for no deal, the public is not ready for no deal,"" said the minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""There is no plan B, at least, not that will get the support of the House (of Commons).""
Rudd said a no-deal scenario ""mustn't be allowed to happen"" and urged lawmakers from all parties come together to stop it.
""We need to try something different. Something that people do in the real world all the time, but which seems so alien in our political culture – to engage with others,"" she said.
""We need to acknowledge the risk that parliament could spend the next precious few months debating about preferred solutions and end up with no compromise, no agreement and no deal.""
Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, a leading pro-EU advocate, said on Friday a second Brexit referendum was now the most likely outcome to break the stalemate, a view shared by ardent Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

""We're actually becoming more divided on this subject than perhaps we were two-and-a-half years ago and that's why I think a second referendum gets closer,"" Farage told BBC TV. ""I hate the thought of it, but I tell you what, I'm going to spend every minute getting ready for it.""

TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Elections officials across Florida say they expect former felons to flock to their offices to register to vote next month when a newly passed ballot initiative launches one of the largest enfranchisement efforts in modern U.S. history.
But partisan politics and logistical questions are clouding the Jan. 8 rollout of a state constitutional amendment that could restore voting rights to more than 1 million ex-felons in Florida.
Democrats and voting rights advocates cried foul this week when Governor-elect Ron DeSantis, a Republican and critic of the measure known as Amendment 4, said the Republican-controlled state legislature must first pass a law to implement its changes.
""I don't see any way around that, regardless of whether you want it, you know, all to be implemented tomorrow or whether you are trying to kind of frustrate it,"" DeSantis said in a recorded interview with the Palm Beach Post published on Thursday.
Representatives for DeSantis did not respond to Reuters' requests on Friday for additional comment. 
Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo in a statement called DeSantis' move an ""act of voter suppression by Republicans who want to pick and choose who should have the right to vote.""
And state Senator Dennis Baxley, the Republican chairman of the Ethics and Elections Committee, agreed the measure largely could take effect without new laws.
""No one in the Senate desires to slow walk this,"" he said. ""We want to get things in order.""
Democrats have celebrated the measure's passage as a civil rights victory, as well as a chance to expand the electorate in their favor in battleground Florida, the largest of the states that swing between parties in presidential elections.
Florida has barred ex-felons from voting for 150 years. African-Americans, who favor the Democratic Party, have been disproportionately affected by felon voter disenfranchisement.
The measure approved by more than 64 percent of Florida voters in November states that felons' ""voting rights shall be restored upon completion of all terms of sentence,"" with exceptions for those convicted of murder or sexual offenses.
Previously, felons could regain their voting rights by appealing for clemency to a state board, which under recent Republican control had approved only a few hundred requests each year with more than 10,000 applications pending.
Members of a bipartisan coalition that wrote the ballot initiative and campaigned for its passage are adamant that its language was designed to take effect without any further laws.
At the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, a champion of the measure, voting rights and elections project director Myrna Pérez said DeSantis' reported position ""sounds like the efforts of a bunch of politicians to try and thwart the will of the people.""
POLITICAL IMPACT
Research shows Republicans may not suffer much from the measure's implementation, said Marc Meredith, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied felon voting rights restoration.
Many of the new voters likely will not affiliate with either party, he said.
Based on voting patterns by former felons, Meredith thought the change may net some 150,000 additional votes statewide, and more would likely be Democrats than Republicans. But, he said, the numbers may not be overwhelming, even in a state that often sees razor-thin election margins.
""There is no convenient prescription that folks are just going to turn out one way or another,"" said Neil Volz, a former Republican who is now political director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that pushed for the measure.
In the Florida governor's race in November, there were more than 8 million ballots cast. DeSantis won by roughly 32,000 votes over his Democratic challenger, Andrew Gillum. According to the Florida Division of Elections, as of Oct. 31 there were about 13.4 million registered voters in the state.
Local elections officials are grappling with myriad issues, such as how to verify decades-old court records to determine voting eligibility.
""Nobody knows what they are doing,"" said Joyce Griffin, the supervisor of elections in Monroe County, which includes the Florida Keys. ""We need direction.""

She said she planned to register two friends with long-passed felony sentences at their homes when the measure takes effect on Jan. 8, and she will do the same for other eligible ex-felons who show up at her office.

KABUL (Reuters) - China pledged to help Afghanistan and Pakistan overcome longstanding suspicions, as officials from the three nations met on Saturday in the latest round of diplomacy aimed at opening talks with the Taliban to end the Afghan war.
China, a close ally of Pakistan, has lately deepened its economic and political ties with Kabul and is using its influence to try to bring the two uneasy South Asian neighbors closer, at a time when the United States has sought Pakistan's help with faltering Afghan peace talks.
The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, met the foreign ministers of Afghanistan and Pakistan in Kabul to put into effect a memorandum of understanding on security cooperation and support for Afghanistan's efforts to open talks with the Taliban.
""China approves of this, and is willing to provide support and help for Pakistan and Afghanistan to improve their ties,"" Wang told reporters after the meeting.
The meeting, which followed initial talks between the three countries a year ago, is the latest sign of China's increasing engagement in the region, where it has invested massively in the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a central part of its global Belt and Road initiative.
Direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban collapsed in 2015, and the Taliban, fighting to drive out international forces and re-establish their version of strict Islamic law, have repeatedly rejected the direct peace talks offered by the Western-backed Afghan government.
However, they have opened contacts with the United States to prepare for possible talks to end a war that has killed and maimed tens of thousands in the 17 years since a U.S.-backed campaign overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani recently formed a 12-strong team to negotiate with the Taliban, but has said any deal could take at least five years to implement.
""We support Afghanistan and Pakistan efforts for peace and we call on the Taliban to join the peace process,"" said Wang, adding that both countries have agreed to resolve disputes through ""friendly consultations.""
Political tensions, coupled with allegations that security agencies in both countries support militant groups that bring deadly attacks against one another continue to strain relations between Kabul and Islamabad.
Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Islamabad was committed to stability and peace in Afghanistan.
""By blaming, no one moves ahead, we have to stop pointing fingers at each other that why I am here to build mutual political trusts and facilitate the peace process of Afghanistan,"" he said.
Earlier this month U.S. President Donald Trump requested Pakistan's support for the U.S. effort to advance the Afghan peace process.

The officials also signed agreements to enable the expansion of CPEC to Afghanistan through road and rail links.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2018 05:58AM ET</span>","Ethnic violence in southern Ethiopia kills 21, wounds 61 - state news","ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Heavy fighting between ethnic groups in southern Ethiopia has killed at least 21 people and wounded 61, its state news agency said on Saturday, amid escalating violence that has sent hundreds fleeing across the border to neighboring Kenya.
Outbreaks of violence in the south between the Oromo and other groups have escalated since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed - the first leader from the Oromo ethnic group in Ethiopia's modern history - came to office in March.
Fighting broke out between Somalis and Oromos in Moyale, a town bordering Kenya, on Thursday and Friday, the Ethiopia News Agency said, citing Suraw Mohammed, deputy spokesman of Somalia Regional State. 
He said some of the displaced had fled to Kenya, while those who had stayed in Ethiopia were receiving humanitarian aid.
The two groups have been engaged in prolonged conflict which has however intensified in recent months.
Early this year at least 5,000 Ethiopians were forced to seek refuge in Kenya after several civilians were killed in what the Ethiopian military said was a botched security operation targeting militants in the country's south.
""People have been killed, business premises bombed and torched, houses have also been set ablaze in the fight between Oromo and Somali Garre fighters,"" said Wario Sora, a human rights activist from Moyale on the Kenyan side.
Patrick Mumali, Moyale sub-county deputy commissioner, confirmed late on Friday that hundreds of Ethiopians have crossed the border to Kenya.
An internal U.N. report dated Dec. 13 and reviewed by Reuters also confirmed the fighting, with heavy artillery being used, and said there was likelihood the conflict could spill over into Kenya.
An Ethiopian source in the capital in touch with people in Moyale said at least several dozen people had so far died in the fighting, which was more intense than previous clashes in the same area earlier in the year.

In the Oromiya region, the largest in the country and home to the largest ethnic group, the Oromo, there are at least four separate conflicts along ethnic lines in addition to a border dispute that risks erupting into new violence, aid groups say.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2018 05:39AM ET</span>",Australia recognizes West Jerusalem as Israel's capital but embassy not moving yet,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia formally recognizes West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, reversing decades of Middle East policy, but will not move its embassy there immediately, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday.
""Australia now recognizes West Jerusalem, being the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, is the capital of Israel,"" Morrison said.
""We look forward to moving our embassy to West Jerusalem when practical,"" he told reporters in Sydney. 
Morrison also confirmed Australia's support for a two-state solution with a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem.
In October, Morrison said he was open to shifting Australia's embassy from Tel Aviv. President Donald Trump's move of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in May delighted Israel, infuriated Palestinians and upset the wider Arab world and Western allies.
Morrison's unexpected announcement in October was viewed cynically at the time because it came days before a crucial by-election in an electorate with a strong Jewish representation, a poll his party subsequently lost.
It also drew criticism from Muslim-majority neighbors such as Indonesia and Malaysia, neither of whom formally recognize Israel's right to exist. Arab countries worried that the move would unnecessarily inflame tensions in the Middle East.
The Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said that the Australian announcement was born of ""petty domestic politics."" 
""The policies of this Australian administration have done nothing to advance the two-state solution,"" Erekat said in a statement. ""All of Jerusalem remains a final status issue for negotiations, while East Jerusalem, under international law, is an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territory.""
Indonesia's foreign ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, noted that Australia had not moved its embassy to Jerusalem and called on all members of the United Nations to recognize a Palestinian state ""based on the principle of two-state solutions"".
Morrison said Australia would not move its embassy to West Jerusalem until the city's final status was determined, but said trade and defense offices would be opened there.
The status of Jerusalem, home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths, is one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians who want East Jerusalem recognized as the capital of a Palestinian state.

Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital, including the eastern sector that it annexed in a move not recognized internationally, after the 1967 Middle East war.

Israel says Islam Abu Humaid, 32, threw a 40 pound (18 kg) marble plate from a rooftop, killing an Israeli special forces sergeant, Ronen Lubarsky, 20, during a May arrest raid in El Amari refugee camp in the Palestinian city of Ramallah.
Israeli forces arrived at the El Amari camp before dawn on Saturday, sealed off the four-storey Abu Humaid house and destroyed it, the military said in a statement.
The Abu Humaid family home has been destroyed before and rebuilt. Two other Abu Humaid sons are in Israeli custody, charged with the killings of five Israelis, and another two face lengthy incarceration for serious security offences. 
A sixth Abu Humaid son was killed by Israeli forces in 1994 after himself being involved in a deadly ambush against an Israeli intelligence officer in the West Bank.
According to the indictment against him, Islam Abu Humaid told interrogators that he wanted to avenge the injury of one of his brothers in a previous Israeli army raid.
""What can we do? This is an enemy who thinks that by doing such actions they will terrorize us and make us fear them,"" said Islam's mother, Latifa Abu Humaid. 
""On the contrary, our animosity becomes stronger, and with it our perseverance and strength.""
Israeli rights groups have criticized family-home demolitions of Palestinian attackers as acts of vengeance and collective punishment.
Israel’s Supreme Court has largely upheld the demolition policy. Israeli officials have termed it both punitive and a deterrence to potential attackers.
""The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) will continue operating in order to thwart terror and maintain security in the area,"" the military said.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemned the demolition.
Tensions flared this week in the West Bank with a string of Palestinian attacks that killed an Israeli baby and two Israeli soldiers and Israeli forces shot dead four suspected Palestinian assailants.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that in response to the attacks, slated demolitions would be sped up.

Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's embattled Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned on Saturday, only a month and a half after taking office and giving the country's president political space to prevent an imminent government shutdown.
    The South Asian island has been in political limbo since President Maithripala Sirisena in late October replaced former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with Rajapaksa, who was then twice sacked by parliament but had refused to resign.
    But as a government shutdown loomed, Rajapaksa put in his papers and said in a statement on Saturday that a change of government that ""the people expected"" has now been put off.
    ""I have no intention of remaining as Prime Minister without a general election being held, and in order to not hamper the President in any way, I will resign from the position of Prime Minister and make way for the President to form a new government,"" Rajapaksa said in the statement.
    He emphasized the need for an election to resolve the county's economic and political crisis and said the main challenge now was to form a government. He also spoke against what he described as the ""destructive forces"" of people seeking to restore their former offices.
    ""We will bring the forces opposed to the country down to their knees by organizing the people,"" Rajapaksa said.
    Representatives of Sirisena and Wickremesinghe could not immediately be contacted.
    Wickremesinghe's office on Friday said that Sirisena had called the former prime minister by telephone to invite him to be sworn back into office on Sunday. Sirisena had previously said he would not appoint Wickremesinghe ""even if he has the backing of all 225 lawmakers in parliament"".
    The country's parliament had voted to cut the budget for Rajapaksa and his ministers after Sirisena had refused to accept no confidence votes against Rajapaksa saying that due procedure was not followed.
    It remains unclear how Sirisena plans to end the political crisis that threatens to shut down the government on Jan. 1, by which time a temporary budget must be approved by parliament.
    The country's Supreme Court on Friday rejected Rajapaksa's bid for an injunction on a lower court's order that barred him and his cabinet from carrying out their roles in government.
    Many foreign countries have refused to recognize Rajapaksa's government. Credit rating agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor's have downgraded Sri Lanka, citing refinancing risks and an uncertain policy outlook.
    Earlier this week, the island nation's parliament passed a vote of confidence in favor of Wickremesinghe, as it sought his reinstatement as prime minister by the president to defuse the political crisis.

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>",Qatar says Gulf Arab bloc needs reform to give it teeth,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Eric Knecht
DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar said on Saturday it remained committed to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) but the bloc needed to enforce its own rules better, signaling a reformed alliance could help end a row between Doha and some of its neighbors.
Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar was still counting on Kuwait and other regional powers to help solve the row that has seen Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and non-GCC member Egypt impose a political and economic boycott on Doha since June 2017.
""We believe that we are more relevant as a bloc"" for the West than as separate and fragmented countries, he told the annual Doha Forum, but said the GCC had ""no teeth"" and needed a dispute resolution mechanism.
""They have mechanisms in place and never trigger them (to hold people accountable) because some countries believe they are non-binding, so we need to make sure all the rules we are submitting to are binding to everyone in this region."" 
The four states accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and cozying up to regional foe Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the boycott aims to curtail its sovereignty. 
The dispute has eluded mediation efforts by Kuwait, which along with Oman is a part of the GCC, and the United States, which believes Gulf unity is essential to containing Iran.
In a sign the dispute still festered, Qatar's emir did not attend an annual Gulf summit on Sunday. Doha earlier announced it was quitting OPEC to focus on gas in a move seen as a shot at the oil exporter club's de facto ruler Saudi Arabia.
""In the Gulf crisis our position remains unchanged - lifting the blockade and settling the differences via dialogue,"" Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani told the forum.
EU OFFERS TO HELP
The boycotting states say the dispute is not a priority and insist Qatar meet a list of demands submitted to it at the start of the crisis that include closing Al Jazeera TV, reducing ties with Tehran and closing a Turkish military base in Qatar.
Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Muslim Iran are locked in several proxy wars in the Middle East, while Turkey's ties with the kingdom have been strained by the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.
Foreign ministers from Iran and Turkey, which both supported Qatar in the row, are attending the two-day forum.
Romania's foreign minister, Teodor-Viorel Meleşcanu, told the gathering that the European Union is working on organizing a conference that could help solve the Gulf rift.
""We are thinking about a joint event for the EU and Arab countries and we would like to have a direct discussion with the GCC countries. We hope to hold it in April and in principle it would take place in Bucharest,"" he later told Reuters.
Romania takes the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU from January for the next six months. 
Bahrain's foreign minister said on Saturday there was no need for mediation as the solution lay in Doha's hands.

""It is not our crisis, it is Qatar's crisis. So there is no need for a mediator to solve it, what it needs is for a wise person from its (Qatar's) people,"" Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa tweeted.

The Turkish military said on Friday it killed eight Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants, prompting Iraqi authorities to summon the Turkish ambassador in Baghdad. 
Turkey regularly hits PKK bases across its southern border, saying the militants use the remote and mountainous northern Iraqi region as a base for deadly attacks inside Turkey, where the outlawed group has waged an insurgency since the 1980s.
President Tayyip Erdogan threatened to launch a ground offensive in northern Iraq earlier this year. This week he also announced an imminent operation against a Kurdish militia in neighboring Syria.
The U.S.-backed YPG militia, which has been fighting Islamic State in Syria, controls Syria's northeastern border with Turkey. Ankara says it is an extension of the PKK and poses a direct threat to Turkey.
""The activities of the PKK terrorist organization in the territory of Iraq and Syria have become a national security issue for Turkey,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said. 
He said the government in Baghdad had a duty to prevent Iraqi land being used as a base for attacks on neighbors, and described Friday's air strikes as an act of self-defense which Turkey carried out because Iraq would not act.
""These operations in the fight against terrorism will continue as long as terror organizations nest on Iraqi soil and as long as Turkey’s security needs require it to,"" Aksoy said. 

The PKK is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. It has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast that has killed about 40,000 people.

Two people have been questioned in connection with the incident on Friday, after devotees fell ill when they ate tomato rice at a Hindu temple. Many people are still being treated for vomiting, diarrhea and respiratory diseases.
Media reports in India said the suspected food poisoning was the result of pesticide contamination but police said it was too early to draw conclusions about the cause.
""We have sent the organs of the dead people and the poisoned food to the forensic laboratory,"" Geetha MS, a senior police officer in the Chamarajanagara district where the temple is located, told Reuters. ""Only after receiving the report can we say what went wrong.""
Several crows and dogs were also found dead after eating the food, Geetha added.
In 2013, 23 school children died in the eastern state of Bihar in one of the worst outbreaks of mass food poisoning in the country. Police had suspected that it was caused by cooking oil that had been kept in a container previously used to store pesticide.
The Karnataka government would provide financial assistance of 500,000 rupees ($6,953.14) to the families of each of the dead, according to media reports.

Xi has pledged to wage war on graft until corruption of all kinds has been expunged at all levels of the Communist Party, from high-level ""tigers"" to low-level ""flies"".
He proclaimed during a twice-a-decade meeting of the top party leadership in October 2017 that his fight against graft had achieved ""overwhelming momentum"".
However, Xi announced at a meeting of the party's Politburo on Friday that the fight had now obtained an ""overwhelming victory"", state broadcaster CCTV reported.
The shift from ""momentum"" to ""victory"" reflects an important judgment from the party leadership, CCTV said.
China's powerful graft watchdogs handled 464,000 cases and punished 406,000 people in the first nine months of 2018.
""We must forcefully reduce the number of cases and effectively stop them from growing,"" the Politburo said, according to CCTV.
Xi said efforts to overhaul China's extensive anti-graft architecture must continue to modernize the systems of oversight for party members and state employees.
China's new National Supervisory Commission was formally established in March, extending the graft fight to all state employees and giving legal backing to the party's controversial internal investigation and detention techniques.

Some Chinese academics have voiced concerns that the reforms will roll back years of work by legal reformers to protect the rights of suspects during investigations.

WASHINGTON/TAOS, New Mexico (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's internal watchdog will investigate the death of a 7-year-old Guatemalan migrant which occurred after she was detained by U.S. border agents, officials said on Friday.
The Trump administration defended the treatment of the child, identified as Jakelin Caal by a Guatemalan official, and said there was no indication that she had any medical problems until several hours after she and her father were taken into U.S. custody on Dec. 6. The Guatemalan government had earlier identified the girl as Jackeline Caal.
Initial news reports said Caal died of dehydration and exhaustion. On Friday, U.S. officials said she had suffered cardiac arrest, brain swelling and liver failure.
The Office of the Inspector General, which looks into accusations of misconduct by public employees, will take the lead on the case. It said it would share the results of its investigation with the government, Congress and the public.
News of the child's death has added to criticism of President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policies from immigrant advocates and Democrats in Congress. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin on Friday repeated his call on Twitter for DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to resign, citing the case.
Nielsen described the death as ""heart-wrenching.""
""My heart goes out to the family, all of DHS. This is just a very sad example of the dangers of this journey,"" she said in an interview with Fox News Channel.
Record numbers of parents traveling with children are being apprehended while trying to cross the U.S. border with Mexico. In November, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers detained 25,172 members of ""family units,"" the highest monthly number ever recorded, the agency said.
The Trump administration has tried to deter people from crossing the border between ports of entry illegally to seek asylum, while also restricting access to official ports of entry. That has created a potential months-long wait for asylum applicants, including those who came as part of a large 'caravan' of Central Americans this year.
'NO INDICATION OF HEALTH CONDITIONS'
Caal and her father, who a Guatemalan official identified as 29-year-old Nery Caal, were detained after arriving on Dec. 6 at around 9:15 p.m. local time at the Antelope Wells port of entry, in a remote part of New Mexico, along with a group of over 160 migrants, U.S. officials said.
Four Border Patrol agents were on scene, and no medical staff were present, said a CBP official, on condition of anonymity.
""These aliens had traveled through Mexico for some period of time before they reached us,"" the CBP official said. ""They were actually in our custody for a very short time.""
A border agent asked the father around 20 questions as part of an initial medical screening. He checked ""no"" on a form asking if the child had any illnesses, a DHS official told reporters on Friday on condition of anonymity. 
The form was provided in English, and the interview was conducted in Spanish, the CBP official said.
""The questions were asked, the observations were made, the father was there, and there was no indication that she had any health conditions,"" the official said.
The Guatemalan foreign ministry said in a statement that Caal's parents' native tongue is Q'eqchi', a Mayan language. Nery Caal told Guatemalan officials that he felt more comfortable speaking Q'eqchi' than Spanish, the foreign ministry said.
""They speak Spanish but they don't understand Spanish 100 percent,"" said Tekandi Paniagua, a Guatemalan consular official in Del Rio, Texas who spoke to Nery Caal on Saturday and Monday, in an interview with Reuters.
At around 4:30 a.m. on Dec. 7, around seven hours after arriving at the border, the girl and her father boarded a bus for the Lordsburg border station in New Mexico, about 95 miles (153 km) away. While they were waiting for the bus, they had access to water and restrooms, the CBP official said.
Just before the bus departed at 5 a.m., Nery Caal told agents that Jakelin was vomiting. By the time the bus arrived at the station at 6:30 a.m., Caal was not breathing. She was treated by Border Patrol medical technicians and emergency services who arrived shortly after, and then taken to a hospital in El Paso, Texas.
A brain scan revealed swelling and the girl was diagnosed with liver failure. She died early in the morning on Dec. 8, with her father at the hospital, the CBP official said.
Nery Caal was released by Border Patrol under an order of supervision, and is staying at a migrant shelter in El Paso, Paniagua said. Paniagua said Nery Caal told him he had crossed the border planning to turn himself in to U.S. authorities, and will try to stay in the United States.
CONGRESS LEARNED VIA MEDIA
Senate Democrats criticized the Trump administration for not revealing Caal's death for nearly a week. 
A Congressional requirement directs CBP to report the death of individuals in its custody within 24 hours to the appropriations committees in both the Senate and House of Representatives. Jay Tilton, a spokesman for the Senate appropriations committee, said in an email that it ""was not alerted"" to Caal's death.
A House Democratic aide said on condition of anonymity that members of the appropriations committee in that chamber were also not alerted to Caal's death, and have asked DHS and CBP to explain.
Senior House Democrats wrote in a letter that the watchdog should investigate the delay in informing Congress. ""It is hard to overstate our frustration with the fact that we learned of this incident through media reports one week after the incident occurred,"" they said.

CBP officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A DHS official on Friday declined to comment on the agency's conversations with members of Congress.

The Yazidi survivor was speaking to a crowd of hundreds in Sinjar, her hometown in northern Iraq.
""With the money I got from the Nobel Peace prize, I will build a hospital in Sinjar to treat ill people, mainly widows and women who were exposed to sexual abuses by Islamic State militants,"" she told the crowd and gathered journalists. 
She thanked the Iraqi and Kurdistan governments for agreeing to her plan and said she would be contacting humanitarian organizations ""soon"" to start construction.
Murad was awarded the $1 million prize alongside Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict.
She was one of about 7,000 women and girls captured in northwest Iraq in August 2014 and held by Islamic State in Mosul, where she was tortured and raped.
She escaped after three months and reached Germany, from where she campaigned extensively to appeal for support for the Yazidi community.
The Yazidi area in Sinjar had previously been home to about 400,000 people, mostly Yazidis and Arab Sunnis.

In a matter of days, more than 3,000 Yazidis were killed and about 6,800 kidnapped, either sold into slavery or conscripted to fight for Islamic State as the religious minority came under attack.

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - The Nigerian military on Friday lifted a suspension of United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund activities in the northeast of the country, hours after it was imposed amid accusations that UNICEF staff spied for Islamist militants in the restive region.
Nigeria's northeast has been torn apart by a decade-long insurgency by Boko Haram and its splinter group Islamic State West Africa, in which more than 30,000 people have been killed and many more driven from their homes. With millions displaced, the northeast is largely dependent on international aid.
Earlier on Friday, the Nigerian military said UNICEF had been training people to sabotage troops' counter-insurgency efforts by uncovering alleged human rights abuses by the military.
In its statement, the Nigerian military said UNICEF staff ""train and deploy spies who support the insurgents and their sympathizers"".
These were ""unwholesome practices that could further jeopardize the fight against terrorism and insurgency"", it said, adding that UNICEF's operations were being suspended in the northeast until further notice.
But in a second statement hours later, the military said it held an emergency meeting with UNICEF representatives late on Friday. 
""After extensive deliberations on the need to seek modalities to work harmoniously with the security agencies in the theater of operation, the Theatre Command has henceforth lifted the three months suspension earlier imposed on UNICEF,"" the military said in its second statement. 
In its second statement, the military said during the meeting it urged ""UNICEF representatives to ensure they share information with relevant authorities whenever induction or training of new staff is being conducted in the theater"".
Earlier, after the allegation and suspension, a UNICEF spokeswoman said the organization was ""verifying the information"".
In April, Nigeria's military declared three UNICEF employees ""persona non grata"", in connection with alleged leaks of information about soldiers sexually abusing children in the northeast, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The declaration was rescinded days later after pressure from diplomats, the sources said.

Nigeria's military is highly sensitive to allegations of human rights abuses.

The case has caused global outrage and has damaged the international standing of the 33-year-old crown prince, the kingdom's de facto ruler. The U.S. Senate on Thursday delivered a rare rebuke to President Donald Trump for his support of the crown prince, whom it blamed for the killing.
""The United States, Germany, France, Canada, we made them all listen... The man clearly says 'I know how to cut'. This man is a soldier. These are all in the audio recordings,"" Erdogan said in a speech in Istanbul. He did not give further details about the recording.
BODY NOT FOUND
Istanbul's chief prosecutor has said Khashoggi was suffocated by his killers in the consulate, before his body was dismembered and disposed of. His remains have not been found.
Khashoggi repeatedly told his killers ""I can't breathe"" during his final moments, CNN reported on Monday, quoting a source who said they had read the full translated transcript of an audio recording.Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh later said Khashoggi had been killed when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
Erdogan renewed his criticism of Riyadh's explanation of the killing. Originally it had said Khashoggi had left the consulate. That was disputed by his Turkish fiancee, who had waited outside the building and said he never emerged.
""The prince says Jamal Khashoggi left the consulate. Is Jamal Khashoggi a kid? His fiancee is waiting outside,"" Erdogan said. ""They think the world is dumb. This nation isn't dumb and it knows how to hold people accountable.""
Turkish officials said last week that the Istanbul prosecutor's office had concluded there was ""strong suspicion"" that Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide to Prince Mohammed, and General Ahmed al-Asiri, who served as deputy head of foreign intelligence, were among the planners of Khashoggi's killing. 
After Riyadh ruled out extraditing the two men, Turkey said this week that the world should seek out justice for Khashoggi under international law.

Erdogan has repeatedly said he would not give up the case. Trump has said he wants Washington to stand by the Saudi government and the prince, despite the CIA assessment that it was probably the prince who ordered Khashoggi's killing.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge on Friday issued an arrest warrant for a famed Brazilian faith healer who has been accused of sexual abuses by more than 200 women in what prosecutors say could be the worst serial sex crimes case in the country's history, authorities said.
João Teixeira de Faria, known as ""John of God"", became a celebrity when Oprah Winfrey broadcast a report of his healing methods in 2013.
He drew thousands of Brazilians and foreigners to the spiritual center he has led since 1976 in Abadiania, a small town in the central Brazilian state of Goias where a court authorized his arrest.
State prosecutors told Reuters they have taken statements from more than 30 women who say they were sexually abused or assaulted while seeking spiritual guidance or psychic healing from him. 
""More than 230 women have contacted us by email and another 50 by telephone,"" said prosecutor Luciano Miranda. ""If their stories are proven, this will be the worst sex crime case that Brazil has had.""
The alleged victims include women from the United States, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Bolivia, he said.
Faria denied the accusations on Thursday when he visited his center and spoke to a crowd of followers. He said he would comply with the law.
Faria, 76, could face charges of rape, with a prison sentence of 10 years if convicted, and rape of a vulnerable person, which carries a sentence of up to 15 years. 
Dutch choreographer Zahira Maus on a TV Globo program on Friday alleged Faria sexually assaulted her. Globo TV spent three months investigating the story and interviewed a dozen other women who said they had been abused by the healer.
His fame has been boosted by supposedly miraculous surgeries he claims to have performed with his hands and without anesthesia.
Winfrey said in a statement that she visited Faria's center in 2012 to explore his controversial healing methods for an program that aired the following year.
""I empathize with the women now coming forward and hope justice is served,"" she said.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's El Nacional newspaper, which has been heavily critical of the ruling Socialist Party, on Friday published its last print edition after struggling for years under government pressure and a collapsing economy. 
The paper, which is transitioning to a web format, has found it increasingly difficult to obtain newsprint due to exchange controls that make imports nearly impossible, and has potentially massive payments in a defamation lawsuit brought by Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello.
""I want to think that this is a pause,"" said the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Patricia Spadaro, at a press conference in the paper's empty offices. 
El Nacional said it will resume its print edition ""when the country returns to democracy,"" a reference to growing global criticism that President Nicolas Maduro has created a dictatorship.
Marcos Ruiz, Secretary General of Venezuela's Press Workers Union, described the end of El Nacional's print edition as part the government's hostile treatment of the press. 
The paper has over the years faced withering criticism, initially because it openly backed the founder of the Socialist Party, late president Hugo Chavez, in his 1998 campaign. 
By 2002, after the paper's editor fell out with Chavez, El Nacional celebrated a botched coup by dissident military officers, which critics called evidence it put politics over objectivity. 
It was often targeted for fueling the country's polarized politics by ignoring government supporters and unquestioningly championing its critics.
With inflation running at 1.3 million percent currently, the paper had struggled to retain staff. 

As elsewhere in the industry, El Nacional's print operation was also impacted by younger readers spurning physical newspapers for digital news.

The order follows a decision from Brazil's Supreme Court on Thursday to overturn an injunction that was preventing the extradition of the former left-wing guerrilla.
Brazilian police said they have not located Battisti, who was living in a coastal town in southern Brazil. 
Battisti's lawyer Igor Tamasauskas told Reuters he had filed an appeal against the Supreme Court decision, seeking to block another attempt to extradite his client. 
Battisti faces life in prison in Italy where he was convicted of four murders committed when he belonged to a guerrilla group called Armed Proletarians for Communism. He escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited.
The Italian government almost obtained his extradition in 2010 but leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva granted Battisti asylum on his last day in office that year.
Brazil's incoming far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, has said he would immediately extradite Battisti.
Temer agreed to extradite him last year, but Supreme Court Justice Luiz Fux upheld Battisti's asylum status after he was arrested trying to cross the border into Bolivia.
Fux on Thursday revoked his earlier injunction, saying the extradition should be a presidential decision, since the Supreme Court had already ruled for Battisti to be sent back to Italy in 2009.

ADEN (Reuters) - Fighting broke out on the outskirts of Yemen's port city of Hodeidah on Friday, residents said, a day after a ceasefire agreement was reached by the warring parties at U.N.-sponsored peace talks.
The main port used to feed Yemen's 30 million people is held by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that also controls the capital Sanaa and has been battling against a Saudi-led Arab coalition seeking to restore a government ousted in 2014.
Hodeidah has been the focus of fighting this year, raising global fears that a battle could cut off supply lines and lead to mass starvation. Yemeni forces backed by the Saudi-led coalition have massed on the city's outskirts.
Despite the ceasefire, one resident told Reuters he could hear the sound of missiles and automatic gunfire in the direction of the eastern 7th July suburb.
Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said coalition warplanes had launched two strikes on Ras Isa city north of Hodeidah. The coalition did not immediately confirm the report.
The warring sides agreed after a week of consultations in Sweden to cease fighting in Hodeidah and withdraw their troops as part of confidence-building measures to pave the way for a wider truce and political negotiations.
It was the first significant breakthrough for U.N.-led peace efforts to end the nearly four-year-old war that has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
Envoy Martin Griffiths said at the end of the peace talks that both parties would withdraw ""within days"" from the port and then from the city. International monitors would be deployed and all armed forces would pull back completely within 21 days.
A Redeployment Coordination Committee including both sides and chaired by the United Nations would oversee implementation.
Both sides issued statements following the talks claiming they would ultimately control Hodeidah.
Abdullah al-Alimi, a senior official in the office of the Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, tweeted on Friday the deal meant a Houthi withdrawal from the city and ""the legitimate authority will fully control security and administration"". The Houthis' media office tweeted that ""occupying forces"" would quit Hodeidah and ""the current authority will be the official authority"".
ROBUST MONITORING NEEDED
Griffiths told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that a robust monitoring regime was urgently needed in Hodeidah to oversee compliance with the truce. Such a monitoring mission needs a Security Council resolution, diplomats said.
He said retired Dutch Major General Patrick Cammaert agreed to lead monitoring and could arrive in the region within days.
""The process outlined on Hodeidah is one that's wracked with potential pitfalls -- the key will be ensuring an orderly withdrawal process in preventing spoilers from derailing the process,"" said Adam Baron of the European Council for Foreign Relations. 
The warring parties are due to hold another round of talks in January to discuss a framework for political negotiations.
Western nations, some of which supply arms and intelligence to the Sunni Muslim military coalition, have pressed alliance leaders Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to end the war following outrage over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul.

The attack took place hours before a suspected Islamist militant gunman killed four people at a Christmas market in the heart of nearby Strasbourg on Tuesday. Authorities have not linked the two incidents.

The figure was negotiated in more than a dozen meetings between the government and representatives from student and educator groups, Duque said in a video statement.
Student protesters from 32 public universities have clashed repeatedly with police during nationwide marches, snarling traffic and public transport in cities across the country.
Duque took office in August pledging to improve higher education, but the government has since said it faces a shortfall for social programs and funding in next year's budget.
""This agreement seeks not just the strengthening of the public education system but the firming up of resources - public universities will have more than 4.5 trillion during these four years,"" Duque said.
Student groups have not called off the strike, saying first they will discuss the deal with their members. 
Public university officials reckon the system has a cumulative deficit of $5.7 billion between operating and investment expenses.
Education spending covers 16 percent, or about $13 billion, of the total national budget for 2019.

MANAGUA (Reuters) - Nicaraguan police raided the offices of a prominent journalist often critical of President Daniel Ortega, the latest sign of a broad crackdown on civil society and independent media organizations.
Carlos Fernando Chamorro, the son of former president Violeta Chamorro, runs the digital newspaper Confidencial and hosts television news programs. He blamed the Thursday night raid and seizure of equipment on increasingly authoritarian efforts to purge the country of domestic dissent.
""This was an absurd attack on free expression,"" the award-winning Chamorro told Reuters on Friday.
Police seized computers and other equipment after breaking open door locks purportedly seeking to enter the offices of Cinco, a separate organization run by Chamorro that earlier in the week was ordered closed by lawmakers loyal to Ortega, he said.
Cinco, described on its website as a research organization focused on communications, culture, democracy and public opinion, had moved to another location years ago, but the police were not deterred, Chamorro said.
Nicaragua has been seized by eight months of anti-government protests, which have left at least 322 people dead and more than 500 people in jail, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, or Cenidh.
The human rights organization was one 10 non-governmental organizations that was stripped of legal status on Wednesday by Nicaragua's Congress, which is controlled by Ortega's allies. The move prohibits the groups from operating.
Earlier in the week, Nicaragua's telecommunications regulator ordered a satellite television network to remove from its offerings the opposition television news channel 100% Noticias.
Ortega's opponents accuse the veteran leftist of attempting to cement an authoritarian family dynasty along with his wife, Rosario Murillo, who he chose to be his vice president.
Chamorro is the son of slain journalist and businessman Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, who opposed right-wing dictator Anastasio Somoza in the late 1970s while at the helm of La Prensa newspaper.
Ortega was also a fierce opponent of Somoza but many of his critics today accuse him of employing similar tactics of repression.

""Our commitment will last as long as we can implement the government deal. When that will no longer be the case (our commitment) will end and the people should have a say again,"" Giorgetti, who is a member of the ruling League party, was quoted as saying by Italian news agencies.
Giorgetti is one of the most influential members of the coalition, which is made up of the League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
This wee, League leader Matteo Salvini dismissed a report saying that his ruling League party was considering pushing for a snap election in March.
Salvini, who is a deputy prime minister and interior, insisted the government will stay on for a full five-year term.
The League won 17 percent of the vote in March elections to become the largest party in a centre-right electoral bloc, which Salvini then abandoned to form a government in June with 5-Star.

The League is now Italy's largest party with more than 30 percent in opinion polls. Polls say most Italians consider Salvini the real power in the government and that the League would make significant gains in new elections.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 12:56PM ET</span>",'Who are you calling 'nebulous'?' May presses testy EU for Brexit help,"By Elizabeth Piper and Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday further assurances on her Brexit deal were possible after European Union leaders told her they would not be renegotiating the treaty and scorned her stilted defense of Britain's departure.
But EU leaders showed no sign of budging, saying it is up to May to sort out her problem getting a deal through parliament in the new year, or face the consequences of failure.
With the British parliament deadlocked, the ultimate destination of the Brexit project remains unclear, with possible outcomes ranging from a disorderly departure with no deal to another referendum on European Union membership.
May, who on Wednesday survived a plot in her party to oust her, rejected EU criticism of ""nebulous"" demands from a divided British political system and asked EU leaders at a summit in Brussels for political and legal assurances to help her win parliament around to her deal. 
She welcomed a statement by the other leaders on Thursday, describing the summit's conclusions as having ""legal status"". 
EU officials said the declaration of their good intentions not to bind Britain to EU rules forever was just that -- not a tweak to the treaty's so-called ""backstop"" to avoid a hard land border for Ireland.
Leaders were united that May will get no more from them, even at the 11th hour, to improve on a withdrawal treaty they agreed with her in Brussels just three weeks ago, officials insisted.
""Further clarification and discussion following the Council's conclusions is, in fact, possible,"" May said, refusing to be discouraged.
""There is work still to do. We will be holding talks in coming days about how to obtain the further assurances that the UK parliament needs in order to be able to approve this deal.""
HUMILIATION?
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron ruled out reopening last month's agreement, aimed at ensuring a smooth exit on March 29.
""We want to be helpful,"" Merkel said, adding that none in the EU want the disorder that the deal's collapse would mean.
Asked if there was more on offer from the EU, summit chair Donald Tusk said there was no question of new negotiations and that he had no mandate for more meetings. He added that he remained at the disposal of the prime minister over Christmas.
Tusk went out of his way to counter British media reports of May being ""humiliated"" on Thursday evening as leaders badgered her for clarity on what she wanted after surviving a bid this week by her own party to oust her.
""We have treated the prime minister with much greater empathy and respect than some British MPs, for sure,"" he told reporters.
EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker also played down a tiff caught on camera where May remonstrated with him about his remark that Britain's position on Brexit was ""nebulous"".
May herself said she accepted it had not been personal and Juncker, calling her ""a woman of great courage"", joked that they had kissed and made up afterward.
Key to solving the problem, the head of the European Commission said, was ""bringing down the temperature"" in the debate.
TOUGH AND TOUGHER
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, whose country's prosperity could be radically affected by the fate of its large and historically overbearing neighbor, said he too was trying to help, but that Dublin would not let the treaty be weakened.
Without a deal, a disruptive customs frontier with Britain's troubled province of Northern Ireland could be a real danger -- among the many unknowns facing Europe over the coming months. 
As the summit closed, sterling was down around 0.7 percent at $1.2573, set for its biggest weekly drop in seven weeks. 
After a punishing week, May was asked by a reporter for Britain's generally pro-Conservative Daily Mail which was worse - the malcontents at home or the ""euro bullies"" in Brussels - and whether she ever wanted to ditch her job and fly off to a remote island.
""Negotiations like this are always tough,"" May said. ""There are always difficult times and, as you get close to the very end, then that can get even more difficult because you're absolutely sorting out the last details of something.""
But May seemed to have failed to convince EU leaders that if they granted what she asked for, she could win over parliament - a case she had set out before dinner on Thursday.
""It would be very useful for us ... to know from the United Kingdom what assurances, what guarantees, what explanations they need,"" Varadkar told reporters.

ITAGUAI, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazil on Friday launched the first of five attack submarines built with French technology in a 35 billion-real ($8.9 billion) program planned to end in 2029 with delivery of a nuclear-powered submarine.
President Michel Temer and his right-wing successor, President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, both pressed the button that lowered into the sea the 1,700-ton submarine named Riachuelo at a Rio de Janeiro naval base. Temer's wife, Marcela, had christened the vessel, by smashing a champagne bottle against its hull.
The submarines being built by the Brazilian Navy in partnership with France's defense company Naval Group, formerly known as DCNS, are a modified version of the Scorpene class diesel-powered submarine.
While the first four submarines in the deal with Naval Group are conventional subs, the fifth will place Brazil in the club of only six nations with nuclear-powered submarines - the United States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, China and India.
The program has been delayed by budget cuts and corruption scandals involving contractors such as Brazil's largest engineering and construction firm Odebrecht. The launch date of the last submarines has been put back until 2029.
The launch of the Riachuelo gives the Brazilian Navy six submarines, adding to five older ones of German technology.
Admiral Bento Albuquerque, who will be mining and energy minister in Bolsonaro's cabinet when he takes office Jan. 1, said investment in the new sub program would total 35 billion reais at today's prices.
The new submarines are planned to equip the Navy to patrol Brazil's 3.5 million square-kilometer off-shore deep waters that contain vast wealth in oil and gas reserves of the so-called pre-salt region.
""Brazil has a vocation for peace and is building its submarine not to threaten anyone or unsettle the calm of international waters,"" Temer said.
""Brazil is building submarines because a nation with more than 7,000 kilometers of coastline cannot do without tools to defend its sovereignty and it marine riches,"" he said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - An estimated two million Venezuelans could join the ranks of migrants and refugees next year, swelling the total to 5.3 million as the country's meltdown continues, the United Nations said on Friday.
About 5,000 Venezuelans flee their homeland daily, down from a peak of 13,000 in August, said Eduardo Stein, a joint special representative for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
Stein described the two million figure as a planning estimate for migrants and refugees leaving for neighboring countries in the next 14 months who will need aid.
""The region had to respond to an emergency that in some areas of concern was almost similar to a massive earthquake. We are indeed facing a humanitarian earthquake,"" he told a news briefing. 
The U.N. appealed last week for $738 million in 2019 to help Venezuela's neighbors cope with the inflow of millions of refugees and migrants who have ""no prospect for return in the short- to medium-term"".
About 3.3 million Venezuelans have fled the political and economic crisis in their homeland, most since 2015, the UNHCR said.
About 365,000 of them have sought asylum, U.N. refugee boss Filippo Grandi said.
""The reasons these people left are ranging from pure hunger to violence and lack of security ... We at UNHCR believe many have valid reasons to seek international protection,"" he said.
Colombia has taken in one million Venezuelan nationals, with most others going to Brazil, Ecuador and Peru.
A bipartisan group of U.S. Senators proposed on Thursday giving temporary protected status to Venezuelan migrants to the United States.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro blames its economic problems on U.S. financial sanctions and an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries.
The U.N. aid plan, presented to donors on Friday, aims to help Venezuelans to become productive contributors in host countries, said Antonio Vitorio, director-general of the IOM. 

""This means focusing on access to the labor market, recognition of qualifications and also guaranteeing that the provision of social services in those countries - especially housing, health, and education - are up to the stress that derives from the newcomers,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested more immigrants who were in the United States illegally in the fiscal year through Sept. 30, 2018, than in any year since 2014, the agency said on Friday. 
The 158,851 people arrested in the 2018 fiscal year by ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations division, the branch that carries out immigration arrests and deportations, represented an 11 percent increase over 2017, according to agency data. 
ICE (NYSE:ICE) arrests of immigrants with no criminal history but who are in the country illegally increased by nearly one-third compared to 2017, to reach 20,464. Such arrests made up 13 percent of all ICE immigration arrests last year, compared to 11 percent the previous year.
Other immigrants arrested by ICE last year were either convicted criminals or had ""pending criminal charges"" at the time of their arrest, according to ICE data - though the latter category can include people who have been arrested by police but are not yet or ever charged with an actual crime. The number of people with pending charges arrested by ICE was 48 percent higher in 2018 than in 2017, while arrests of those with criminal convictions dropped slightly.
Those with criminal convictions made up 66 percent of all those arrested last year, while those with ""pending"" charges made up 21 percent.
Under President Donald Trump, U.S. immigration enforcement officers have expanded the arrest, detention and deportation of people in the United States illegally, including those with little or no criminal history or with deep roots in their communities.

The most common criminal charges or convictions for those arrested by ICE last year, according to its data, were driving under the influence, ""dangerous drugs,"" ""traffic offenses,"" and ""immigration,"" which includes crimes such as entering the country illegally, entering illegally more than once, falsely claiming U.S. citizenship, or ""alien smuggling.""

Both chambers of parliament have approved the new law, with the Bundesrat upper house giving its backing on Friday.
LGBT campaigners say the measure does not go far enough. They want new laws to make it easier for people who do not identify with the gender they were born with to change it on official documents.
The introduction of the new category came after the Federal Constitutional Court called on lawmakers to enact legislation to either introduce a third category or dispense with gender altogether in official documents.

The ruling followed a court appeal brought by an intersex adult and said that courts and state authorities should no longer compel intersex people to choose between identifying as male or female.

KIGALI (Reuters) - At least two Rwandan soldiers and an unknown number of rebels were killed when a group of attackers crossed into Rwanda from the Democratic Republic of Congo this week, President Paul Kagame said on Friday.
Kagame said the group, who crossed into the border town of Rubavu, may have been carrying out an attack to test Rwanda's defenses.
""I think a couple of soldiers were killed, a couple meaning two, three (from Rwandan side). We are still gathering sufficient information in terms of where they were coming from, assistance they had,"" he told a news conference.
""We are seeking clarification and collaboration from the authorities in Congo, cooperation in understanding what enabled this to happen,"" he said, adding the attackers suffered a number of casualties.
While Kagame did not identify the group, rebel groups among those operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo include the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).
A spokesman for FDLR said on BBC Kinyarwanda radio on Tuesday that they attacked Rwanda as they were pushing Rwandan troops who had tried to forcibly repatriate Rwandan refugees in Congo.
The FDLR includes former Hutu militiamen responsible for Rwanda's 1994 genocide who then fled into eastern Congo. Its presence on Congolese soil has been cited as a reason for a series of military interventions by Rwanda.
Kagame left open the possibility that the attack may have been mounted by a new group called RNC, one of several other groups which he said had joined forces with FDLR.
Millions died of conflict, hunger and disease during a 1998-2003 war in eastern Congo, fueled by Rwandan intervention, and the region remains plagued by dozens of armed groups that exploit its vast reserves of gold, diamonds and other minerals.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A robust monitoring regime is urgently needed in Yemen's port city of Hodeidah to oversee compliance by the warring parties with an agreed ceasefire in the region, United Nations Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Friday. 
The Iranian-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Yemen government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi agreed on Thursday to stop fighting for Houthi-held Hodeidah and withdraw their troops, the first significant breakthrough for U.N.-led peace efforts in five years of conflict.
""A robust and competent monitoring regime is not just essential, it is also urgently needed and both parties have told us they would very much welcome it and indeed depend on it,"" Griffiths told the 15-member council, adding that U.N. officials were already planning for such a deployment. 
Such a monitoring mission needs the backing of the Security Council in a resolution, diplomats said. 
Griffiths said retired Dutch Major General Patrick Cammaert had agreed to lead the monitoring component of the agreement, which took effect on Thursday when the deal was published. He said Cammaert could arrive in the region within days. 
""Being present in the field soon is an essential part of the confidence that needs to go with the implementation of this agreement,"" Griffiths said.
The council was already discussing a British-drafted resolution to enshrine five requests made by U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock - one of which was for a truce around facilities needed for aid and commercial imports - and diplomats said that would now be reworked to endorse the agreement reached in Sweden. 
""We hope to be able to work expeditiously with colleagues to bring about a Security Council resolution which will give the firmest possible support to what has been achieved so far,"" British U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce told the council. 
""As requested we will of course want - with colleagues - to address the monitoring requirements,"" she said. 
The conflict has pushed Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, to the verge of famine, and millions of people rely on food aid. More than 80 percent of Yemen's imports used to come through Hodeidah port, but that has slowed to a trickle. 
""The U.N. will take on a leading role in supporting Yemen Red Sea Ports Corporation in management and inspections at Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Issa,"" Griffiths said. ""The U.N. ... has developed a plan seeking specific support from member states in the port.""

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley warned that the Security Council would be watching: ""We must be ready to act if one or more of the parties fails to follow through.""

(Reuters) - An Irish-born priest, who was convicted of sexually abusing a girl in his care at a religious school in Santiago but served no jail time for the offense, left Chile on Friday for Rome after serving a four-year sentence. 
Critics have long pointed to the case of the Rev. John O'Reilly as an example of leniency in a country where the Roman Catholic church has long held powerful sway in politics and society. 
A judge in 2014 sentenced O'Reilly, a leader of the Legionaries of Christ religious order, to four years of ""supervised liberty"" for abusing a preteen girl at the private Colegio Cumbres in the affluent neighborhood of Las Condes between 2007 and 2009.
O'Reilly completed his sentence on Dec. 10, according to a statement issued by the Legionaries of Christ on Friday, and Chilean courts subsequently expelled him from the country.
He boarded a flight on Friday in Santiago bound for Rome, where he will await a formal canonical sentence from the Legionaries of Christ, the statement said. 
O'Reilly could not be immediately reached for comment.
The priest's release comes as a growing sex abuse grips the Catholic Church in Chile. Chilean prosecutors this year have investigated hundreds of cases of alleged abuse and cover-up by clergy. In May, all of the country’s 34 bishops offered their resignation to the pope.
O'Reilly's sentence has been criticized as lenient. During his sentence, he was not confined at home nor required to periodically check in with a parole officer, and was free to travel out of the country.
Prosecutors had requested he be sent to prison for 10 years.

The founder of the Legionaries of Christ, Mexican Rev. Marcial Maciel, was found by a Vatican investigation to be a fraud and pedophile who had fathered several children.

With the British parliament deadlocked, the future of Brexit has been thrust into doubt with possible outcomes ranging from a disorderly departure with no deal to another referendum on European Union membership.
In a sign of just how unpredictable Brexit has become, the senior minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the possibility of a second referendum was also growing.
The minister added that there was no consensus for any alternative to May's deal, which seeks to keep close trading ties with the bloc after leaving.
The option of a ""managed no deal"" is rising, the minister said, adding: ""We are not ready for no deal, the public is not ready for no deal."" 
""There is no plan B, at least, not that will get the support of the House (of Commons),"" the minister said. ""What May can bring back from the EU will not satisfy those that need satisfying.""
May has repeatedly warned that if her deal is rejected then the world's fifth largest economy might have to leave without a deal - the nightmare option for big business - or that Brexit might be thwarted altogether.
Both London and Brussels have stepped up planning for a no deal exit.
No deal means there would be no transition period so the exit would be abrupt, though the EU and Britain could try to make agreements on certain areas, for example on aviation, to reduce the expected chaos that would ensue.
Britain is a member of the World Trade Organization so tariffs and other terms governing its trade with the EU would be set under WTO rules.

Business leaders are triggering contingency plans to cope with additional checks on the post-Brexit UK-EU border that they fear will clog up ports, silt up the arteries of trade and dislocate supply chains in Europe and beyond.

""To ensure stability of the nation, former president ... Rajapaksa has decided to resign from the Premiership tomorrow after an address to the nation,"" Namal Rajapaksa, an MP in his father's party, said on his Twitter account.
The South Asian island has been in political gridlock for over a month since Sirisena replaced former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was then twice sacked by parliament but has refused to resign.
Sirisena did not accept the parliamentary votes, saying that due procedure was not followed.
It remains unclear how he plans to end the political crisis that threatens to shut down the government on Jan. 1 because a temporary budget must be approved by parliament before that.
Separately on Friday, the country's Supreme Court rejected Rajapaksa's bid for an injunction on a lower court's order that barred him and his cabinet from carrying out their roles in government.
Many foreign countries have not recognized Rajapaksa's government. Credit rating agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor's have downgraded Sri Lanka, citing refinancing risks and an uncertain policy outlook. 
Earlier this week, the island nation's parliament passed a vote of confidence in favor of Wickremesinghe, as it sought his reinstatement as prime minister by the president to defuse the political crisis.

Sirisena has repeatedly said he will not appoint Wickremesinghe ""even if he has the backing of all 225 lawmakers in parliament"".

Hodeidah became the focus of Yemen's nearly four-year-old war this year after the Saudi-led coalition launched an offensive to seize the city, a Red Sea port and supply line for millions of people at risk of famine, from Iranian-aligned Houthi forces that also hold the capital Sanaa.
At talks in Sweden on Thursday, the Houthis and the coalition-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi agreed to stop fighting in Hodeidah and withdraw forces.
It was a breakthrough for U.N.-led efforts to end the war that has killed tens of thousands of people and caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
Akram Ateeq, 31, used to support his mother, wife and child by selling fish near Hodeidah harbor but has been unable to work for six months due to battles on the outskirts of the city.
""We are happy there will be a halt to the war. We have no jobs and are living on aid. We need help,"" he told Reuters.
Residents reported lingering skirmishes on the northern and eastern edges of the city on Thursday night but said Hodeidah was calm by Friday morning. Streets were largely empty at the start of the weekend.
""We are happy about the ceasefire but are worried that the fighters will not abide by it,"" said teacher Iman Azzi, in her 50s. ""The war has destroyed us. We want to live.""
Youssef Abdo Ali, 44, has been struggling to feed his nine children since seeking refuge in Hodeidah. ""The war has wiped out everything,"" he said.
U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths, who secured Thursday's deal after a week of peace talks in Sweden, the first in over two years, said both parties would withdraw ""within days"" from the port, a major entry point for most of Yemen's commercial imports and aid supplies, and later from the city as a whole.
International monitors are to be deployed and armed forces would pull back completely within 21 days.
The warring parties are due to discuss a political framework for peace negotiations at a second round of talks in January.
""BUMPY"" ROAD AHEAD
The Sunni Muslim alliance led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) intervened in the war in 2015 to restore Hadi's government after it was ousted from Sanaa by the Houthis.
The Gulf states have come under pressure from Western allies to end the conflict, in which thousands of civilians have been killed in Saudi-led air strikes, rights groups say.
""The road ahead remains bumpy but the significant breakthrough will make peace possible,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted on Friday.
Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir later tweeted that Saudi Defence Minister Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had exerted ""great personal efforts"" to ensure the success of the Sweden talks, without providing details.
The war is seen as a broader proxy conflict between Iran and its major Middle East rival Saudi Arabia.
The UAE, which controls military bases in the coastal towns of al-Khokha and al-Mokha, has massed thousands of Yemeni forces on the outskirts of Hodeidah, the Houthis' main supply line.
Coalition warplanes have backed fighters battling Houthis in the eastern 7th July district of Hodeidah and near a university 4 km (2.5 miles) from the port and a few blocks from al-Thawra hospital, the main medical facility on Yemen's western coast.
The ceasefire has wider implications for millions facing possible starvation, as the port supplies two-thirds of the population of the impoverished country of 29 million people. 
Herve Verhoosel, senior spokesman for the World Food Programme, told a U.N. briefing in Geneva that the truce should enable a sustained flow of food, fuel and aid and prevent further price spikes.
He said it would renew access to Red Sea Mills, which stores 51,000 tonnes of WFP wheat stock but has been cut off since September due to fighting.
U.S. aid group Mercy Corps cautioned that the truce was only the first step on an uncertain road to peace.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia will begin moving its troops away from the border with Eritrea, senior military officials said on Friday, months after the erstwhile enemies reopened it for the first time in 20 years.
""Relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea are very good - there is no longer the threat of conflict,"" Ethiopia's Major General Asrat Denero, Commander of the Western Command, said. 
War broke out between the two countries in 1998 over the border and other issues, killing an estimated 80,000 people before fighting finally ended in 2000 in a contested peace deal.
However, tensions simmered over the position of the frontier until this year when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed offered to end the standoff as part of a package of reforms that have reshaped the political landscape of the Horn of Africa.
""There is no need to maintain our troops there (on the border). It is necessary to deploy them elsewhere,"" Denero said.
Abiy announced the plan for Ethiopian and Eritrean forces along the border to be moved back to camps in September.
""As part of a restructuring of the military, changes are taking place with regards to their positions,"" Lieutenant General Mola Hailemariam, Commander of Special Operations of the Ethiopian National Defense Force, told a news conference.

Officials found about six tonnes of processed cannabis and 3 million super-strength ""Captagon"" amphetamine pills hidden aboard the Syrian-flagged ""Noka"", it said in a statement.
The freighter, with a crew of 11, was en route from the Syrian port of Latakia to Benghazi when it was intercepted by Greek authorities off the southeastern coast of Crete on Dec. 5.
The Noka was escorted to Heraklion port on the Greek island on Dec. 8, where the authorities unloaded its entire cargo.
The drugs were found under false floors in eight containers, hidden between layers of coffee, spices and wood shavings.
Syria became a major amphetamines exporter and consumer as the trauma of the country’s civil war fueled demand and the breakdown in order created opportunity for producers.
Captagon was said to be a fund-raising tool and stimulant for militants. The government now controls most of the country and Islamic State is close to defeat.
Greek authorities have impounded the vessel and its contents. The crew have been arrested and will appear before a public prosecutor on Saturday.

Scientists say Captagon is a super-boosted amphetamine with unique chemical complexities allowing it to induce potent psychoactive effects far more rapidly than amphetamines alone.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Six security officials were killed in an attack in southwestern Pakistan on Friday when their convoy came under heavy firing in a mountainous area near the border with Iran.
Pakistan's restive Baluchistan province has been hit by a number of attacks on security personnel but the number of large scale incidents has decreased significantly since 2016. 
The province's information minister Zahoor Ahmed Buledi told Reuters that six members of the Frontier Corps paramilitary force in charge of security in the region were killed in ""heavy"" firing along a mountainous stretch of road in the Kech district.
Fourteen others were wounded. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Islamist militants linked to the Taliban, al Qaeda and Islamic State have been operating in the province, which borders Iran as well as Afghanistan. It also has an indigenous ethnic Baluch insurgency fighting the central government.
Last month, three men from the separatist Baloch Liberation Army stormed the Chinese embassy in Pakistan's southern metropolis Karachi, killing four people including two policemen.
They were shot and killed by police before they could force their way in in a car packed with explosives.
Baluchistan, which has rich mineral and natural gas reserves but remains Pakistan’s poorest province, is the site of a long-running rebellion by separatists who argue the state is taking over their lands and have targeted Chinese-funded projects.
In July, a suicide bomber detonated in the middle of a crowded election rally in the province, killing 128 people including electoral candidate Siraj Raisani. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the blast.

KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Delegates at U.N. climate talks in the Polish city of Katowice point to the mining museum next to the conference venue as the proper place for coal, which provides 80 percent of the country's electricity.
Poland's decision to host the negotiations to revive the 2015 Paris agreement on phasing out fossil fuel has laid bare the tension between high-minded goals and business realities.
A short drive from the conference venue, at the Silesian region's dozen or so remaining mines, tonnes of freshly dug coal thunder down shoots to be rail-roaded to power plants for carbon-intensive generation. 
Coal bosses see a need to address climate risk, but say Poland must use thermal coal for electricity until it has a better option. 
Silesia also produces coking coal, used in steel, and viewed as a strategic mineral even by the European Union, which seeks to be an environmental leader.
Poland's JSW, the European Union's largest coking coal producer, is seeking to grow. 
""The world has to tackle the increase of carbon dioxide emissions, but I do not see a chance the world can live without steel these days and there is not an easy solution to substitute steel and substitute coking coal,"" CEO Daniel Ozon told Reuters.
Financial backing can be an issue for all forms of coal and JSW has its eye on Chinese banks as international lenders are wary.
GENERATION GAP
For many Poles, coal mining symbolizes national independence. 
State-dominated companies can look to a government striving to win over an electorate divided between an older generation that associates coal with a reliable income and a sense of community, and youths engaged in climate protests.
As the demonstrators march, international business works to keep shareholders on side.
One of the climate team from the world's biggest producer of coking coal BHP was among business representatives taking part in the side events accompanying the negotiations.
The U.N. talks have proved long and fractious, with flash-points including a revolt by Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States and Kuwait against a major scientific report that laid out the reasons to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
""The real challenge is not whether it's 2 degrees or 1.5 degrees; it's that not enough is happening,"" Graham Winkelman, BHP's practice lead on climate change, said in an interview.
BHP stands apart from other big miners with a goal to make its own operations carbon neutral, in line with the Paris agreement, by the second half of the century.
But just as governments have to work out practicalities, it is also unclear how BHP can achieve its goals.
""There is no definitive path-way,"" Winkelman said, although he repeated a frequent industry request for a carbon price to help shift investment towards a greener technology.
Poland's aim is to share the challenges of bringing about a ""just transition"", Polish Deputy Environment Minister Michal Kurtyka, who presided over the talks, said.
As a graduate of Paris' elite Ecole Polytechnique, a physicist, an economist and an engineer, his favored solution is electric vehicles. With fewer moving parts and less wasted heat than internal combustion engines, he says they will help even if they run on coal-fired power.
As a citizen of a country that switched in 1989 from ""a centrally planned to a market economy,"" Kurtyka has first-hand experience of deep change.
""In my young days, growing up in Krakow, that was a completely different city from now. At 8 p.m. the lights switched off. You could not open the window because of air pollution,"" he said.

In Katowice, some residents say they still can't let the air in and are not confident that is about to change.

ESIGODINI, Zimbabwe (Reuters) - A report into Zimbabwe's post-election violence that left six people dead and dozens injured in August will be published next week, President Emmerson Mnangagwa said on Friday.
Mnangagwa has blamed the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leaders for the violence, while the army has denied allegations it shot civilians during the Aug. 1 protests. 
Following the disputed vote, Zimbabwe is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a decade, marked by shortages of fuel and cash and a spike in prices of basic goods. 
The political rifts have also continued, with MDC leader Nelson Chamisa saying Mnangagwa is an illegitimate leader. Chamisa denies inciting his supporters to take to the streets in the aftermath of the election.
Video footage showed soldiers, some with their faces obscured by camouflage masks, opening fire with automatic weapons during the protests.
""I received the report, which we are looking into with my deputies. We have agreed that next week we will make it public,"" Mnangagwa told 6,000 members at ZANU-PF's first annual conference since Robert Mugabe was forced to retire after an army coup in November 2017.
Mnangagwa also told the party conference in Esigodini, 500 km (310 miles) south-west of Harare that he had won fairly with a huge majority in parliament and would not invite the opposition into his government.
ZANU-PF officials say Mnangagwa wants to end speculation that he will only serve one five-year term and step down in favor of one his two deputies, Constantino Chiwenga, 62.
Chiwenga is the retired defense forces chief who led the coup against Mugabe and is seen as the power behind Mnangagwa. The army still holds significant influence on who runs for top office in ZANU-PF, political analysts said. 
The conference is expected to endorse Mnangagwa to run for a second and final term in 2023 when he will be 80 years old.
In the meantime, the president has the immediate problems of fuel shortages and worker unrest to address.

In Harare and most major cities, motorists queued for fuel as shortages continued for a third week, while junior doctors refused to end a two-week strike.

The chief of police in Paris said concerns remained about violent groups infiltrating the protests. Anti-riot officers will protect landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and prevent people getting close to the presidential palace.
""We need to be prepared for worst-case scenarios,"" police chief Michel Delpuech told RTL radio.
He expected businesses in the capital to be less affected this weekend after heavy disruption over the past three weeks when major stores shut, hotels suffered cancellations and tourists stayed away during the usually busy run-up to Christmas.
Nicknamed ""Acte V"" of the protests, the yellow vest demonstrators will take to the streets this weekend as France recovers from an unrelated attack on a Christmas market in the eastern city of Strasbourg on Tuesday, when a gunman shot and killed three people and wounded several others.
Hundreds of police officers were redeployed to Strasbourg to search for the gunman, who was shot dead in an exchange of fire on Thursday evening.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said it was time for the yellow vests to scale down their protests and accept they had achieved their aims. Police officers also deserved a break, he added.
""I'd rather have the police force doing their real job, chasing criminals and combating the terrorism threat, instead of securing roundabouts where a few thousand people keep a lot of police busy,"" he said.

TOLL ON THE ECONOMY
Attractions such as the Louvre museum and Opera Garnier will be open this weekend, as will luxury department stores like Galeries Lafayette and Printemps. Last Saturday they were closed as thousands of sometimes violent protesters tore through the city. The previous weekend the Arc de Triomphe was vandalized, cars were overturned and torched and businesses smashed up.
The protests have taken a toll on the economy, with output in the last quarter of the year set to be half initial projections, while Macron's concessions are likely to push the budget deficit above an EU agreed limit.
The yellow vest movement, which began as a protest against fuel taxes and then grew into an anti-Macron alliance, appears to have calmed since the president announced a series of measures to help the working poor.
However, many people wearing the high-visibility motorists' safety jackets which are the symbol of the protests were manning barricades outside cities on Friday. 
After heavy criticism for not being seen to respond to the protesters' complaints, Macron made a TV address this week during which he said he understood their concerns and acknowledged the need for a different approach. 
As well cancelling fuel tax increases that were due to kick in next month, Macron said he would increase the minimum wage by 100 euros a month from January and reduce taxes for poorer pensioners, among other measures. 

Since the first yellow vest protests on Nov. 17, supporters have kept up a steady stream of dissent, although the numbers joining marches have steadily fallen.

Hundreds of businesses, government offices and schools received the awkwardly-worded letters, threatening to set off explosives if payments of $20,000 in cryptocurrency were not received, sparking scattered evacuations of schools and transit facilities before the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies dismissed the threats as lacking credibility.
Hoax threats were received on Thursday in cities including Washington, New York, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Oklahoma City, Grand Rapids, Iowa, Denver, Ottawa and Calgary, Alberta.
Officials provided no new details on the investigation into who was behind the threats early Friday.
A similar wave of emailed hoax bomb threats in December 2015 prompted officials in Los Angeles to close the city's public school system, which national law enforcement officials later criticized as an over-reaction.
Two weeks previously, a married couple inspired by Islamic State had killed 14 people at a California county office building in a shooting rampage.

The EU is readying a new electronic visa waiver system by 2021 to beef up security. The bloc's executive proposed to exempt Britain from visas provided that the sides agree on a Brexit deal before the UK leaves, as is now due on March 29, 2019.
The new EU system, or ETIAS, would be similar to the ESTA scheme used by the United States, and would apply to countries outside the bloc whose citizens can travel to Europe visa-free. 
There are currently 61 such countries from Monaco to Australia. ETIAS would start applying to the UK after its status-quo transition after Brexit runs its course, which is now due at the end of 2020 though could be extended.
The fee would be waived for travelers under 18 and those over 70 years old. 
It would also cover countries associated with the EU's zone of control-free travel, meaning Britons would also have to pay to travel to Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Lichtenstein since they are part of this so-called Schengen zone even though outside of the EU. 
Conversely, it would not cover EU states that are not in Schengen, like Ireland. 
If Britain crashes out of the bloc with no agreement in place to mitigate ensuing disruptions, Britons could require visas to travel to the EU in the future, a spokeswoman for the European Commission said on Friday. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May was again under pressure on Friday over her Brexit deal, after her pleas to EU leaders for more assurances over their tentative divorce deal fell flat.

LONDON (Reuters) - The cost of staging the 2016 referendum that triggered Britain’s impending exit from the European Union was almost 130 million pounds ($163 million), the UK’s electoral regulator said on Friday, amid calls from some politicians for a second vote.
Operational costs including staffing, raising public awareness of the referendum, running polling stations, administering postal ballots and counting votes amounted to 129.1 million pounds, a report by Britain’s Electoral Commission said. The report did not cover spending by campaigners or referendum campaign broadcast costs.
Almost 33.6 million people – a turnout of 72.2 percent - cast a vote in the June 2016 referendum that involved 41,050 polling stations manned by 107,100 staff. More than 51,500 staff verified and counted ballot papers. 
The result saw 52 percent vote to leave the EU and 48 percent back remaining and the British government has been grappling with the outcome ever since as Prime Minister Theresa May battles to secure a Brexit divorce deal that is palatable to UK lawmakers.
The current parliamentary deadlock over her withdrawal agreement and mounting concern the UK could crash out of the EU without a deal have spurred growing calls for a second referendum on the UK’s relationship with Europe.

Among the leading figures pushing for another vote are former prime minister Tony Blair, who said on Friday the UK and EU should brace for a second referendum because parliament will probably fail to agree on a divorce deal and the public will need to break the stalemate.

STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - Strasbourg reopened its traditional Christmas market under heavy security on Friday, the morning after French police shot dead a gunman suspected of killing three people in the heart of the historic city.
Cherif Chekatt, 29, was killed in the Neudorf neighborhood of Strasbourg after firing on police, ending a two-day manhunt that involved more than 700 members of the security forces.
The attack on Strasbourg's cherished Christmas market, a target full of religious symbolism, evoked France's difficulties in integrating western Europe's largest Muslim minority and dealing with homegrown militants inspired by Islamic State.
""It's reopening just in time,"" said stall-holder Bernard Kuntz, preparing his scarves and stoles imported from India ahead of the expected arrival of French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, who was expected to speak.
""We were getting worried. Some of the guys have taken out loans to be here, and we've already lost two days."" 
Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries described the attack as indisputably an act of terrorism, expressed relief that Chekatt had been killed and said everyone in Strasbourg, on eastern France's Rhine river border with Germany, felt the same. 
French troops, who have been used to bolster national security since a wave of Islamic State-inspired attacks began in France in 2015, stood guard at the open-air market.
""I think it will help to get back to a life that I would describe as normal,"" Ries told reporters after the news that Chekatt had been killed. ""With the death of this terrorist ... citizens, like me, are relieved.""
EXTRA 1,800 TROOPS ON MARKET PATROLS
Islamic State (IS) claimed Chekatt as one of its soldiers, saying he ""carried out the operation in response to calls for citizens of coalition countries"" fighting the militant group. 
IS provided no evidence for the claim and Castaner called it ""opportunistic"".
""Nothing indicates that (Chekatt) was part of a network. There is nothing to suggest that he was being protected by such, but the investigation is not yet over,"" Castaner told Europe 1.
He described Chekatt as a long-time delinquent whose Islamic beliefs were radicalized during previous periods in prison. Police were still interrogating seven associates on Friday, including his parents, to determine whether he had accomplices.
France ramped up its security threat to its highest level after Chekatt struck late on Tuesday. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe promised an extra 1,800 troops would be put on patrols with a special focus on Christmas markets.
The outdoor market in Strasbourg, centered around a towering Christmas Tree in Place Kleber, draws more than 2 million visitors each year. Christmas markets have been a feature of the Alsatian city since the early 15th century. 
Three people died in Tuesday's assault in the vicinity of the Christmas market and several were wounded, including one person fighting for their life, Paris Prosecutor Remy Heitz said.

The Strasbourg shooting was the latest in a succession of attacks linked to Islamist militancy in France going back to 2012. Since January 2015, more than 240 people have been killed in attacks on French soil, most of them in 2015-16.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte sought to convince European Union leaders on Friday that his offer to cut Italy's deficit target for next year should make an EU disciplinary procedure unnecessary.
Conte has said he is ready to cut the headline deficit to 2.04 percent of output from 2.40 percent, and hopes to reach agreement with the EU executive, the Commission, on Monday.
Conte met German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday on the sidelines of the EU summit in Brussels, officials said, and was trying to arrange to meet Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, one of the harshest critics of Italy's expansionary budget.
The Commission insists that Italy must reduce its structural deficit, which excludes one-offs and business cycle swings, to shrink a debt burden equivalent to more than 130 percent of GDP. EU officials have said this would limit the headline deficit to 1.9 percent of output.
EU states have the last say on opening any disciplinary procedure but European diplomats said euro zone countries, including Germany, were ready to leave it to the Commission to negotiate, and would accept whatever outcome was agreed.
At the same time, Italy's readiness to revise its spending plans, and emerging budget problems in France, have created a more conciliatory atmosphere.
On Thursday, Conte met Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, whose finance minister, Mario Centeno, chairs the euro zone finance ministers' committee where key decisions for the euro zone are made.
Also on Thursday, EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said Italy's new offer showed a ""significant effort"", and that Rome and Brussels were working to find a compromise quickly on remaining ""technical"" issues.
Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria was in Brussels on Friday and planned to stay until a deal was reached, his spokeswoman said.

If the Commission moved ahead with a disciplinary procedure, it could put pressure on the value of Italy's sovereign bonds and expose it to prolonged market pressure.

Candidates for President Joseph Kabila's ruling coalition and the opposition blamed each other for the incident. Violence has flared on the campaign trail this week, with security forces killing at least two people at opposition gatherings. 
“In an already tense electoral environment, I urge the government to send a clear signal that threats and violence against political opponents will not be tolerated,” Bachelet said in a statement

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo's parliament voted on Friday to create a 5,000-strong standing army, a week after Serbia's premier suggested the move could provoke military intervention by Belgrade.
The move, coming 20 years after Kosovo Albanians' uprising against Serbian rule and a decade after independence, was lauded as ""historic"" by the United States but NATO criticized it as unhelpful in efforts to ease tensions between Kosovo and Serbia.
Legislation to transform the lightly armed Kosovo Security Force, which was created mainly for crisis response, civil defense and removal of ordnance from the 1990s conflict, into an army was approved by 105 deputies in the 120-seat assembly.
Eleven minority Serb deputies boycotted the vote. Kosovo's constitution mandates the creation of a national army but no action was taken for years while Pristina sought, in vain, to obtain the approval of Kosovo Serbs. 
The move is also strongly opposed by Kosovo Serbs' patron Serbia, which has refused to recognize the independence of its former province and warned that a national Kosovo army could destabilize the Western Balkans. 
""I regret that this decision was made despite the concerns expressed by NATO,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement on Friday. 
""The North Atlantic Council will now have to re-examine the level of NATO’s engagement with the Kosovo Security Force,"" he said.
Though creating such an army could take years, Serbian politicians maintain that it could be used to expel remaining Serbs from Kosovo - an accusation denied by Kosovo Albanian leaders who rely on European Union and U.S. support for reforms and development of the small, impoverished Balkan country.
On Dec. 5, Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic suggested one possible response by Belgrade could be military intervention.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic will be inspecting troops along the Kosovo border over the next three days, his office said on Thursday.
NATO-led peacekeeping mission to Kosovo still has around 4,000 troops in the landlocked country.
Balkans analysts, however, said any action by Serbia's 28,000-strong army against Kosovo is highly unlikely given Belgrade's aspirations to join the EU and that Brnabic's remarks appeared to be a sop to Serbian nationalists.
With the new law in place, Kosovo will set up a defense ministry and the future army is to be comprised of 5,000 active soldiers and 3,000 reservists. Pristina government officials said the process would last at least 10 years. 

Kosovo's independence came almost a decade after a NATO air war halted a two-year counter-insurgency war by Serbian security forces that included arrests, killings and expulsions of ethnic Albanian civilians.

Erdogan said this week that Turkey would launch a new operation within days against the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG militia which controls swathes of Syria's northern border region, in what will be Turkey's third military campaign in Syria in two years.
Ankara and Washington have long been at odds in Syria, where the United States has backed the YPG in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist organization and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
Turkey has complained over the slow implementation of a deal with Washington to pull YPG Kurdish fighters out of Manbij, which lies in mainly Arab territory west of the Euphrates, back to the eastern bank of the river.
""Manbij is a place where Arabs live, but they have surrendered the area to the terror organization,"" Erdogan told members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in a speech in Istanbul. ""Now we are saying that you should cleanse, remove them, or else we will enter Manbij. I am speaking very clearly.""
Erdogan said Turkey was also determined to bring ""peace and security"" to areas east of the Euphrates, where the YPG controls an area stretching more than 400 km (250 miles) along the border towards Iraq.
He compared the promised military campaign to an incursion into northern Syria in 2016 and one earlier this year by Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies, who still hold territory there seized from YPG and Islamic State fighters. 
A spokesman for the Syrian rebels said on Thursday that up to 15,000 fighters are prepared to support Turkey's latest operation.
The United States, which has set up observation posts on the Syrian side of the border, has warned Turkey against a new incursion and said the newly constructed positions would help deter any security threat against Turkey coming from Syria.
Erdogan, however, said Turkey had waited long enough to act against the YPG militia, which it says is indistinguishable from PKK militants who have waged an insurgency against the state in southeastern Turkey for 34 years.
""We are not only providing security for our country when taking steps in Syria but we are also protecting the honor of people,"" he said.

Kurdish commander Mazloum Kobanin said on Thursday the Syrian Democratic Forces, which are spearheaded by the YPG, will respond strongly to any attack.

Under huge pressure at home as British media described her largely unsuccessful plea for favor from EU leaders as a humiliation, May appeared anxious to make a point to Juncker before a new session in the morning.
What they said was not audible but official video of their exchange as other leaders took their seats showed May repeating herself while the former Luxembourg premier held her by the arm, shook his head and raised with his palm in an apparent effort to calm her down before the Dutch prime arrived to interrupt them.
The previous evening, Juncker told a news conference that May's pitch to the summit for help on Brexit was ""nebulous"" and ""vague"". Diplomats said other leaders made similar complaints directly to the beleaguered British leader during the talks.
Asked what she had said to Juncker, a British government source said only: ""I'm sure they had plenty to discuss.""
EU diplomats said May had on Thursday evening appealed for some legally binding amendments to the Brexit deal which she had agreed last month but seems unable to get through parliament.
But the other 27 leaders had stood firm on a refusal to do anything that might water down the so-called ""backstop"" designed to avoid a disruptive ""hard border"" for Northern Ireland. They issued a statement stressing that they hope it would not be used, or if it were for only a very short time.
But that has failed to satisfy critics of May's plan, who say it opens the risk of Britain being bound into EU customs and other regulations indefinitely, unless the two sides can agree on another way to keep their borders almost totally open.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 06:23AM ET</span>",California could have seismic impact on 2020 Democratic presidential race,"By James Oliphant
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California is determined to force 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls to make some hard choices.
The nation's most populous liberal state has moved its presidential nominating contest to early in the 2020 calendar, a shift its leaders hope will give it maximum impact on the selection of a Democratic nominee and push candidates to address progressive issues such as climate change.
The reshuffling means California voters, who can cast ballots weeks before primary election day, will be helping to determine a nominee at the same time as those in traditional early primary states such as New Hampshire. 
""It's a big deal,"" said Ben Tulchin, a San Francisco-based consultant who worked as a pollster for Democratic U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. ""The traditional schedule had smaller states, more affordable states, retail politics. California is not like that.""
The shift to so-called ""Super Tuesday"" in March 2020 will change how campaigns structure their efforts and require tough decisions about allocation of resources, Democratic Party sources and strategists say. Competing in California, with its large, expensive media markets, may only be possible for the most deep-pocketed campaigns.
That factor alone might be enough to keep some of the two dozen or so Democrats who are considering entering the race from getting in.
“The amount of money you’re going to need to be competitive in California is just going to knock so many people out before it begins,” said James Demers, who was co-chairman of Democratic President Barack Obama's campaign in New Hampshire. “It feels like the day and age of using Iowa and New Hampshire to get a campaign started are over.""
Those two states have zealously guarded their position as the points of entry for presidential aspirants. But with their small and largely homogenous populations, they may be more a part of the Democratic Party’s past than its future, as liberal elements within the diverse party have pushed to have a bigger say in the selection of a nominee.
In the 2016 race, the two states combined to apportion 68 Democratic delegates to presidential candidates. California, the biggest prize, awarded 475. 
The candidate who amasses the majority of delegates will be formally nominated at the party’s convention in the summer of 2020 and then likely will face President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the general election as he seeks a second term.
A LARGER PLAYING FIELD
California's secretary of state, Alex Padilla, made clear in an interview with Reuters that the primary was moved up to require contenders to campaign and invest in the state. 
For years, California Democrats have complained that candidates came to the state to raise money from the entertainment and tech industries without its voters playing a meaningful role in the outcome of the race.
“Anybody who is running for president who cares about getting votes in California will chose to campaign here,” Padilla said. “Those who don’t chose to campaign here – that sends a very strong message, regardless of party.”
Padilla said the shift also was intended to push candidates to address the issues that concern Californians such as environmental protection, climate change and immigration, which could end up benefiting candidates with a more progressive agenda that matches the state’s left-leaning electorate. 
That could create tension for candidates who simultaneously may be courting more moderate electorates in places like New Hampshire and South Carolina or force them to limit their appeal to one faction of the Democratic Party over another.
Michael Ceraso, who ran Sanders' operation in California, said the primary will be a referendum on the state's political priorities. ""Do you support the California progressive agenda?"" he said. 
But it isn’t only California that could reshape the nomination process. Delegate-rich states such as Texas and North Carolina also are scheduled to hold a primary on Super Tuesday, significantly widening the battlefield.
The result could be a Democratic field reduced to a handful of candidates a month after the primaries begin in early February. (The full primary schedule will not be finalized until 2019.) 
“A clustered calendar has tended to produce an early winner,” said Josh Putnam, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina–Wilmington and an expert on the primary process.
Candidates will have to map out an expansive, multistate strategy that involves personal campaigning in some states, organizing a field operation in others and launching broadcast and online ad blitzes in still more. 
The prospect of competing in California and other Super Tuesday states means candidates likely cannot afford to wait to raise money and build an organization, suggesting a flurry of campaign announcements could come early next year, strategists say.
RISK AND REWARD
Some campaigns will have to determine whether to try to compete in California at all or risk ceding delegates from the state entirely. Under Democratic Party rules, candidates in most instances must amass at least 15 percent of the vote in a given primary to be awarded delegates. 
Complicating the matter could be the presence in the field of Californians including U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and billionaire Tom Steyer. 
Historically, however, presidential candidates have not been able to rely on local support. As recently as 2016, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio lost his home-state Florida Republican primary to Trump. 
Strategists say candidates cannot afford to neglect Iowa and New Hampshire. The news media's focus will remain on the winners of those contests, making deep expenditures in California a possible risk without reward. 
“If you spend a lot of money in California, and you get a terrible showing in Iowa, odds are you aren’t going to do well on Super Tuesday,” Ceraso said. 
That is why Jeff Link, a Democratic strategist in Iowa who has worked for the presidential campaigns of Al Gore and Obama, argues that early voting in California will make the initial primary states even more relevant, as those voters will be looking to identify front-runners.

“Iowa and New Hampshire will come while people have ballots in their hands,” Link said.

Washington said on Thursday that a meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin would not be held until Moscow released three Ukrainian navy vessels and their crews, seized last month off Crimea. 
""Of course, such a position cannot be grounds for violating the course of legal proceedings and the investigation that is under way against those who violated Russia's state borders,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call. 
Russia detained the vessels' combined crew of 24 last month and accused them of illegally entering Russian waters. Ukraine said Russia captured the two small gunboats and one tugboat illegally and accused Moscow of military aggression.
Putin and Trump were due to have an extended meeting at a G20 summit in Argentina two weeks ago, but Trump canceled after the naval incident.
Peskov said the Kremlin remained ready to organize a future meeting between Putin and Trump, as well as at other levels.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States and South Korea have failed to agree on a bigger South Korean share of the cost of maintaining U.S. troops, an official said on Friday, as the U.S. military warned Korean workers they might be put on leave if no deal is reached.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that South Korea should bear more of the burden for keeping some 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea, where the United States has stationed forces since the 1950-53 Korean War.
Senior officials from both sides held three-day talks in Seoul from Tuesday to hammer out an accord to replace a 2014 deal due to expire this year, which requires South Korea to pay about 960 billion won ($850 million) this year. 
Despite 10 rounds of negotiations since March, the two sides struggled to reach an agreement after the United States demanded a sharp increase, South Korean officials said. 
""We've come to agreement on almost all elements but could not make it final because of differences on the total scale of the deal,"" a senior South Korean foreign ministry official told reporters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
In a statement, U.S. Forces in Korea (USFK) said it was seeking a ""swift conclusion"" to the negotiations ""to mitigate a possible lapse in contributions"" from South Korea.
""Due to the ongoing consultative talks between U.S. and Republic of Korea (ROK) delegations, we are unable to speculate on potential outcomes,"" the statement said. 
The United States initially pushed South Korea to increase its share of the burden to about $1.2 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing unidentified sources.
South Korean and American officials have not publicly confirmed a dollar amount.
South Korean officials have said the United States asked that South Korea pay for the mobilization of equipment, such as bombers, nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines, during joint military exercises.
Trump announced a halt to the exercises in June after a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying they were very expensive and paid for mostly by his country.
Some small-scale joint exercises have taken place since then, while major ones were suspended as part of efforts to expedite talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear program.
The South Korean official said the two sides were not expected to meet again this year, raising the risk of a funding gap.
Last month, U.S. Forces Korea warned South Korean workers some of them might have to ""furlough"", or go on unpaid leave, from mid-April if a deal could not be reached.
In its statement on Friday, USFK said it would ensure that South Korean employees ""have adequate time to prepare for any potential furlough.""
About 70 percent of South Korea's contribution covers the salaries of some 8,700 employees who provide administrative, technical and other services for the U.S. military.

""We are making efforts to minimize any negative impact that may have on the employees,"" said the ministry official.

The war in Yemen is seen as a proxy war between Iran and its key regional rival Saudi Arabia. U.N.-backed talks in Sweden ended on Thursday with an agreement between the Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to cease fighting for the Houthi-held port city of Hodeidah and withdraw their troops. 
It was the first significant breakthrough for U.N.-led peace efforts in five years of conflict in Yemen. A next round of talks will be held at the end of January at which the warring parties will discuss a framework for political negotiations. 
""Iran welcomes the agreement ... and hopes it will pave the way for the next round of dialogue for concluding a final accord among Yemeni groups,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by TV.
""The agreement is significant. The deal showed that the Yemeni groups involved in the talks had truly understood the deplorable conditions of the innocent and oppressed Yemeni people,"" Qasemi said. 
A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing forces of Hadi's internationally recognized government. The war has killed tens of thousands of people and caused a humanitarian crisis in Yemen. 
Saudi Arabia accuses Tehran of supplying the Houthis with weapons. Iran has repeatedly denied this.

""Iran considers stopping of bloodshed and continuing Yemeni-Yemeni talks as the final solution for the situation in Yemen,"" Qasemi said.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Ruling party activists in Bangladesh attacked a veteran opposition leader on Friday as he traveled through the capital, he opposition said, injuring about 12 supporters and inflaming tension just over two weeks before a general election.
Kamal Hossain, an octogenarian Oxford-educated international jurist now heading an opposition alliance, was not hurt when his convoy was attacked by men wielding sticks and stones as he returned from placing flowers on a memorial to victims of Bangladesh's independence war, an opposition spokesman said.
""At least 12 workers and activists of the alliance were injured and several vehicles of senior leaders damaged,” the opposition spokesman, Latiful Bari Hamim, told Reuters.
Mahbub Alam Hanif, a senior official of the ruling Awami League, dismissed the accusation against his party's supporters.
Police said they had looked into the report of trouble but had found nothing untoward. They would investigate if a complaint was lodged.
Bangladeshi elections are often violent and marred by ballot-stuffing and voter intimidation.
For years, politics has been defined by fierce rivalry between two women - Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who leads the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is the longest serving leader in Bangladesh's history, and is seeking a third straight term.
She began a second term in 2014, after an election boycotted by the BNP.
Until two months ago, the BNP was in disarray following the jailing in February of Khaleda, on charges she said were politically motivated.
But the BNP joined hands with smaller parties to form the alliance led by Hossain in October, setting the stage for a more competitive race.

Hossain, 82, was not available for comment.

The monk, Rahul Walke Bodhi, had been meditating in the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in the western state of Maharashtra for the last month, and was attacked while offering morning prayers on Tuesday, a forest official said.
Two other monks who were on their way to give him food said they witnessed the attack but Walke was dead by the time they reached him, according to a second forest official.
""I would like to tell everyone not to go into the forest,"" Gajendra Narwane, deputy director of the reserve, told the BBC Marathi-language service.
Forest rangers have set up two cages and a camera trap to try to capture the animal. It was not clear what they would do with it if they caught it.
The forest, some 825 km (510 miles) east of the city of Mumbai, is in a reserve for big cats where four other fatal attacks have occurred in the last few weeks, according to media.
Forest officials have cordoned off the area where the monk was killed and are restricting the timing of visitor access to a Buddhist temple there.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's President Moon Jae-in told Japanese lawmakers on Friday ""cautious, restrained"" language is needed when discussing wartime forced labor to avoid ""inciting antagonistic emotions"" between the people of the two East Asian countries. 
A row between Seoul and Tokyo flared again in late October when South Korea's Supreme Court ruled that Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp must pay four South Koreans 100 million won ($87,700) in compensation for their forced labor during World War Two. 
Japan denounced the ruling, which said a 1965 treaty did not remove the workers' right to reparations, as ""unthinkable"".
The strain in relations between the two U.S. allies could affect efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, analysts say.
Moon, who met Japanese lawmakers in Seoul on Friday, said his government would take its time to seek a solution because the issue was triggered by a judicial ruling that must be respected.
""I think we need to use cautious, restrained expressions on this issue so as not to incite antagonistic emotions of the peoples of both countries,"" Moon said at the meeting.
""Hurting the amicable sentiment between the two countries does not help the progress of the future relationship between South Korea and Japan,"" he added.
Japanese leaders have reacted angrily to the Nippon Steel verdict and a later ruling against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, arguing that the issue was settled by the 1965 treaty. 
At a press briefing in Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the South Korean rulings defied international law. 
""Relations between our two countries right now are in a very difficult situation,"" he said. ""We will continue to strongly urge the South Korean government to respond in the appropriate manner.""
Moon addressed another contentious bilateral issue over Seoul's decision last month to disband a fund meant to settle compensation for South Korean women forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War Two. 
Under a 2015 deal, Japan apologized to the ""comfort women"" - Japan's euphemism for women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels - and provided a 1 billion yen ($9.4 million) fund to help them. 
South Korea has said it will discuss with Japan what to do with the balance of the fund, which stood at 16.08 billion won ($14.2 million) by end-October, including Seoul's contributions. 

""I hope that South Korea and Japan can discuss how to utilize the balance of the fund and 1 billion yen in a way that fits the original purpose,"" Moon said.

Hajin is the last big town held by Islamic State in its remaining pocket of territory east of the Euphrates River near the border with Iraq. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, have been battling to eradicate Islamic State for several months in the area.
A YPG source said the SDF was now in control of Hajin, where some small remaining pockets of Islamic State resistance would be finished off in the next day or two.
The capture of Hajin leaves Islamic State in control of a diminishing strip of territory along the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in the area where the U.S.-backed operations are focused.
The jihadists also control some desert terrain west of the river in territory otherwise controlled by the Damascus government and its allies.
SDF commander-in-chief Mazloum Kobani told Reuters on Thursday that at least 5,000 Islamic State fighters remain holed up in the pocket of territory including Hajin and that they had decided to fight to the death.
This includes some 2,000 foreign fighters, mostly Arabs and Europeans along with their families.
Kobani also said it was possible that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was in eastern Syria, but the SDF could not be sure because he often disappears.
Islamic State was driven from nearly all the territory it once held in Syria last year in separate campaigns waged by the U.S.-backed SDF on the one hand, and the Russian-backed Syrian government on the other.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong democracy leaders pledged on Friday to sustain their fight for full democracy at the end of a month-long trial that could see them jailed for leading and inciting 2014 protests against what they see as Beijing's unjust curbs on freedom.
Nine defendants face a maximum seven years in jail for each of various charges that include conspiracy to commit public nuisance and incitement to commit public nuisance. A verdict is expected on April 9.
They all pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors say they were instigators of the 79-day ""Occupy"" protests in late 2014 which drew hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets, hoping to press Beijing to grant full democracy in the global financial hub. 
""Only through the introduction of genuine universal suffrage could a door be opened to resolving the deep-seated conflicts in Hong Kong,"" one of the nine, law professor Benny Tai, 54, told the court.
""The price of freedom is indeed eternal vigilance.""
The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, with the promise of a high degree of autonomy and universal suffrage as an ""ultimate aim"".
Critics, however, including foreign governments and business groups, say that the guarantee is ringing increasingly hollow, with a democratic reform process now largely stalled.
The trial is the latest in a series against Hong Kong's pro-democracy opposition that has seen scores of activists jailed.
Activists say Hong Kong's freedoms have come under increasing strain, and they point to the recent expulsion of a British journalist and various steps to shut out democrats from city politics.
Hong Kong's government says the rule of law is a ""core value"" and it is trying to heal political and social divides and push political reform. But it says it will not tolerate any talk of moves toward independence from China.
'SPIRIT' OF DR KING 
The prosecution's case focused on three people: Tai, retired sociologist Chan Kin-man, 59, and retired pastor Chu Yiu-ming, 74.
The prosecution presented video evidence to illustrate what it said was their role in leading, planning, and unlawfully inciting others to obstruct public places during the ""Occupy Central"" protests. Central is Hong Kong's business district.
The three defended the civil disobedience movement as a constitutionally protected right to push for social justice, at times citing the example of U.S. civil rights leader, Martin Luther King.
""I was inspired very much by Dr King, and this is the same spirit we have implanted ... we strive to inspire self-sacrificing love and peacefulness but not to incite anger and hatred,"" Tai said.
Lawyers for the three argued that the actual ""Occupy"" movement ended up taking place in other locations, not the business district as initially planned, and it was a spontaneous movement, partly spearheaded by students and inflamed when police fired teargas.
Six others, including lawmakers Tanya Chan and Shiu Ka-chun, two former student leaders Eason Chung and Tommy Cheung, activist Raphael Wong and veteran democrat Lee Wing-tat, also face various public nuisance charges.
""If we still don’t have the right to vote, it's a dead end for Hong Kong,"" said Chan.

""I'm very sure that it's the duty of every citizen to protect freedom and also the duty for every citizen to fight for democracy. It is the only way.""

KOROSTEN, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian security service officers raided the Orthodox Christian cathedral in this northwestern town this month, saying it suspected its Russia-aligned clergy of spreading religious hatred. 
But Archpriest Anatoliy, the senior priest at the Cathedral of the Nativity, saw the raid as a hostile act in a theological battle between Ukraine's two main Orthodox factions that is part of a broader political conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
The cathedral is aligned with Russian Orthodoxy, and part of a church which is widely referred to in Ukraine as the Moscow Patriarchate that is pitted against what is known as the Kiev Patriarchate.
""I told them: you have your own methods, you have your own strength, and we have our own strength. You serve the devil, and I serve God,"" Anatoliy said of the raid on the gold-domed cathedral in Korosten, 145 km (90 miles) northwest of Kiev.
""These are their usual methods, intimidation, intimidation, terror,"" he said, dismissing the SBU security service's allegations.
The raid was one of several on churches with ties to Moscow in the run-up to a council in Kiev on Saturday at which Ukrainian priests will establish a new national church, breaking hundreds of years of relations with the Russian clergy. 
The decision follows a synod in October presided over by the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul, the global spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians, which endorsed Ukraine's request for an ""autocephalous"", or independent, church.
Ukraine's pro-Western leaders say the move is essential to keep Ukraine safe from what they see as Russian meddling and Moscow's neocolonial ambitions. President Petro Poroshenko compares it to the security umbrella that would be offered by membership of the NATO defense alliance. 
But the Russian Orthodox Church has portrayed it as the biggest split in Christianity for 1,000 years and Saturday's council is taking place at a time of heightened tension between Kiev and Moscow.
Ukraine imposed martial law last month after Russia captured three of its vessels in the Kerch Strait between Russia's mainland and the Crimea peninsula.
Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 after a pro-Moscow president was ousted in street protests in Kiev, and backed separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine in a conflict that has killed more than 10,000. 
ALLEGATIONS OF INCITEMENT AND BULLYING 
The SBU worries Russia is using the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) to incite tensions as cover to invade.
""The deliberate instigation by the Russian special services of inter-church conflicts in Ukraine, to be combined with provoking direct acts of terrorism, may become a pretext for open military invasion by the Russian Federation's armed forces of our country,"" SBU Chief Vasyl Hrytsak said.
Showing video footage and phone intercepts at a briefing on Thursday, the SBU said it had uncovered a plot to instigate protests before the council. 
Moscow has denied allegations of meddling in Ukraine and the Moscow Patriarchate sees the SBU raids as an attempt to bully its clergy into attending the council. 
Saturday's council at the 11th century St Sophia Cathedral in Kiev will decide the make-up of the new church and elect its leader. The leader will then go to Istanbul to receive what is known as a ""tomos"", or decree, for independence.
The Moscow Patriarchate has said it will boycott the event and punish any priest who takes part. 
""We do not recognize its legitimacy. This is not a council - this is a gang of bandits, who have gathered to do their work -- take over temples and destroy the church,"" Anatoliy said. 
Religions divisions in Ukraine widened as relations between the West and Russia sank in 2014.
The Moscow Patriarchate sees itself as the one true church but authorities accuse it of being a Kremlin stooge helping to spread Russian propaganda and aiding the rebels. 
The Moscow Patriarchate denies doing this and calls the independent church a ploy by Poroshenko to boost his ratings before a presidential election in March. 

The Kiev Patriarchate was born after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its popularity has grown since 2014. It favors European integration and champions an independent church but the Moscow Patriarchate denounces it as schismatic.

LONDON (Reuters) - Former Prime Minister Tony Blair will say on Friday that Britain and the European Union should prepare for a second Brexit referendum because parliament will probably fail to agree on a divorce deal and the public will need to break the deadlock.
Less than four months before Britain is due to leave the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May called off a parliamentary vote on her deal with Brussels this week after admitting it would be heavily defeated. 
Addressing EU leaders meeting in Brussels, Blair said they should offer to reform the bloc to make it more attractive for Britain to remain.
""Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvass the options in (a) sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum; Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again,"" Blair, who was Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, will say in a speech in London.
Blair's office released extracts of the speech in advance.
An offer by the EU to reform would show ""that the political leadership of Europe and Britain had listened to the underlying concerns of those who voted (for) Brexit, not disrespecting the concerns but meeting them in a way which is not damaging"". 
Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit since the 2016 referendum, echoing other critics, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who have suggested Britain could still change its mind.
Blair will say it is perverse that the Britain and the EU are preparing for a potentially economically damaging Brexit without any deal, but not another referendum. 

""We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If Parliament can't then it should decide to go back to the people.""

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 01:15AM ET</span>","Security, free speech in focus as Seoul braces for possible visit from North Korea's Kim","By Jeongmin Kim and Yijin Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - Speculation that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will soon visit Seoul for the first time has sparked debate in South Korea over how to allow citizens to express often strongly held views while preventing any international incidents.
To pull off the summit he wants – full of inspiring imagery of Korean unity and reconciliation - President Moon Jae-in needs to walk a fine line between providing sufficient security for Kim and being accused of stifling speech to appease a dictator. 
Unlike tightly controlled Singapore, where Kim took a surprise night time stroll before his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in June, Seoul is routinely roiled by protests.
Many South Koreans still take a dim view of North Korea in the wake of their 1950-53 war and decades of hostility, making the risk of disruptions to the visit high.
A summit in Seoul now appears unlikely this year, but small yet vocal groups of conservative protesters who routinely gather on Seoul streets to protest against Moon or to urge Trump to bomb North Korea have already mobilized to protest any visit by Kim. 
At a recent rally in downtown Seoul, banners read ""Let’s punish Kim Jong Un"" and organizers said they intend to try to ""arrest"" the North Korean leader.
""Once (Kim) steps on our land he will be captured and no one can take responsibility for what will happen afterwards,"" Ihn Ji-yeon, a leader with the far-right Korea Patriots Party told Reuters at the rally.
Seoul police declined to comment on those claims.
Opposing groups have also been vocal in wanting to welcome Kim and calling for more engagement with the North, encouraged by a relaxation in enforcement of national security laws.
PREVENTING THE UNEXPECTED
At their summit in Pyongyang in September, Kim told Moon he would visit Seoul ""at an early date"". South Korean officials pressed for it to happen this year, but they now say that appears unlikely.
Any summit in Seoul would likely be overshadowed by a lack of progress on negotiations between North Korea and the United States over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.
That could leave Moon and Kim little leeway to progress their goals of declaring an official end to the Korean War, forging closer ties and resuming joint economic projects.
Kim’s visit would be the first by a North Korean leader to the South, so security forces of both sides would be treading on unknown ground. 
The security office of South Korea's presidential Blue House would likely oversee the whole operation, while North Korean security forces would conduct inspections ahead of time, as well as provide personal protection for Kim during the visit, said Lee Man-jong, a law and police professor at Seoul's Howon University. 
At the 2010 G20 summit, Seoul mobilized about 50,000 security forces, and about 35,000 for Trump's state visit in November last year, Lee said.
Police sources said South Korean authorities are likely to declare the highest level of emergency preparedness for a Kim visit. 
Under that plan, all five of Seoul’s 1,200-officer-strong police divisions specializing in crowd control would be mobilized, with all annual leave canceled for police officers, said one police official, who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to speak publicly. 
Tens of thousands of other officers would likely be called up from other police and government agencies, including the military, he said. 
FREE SPEECH CONCERNS
Some critics of the Moon administration say they fear authorities will work with North Korean security to tamp down even peaceful displays of opposition to Kim.
""If Kim Jong Un really visits Seoul, what the government should never, ever do is contrive a ‘welcoming’ atmosphere by forcibly banning anti-Kim Jong Un protests or mobilizing pro-North Korea gatherings,"" said Liberty Korea Party lawmaker Baek Seung-joo. ""The Blue House cannot and should not order anything more than sheer maintenance of order when Kim Jong Un visits Seoul.""
Another lawmaker who visited Pyongyang during the September Korean summit told South Korean media Kim Jong Un acknowledged the likelihood of protesters if he visits, but did not seem concerned by the ""disagreeing voices"" he might face.
A spokesperson for South Korea's presidential Blue House said Moon's administration would ""strive to actively communicate"" with critics of a Kim visit.
""There will be no compromise in our firm stance guaranteeing free speech in the process,"" Nam Sang-kyu told Reuters in a statement. ""As... the contemplated visit by (Kim) is to mark the very first visit by a North Korean leader, our administration is fully committed to prepare the event in a safe and efficient manner, and thus successfully complete the event.""
During the summit with Trump in Singapore, local police, hotel staff, and North Korean security guards at Kim's hotel would warn onlooking guests to keep their phones down and forced some who were caught taking photos of Kim to erase them.

""In South Korea, there are bound to be protesters against Kim Jong Un’s dictatorship,"" Baek said. ""Only when we allow protest and also show Kim Jong Un Seoul, and the way our system is, can there be a learning moment for Kim Jong Un.""

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2018 12:35AM ET</span>",The politics of a plot to kill Sri Lanka's president,"By John Geddie, Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal
COLOMBO (Reuters) - A plot to kill the president, links to foreign intelligence, a rogue police officer and a missing sniper: the snippets of news emerging from Sri Lanka in recent weeks seem plucked from the pages of paperback fiction.
But the allegations have had real enough consequences for the island nation, contributing to upending its politics, undermining its currency and credit rating, and affecting relations with giant neighbor India.
President Maithripala Sirisena sacked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in October, just weeks after a little-known social activist alleged he had heard of a plot to assassinate the president from a police officer.
Reuters has learned that investigators have not found any substantial evidence to back up the claim, although Sirisena said in a newspaper interview this month that the refusal of Wickremesinghe to take the plot seriously was the final straw leading to his dismissal.
A spokesman for Sirisena did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Sirisena said in the interview with Ceylon Today: ""I was completely disappointed by the way things were moving.""
Referring to the assassination plot, he added: ""They (the authorities) displayed utter lethargy.""
Wickremesinghe has said he never interfered with the investigations and kept Sirisena informed of their progress.
Sri Lanka has a long history of political assassinations in decades of civil war, making Sirisena's allegations all the more explosive.
""It is hard to know what the truth is and many people are skeptical (of the plot),"" said a senior Western diplomat in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo. ""It's part of the politics,"" he added.
What is clear is the drama has paralyzed the island nation and left it without a functioning government for months. 
The alleged plot first came to light on September 12, when self-styled anti-corruption activist and police informant Namal Kumara gathered a few local journalists and made a series of accusations against a senior police officer. 
The most alarming of those claims was that the officer had told him about a plot to assassinate Sirisena using agents of the criminal underworld.
Kumara said he had deleted the recording of the conversation about the plot against Sirisena out of fear, but to back up his allegations he released recordings of other conversations with the deputy inspector general of police, Nalaka de Silva. 
Ruwan Gunasekara, a police spokesman, said there was evidence in those recordings of a plot to kill another senior officer. But he added that in nearly three months of investigations, police had found ""no substantial evidence"" of an assassination threat to Sirisena beyond Kumara's claims.
The comments, made to Reuters, have not been previously reported. 
""NONSENSE""
On Saturday, police sent Kumara's phone to Hong Kong to see if any deleted recordings could be recovered. De Silva remains in custody and could not be reached for comment. 
Speaking via a video-call from a town in Sri Lanka's eastern province, a relaxed, bare-chested Kumara told Reuters the police were now showing little interest in his story.
""The way they (investigators) take action is very poor. I'm ready to help them if they ask,"" he said, adding that he had further information to reveal to authorities. He declined to elaborate.
From the outset, there were doubts over Kumara, who runs a private anti-corruption campaign group that he says is funded by himself and a few other activists.
""All what he said was nonsense,"" Rajitha Senarathne, the cabinet spokesman in the former government of Wickremesinghe, told Reuters.
Even one of Sirisena's closest aides acknowledged that Kumara may not be reliable. 
""That informant may not be credible but you can't just brush it (the plot) away,"" Shiral Lakthilaka, the president's coordinating secretary and adviser, told Reuters. 
In an interview with foreign correspondents late last month, Sirisena alleged that former cabinet minister and army chief Sarath Fonseka may be involved in the plot. He also said a missing man described as a former Tamil militant sniper could be involved. 
Gunasekara from Sri Lanka's police told Reuters there was no investigation into Fonseka ""at the moment"" and that he ""was not aware"" of the incident involving the missing sniper. Fonseka has denied the allegations and called for Sirisena to be prosecuted.
INDIAN CONNECTION
Police have said they arrested an Indian national named Marsili Thomas in connection with the case on information provided by Kumara. 
Rumors started to swirl around social media that Thomas was working for the Indian secret service - which Sirisena later referred to in a cabinet meeting, according to officials present, threatening a diplomatic furor. 
India, the regional superpower, is an ever-present bogeyman for Sri Lankans. Many blame India for supporting Tamil Tiger separatists during the civil war.
Asked if Thomas was linked to India's intelligence, the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka did not respond. Thomas, who remains in custody in Sri Lanka, could not be reached for comment.
India's foreign ministry has said Sirisena spoke to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the issue to ensure it didn't lead to a diplomatic crisis. 
As the rumors and conspiracy theories continue to swirl around Colombo, Sri Lanka's government is in limbo. Wickremesinghe's replacement, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, has lost two confidence motions in parliament and been prevented from assuming office by a court order. 
Sirisena has ordered the parliament dissolved and called for fresh elections, but Sri Lanka's top court ruled the move as unconstitutional on Thursday.
Sirisena has called the impasse ""a storm in a teacup."" 
""These issues will be settled soon and no one needs to worry,"" he said in the newspaper interview. 
But he has refused to reinstate Wickremesinghe. 

He told the foreign correspondents: ""Leave the law and order aside, isn't it a duty of a prime minister at least to ask the president who is facing an assassination threat? There was nothing like that ... How can I go forward with Ranil Wickremesinghe?""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of U.S. inmates executed this year has reached a 25-year low as fewer death sentences are handed down and death row inmates clear their names or die of natural causes, the Death Penalty Information Center reported on Friday.
Fewer than 2,500 inmates are awaiting execution as 2018 draws to an end after 25 executions, making this the third consecutive year with fewer than 30 executions, the DPIC, a non-profit organization that collects data on the death penalty in the United States, said in its annual report. 
""Public appetite for the death penalty has declined dramatically since the 1990s,"" Robert Dunham, executive director of the DPIC, said in a phone interview. ""The death penalty has been criticized for years because of its arbitrariness, because of its racial disparities, because it disproportionately sentences people to death who are poor, who are defendants of color, or who have mental illness or intellectual disabilities.""
Forty-two death sentences were imposed in 2018, following a trend of decline since nearly 300 sentences were handed down per year in the 1990s. Florida and Texas sentenced the most inmates with seven each. Many of those sentenced had committed multiple murders. 
Some 164 death row inmates have been exonerated since 1973, which Dunham said is evidence that innocent people could have mistakenly been executed in the past.
The DPIC report also found that 72 percent of the inmates executed in 2018 showed significant evidence of mental illness, brain injury, or childhood trauma. 
Advocates of the death penalty argue that it should remain legal to punish those who commit the most severe crimes. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has said it is considering expanding use of the death penalty for some federal crimes.
In October, Washington became the 20th U.S. state to abolish the death penalty. The state Supreme Court cited a study which found that black defendants were three to five times more likely to be sentenced to death than non-black defendants in similar proceedings.

A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1972 banned executions but they were reinstated in 1976.

Beijing sent troops into Tibet in 1950 in what it officially terms a peaceful liberation and has ruled there with an iron fist even since. The Dalai Lama, the highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism, fled into exile to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule.
China routinely denounces him as a dangerous separatist, although the Dalai Lama says he merely wants genuine autonomy for his remote and mountainous homeland.
The official Tibet Daily said in a lengthy commentary released online late on Thursday the Dalai Lama had never given up promoting Tibetan independence, dismissing his intentions to seek a ""middle way"" of genuine autonomy.
""Whether it's the 'middle way' or a 'high degree of autonomy', the aim is to try and negate the leadership of the party, negate the socialist system, and negate the ethnic autonomous region system,"" the paper wrote.
It said the Dalai Lama has tried to use hostile forces in the Western media to spread his ""rumors and slander"" against China to promote Tibetan independence, ignoring the freedoms and respect accorded to the people of Tibet.
""In the face of the lies of the 14th Dalai Lama, the various peoples of Tibet should be even more aware that socialist new Tibet replacing the theistic and feudal system of old Tibet was a historical necessity, and a victory for the truth and the people,"" the paper wrote.
There was no immediate reaction to the paper's commentary from the India-based exiled Tibetan government. 
Rights groups say the situation for ethnic Tibetans inside what China calls the Tibet Autonomous Region remains extremely difficult.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in June conditions were ""fast deteriorating"" in Tibet.
This week, the U.S. Senate passed the Reciprocal Access To Tibet Act, which now goes to the White House for President Donald Trump to sign into law.
That act seeks to promote access to Tibet for U.S. diplomats and other officials, journalists, and other citizens by denying entry into the United States for Chinese officials deemed responsible for restricting access to Tibet.

All foreigners need special permission to enter Tibet, which is generally granted for tourists but very infrequently for foreign diplomats and journalists.

HAMILTON, Bermuda (Reuters) - Bermuda's government on Thursday filed an appeal to a high court in London seeking to uphold a law challenged in local courts that would ban gay marriage in the British overseas island. 
In February, Bermuda's governor, John Rankin, approved the Domestic Partnership Act (DPA), which allows same-sex couples to form domestic partnerships but not marry, marking a rare departure from the trend toward legalizing gay marriage in Western countries.
The government of Bermuda, a wealthy territory of 60,000 people, says domestic partnerships offer equal rights as marriage. But two local courts deemed the DPA unconstitutional, most recently in November, suspending its implementation.
Thousands of people on the socially conservative island support a ban on gay marriage. 
Bermuda's government said it is appealing the matter to London's Privy Council, the highest court of appeal for British territories, because the matter is of general public importance.
""Constitutional issues are important issues and this Government wants to get it right,"" the government said in a statement on Thursday.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has yet to decide whether to grant permission to appeal. A spokeswoman for the Privy Council could not immediately be reached for comment.
Appeals to the Privy Council are rare, with only one or two cases from Bermuda brought each year, according to court records seen by Reuters.
Local courts said the DPA violates a clause in the constitution that protects freedom of conscience, handing down rulings that were celebrated by local lawyers and activists who have fought to undo the legislation.
""This is a cynical, bigoted, hypocritical attack on the rights and freedoms of others,"" said Tony Brannon, a gay rights activist in Bermuda, of the appeal to the Privy Council.
If gay marriage is allowed to stand, its proponents expect it to set a precedent for other British territories.

(Reuters) - Investigators are still piecing together what killed two private subcontractors near the largest U.S. research station in Antarctica, but no criminal activity was immediately suspected, the National Science Foundation (NSF) said on Thursday.
The two fire-safety technicians died in unexplained circumstances on Wednesday while performing preventive maintenance on a building that houses a generator for a radio transmitter outside the NSF-managed McMurdo Station, the agency said.
While the science foundation, a U.S. government agency, said an official inquiry into the deaths was just getting under way, spokesman Peter West told Reuters that investigators had turned up no evidence of foul play.
He also said the deaths were believed to have resulted in all likelihood from some kind of accident or mishap. West said he was not at liberty to disclose more about the investigation.
NSF also declined to disclose any personal information about the two workers, except to say they were employed by a Virginia-based company, PAE, which in turn was hired by the U.S. Antarctica Program's logistics contractor, Leidos, headquartered in Colorado.
PAE did not respond to requests for comment.
The science foundation initially reported the two technicians were found unconscious on the floor of the generator hut after a helicopter pilot flying over the area saw what appeared to be smoke coming from the structure and landed to investigate.
The NSF revised its account on Thursday, saying the pilot was on the ground a short distance away waiting for the pair to complete their work. He walked up a hill to the generator to check on them when they failed to return to the helicopter landing site at the agreed-upon time.
One of the workers was pronounced dead by medical personnel called to the scene and the other a short time later at the McMurdo medical clinic, the NSF said.
The largest research outpost in Antarctica, the 60-year-old McMurdo Station lies at the tip of Ross Island in New Zealand-claimed territory called the Ross Dependency. The two deaths occurred on Dec. 12, New Zealand time.
Daytime highs in December, in the middle of the Antarctic summer, average 31.5 degrees Fahrenheit, or just below zero degrees Celsius. Some 900 people, including scientists and support personnel, work at the station this time of year.
Human deaths are uncommon in Antarctica, despite its harsh environment. As recently as October, a subcontractor died of natural causes at Palmer Station, one of two other NSF outposts on the frozen continent. A 43-year-old electronic maintenance technician from Canada died at McMurdo on New Year's Day 2000.

1244,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 07:55PM ET</span>",Brazil judge orders arrest of Italian militant fugitive Battisti: report,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has ordered the arrest of Cesare Battisti, an Italian former left-wing guerrilla convicted of murder in his country, opening the way for his extradition, Globo TV reported on Thursday.
Justice Luiz Fux revoked an injunction he granted last year preventing Battisti's extradition, and ruled it was up to Brazil's president to decide his fate, Globo said. Battisti's lawyer Igor Tamasauskas told Reuters he had received the decision but had not yet read it, though he believed his client's arrest had been ordered.
The extradition of Battisti has been long sought by Italy. He faces life in prison in his home country, where he was convicted of four murders committed in the 1970s, when he belonged to a guerrilla group called Armed Proletarians for Communism. He escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited.
The Italian government almost obtained his extradition in 2010 but leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva granted Battisti asylum on his last day in office that year.
Brazil's incoming far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, has said he would extradite Battisti immediately.
The current centrist government of President Michel Temer was prevented from extraditing Battisti by Fux's injunction upholding his asylum status. That decision came after Battisti was caught trying to cross the border into Bolivia and arrested for having large amounts of undeclared cash. 
Fux has now decided that the extradition should be a presidential decision, since the Supreme Court had already ruled for Battisti to be sent back to Italy in 2009.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday narrowed an order that had blocked President Donald Trump's administration from enforcing new rules that undermine an Obamacare requirement for employers to provide insurance that covers women's birth control.
Last year two federal judges - one in Philadelphia and one in Oakland, California - had blocked the government from enforcing a new guideline allowing businesses or nonprofits to obtain exemptions from the contraception policy on moral or religious grounds. The Justice Department appealed both rulings.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said on Thursday the government likely violated administrative laws in promulgating the new rules. The appeals court said, however, the injunction issued in California should not apply nationwide, but only within the five states that sued over the policy.
California's attorney general filed the case, along with AGs in Delaware, Virginia, Maryland and New York. 
Despite the 9th Circuit ruling, a nationwide injunction issued by the Philadelphia judge is still in effect while that case is under appeal at the 3rd Circuit, a spokesman for Pennsylvania's attorney general said on Thursday.
U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco said single judges should not be able to issue nationwide injunctions, and called the 9th Circuit ruling ""a victory for restoring the constitutional order of the federal government and ending abuses of judicial power."" 
Meanwhile, California Attorney General Xavier Bacerra in a statement said the decision ""is an important step to protect a woman’s right to access cost-free birth control.""
One 9th Circuit judge on the three-judge panel, an appointee of Republican President George H.W. Bush, said he would have revoked the California injunction altogether.
The cases are among several that Democratic state attorneys general filed after the Republican Trump administration revealed the new rules which targeted the contraceptive mandate implemented as part of 2010's Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.
The rules would let businesses or nonprofits lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law's mandate that employers provide contraceptive coverage in health insurance with no co-payment.
Conservative Christian activists and congressional Republicans praised the move, while reproductive rights advocates and Democrats criticized it.

A new but similar set of federal rules around birth control coverage are set to take effect next month, which are also the subject of separate court challenges.

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 07:05PM ET</span>",Federal prosecutors probing Trump inauguration spending: WSJ,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are investigating whether U.S. President Donald Trump's inaugural committee misspent some of the record $107 million it raised from donors, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people it said were familiar with the matter.
The early-stage investigation by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office is examining whether some of the committee's donors gave money in exchange for policy concessions, influencing administration positions or access to the incoming administration, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.
A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office declined to comment. 
Asked about the report, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Reuters the president was not involved in his inaugural committee. ""The last thing a president-elect has time for is inaugural fund-raising,"" he said.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders also said the inauguration had nothing to do with Trump or his wife, Melania.
""The biggest thing the president did in his engagement in the inauguration was to come here and raise his hand and take the oath of office,"" Sanders told reporters.
The probe into the inaugural committee comes as Trump and his White House are already facing investigations into the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia, hush-money payments to women claiming to have had affairs with Trump and spending by Trump's foundation, among other issues.
According to the Journal, the investigation into the inaugural committee partly stemmed from materials seized in a probe into the dealings of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. Cohen was sentenced on Wednesday to three years in prison for crimes including orchestrating the hush payments in violation of campaign laws.
Although campaign finance laws restrict the size of campaign contributions, inaugurations can accept unlimited donations, including from corporations. The amount raised by Trump's inaugural committee, chaired by real estate developer and investor Thomas Barrack, was the largest in history, according to Federal Election Commission filings. 
The Journal said there was no sign the probe was targeting Barrack. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The event-planning business of Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former unpaid advisor to Melania Trump, was the highest-paid vendor to the committee at $25.8 million, the Journal reported. A recorded conversation between Wolkoff and Cohen in which she expressed concern about the committee's spending was seized from Cohen, the Journal said, citing a person familiar with the matter. 
Prosecutors have questioned former campaign aide Richard Gates, who served as deputy chairman of inaugural committee, the Journal reported. Gates pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy charges relating to his foreign consulting work with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
Tom Green, a lawyer for Gates, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Journal said prosecutors are also seeking documents from Franklin Haney, a Tennessee developer who gave $1 million to the inaugural committee and later hired Cohen to help him obtain a $5 billion U.S Department of Energy loan. A loan application by Haney's company is still pending with the department, the Journal reported. 
Larry Blust, a lawyer for Haney, declined to comment.

Other major inauguration donors included casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million, and investment firm founder  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) and mining investor Christopher Cline, who gave $1 million each, according to FEC filings. There is no indication any of the three are part of the investigation.

The remaining 13 council members voted in favor of the resolution drafted by Sweden and Kuwait. It renewed action first taken by the council in 2014 to allow aid deliveries into then rebel-held areas at four border crossings from Turkey, Iraq and Jordan, even though Syria warned against the measure. 
However, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia complained that the text was outdated as one of those crossings was now back in Syrian government hands and the situation elsewhere in the country had changed. 
""The fact that the stabilizing trends are strengthening in Syria is undeniable ... Despite remaining problems there are positive steps in improving the humanitarian situation,"" Nebenzia said. 
""This is a critical moment and the international community needs to now give a helping hand to the Syrians in order to overcome the devastation and making sure that people who voluntarily decided to return can live normally,"" he added.
But Western countries say they will not approve reconstruction funding for Syria, or drop sanctions on the Syrian government, without a political settlement to end the more than seven-year conflict. 
""The Assad regime supported by its backers has not only created an environment that makes humanitarian aid essential for millions of Syrians, but it continues to use aid as a weapon of war,"" British U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce told the council. 
U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock told the council on Thursday that cross-border aid ""provides a critical lifeline for millions of Syrians who cannot be supported through other means.""
China's U.N. Ambassador Ma Zhaoxu said international aid operations in Syria should ""scrupulously observe the principles of neutrality, impartiality and non-politicization.""

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 06:25PM ET</span>","Bomb threats demanding bitcoin sweep U.S., Canada, none found credible","By Mark Hosenball
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A rash of bomb threats were emailed on Thursday to hundreds of businesses, public offices and schools across the United States and Canada demanding payment in cryptocurrency, but none of the threats appeared credible, law enforcement officials said.
One email targeting a St. Louis-area middle school was traced by local investigators to an internet protocol, or IP, address in Moscow, the sheriff's office in Lincoln County, Missouri said.
But U.S. government sources speaking on background to Reuters said that such findings were inconclusive and that federal investigators doubted that Russians or the Russian government were involved.
The officials cautioned that such an IP address does not prove it came from Russia because the sender could have electronically laid a false trail to cover up its true origin. They suggested instead that the flurry of emails were part of a widescale digital hoax.
The security scare began shortly before 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) as police departments in major U.S. cities coast to coast began reporting on Twitter that numerous local businesses had received the menacing emails - awkwardly worded threats to set off a bomb unless a bitcoin payment of $20,000 were received.
Four hours into the security scare, no actual explosives had been found, authorities said. But the threats prompted brief evacuations of a Toronto subway station and a newspaper office in Raleigh, North Carolina. Some public schools and businesses also were evacuated as a precaution.
Lincoln County, Missouri, sheriff's spokesman Lieutenant Andy Binder said authorities bused the students from a middle school receiving one of the threats to another campus as a precaution, but the school was later determined to be safe and classes will resume there on Friday.
Among other cities where bomb threats were reported by authorities were Washington, New York, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oklahoma City, Denver, Ottawa, and Calgary, Alberta.
Police at the University of Wisconsin in Madison tweeted an image taken of one email threat found to be circulating that said in part: ""Good day. There is an explosive device (lead azide) in the building where your company is conducted. It is assembled according to my guide. It is compact and it is covered up very carefully. It can not damage the structure of the building, but in case of its explosion you will get many wounded people."" 
The campus police tweet concludes by referring to the emails as ""a SCAM happening nationwide."" 
The FBI and other federal agencies were alerted to the email chains, officials said.
""We are aware of threats being made in cities across the country,"" Rukelt Dalberis, an FBI spokesman in Los Angeles, told Reuters separately. ""We remain in touch with our law enforcement partners. We encourage the public to remain vigilant and report suspicious activities that could represent a threat."" 
A similar wave of emailed hoax bomb threats in December 2015 prompted officials in Los Angeles to close the city's public school system, which national law enforcement officials later criticized as an overreaction.
Two weeks previously, a married couple inspired by Islamic State had killed 14 people at a California county office building in a shooting rampage.

A teenager with dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship was arrested in Israel in March 2017 for making bomb threats to more than 100 Jewish organizations and Jewish community centers (JCCs) in dozens of U.S. states over several months.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia and China abstained on Thursday in a United Nations vote to extend a peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic (CAR) because the French-drafted resolution did not make direct reference to Russia's efforts to help the country.
The remaining 13 U.N. Security Council members voted for the annual renewal of the operation, deployed in 2014, which has more than 12,000 troops and police. Violence broke out in CAR in 2013 when mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted the president, prompting reprisals from mostly Christian militias.
Despite their abstentions, Russia and China both said they supported the peacekeeping mission. But the Security Council vote highlights a wariness by Western powers of efforts by Moscow and Beijing to expand their influence in Africa.
""Assisting the government of the Central African Republic is not a competition. In helping one of the world's poorest countries emerge from more than a decade of conflict in pursuit of peace and development, there's no room for jealousy,"" Deputy U.S. Ambassador Jonathan Cohen told the council. 
Earlier on Thursday the Trump administration unveiled its strategy for Africa, which national security adviser John Bolton said aimed to counter economic and political influence of China and Russia on the continent.
In CAR this year Russia has sent plane loads of weapons and dozens of contractors to train soldiers and secure mining projects, marking the start of its highest-profile military foray in sub-Saharan Africa for decades.
While the African Union, supported by CAR's former colonial ruler France, is trying to broker peace, Russia and Sudan separately mediated a preliminary agreement signed by Central African armed groups in August in Khartoum.
The African Union initiative ""is the only dialogue process which is direct and inclusive between the Central African government and the armed groups from which dialogue and comprehensive peace agreement could emerge,"" French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre told the council on Thursday. 
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia complained that the French-drafted resolution did not welcome peace efforts that ""are in line with and help the implementation of the African peace initiative"" or the contribution of the Russian trainers. 
""Behind all of this what we can see is an approach to the African countries as one's own turf and reserve within the vicious circle of metropolis versus colony,"" Nebenzia said. 

Chinese U.N. Ambassador Ma Zhaoxu also said the resolution should have recognized all efforts to broker peace in CAR.

MANAGUA (Reuters) - Nicaraguan lawmakers on Thursday blocked five non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that had been critical of President Daniel Ortega from formally operating, after previously blocking five others, including a prominent human rights group.
International human rights organizations said the move was retaliation against the groups for highlighting human rights violations committed during eight months of anti-government protests. 
The protests left at least 322 dead and more than 500 people in jail, according to the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, or Cenidh - one of the organizations that was stripped of legal status on Wednesday by Nicaragua's Congress, which is controlled by Ortega's allies. 
Without legal status, organizations cannot keep bank accounts, receive funds or carry out projects. The interior ministry oversees the registry of NGOs and can ask Congress to cancel their legal status. 
""We are not going away,"" said Cenidh President Vilma Nunez in a phone interview. ""I will use all the energy I have left to defend these offices."" 
Pro-government lawmakers accuse the organizations of receiving money to finance a ""coup"" seeking to oust Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo. 
The government is likely to keep wiping out more organizations, said political analyst Eliseo Nunez.
""Their strategy is one of revenge to eliminate any sign of domestic opposition,"" he said. 
Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said the ban was a serious attack on civil society.

""Anyone who dares to disagree with the Ortega-Murillo regime continues to be repressed,"" he said on Twitter.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 05:54PM ET</span>",Yemen's warring parties agree to ceasefire in Hodeidah and U.N. role,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Johan Sennero
RIMBO, Sweden (Reuters) - Yemen's warring parties agreed on Thursday to cease fighting for the Houthi-held port city of Hodeidah and withdraw their troops, the first significant breakthrough for U.N.-led peace efforts in five years of conflict. 
At the close of a week of talks in Sweden, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a framework for political negotiations would be discussed at the next round of talks at the end of January between the Iranian-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. 
Western nations, some of which supply arms and intelligence to the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015, had pressed the two sides to agree confidence-building steps to pave the way for a wider truce and a political process to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people.
The conflict has pushed Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, to the verge of famine. The World Food Programme said the Hodeidah deal was a much-needed boost for its task of feeding 12 million severely hungry Yemenis. 
The Houthis control most towns and cities including the capital Sanaa, from where they ousted Hadi's government in 2014. It is now based in the southern port of Aden.
""You have reached an agreement on Hodeidah port and city, which will see a mutual re-deployment of forces from the port and the city, and the establishment of a governorate-wide ceasefire,"" said Guterres.
""The U.N. will play a leading role in the port,"" he told a news conference in Rimbo, outside Stockholm.
The United States, which provides military support to the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, welcomed the agreement. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that while many details still needed to be worked out, the talks marked a pivotal first step. ""Moving forward, all must continue to engage, de-escalate tensions, and cease ongoing hostilities,"" he said in a statement.
In a largely symbolic rebuke to President Donald Trump, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution on Thursday to end military backing for the war in Yemen. The measure is unlikely to become law.
QUICK WITHDRAWAL 
U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths said both parties would withdraw ""within days"" from the port, a main entry point for most of Yemen's commercial imports and aid supplies, and later from the city of Hodeidah, where coalition troops have massed on the outskirts. 
Houthi forces would also pull back from the port of Salif, used for grains, and Ras Isa, used for oil. Revenues from the three ports would go the central bank branch in Hodeidah.
A Redeployment Coordination Committee including both sides will oversee the ceasefire and withdrawal, according to the agreement. It will be chaired by the United Nations and report weekly to the U.N. Security Council.
International monitors will be deployed in Hodeidah city and the three ports, and all armed forces are due to pull back completely within 21 days of the ceasefire coming into force.
Saudi ambassador to Yemen Mohammed al-Jabir told Al Arabiya TV that enforcement procedures relating to Hodeidah would start on Friday.
Another joint committee overseen by the United Nations will set up humanitarian corridors to Taiz, Yemen's third city.
""This is a minor breakthrough. They have been able to achieve more than anyone expected,"" said Elizabeth Dickinson, Senior Analyst, Arabian Peninsula, at International Crisis Group.
""Saudi Arabia has taken a firmer hand with the Hadi government, which has in turn been more cooperative.""
She added: ""The big game is the political framework, which would pave the way for actual peace negotiations.""
Riyadh has come under increased scrutiny over the Yemen war and its activities in the region since the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
The Sunni Muslim Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened to restore Hadi's government, but is now bogged down in a military stalemate and wants to exit the costly war.
The Saudi ambassador to Washington, Prince Khalid bin Salman, said the deal would help ensure the security of the Red Sea, one of the world's main routes for oil tankers.

Guterres said the UN would push on with tackling issues hanging over from the talks, including reopening Sanaa airport and shoring up the central bank.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 05:46PM ET</span>",May urges EU to help get Brexit 'over the line',"By Gabriela Baczynska and Elizabeth Piper
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain's weakened prime minister, Theresa May, appealed to fellow EU leaders on Thursday for concessions to help her win support in parliament next month for a deal that can smooth Britain's exit from the European Union.
""Trust me,"" she urged the other 27 leaders, according to a British official. She assured them she could get the deal they agreed with her last month through parliament -- if they would only help her overcome British resistance to its terms.
""It is in none of our interests to run the risk of an accidental no deal with all the disruption that would bring, or to allow this to drag on any further,"" she warned, before leaving the others to discuss their response over dinner.
Twenty-four hours after surviving an internal party vote that threatened to oust her, May was met largely by readiness to help from European Union leaders but also by a warning: we will not reopen the divorce agreement struck last month.
Leaders who have said that some kind of declaratory text aimed at easing British concerns could be delivered on Thursday, with possibly more to come next month before May puts her package to lawmakers. 
Diplomats said one option would be to put a date -- possibly end-2021 -- as a non-binding target for concluding a close EU-UK trade alliance that would end the need for the ""Irish backstop"" -- a mechanism anathema to May's party.
However, even introducing an aspirational date would be hard for some, including Dublin, to accept, as May struggles to find a way to satisfy her critics' demand for a strict time-limit. 
The backstop could leave Britain tied forever to EU customs rules until a better way is agreed to ensure there are no disruptive frontier controls on Northern Ireland's land border with the Irish republic. 
""We have to change the perception that the backstop could be a trap from which the UK could not escape. Until we do, the deal, our deal, is at risk,"" May told the other leaders.
""There is a majority in my parliament who want to leave with a deal so with the right assurances this deal can be passed.""
DEADLOCK
Britain's departure from the EU, its biggest shift in trade and foreign policy for over 40 years, is proving far from easy, complicated by the deep divisions in her Conservative Party.
With less than four months before Britain is due to leave on March 29, May faces deadlock in parliament over the deal, which has hardened positions at home, throwing up more uncertainty for businesses trying to predict what will happen to the economy.
While others tried to temper their language by expressing a desire to help May, French President Emmanuel Macron was blunt. 
""We cannot reopen a legal agreement, we can't renegotiate what was negotiated for several months,"" he told reporters. ""It's up to Theresa May to tell us what political solution she expects to pursue to find a majority for this deal.""
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was less strident, saying: ""We can of course talk about whether there are additional assurances but in this the 27 EU members are together and will make their interests clear, although always in the spirit that we want very, very good relations with Great Britain after Great Britain has left the European Union.""
MAY SURVIVES
May won Wednesday's party ballot 200-117 but the size of the vote against her deepened divisions just weeks before parliament needs to approve a deal to prevent a disorderly exit from the EU. Victory also came at a price - May promised she would step down by the next election scheduled for 2022. 
Her spokeswoman said that the Brexit deal would be put before parliament ""as soon as possible"" in January.
The level of opposition to her deal was underlined earlier this week when May was forced to delay a parliamentary vote on her deal for fear of a defeat. 
May wants legal assurances that the backstop will not remain in place indefinitely. 
Diplomats expect it to change after May tells the other national leaders what she needs. They suggested the EU may be readying more solid assurances for May in January.

""Today is about de-mystifying this whole Northern Ireland backstop. Nobody in the EU wants to use it. But we need to have it,"" said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

Michel Sidibe announced the decision on Thursday at the end of a three-day board meeting of UNAIDS that examined the panel's report, the agency said in a statement.
The four-member panel, in a 70-page report issued last Friday, said that a ""patriarchal culture of favoritism and cronyism"" had allowed ""impunity and retaliation"". Sidibe, a Malian national, has been executive director since 2009 of the Geneva-based agency which has some 670 staff worldwide.
""He informed the UNAIDS Board that its meeting in June 2019 would be his last Board meeting and he would complete his duties at the end of June 2019,"" said a UNAIDS statement on Thursday night.
Sidibe was quoted as saying in the UNAID statement: ""I look forward to an inclusive, transparent and open dialogue and collaboration with staff in shaping a new UNAIDS.""
""I will work to ensure a smooth transition and pledge to keep my focus on our staff and delivering results for the people we serve.""
The United Nations has tried to increase transparency and strengthen how it deals with serious accusations in recent years after a string of sexual exploitation and abuse charges were made against U.N. peacekeepers in Central African Republic.
""The UNAIDS Secretariat is in crisis, a crisis which threatens its vital work,"" the panel report said, citing results of staff surveys that ""painted a troubling picture of the UNAIDS organizational culture that cries out for urgent change.""
UNAIDS said last month it had placed its country director for Nigeria on administrative leave following allegations of sexual harassment. That case is one of three under investigation, UNAIDS spokeswoman Sophie Barton-Knott said. 

In February, Luiz Loures, UNAIDS deputy head, said he would not seek to renew his term in office, although the spokeswoman said at the time it was not reasonable to link his departure to a sexual harassment allegation that proved unsubstantiated.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S.-backed SDF vows to fight any Turkish attack in north Syria,"By Rodi Said
AIN ISSA, Syria (Reuters) - The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces will respond strongly to any Turkish attack but is pressing diplomatic efforts to deter an assault, its commander-in-chief said on Thursday.
In a rare interview, Mazloum Kobani told Reuters that Washington had made ""serious attempts"" to prevent a Turkish offensive against Kurdish fighters who control a swathe of northern Syria at the Turkish border, but the United States should ramp up its efforts further.
The SDF, which is spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, has been at the heart of the U.S.-backed fight against Islamic State. It has seized vast territory from the jihadists with the help of U.S. warplanes and special forces.
SDF commander-in-chief Kobani warned that a Turkish assault would tie up YPG fighters who are currently fighting Islamic State remnants in eastern Syria, allowing the jihadists to spread again.
""We are ready for any attack and will respond strongly...within our areas,"" said Kobani, a founder of the SDF and YPG. ""Till now, our diplomatic attempts are ongoing to deter this."" 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan declared on Wednesday that he would launch an operation within days into northeast Syria, where some 2,000 U.S. troops stand alongside the SDF. He said the target was not U.S. soldiers. 
The Pentagon warned that any unilateral military action would be ""unacceptable"". 
U.S. support for the YPG has infuriated NATO ally Ankara, which deems the Kurdish fighters terrorists. Turkey says the YPG is an extension of the outlawed PKK movement that has waged a decades-long insurgency in southeast Turkey.
FIGHT TO THE DEATH
Kobani said Turkey had been mobilizing Syrian fighters allied to it at fronts bordering the SDF region.
In recent years, Turkish forces have already swept into Syria pushing the YPG out of territory west of the Euphrates. But past offensives have stopped at the banks of the river, partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. troops.
Kobani, 50, met with top U.S. diplomat for Syria, James Jeffrey, who came to the SDF region after holding talks in Ankara earlier this week.
""(Jeffrey) knows well that Turkish attacks will make the fight against Daesh fail and all the work between us will go to waste,"" Kobani said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
The SDF suspended its battle against Islamic State in eastern Syria in October due to Turkish cross-border shelling of the north. Ground operations resumed when the U.S. military set up observation posts at the border. 
At least 5,000 hardline jihadists remain holed up in the desert enclave in eastern Syria, including some elite forces and members of Islamic State's Shura Council, Kobani said. This includes some 2,000 foreign fighters, mostly Arabs and Europeans along with their families. 
""They have decided to fight till the death. Daesh is still strong,"" said Kobani, a former engineering student and activist whose nom de guerre refers to his Kurdish hometown in northern Syria. 
Kobani said it was possible that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was in eastern Syria, but the SDF could not be sure because he often disappears.
He said veteran Kurdish YPG fighters were running the offensive, leading thousands of more recently recruited local fighters from the mostly Arab eastern province of Deir al-Zor.

""If there is a Turkish attack, the YPG forces will be forced to come protect the borders, to defend their families,"" he said. Without them, ""the battle against Daesh is not possible.""

KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Negotiators from nearly 200 countries produced a draft text on Thursday on how to implement the Paris Agreement on combating global warming, but some disputes remain with only one day left before the official end of the conference.
The presidency of the climate talks in Katowice, Poland, had asked for a draft of the final package to be ready by Thursday afternoon after almost two weeks of negotiations, but work continued into the evening to get it ready.
The draft lays out options on ways to implement the 2015 Paris pact which aims to limit global warming to ""well below"" two degrees Celsius.
""We can implement the Paris Agreement as you all designed it. It is now time to move forward. We need to move. Climate change will not wait for us,"" Poland's Michal Kurtyka, president of the talks, told delegates.
Ministers are expected to continue working on sticking points through the night into Friday.
Disputes over finance have been a stumbling block at the talks, as well as monitoring and reporting countries' efforts to reduce emissions. The United States, which intends to withdraw from the pact, is trying to ensure a level playing field for U.S. businesses against China.
""Money is the most difficult part of it. This is all money talk. This (meeting) is about technical decisions although it turned political,"" one delegate told Reuters.
Groups of small island states and poorer countries, representing over 920 million people, issued a statement to Kurtyka expressing their frustration with the slow pace and lack of ambition of the talks. 
""(We are) deeply concerned over the direction in which the outcomes ... are heading,"" the statement said, adding that a robust rulebook is needed to ensure ambitious emissions cuts are made.
The text still contains some wording in brackets, denoting it has yet to be agreed, but less than previous drafts.

The talks are formally scheduled to end on Friday but in the past they have often over-run into the weekend.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>","Cocaine surge to Europe fueled by new gangs, violence: report","By Axel Bugge
LISBON (Reuters) - New gangs are muscling into cocaine markets in Europe, setting up smuggling networks straight from producers in Latin America to consumers, a business which used to be dominated by the mafia, the Lisbon-based EU drugs agency said on Thursday.
In a study, which aimed to identify the causes of surging amounts of cocaine smuggled into Europe, the agency found that new gangs from the Balkans, Morocco and elsewhere were joining Italy's mafia to supply Europe's most popular stimulant drug.
Rising supplies of purer cocaine to Europe is mainly the result of growing production in Latin America, especially by the biggest producer, Colombia.
That has led to growing numbers of gangs setting up their own smuggling lines straight from producers, which has kept cocaine prices lower. New gangs now include Moroccans, who use their established smuggling routes for cannabis. 
""The fragmentation of the cocaine trade in Europe appears to have resulted in increased competition among crime gangs for national and cross-border territories in cocaine supply and retail,"" the report said. ""One of the consequences has been an increase in violence and drug-related homicides.""
The emergence of more gangs has led to new marketing and transport methods, such as by couriers who dispatch the cocaine to consumers who contact special, dedicated call centers. 
Such courier services exist in Britain, France and Belgium, where buyers get in touch with call centers located in Spain or the western Balkans, the report said.
""These new methods, reflecting an 'Uberisation' of the cocaine trade, are clear signs of a competitive market in which sellers have to promote additional services beyond the product itself, such as fast delivery anywhere at any time,"" it said.
The increasing supply of cocaine in Europe has coincided in the past few years with changes in traditional smuggling routes from Iberia to large ports in Belgium, France and Germany. 
The port of Antwerp is now the single, biggest entry point for cocaine into Europe, with 41 tonnes seized in 2017. In 2016 70.9 tonnes of the drug was seized in all in Europe.
The report warned that the new smuggling routes through ports ""may represent only the tip of the iceberg, as other routes and trafficking modes, such as private aviation, may simply go undetected.""

1258,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 02:54PM ET</span>",Hungarian protests intensify as Orban heads to Brussels,"By Marton Dunai
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Thousands of Hungarians protested in Budapest on Thursday, resuming demonstrations that started on Wednesday against new legislation governing labor regulations and which would exempt government from independent control by the courts.
The ruling populist right-wing Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban passed both new laws on Wednesday, over opposition protests inside parliament and rioting on the street.
Around 3,000 demonstrators gathered at parliament on Thursday and later blocked traffic on one of the bridges over the Danube, shouting ""Dirty Fidesz"" and ""Orban go to hell.""
""Discontent has brought us here ... one is the issue of the courts, which is the next phase of cementing their power,"" said Tamas Szabo, 65, who came with a Hungarian flag. ""The other (law) is a slap on the face of working people.""
""I've come to show a huge middle finger to the government,"" said Adam, a student, who declined to give his full name.
The protesters were mostly upset with labor rules, which allow employers to require up to 400 overtime hours per year. 
Rights groups say the new law on administrative courts could lead to political interference in justice matters. The government rejected this assumption.
Orban has eroded democratic checks and balances since taking power in 2010, stacking courts and watchdog institutions with loyalists, turning much of the media into a propaganda machine, and favoring friends in public procurement.
In recent weeks, he chased a prominent U.S. private university out of the country and smoothed the way for a mammoth new pro-government media group, which formed as Orban associates donated vast media holdings to it.
International partners have failed to get him to stop. Orban is in Brussels for an EU summit, for talks on Brexit, the euro zone, migration and Russia, among others.
In September the European Parliament voted to impose sanctions on Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption. Certain of the support from Poland, Hungary rejected the accusations.
Despite any popular resentment, Orban's reshuffle of the electoral system and the lack of a unified opposition has allowed him to retain a two-thirds parliament majority with only about a third of the electorate supporting him.
He continues to enjoy that much support, easily beating most of his rivals put together, polls show.

Bukele, a 37-year-old businessman of the right-wing Great Alliance for National Unity party (GANA) has a 24-point advantage over his nearest rival with 44.1 percent of voter intentions, according to a poll conducted by Central American University (UCA).
His lead in polls marks the first time in three decades that a candidate from an outsider party has a real shot of winning the presidency.
""For the first time, the power held by two sides that were confronted in war and of two political (coalitions) that have taken turns in power since the peace accords is being challenged,"" UCA Vice Chancellor Omar Serrano said.
Bukele has gained support for his harsh criticism of traditional politicians and for revamping infrastructure works during his term as mayor of San Salvador.
The incumbent leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) has been in power since 2009, after the country's main right-wing party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), ruled for two decades.
Businessman Carlos Calleja of ARENA has 19.7 percent support in the poll. The candidate for the FMLN, former Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez, has 10.6 percent.
To win the presidency in El Salvador a candidate must get over 50 percent of the vote, otherwise a second-round runoff is required.
The former San Salvador mayor was kicked out of FMLN in October 2017, accused of dividing the party as well as throwing an apple at and insulting a female member of the party. Bukele denies the incident ever occurred.
He joined GANA after time had run out to register his own political party.
Rampant gang violence, a sluggish economy and high-profile corruption cases will likely be key voter issues.

UCA pollsters interviewed 1,806 people in the survey, which was conducted between Nov. 16 and Dec. 2.

LONDON (Reuters) - The former British wife of a Russian billionaire, who was ordered to pay a 453 million pound ($572 million) divorce bill, has claimed the first sliver of the award after seizing and selling a helicopter, her advisers said on Thursday.
Oil and gas tycoon Farkhad Akhmedov was ordered to pay around 40 percent of his fortune to Tatiana Akhmedova by London's High Court in 2016 in one of the largest divorce settlements in legal history.
The judge ordered Akhmedov to hand his former wife a modern art collection valued at over 90 million pounds, English property worth 2.5 million pounds, a 350,000 pound Aston Martin car and a 350 million pound lump sum. 
But he failed to do so and has called the proceedings misguided and wrong. 
The London court granted a worldwide freezing order and Akhmedova has employed lawyers and asset tracing specialists to unravel a web of offshore companies and try to claim assets around the globe - in particular superyacht M.V. Luna.
The Eurocopter EC155 helicopter, once used to ferry passengers to Luna, was seized and sold for around 5.0 million euros ($5.7 million), according to her lawyer. 
Luna, an expedition yacht built for Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich before Akhmedov bought it in 2014, has at least nine decks, space for 50 crew, two helipads, a vast swimming pool and a mini submarine. It is impounded in Dubai. 
""The net has been closing on Mr Akhmedov for a while now, and the sale of this helicopter proves that our enforcement methods are not just working but bearing fruit,"" said Jonathan Wild, an advocate and asset recovery specialist with Callin Wild LLC, who is representing Akhmedova.
A spokesman for Akhmedov said the net value of the helicopter was ""negligible"" in the context of the sums his former wife had spent on legal actions around the world.
""Mr Akhmedov and the Akhmedov family trust remain confident that their legal efforts will continue to be successful in preventing the seizure of any meaningful assets,"" he added.
Forbes estimates the net worth of Akhmedov, a former London oil and gas trader who earned a fortune in Russia's energy sector, at $1.4 billion. He features on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Russian so-called ""oligarchs"" identified as close to President Vladimir Putin, published in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives called nearly unanimously on Thursday for the government of Myanmar to release Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were imprisoned one year ago in a landmark free speech case.
House members voted by 394 to 1 for a resolution calling for release of Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who were found guilty in September of violating Myanmar's Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison. The case has raised questions among a number of political leaders in the United States and Europe, human rights advocates and the United Nations about Myanmar's progress toward democracy.
The measure is non-binding, but intended as a strong message to the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, as well as to President Donald Trump's administration that members of the U.S. Congress want the two men released.
The resolution also calls the Myanmar military's campaign against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority a genocide. In a report issued on Aug. 27, U.N. investigators said Myanmar’s military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" and for the first time explicitly called for Myanmar officials to face genocide charges over their campaign. 
The U.S. Department of State, which would make an official determination, has not made that official designation using the term genocide.
The Myanmar embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the House of Representatives vote.
The military in Myanmar, where Buddhism is the main religion, has denied past accusations that it had committed genocide against the Rohingya and says its actions were part of a fight against terrorism.
The one ""no"" vote came from Representative Andy Biggs, a Republican from Arizona. Asked to comment on Biggs’ vote, Daniel Stefanski, a spokesman for the congressman, did not directly address the question but said the Myanmar military’s ""continuing oppression of the Rohingya is inhumane"" and called on the Trump administration ""to use maximum diplomatic pressure to end the genocide and demand the release of the two journalists.""
The reporters, who pleaded not guilty, said they were handed papers by police shortly before they were detained, and a police witness testified that they had been set up. They had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya men and boys as part of a military response to insurgent attacks.
Lawyers for the two Reuters reporters have lodged an appeal against their conviction and sentence. An appeal hearing is scheduled for Dec. 24.
Among other things, the House resolution also condemns attacks against civilians by the Burmese military and calls on Trump to impose additional sanctions on senior members of the Burmese military and security forces it says are responsible for human rights abuses.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move is likely to please pro-settler members of Netanyahu's right-wing coalition while angering Palestinians, who want the West Bank as part of a future state.
""Arranging the rights for the homes allows thousands of residents to be provided with infrastructure of public buildings, educational and religious buildings,"" Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
It did not give a specific number of homes but Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked tweeted that more than 2,000 homes would be getting permits.
Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that are also home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians.
Settlements are one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, frozen since 2014.
In August, an Israeli court broke new ground, and infuriated Palestinians, by giving legal recognition to the Jewish outpost of Mitzpe Kramim, built without government authorization on privately owned Palestinian land in the West Bank.
Palestinians want the West Bank for a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. 
Most countries consider all settlements that Israel has built in territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war to be illegal. Israel disputes this and says their future should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians.
Netanyahu also said he would try to advance plans for 82 new housing units in the Jewish settlement of Ofra and two West Bank industrial zones.

Netanyahu last month faced a challenge from the far-right after his defense minister resigned and lashed out at the government’s acceptance of a ceasefire with the Palestinian militant group Hamas amid a surge in Gaza violence. Other far-right ministers had threatened to quit, but later backed down.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordanian authorities deployed hundreds of riot police in the capital and warned activists to stay within the law on Thursday as hundreds of demonstrators staged more protests against tough austerity measures backed by the International Monetary Fund. 
Large demonstrations in the summer over an unpopular IMF-backed tax bill brought down the previous government.
Protesters have been holding sporadic demonstrations for the past two weeks and a judicial source said authorities had detained several people for chanting slogans critical of King Abdullah as well as the government.
""(For) anyone who breaches the law there will be punishment,"" government spokeswoman Jumana Ghunaimat told reporters on Thursday.
""There are those who want to sow destruction ... We must safeguard Jordan's stability and security,"" she said, adding that the government wanted dialogue.
The latest protests erupted after a largely pliant parliament last month approved a tax bill widely seen as making few changes to the unpopular law scrapped after the summer demonstrations.
Many Jordanians say the government, which faces a record public debt of around $40 billion and desperately needs to raise revenue, is eroding the disposable incomes of poorer and middle class Jordanians while letting the wealthy off the hook.
The protesters complain that Prime Minister Omar Razzaz, appointed by King Abdullah after the summer protests, has not delivered on promises to jail corrupt officials and businessmen.
""Our demands are bread, dignity and freedom,"" chanted demonstrators as scuffles briefly broke out when some protesters sought to break a police cordon to march closer to the prime minister's office. 
They also say he has sought public support for tough economic measures while failing to curb lavish public expenditure and improve public services, and that he should resign.

Jordan suffers from high unemployment, with regional conflicts weighing on business confidence. Poor economic growth has reduced tax revenues, forcing Jordan to borrow heavily abroad and also to resort to more domestic financing.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - A fire overnight at a warehouse in Congo's capital destroyed thousands of voting machines and ballot boxes that were due to be used in the country's long-delayed Dec. 23 presidential election, authorities said on Thursday.
Democratic Republic of Congo's national electoral commission (CENI) said in a statement the blaze had destroyed 8,000 of 10,368 voting machines due to be used in the capital Kinshasa, but said the election would go ahead as scheduled. 
CENI did not say who it believed to be responsible for the fire - which broke out about 2 a.m. (0100 GMT) in the Gombe riverside area of Kinshasa that is also home to President Joseph Kabila's residence - but the ruling coalition and leading opposition candidates immediately traded accusations of blame.
Kabila's Common Front for Congo (FCC), which is backing former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary in the presidential race, accused opposition candidate Martin Fayulu of inciting violence earlier this month. 
""Over the course of this electoral campaign, (Fayulu) called on his supporters and sympathizers to destroy electoral materials,"" the FCC said in a statement. 
Fayulu rejected the charge and suggested that state security forces might have been behind the blaze. 
""The fire erupted in a building guarded by the Republican Guard,"" Fayulu told Reuters. ""You understand today that the Kabila people do not want to organize elections.""
Felix Tshisekedi, the other leading opposition candidate, also suggested on local radio that the government was responsible. ""How is it that what should be the best protected place in the republic at this time can burn so easily?"" he said. 
Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi, a Kabila adviser, said police guarding the warehouse had been arrested and that forensic police had launched an investigation. 
Kabila, in power since his father's assassination in 2001, is due to step down because of constitutional term limits.
The vote has already been delayed by two years due to what authorities said were logistical challenges but the opposition said were obstacles put in place out of Kabila's reluctance to relinquish power. 
This month's highly anticipated vote could mark Congo's first peaceful transition of power since independence in 1960, after decades marked by authoritarian rule, assassinations and civil wars in which millions of people are thought to have died.
ELECTION DATE MAINTAINED
CENI president Corneille Nangaa told a news conference the destroyed equipment represented the materials for 19 of 24 voting districts in Kinshasa.
""Without minimizing the gravity of this damaging situation for the electoral process, CENI is working to pursue the process in conformity with its calendar,"" Nangaa said.
Kikaya said voting machines from elsewhere in Congo would be recalled for use in Kinshasa, which is home to more than 15 percent of the population. 
The introduction of the untested tablet-like voting machines for the election has been widely opposed by opposition candidates competing against Shadary.
They say the machines are more vulnerable to vote-rigging than paper and ink, and could be compromised by the unreliability of Congo’s power supply.
The delay in the elections over the past two years has coincided with a breakdown in security across much of the vast mineral-rich country. Militants fight over land and resources in the east near the borders with Uganda and Rwanda. 
Campaigning over the past three weeks has been mostly peaceful, but police fired live rounds to disperse opposition supporters this week in the southeast, killing at least one person on Wednesday.

Another person was killed on Thursday by security forces in the central city of Mbuji-Mayi ahead of a campaign visit by Tshisekedi. Vincent Ngoy, a spokesman for the provincial governor, told Reuters a ""stray bullet"" was to blame.

1265,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 01:05PM ET</span>",Italy's lower deficit goal: a politically useful fudge,"By Gavin Jones and Giuseppe Fonte
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's surprise decision to sharply cut its budget deficit goal does little to address the problems of its finances or a deeper debate over EU fiscal rules, but may serve the real purpose of easing market pressure and playing for time.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told the European Commission on Wednesday he was lowering next year's target to 2.04 percent of gross domestic product from 2.4 percent to avoid disciplinary action by Brussels. 
Rome has yet to detail how it will achieve the lower target, and many economists believe it won't. The new goal probably still breaks European Union rules, but the Commission signaled it should be enough to halt its threatened ""excessive deficit procedure"" and markets celebrated.
Italian two-year bond yields hit their lowest level in six months on Thursday and the closely-watched Italy/Germany 10-year spread was at its tightest since late September, at 261 basis points, down about 80 points from highs reached in October.
If maintained, that means lower borrowing costs which will help the economy and reduce the deficit, taking pressure off the coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League.
""What they have done wins some time, it opens a channel of communication with the Commission and it shows some pragmatism which the markets may appreciate,"" said Wolfango Piccoli of the London-based political risk consultancy Teneo.
European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said after an ""extremely constructive meeting"" in Brussels with Economy Minister Giovanni Tria that Italy had made a ""significant effort"" and a deal was possible.
""We are working with the aim to reach a common position ... we want to do it quickly,"" he said, adding that there was still some ""technical work"" to be hammered out.
""NON-COMPLIANT""
Lorenzo Codogno, head of LC Macro Advisors and former chief economist at the Italian Treasury, believes the government may meet its new target by delaying implementation of welfare and pension measures, but this was of little importance.
""What matters is that the budget still entails a structural increase in spending which risks making Italy's public debt unsustainable,"" he said.
Even under the revised target the structural deficit, adjusted for economic growth and one-off items, still rises significantly next year, so Italy remains ""non-compliant"" with EU rules, Codogno added.
The main reason for Rome's move was market pressure that was squeezing the banking system and businesses in the League's northern Italian heartland, government and coalition sources told Reuters.
The government had justified the previous 2.4 percent target as the way to throw off austerity and unleash growth in the euro zone's most chronically sluggish economy, so it loses some face over the climbdown. However, opposition parties are in disarray, with the League and 5-Star together still commanding around 60 percent support in opinion polls.
""Still at work for the Italians, keeping our promises on work, pensions, health and security, aiming to avoid sanctions and problems with the EU and the markets,"" League leader Matteo Salvini tweeted after the new target was announced.
Salvini, who has softened his eurosceptic policies to capture the political middle ground, ignored advice from his hardline economics adviser Claudio Borghi to keep the deficit no lower than 2.2 percent.
FLAGSHIP REFORMS
Ministers have said some of the savings will come from costly flagship reforms: an income support scheme known as the ""citizens wage"", and a lowering of the retirement age.
Neither measure will take effect at the start of 2019, and the take-up of the early retirement option will be less than budgeted, yielding savings of ""a few billion euros"", Deputy Industry Minister Dario Galli said.
To find the rest of the roughly 7 billion euros needed, the government will sell public real estate and cut spending, and is considering a new tax on internet companies planned by the previous government but never implemented, sources said.
Some economists say that with the economy teetering on recession, the deficit will overshoot. ""If the 2.4 percent target was hard to hit, then 2 percent looks like fantasy,"" said Piccoli.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital said in a note to clients that it still expected a deficit of 2.8 percent next year, though there was now a slight chance it would be a little bit lower.
Brussels looks set to put Italy on a looser leash, having already indicated leniency toward France over its spending concessions following violent street protests.
""It will be very hard for the Commission to play hard ball with Italy given what is going on in France and now that Rome has shown some initiative,"" said Piccoli. 
He forecast that Brussels would play for time by delaying its final verdict on Rome's budget until April, when final end-2018 data are available.
Gustavo Piga, economics professor at Rome's Tor Vergata University, said considering the unrest in France the Commission would be mad not to accept Italy's concessions.

""It would show that they don't understand that economics feeds politics and they would be asking for trouble,"" he said.

TUNIS, (Reuters) - - Hundreds of lawyers and doctors in Tunisia protested on Wednesday against a new law that will force them to disclose their salaries as part of a government bid to raise taxes.
The North African country is under pressure from foreign donors to increase tax revenues to cut a budget deficit.
Parliament passed on Monday a bill which allows the government to force doctors and lawyers to disclose salaries. Both professions currently do not need to do this due to professional secrecy rules, which officials say is used by some to avoid tax by understating their actual income.
Hundreds of lawyers protested in front of the prime minister’s office holding up banners saying ""professional secrecy is a red line.”
The goal of the government is to strike free professions, eliminate them and weaken them by all means,"" said Amer Mehrazi, the dean of lawyers in the protest.
Some lawyers on Monday staged a brief strike in several courts.
A government official told Reuters that the law will create more tax transparency and ensure justice doctors and lawyers paid their fair share of tax.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Worshippers at a church in the Netherlands that have been holding round-the-clock prayer services for more than six weeks to prevent an Armenian family from being deported are hoping for a Christmas miracle.
Under Dutch law, police are barred from entering a place of worship while a ceremony is in progress. So hundreds of supporters from the Netherlands and abroad have held non-stop services at the Bethel church in The Hague to block the deportation of the Tamrazyan family. 
They are ""from all over the world, and that means a lot to our family. ...It gives us strength to keep going,"" said daughter Hayarpi, 21. ""I really don't know what the outcome will be, but we hope we can stay here because this is our home.""
The congregation hopes to convince Dutch authorities to make an exception to immigration rules on humanitarian grounds.
""We will continue for as long as we believe it is necessary and possible,"" Bethel Minister Derk Stegeman said. ""We hope at Christmas our minister will make a great gesture"" and grant clemency to the family, he said.
The family came to the Netherlands in 2010 and say they cannot safely return home because they are considered dissidents by the Armenian authorities, although the nationalist Republican Party government that dominated Armenia since independence from the Soviet Union was toppled this year after peaceful protests.
The Netherlands took in hundreds of thousands of migrant workers in the 1960s and 1970s but now has one of the EU's toughest immigration policies. The conservative government under Prime Minister Mark Rutte says ""economic"" immigrants cannot stay, though refugees fleeing violence have a right to asylum.
The Tamrazyans lived legally in the Netherlands for nine years while their asylum application made its way through the courts. But a final rejection came this year, and they have been refused an exemption under a program for minors living there for more than five years.
""They've been told numerous times they have to leave the Netherlands,"" the deputy minister for asylum and migration affairs, Mark Harbers, said on Dutch television last week. ""This (vigil) seems pretty hopeless to me."" 
Hayarpi and her sister, 19-year-old Warduhi, have been studying at a Dutch university, while their younger brother, 15-year-old Seyran, plays on a local soccer team. 

""My brother, sister and I grew up in the Netherlands,"" she told journalists. ""All our friends are here, and my sister and I are studying here. This is just where we belong.""

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic leaders rebuked President Donald Trump on Thursday for saying Mexico will pay for a border wall through a new trade deal, while Mexico's new president said the topic has not come up in his talks with Trump.
The Republican president vowed during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to build a wall along the border with Mexico to slow the flow of illegal immigration, and he has long pledged that Mexico - not U.S. taxpayers - would fund it.
In a Twitter post early on Thursday, Trump said that unspecified savings for the United States as a result of the renegotiated trade deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada would pay for the wall. 
""Just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!,"" he wrote.
While some U.S. businesses stand to benefit from a renegotiated North American trade deal, it was not clear what Trump was referring to in terms of savings for the U.S. government.
Funding for the border wall has been a sticking point in spending bills before Congress, and Trump clashed with leading Democrats over the issue during an Oval Office meeting on Tuesday.
One of them, House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, ridiculed Trump's assertion on Thursday.
""What money? What money? 'That money will be used to pay for the wall?' The money that businesses make? What money is he talking about that's going to go pay for the wall? It just doesn't measure up,"" Pelosi told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. 
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer taunted Trump over his Mexico claim in a riposte on Twitter.
""Mr. President: If you say Mexico is going to pay for the wall (which I don’t believe), then I guess we don't have to! Let's fund the government,"" Schumer wrote.
In Mexico City, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the border wall was not discussed on a phone call with the U.S leader on Wednesday. Mexico has repeatedly rejected Trump's demand it pay for the wall.
""We have not discussed that issue, in any conversation. ... It was a respectful and friendly conversation,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters after Trump's tweet linking the trade deal to wall funding.
Instead, he said the two leaders spoke about the possibility of creating a joint program for development and job creation in Central America and Mexico. The White House confirmed the call was about the drivers of migration including insecurity and economic stagnation.
Lopez Obrador said he also discussed a possible meeting with Trump in Washington.

""He invited me. I'm also able to go to Washington, but I think that both for him and for us there must be a reason and I think the most important thing would be to sign this agreement or meet with that purpose,"" said Lopez Obrador.

1269,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Dutch fudge or Walloon macaroon? EU weighs gift for May,"By Gabriela Baczynska and Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Dutch fudge is off the summit table as EU lawyers look closer to home in Belgium for a model of what leaders can offer Prime Minister Theresa May in the way of reassurances to help her sell a Brexit deal at home in Britain.
May arrived in Brussels on Thursday hoping to persuade the rest of the European Union at the summit to gift-wrap a treaty on British withdrawal that she agreed with them just last month, but has been unable to get through parliament before Christmas.
The EU refuses to reopen the package so efforts focus on new words the Union could offer to ease fears that an Irish ""backstop"" insurance clause could trap Britain forever in EU rules.
There is long pedigree of such special favors, involving Danes, the Dutch, the British themselves and a quick fix to fend off a veto threat in 2016 from the French-speaking Belgian region of Wallonia.
Complicating calculations is how far the EU can or should hand May a gift before Christmas, and how much it should take more time -- meaning their delivery is still fresh in the minds of British lawmakers when they come to vote in the new year.
May visited Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Tuesday. After a referendum in the Netherlands two years ago seemed set to undo an EU pact with Ukraine, Rutte got fellow leaders to issue a summit ""decision"" that reassured his country that Ukraine was not about to join the EU.
However, EU officials say the ""Dutch fudge"" model would need longer preparation than May has left before Brexit in March and carries more legal weight than Ireland and others would accept.
That applies too to the ""Danish solution"", referring to a summit in Edinburgh in 1992 which gave Denmark a side-deal to avoid its government vetoing the Maastricht Treaty on deep European integration, despite Danes voting No in a referendum.
HOMAGE TO WALLONIA
The favored solution now, say EU diplomats, is that used to appease Belgium's Walloons when their left-wing parliament threatened to veto a free trade accord with Canada.
Belgian trade policy is devolved to its French-, Dutch- and German-speaking regions, so this was a major threat. The fix was a 12-page ""Joint Interpretative Instrument"", by which the Union set out how the EU-Canada treaty would work.
Lawyers believed this did not go beyond the deal already signed in Ottawa or obfuscate possible future legal arguments. 
That would fit the bill now for an EU determined not to unwrap the indefinite guarantee to Dublin that Britain would stay in a customs union until a better way is found to avoid frontier posts that could disrupt the peace in Northern Ireland.
Officials have already drafted a page of ""conclusions"" which could be issued after a late-night session on Thursday to ""clarify"", for example, the EU's intent not to use the backstop.
Some diplomats think that could mark just an early Christmas gift to bolster May at home, with a more substantial package of promises -- though still political rather than legally-binding -- to come next month, before she puts her deal to parliament.
""We can’t give too much now as we would be left empty-handed for stage two in January,"" one senior EU diplomat told Reuters.
The British have form on this. Leaders remember a summit deal for May's predecessor David Cameron in early 2016. Based on the Danish model, it included an opt-out from EU migration rules and was meant to help him persuade Britons to stay in the EU.
But in campaigning for the June Brexit referendum, he barely mentioned it and then lost -- throwing the Union into an existential crisis

""The experience of Mr. Cameron showed these things have a tendency to evaporate very quickly,"" a second senior diplomat said of the timing of any special reassurances for May. ""There is a risk of a similar situation.""

1270,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 12:28PM ET</span>","In an African first, a cannabis expo...without cannabis","By Joe Bavier
PRETORIA (Reuters) - Andre Kruger's stand at Africa's first ever cannabis exposition displayed an indoor growing tent, complete with state-of-the-art lighting imported from the United States and fittings for a high-tech hydroponic irrigation system. 
What it didn't have, however, was a cannabis plant. 
The four-day expo, which opened in South Africa's capital Pretoria on Thursday, was a stark illustration of the legal grey area the nascent industry occupies in the continent's most developed economy. 
In September, the Constitutional Court decriminalised the use and cultivation of cannabis in private space. But the decision did not legalize its trade or distribution. Even displaying cannabis in public remains legally dubious. 
So exhibitors at the expo got creative. Kruger, whose company Sombrero Hydroponics has seen a spike in customer inquiries since September, used two artificial poinsettias as stand-ins.
""People just feel more comfortable now, because they don't have this added thought in the back of their mind thinking, 'What if the cops stop at my house?'"" he said. ""They're coming out of the closet, in this case the tent.""
Hundreds of expo-goers bought tickets and were already queuing before the event opened, but not everyone agreed with the ground rules.
Cannabis activist Steven Thapelo Khundu handed out cannabis buds from a plastic bag at the expo entrance, encouraging attendees to bring them inside. 
""Free Ganga Free! Free Ganga Free!"" he shouted as security forcibly removed him. 
Under the court decision, lawmakers have two years to amend the country's cannabis laws, but the industry isn't waiting. 
South Africa recently established a legal framework for licensing growers. The local unit of Canada's Canopy Growth, which in August received a $4 billion investment pledge from Corona beer maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), is among the early applicants.
""I don't think most people realize just how big the cannabis industry is in Africa already, in South Africa already,"" said the Cannabis Expo's co-founder Silas Howarth.
International companies are, for now at least, seeking licenses to produce cannabis for export. But Gerhard Naude, the founder of healthcare company Go Life International, believes a fully legal domestic industry is now only a matter of time.
""I think there will be a few licenses awarded, and very closely regulated. I think in two years we'll definitely have a license, for the use of medicinal cannabis in any case,"" he said.
Itumeleng Tau, who said he's been growing marijuana for around 20 years, is among a wave of underground cannabis entrepreneurs who are hoping the pending legal changes will allow them to bring their businesses out of the shadows. 
The expo was an important first step, he said. But the absence of any actual cannabis was strange.

""It's something very, very wrong ... It's like we came to a party but there's no music.""

""Brexit Christmas wish: finally decide what you really want and Santa will deliver,"" Lithuania's ever pithy president, Dalia Grybauskaite, tweeted as Prime Minister Theresa May began 24 hours of meetings with her 27 EU counterparts in Brussels.
Having agreed a treaty last month to ease Britain's path out of the bloc in March, the EU was exasperated that May failed to get the package through parliament this week and has come to the summit seeking tweaks that they show little sign of giving her.

May survived a confidence vote by her Conservative Party on Wednesday, but a mutiny by more than a third of her lawmakers indicated parliament was heading toward deadlock over Brexit.

STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - Armed French police launched an operation in Strasbourg's Neudorf neighborhood on Thursday as they pursue the hunt for a gunman who killed three people in an attack on a Christmas market.
Elite officers from the RAID police unit fanned out along one street, some with their guns trained on the houses in front of them. Other officers extended a security perimeter in the neighborhood.
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QQL0XG) 
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told the Senate that police were acting on a lead and ""eliminating any doubts"". There was no immediate indication they had located the suspect shooter.
The death toll from Tuesday night's attack rose to three on Thursday, as police combed the city in the east of France for a second day and manned checkpoints on the German border. 
Police issued a wanted poster for Cherif Chekatt, the main suspect in the attack, who was on an watchlist as a potential security threat. Authorities say the 29-year-old was known to have developed radical religious views while in jail.
Strasbourg's mayor has said the attack was ""indisputably an act of terrorism"" and, with the gunman on the run, France has raised its security threat to the highest level. 
More than 700 police are taking part in the manhunt. French and German police manned controls on either side of the Europe Bridge, which spans the frontier running along the Rhine river.
Asked if French police had been instructed to catch Chekatt dead or alive, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told CNews: ""It doesn't matter. The best thing would be to find him as quickly as possible.""
It took police four months to track down Salah Abdesalam, the prime surviving suspect from the November 2015 militant assault on Paris, in an apartment in Brussels. One hundred and thirty people were killed in that attack as well as seven gunmen and bombers.
RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM
The Christmas market, a hugely popular attraction in historic Strasbourg, remained closed on Thursday.
Witnesses told investigators that the suspect Chekatt cried out ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Greater) as he opened fire on the market, a target Paris Prosecutor Remy Heitz suggested may have been chosen for its religious symbolism.
Chekatt's police file photo shows a bearded man of North African descent, with a prayer bruise on the center of his forehead. He has 27 criminal convictions for theft and violence, and has spent time in French, German and Swiss jails. 
Neighbours on the housing estate where Chekatt family's lived described the suspect as a typical young man who dressed in jogging pants and trainers rather than traditional Islamic robes.
""He was a little gangster, but I didn't see any signs of him being radicalized,"" said a leader of a community group standing outside Chekkat’s apartment building, who asked not to be identified while discussing him.
The attack took place at a testing time for President Emmanuel Macron, who on Monday announced tax concessions to quell a month-long public revolt over living costs that spurred the worst unrest in central Paris since student riots in 1968.
Griveaux said a decision had yet to be taken on whether to ban another planned ""yellow vest"" protest in Paris. The last three consecutive Saturdays of riots in the capital have seen cars torched, shops looted and the Arc de Triomphe defaced.

""We're simply saying at this stage that, given the events that are unfolding after the terrorist attack in Strasbourg, it would be preferable if everyone could go about a Saturday before the festive holidays in a quiet way,"" Griveaux said.

Ukraine has said Russia captured the two small gunboats and one tugboat illegally and accused Moscow of military aggression. 
The United States and the European Union have called for the release of the sailors, who are in pretrial detention in Moscow. 
Roman Mokryak, the commander of one of the gunboats, told Russian investigators he would not provide any information until his crew was released, his lawyer, Ilya Novikov, said on Wednesday.
""He believes he alone answers for what happens on board, that his crew carried out his orders and that they cannot be held to account,"" Novikov wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Oleh Melnychuk, the captain of the tugboat, has also refused to testify, denying Moscow's accusations and calling himself a prisoner of war, his lawyer Edem Semedlyayev wrote in a separate Facebook post on Wednesday. 
No date has been set for the sailors' trial.
Ukraine has said it fears Russia is preparing to attack it, citing an alleged military build-up along its border. Russia denies this and says Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is trying to whip up anti-Russian sentiment as part of an election campaign.

OSLO (Reuters) - Whatever the outcome of Britain's tortuous divorce proceedings from Europe, there appears to be little help waiting in the wings from non-EU member Norway to join its own special relationship with the bloc.
Some Brexit supporters in Britain have touted a so-called ""Norway-plus"" scenario, whereby the world's fifth largest economy would emulate the Scandinavian country in finding its own tailored deal with the European Union. 
Their idea has not gained much domestic momentum. 
But even so, in Oslo, there would be low prospects of consensus for any potential U.K. bid to rejoin the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - between Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein Switzerland and the European Union - which it left in 1973.
Prime Minister Erna Solberg did tell Reuters that Oslo could lend a hand, but there would be little support from others in her governing coalition or the opposition Labour party, Norway's biggest party, on a major issue needing consensus.
Politicians say the nations' interests are too diverse - even though Britain is Norway's biggest trading partner - and they worry U.K. entry to EFTA could swamp other members. 
Currently the second largest EU economy, Britain has 66 million people, versus EFTA nations' combined 14 million.
""Norwegian interests are quite different from British interests,"" Anniken Huitfeldt, leader of parliament's foreign affairs and defense committee, told Reuters, citing fisheries and agriculture policies.
""I do not see the need to extend an invitation for Britain to join EFTA,"" said Huitfeldt, a Labour lawmaker.
FOOD DIFFERENCES
Norway imposes high tariffs on food to protect farmers in a nation that stretches into the Arctic, whereas Britain is a major food exporter.
Another concern is that London could veto future EFTA decisions, said Abid Raja, vice president of parliament of the centrist Liberal party that is part of Solberg's coalition.
""Norway must think of its own interests and what is best there is that Britain holds a new referendum and stays in the EU,"" he told Reuters.
Under its arrangements, Norway is currently part of the EU single market - which allows for free movement of goods, capital, services and people - but not the customs union.
With the Norwegian public largely disinterested in the issue, the only political support for Britain joining EFTA seems to be from two small parties, the Socialist Left and the Centre Party, which want to renegotiate Norway's entire relations with the EU. They think British membership of EFTA would give Oslo better bargaining power with Brussels. 
""Northern European countries would have a stronger negotiating position and could assess together what kind of relationship we would want to have with the EU,"" Torgeir Knag Fylkesnes, a Socialist Left lawmaker told Reuters. 
""We could ... have a better deal for democracy and Norwegian business.""

The Copts, who make up around 10 percent of the population, have long complained of discrimination. They have also frequently been attacked by Islamist militants who see them as infidels, prompting authorities to place armed guards outside churches and monasteries.
While Wednesday's killing appeared to be the result of a dispute between a construction worker and his son on one side and a police guard on the other, it angered local Copts still reeling from the death of seven members of their community in an Islamist militant gun attack in November.
Residents and security sources said the officer shot the pair, identified as Imad Kamal Sadeq, 49, and his 21-year-old son, David, late on Wednesday on a construction site near a church he was guarding.
They said the policeman was in custody being questioned while authorities reviewed CCTV footage from the church's security cameras.
Witnesses described angry exchanges between some 2,000 mourners and policemen guarding the funeral in Minya.
""One, two, where are the rights of the martyrs?"" the crowd chanted.
The head of the local diocese, Archbishop Macarius, who led the funeral prayers, demanded a response from authorities.

FREETOWN (Reuters) - Seven-year-old Carlos Kamara needs urgent surgery on a collapsed lung after he swallowed a toy whistle. Instead, all he can do is lie in pain in a half-empty hospital ward waiting to be seen. 
A doctors' strike in Sierra Leone has paralyzed an already threadbare health system in one of the world's poorest countries, leaving its biggest and busiest hospitals in disarray, the sick unattended. 
It represents a new low in Sierra Leone whose ranks of medical staff were hit by the Ebola outbreak of 2013-16 that killed 250 medical workers out of nearly 4,000 in total.
That came after a diamond-fueled, 11-year civil war that ended in 2002 and cost the lives of about 50,000 people.
Recovery has been hobbled by a steep drop in the price of one of Sierra Leone's biggest exports, iron ore, hampering investment in public health.
""Seeing my son like this, in so much pain . . . the government must resolve this quickly or soon there will be blood on everyone's hands,"" said Kamara's mother Khadija in a children's ward at Freetown's Connaught Hospital. 
A first attempt to remove the whistle on Dec. 3, the day before the strike began, was unsuccessful. Now he lies in bed, barely able to sit up and sip water, a tube running from his chest to a bag filled with bloody fluids. 
In ten days after that initial surgery, he has been seen twice, his mother said. 
The doctors in public hospitals are protesting against low wages and poor conditions which include a lack of the simplest medical aids, like oxygen.
""PEOPLE ARE DYING"" 
""It brings us no joy to do this,"" said Dr Sulaiman Lakkoh, a senior infection prevention specialist at Connaught who joined the strike last week. ""People are dying in our absence, but not as many as will die if the government continues to neglect hospital conditions.""
Representatives of Sierra Leone's Medical and Dental Association (SLMDA) said the strike could stretch into next week before agreement is reached with the health ministry. 
Health Minister Alpha Wuri declined to comment. 
Community health workers without formal medical training, as well as international medics working for charities who have come to help, are taking care of patients. 
Many people have chosen to stay away from hospital during the strike if possible, and most of Connaught's wards were empty. Yet dozens of patients meandered around the courtyard or slept on cardboard mats in halls, waiting to be assigned a bed. 
The country's only maternity hospital, the Princess Christian Maternity Hospital, is as busy as ever and in chaos, said aid sources on condition of anonymity.

Saidu Teteh Kamara, a middle-aged man unrelated to Carlos, has waited at Connaught for four days to be treated for jaundice, his eyes yellow and stomach swollen to the size of a beach ball. 
""The government must take this seriously or people will die who didn't have to,"" he said, talking slowly and gripping his stomach.

Activists long accused police in the East African country of using excessive force with little risk of being charged or convicted. A police oversight authority set up in 2011 ended virtual police impunity and fostered prosecutions for abuses. 
Former senior police officer Nahashon Mutua was found guilty of the murder of Martin Koome, who was found dead in a cell at a Nairobi police station where Mutua was in charge.
""I find the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and I believe the deceased died of injuries he sustained while in police cells,"" said High Court Judge Stella Mutuku, remanding Mutua in custody until sentencing next week.
""The former senior policeman misused his powers of authority and flouted the law so as to cover up the case,"" Mutuku said, dismissing the argument of Mutua's defense that Koome was fatally beaten by other inmates.
Kenya's Independent Police Oversight Authority watchdog led the investigation that brought charges against Mutua. ""This is a wake-up call to other police officers to perform their duties within the law..., IPOA spokesman Dennis Oketch said.
""The judgment is a big step towards holding errant police officers to account,"" anti-violence organization International Justice Mission said in a statement.
IPOA, established seven years ago after police killed hundreds of Kenyans during unrest that followed disputed elections in 2007, can investigate police on its own initiative or after receiving a complaint from the public.
It has the power to order any serving or retired officer to appear before it. IPOA submits the findings of its investigations to prosecutors, who decide whether to pursue a criminal trial or order an inquest.

CARACAS (Reuters) - As Venezuela's hyperinflation and chronic medicine shortages leave HIV patients with little hope of obtaining antiretroviral drugs, many are now relying on the leaves of a tropical tree known as the guasimo.
For each dose, patients use around 50 leaves from the tree, which is often used for lumber and is also known as the West Indian elm, and run them through a blender with water. They then strain and drink the green liquid. 
Doctors and patients alike have questioned the effectiveness of the remedy, which has for years been used in Venezuela and Brazil as a complement to pharmaceutical treatment. 
But HIV patients hoping to ward off AIDS increasingly see it as better than nothing.
""I have nothing to lose,"" said one HIV-positive man as he prepared and drank the beverage, asking not to be identified because his co-workers are unaware of his diagnosis.
For years he received antiretrovirals provided for free by the state, but supplies dried up as the country's socialist economic system unraveled. After five months of not taking medication, his doctor recommended the leaf concoction.
""My mind keeps telling me: I'm going to die, I got into this situation because the government doesn't provide medication,"" he said.
Dr. Carlos Perez began recommending the treatment at the start of 2018 when the shortage of antiretrovirals became acute. He tells patients to drink the guasimo leaf beverage twice a day for a month.
""It is a complementary treatment,"" said Perez, who is part of an organization called Solidarity Action that helps provide care for HIV patients. 
""(One) component of these leaves is tannin, a biochemical component that apparently has antiviral properties.""
The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the medicine shortages.
Antiretrovirals can generally only be purchased abroad, and a month of treatment costs at least $85, the equivalent of nearly a year of minimum wage. Annual inflation reached 1.3 million percent in November.
The Venezuela office of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS said in an email that Venezuela had 120,000 people who were HIV positive as of 2016, 61 percent of whom were taking antiretrovirals.
The agency said it relies on the government for the data, adding it does not have any more updated information.
Some doctors insist the only real solution for HIV patients is for the government to create functioning policies that ensure the availability of medication.
""The state has failed in its obligations to ensure access to healthcare,"" said Dr. Felix Oletta, a former health minister and member of a non-profit group called Defending Epidemiology.

He added that the leaf beverage ""does absolutely nothing, nor is it a treatment with any scientific backing.""

KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - The Maldives will do all in its power to keep ""our heads above water"", the head of its delegation at U.N. climate talks said on Thursday in an impassioned appeal for nations to overcome their divisions over how to tackle global warming.
The low-lying Maldives is among countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels and coral reef deterioration.
""We are not prepared to die. We are not going to become the first victims of the climate crisis. Instead, we are going to do everything in our power to keep our heads above water,"" Mohamed Nasheed told delegates at the talks in Katowice, Poland.
""Climate change is a national security issue for us. It is an existential threat,"" he said, adding that a rise in global temperatures could still be avoided but countries had to unite.
Nasheed was the Maldives' first democratically elected leader but was ousted in 2012 in a coup, imprisoned then granted asylum in Britain.
The Maldives' current president, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, invited Nasheed to head the country's negotiating delegation at the Katowice talks, which are aimed at agreeing rules for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.
With less than two days until the conference is formally scheduled to end, delegates are still grappling with many issues - not just how the accord will be implemented - including finance, strengthening emissions cuts and monitoring action.
A draft, more concise text of the deal should be available later on Thursday but it is expected to still be laden with brackets for wording to be decided on and gaps.
Since last addressing a U.N. climate conference in 2009, Nasheed said he had been deposed in a coup, imprisoned and then forced into exile.
""But almost 10 years since I was last at these climate negotiations, I must say, nothing much seems to have changed. We are still using the same old, dinosaur language,"" he said.

""Carbon emissions are rising, rising and rising and all we seem to be doing is talking, talking and talking.""

Lu Guang, a three-time World Press Photo award winner, had been invited to take part in photography events in the regional capital, Urumqi, in late October, his wife, Xu Xiaoli, said last month. 
She lost touch with her husband on Nov. 3 while he was traveling alone in the southern city of Kashgar and has not heard from him since, Xu said at the time.
Xu told Reuters by telephone from New York City, where she lives, that police in Xinjiang's southern city of Kashgar had informed the family of his arrest.
In a post on Twitter she added that the family had hired a lawyer but they have not received any written notice about the case.
Kashgar police did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.
Lu's prize-winning work has largely focused on sensitive environmental and social issues in China, including industrial pollution, drug addiction and people living with AIDS.
Beijing has faced an outcry from activists, academics, foreign governments and U.N. rights experts over mass detentions and strict surveillance of the ethnic Uighur minority and other Muslim groups in Xinjiang.

Chinese authorities routinely deny any ethnic or religious repression in Xinjiang and say its measures are needed to combat the influence of religious extremism.

Babis, the Czech Republic's second-richest person, has battled accusations from opponents since entering politics in 2011. His fight expanded to Brussels after new EU regulations that deal with conflict of interest took effect in August.
European Parliament members approved a resolution on Thursday that calls on the Commission to follow up on an EU legal document that said a conflict of interest existed.
This included a measure to suspend all EU funding to Agrofert - the conglomerate spanning food, agriculture, chemicals and media that Babis founded in the 1990s - until the conflict of interest has been fully investigated.
Babis denies having any conflicts of interest. He placed Agrofert, which gets tens of millions of euros a year in farming subsidies and development programs, into trust funds last year to meet Czech conflict of interest laws.
Critics, including Transparency International, say that was not enough, since Babis is still the main beneficiary of the trust funds.
On Thursday, Babis said political opponents have sought to move their political fight to the European Parliament.
""For me, this is a political affair. I am convinced it will be shown that I do not have any conflict of interest,"" he said on Czech Television before the vote.

""I proceeded according to Czech law. Now we are in communication with the European Commission.""

1293,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 07:46AM ET</span>","Up to 15,000 Syrian rebels ready to back Turkish operation in northeast","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Up to 15,000 Syrian rebels are ready to join a Turkish military offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeast Syria, but no date has been set for the operation, a spokesman for the main Turkish-backed Syrian rebel group said on Thursday.
President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that Turkey will launch the military operation in a few days, targeting a border region east of the Euphrates river which is held by the YPG Kurdish militia.
The announcement prompted a sharp rebuke from the Pentagon, which said any unilateral military action into northeast Syria would be unacceptable. 
The United States has been supporting the YPG in the fight against Islamic State insurgents since 2015. Following cross-border shelling from Turkey into Kurdish-controlled territory two months ago, U.S. forces have set up three military observation posts near the border.
Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist organization and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency against the state in southeastern Turkey for more than three decades.
Turkey has already swept YPG fighters from west of the Euphrates in military campaigns over the past two years, but has not gone east of the river - partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces.
But Erdogan's patience with Washington over Syria - specifically a deal to clear the YPG from the town of Manbij, just west of the Euphrates - seems to have worn thin.
The spokesman for the National Army, a Turkish-backed rebel force aimed at unifying disparate factions in northwest Syria, said on Thursday that there was no set date for the operation, which will start from both Syrian and Turkish territory.
""The battle will be launched simultaneously from several fronts,"" Major Youssef Hamoud told Reuters.
""It will be in Manbij and Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn,"" he said, referring to towns about 200 km (125 miles) apart near Syria's northern border.
Hamoud said the operation from Turkey may begin a few days before the move from within Syria.
In a speech on Wednesday, Erdogan said that Turkey's target ""is never U.S. soldiers"".
Commander Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that unilateral military action into northeast Syria by any party would be of grave concern, ""particularly as U.S. personnel may be present or in the vicinity.""

Hungary accuses Ukraine of trampling over the educational rights of its ethnic Hungarian minority. Budapest has threatened to retaliate by blocking Kiev's efforts to move closer to NATO and the European Union, clubs Hungary belongs to.
The U.S. ambassador in Budapest, David Cornstein, told a parliamentary committee that Hungary could do more to ""prioritize alliances"" at a time when he said Russia posed a renewed threat to Ukraine and to Europe.
""Now more than ever, Russia is testing the West,"" Cornstein said in a statement circulated by the embassy. 
""We feel strongly ... that as NATO allies the best way to promote reforms in Ukraine is by talking to Ukraine, not by blocking Ukrainian engagement with NATO.""
Earlier on Thursday, NATO head Jens Stoltenberg told Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that NATO would deliver secure communication equipment to Ukraine's military this month.
Cornstein said Hungary, which is heavily reliant on Russian oil, gas and nuclear expertise, was playing with fire by cosying up to President Vladimir Putin.
""We need to keep the big picture in mind,"" he said. ""Putin is not interested in national sovereignty. His vision is neoimperial. If Ukraine fails, Hungary will be on the front line of Russian aggression.""
Foreign Ministry State Secretary Levente Magyar told the parliamentary committee that the differences between the U.S. and Hungary were not strategic, and said he hoped dialogue would help rectify them, according to state news agency MTI.
Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has backed Western sanctions on Russia over its annexation of the Crimean peninsula and its backing for a pro-Russian separatist revolt in eastern Ukraine, but he has also criticized the measures.

The violence compounds an already dire security situation in the desert region used by jihadist groups to launch attacks in Mali and across West Africa. 
The identity of the assailants was unknown, but disputes between the nomadic Tuareg and herder Fulani ethnic groups have killed several hundred and displaced thousands this year. 
Menaka town mayor Nanout Kotia told Reuters 43 Tuareg died in a village 20 km (12 miles) away over the past two days. 
""Armed men riding motorbikes attacked several nomadic campsites in Tinabaw. They shot indiscriminately at the population,"" Kotia told Reuters, saying security forces had been sent to the area. 
Mali's main Tuareg separatist group, the Coordination of Azawad Movements, said 47 Tuareg civilians were killed in the Tinabaw area. Nobody has claimed responsibility.
Armed men killed 15 Fulani civilians in Mali's central Mopti region earlier this month. 
Mali has been in turmoil since Tuareg rebels and loosely allied Islamists took over its north in 2012, prompting French forces to intervene to push them back the following year. 
They have since regained a foothold in the north and center, tapping into ethnic rivalries to recruit new members.

South West will be the first of Somalia’s seven semi-autonomous regions to hold presidential elections in the coming months, a critical juncture in a growing power struggle between center and periphery in the aftermath of a long civil war.
""Candidate Sheikh Mukhtar (Robow) was just beaten and arrested by Ethiopian (peacekeeping) forces in Baidoa now,"" said Muawiya Mudeey, a spokesman for Robow.
""First he was called in by the interim president of South West state and when he reached that office, Ethiopian forces beat him terribly and they arrested him. And now there is fighting between residents and government forces in Baidoa.""
Regional officials in Baidoa, the state capital of South West, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Mohamed Aden, a local elder, said Ethiopian and local Somali security forces participated in Robow's arrest. ""We do not know the reason but we think it is because of politics,"" Aden told Reuters by telephone.
""There is no fighting now but tension is very high in Baidoa and anything can happen. I mean, war can start anytime.""
Robow, a former prominent al Shabaab insurgent and group spokesman, lay low for several years before publicly renouncing violence and recognizing the authority of the U.S.-backed federal government in August 2017. 
The Mogadishu government tried to bar his presidential candidacy in South West because of remaining U.S. sanctions against him. But the state electoral commission last month dismissed Mogadishu's demands and accepted his candidacy.
However, on Dec. 1 the commission postponed South West's vote for the third time, saying it was not sufficiently prepared amid lingering tensions with Mogadishu.
Somalia has been trying to claw its way out of the remnants of the civil war that engulfed it in 1991, when clan warlords overthrew a dictator and then turned on each other.

Al Shabaab has sought for more than a decade to topple the weak central government in Mogadishu and implement its strict version of Islamic law. It was driven out of the capital in 2011 but retains a strong presence in some areas including South West.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Koreans on Thursday fiercely debated a government plan to allow conscientious objectors to work in prisons instead of mandatory military duty in a country still technically at war with North Korea.
South Korea is one the few countries in the world that has compulsory conscription for all able-bodied men.
They must complete 18 to 22 months of duty as part of the South's military deterrent since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a formal peace treaty.
But there are growing challenges for military service as tensions have eased between the Koreas and the male birth rate falls in the South.
After a Constitutional Court ruling in June said conscientious objectors need an alternative to military service, the defense ministry explored allowing them to live and work in correctional facilities for three years.
Critics said the prison proposal was punitive, prompting the defense ministry to consider allowing objectors to work at fire stations and limit their service to 27 months. 
The ministry hosted a public hearing in the capital Seoul on Thursday where the crowd engaged a vigorous debate.
Kim Soo-jung, a lawyer who has defended several objectors, said a three-year work term in prison failed to take advantage of the varied talents of objectors. 
""There are doctors among the objectors and these people have all kinds of different capabilities,"" Kim said.
""Putting everyone in prison for a long time is not a win-win approach,"" she added.
A conservative activist shouted that Kim was not qualified to speak on the issue because she is a woman.
Lee Yong-seok, a peace activist who was jailed for three years for refusing military service, called for more options for objectors. Others at the meeting questioned the fairness of allowing them to avoid military duty.
One woman who has a son serving in the military drew applause and cheers when she asked why objectors should have options that were not available to regular draftees.

Lee Nam-woo, deputy defense minister for personnel, welfare, health and mobilization, said the ministry will make a decision after considering various public opinions.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian groups pushing for an increase in the minimum age for girls to marry, from 16, said on Thursday it was encouraged by a Constitutional Court order that legislators should work on a change.
Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, is among the top 10 countries in the world with the highest number of child brides, according to campaign group Girls Not Brides.
""We now have the legitimacy, that the decision of the Constitutional Court today strengthens and agrees with our reasoning,"" said Lia Anggie, a legal representative for the coalition of campaigners against child marriage.
The coalition had petitioned the court on the grounds that the law discriminated against girls, who can marry at 16, while the legal age for men is 19.
Indonesia's top court ruled that the government must change the minimum age at which a girl can get married. It did not specify an increase, and gave legislators three years to decide what the new minimum age should be.
Anggie told Reuters the court decision was ""a clear step"" in its push for ending child marriage.
While girls are legally allowed to get married at 16, it is common, particularly in rural areas for girls, to become brides at much younger ages. 
One in four girls marry before they turn 18 in Indonesia, according to the U.N. Children's Fund. On average, more than 3,500 Indonesian girls are married every day.
In its verdict, the court agreed that the marriage law discriminated against girls, a court spokesman said, adding that the law was also seen as out of line with rules on child protection.
The court had therefore found the law ""unconstitutional"", spokesman Fajar Laksono said.
The court gave legislators three years to come up with a change, and in their deliberations, they should ""take into consideration and see changing times"", Laksono told Reuters.
Erasmus Napitupulu, another legal representative of the group that filed the petition, which includes women who were child brides, said he welcomed the ruling but was disappointed the court ""was not brave enough"" to take a clear stand.
""Now the ball is in the hands of President Jokowi,"" he said, referring to President Joko Widodo by his nickname.
""We will continue to push until women in Indonesia get protection and guaranteed rights from the state.""

Britain's government asked the Supreme Court in April to rule on whether Brexit bills passed by the Scottish and Welsh parliaments were constitutionally sound, arguing that they would cause legal confusion.
The Supreme Court said on Thursday the whole of the Scottish Bill was not outside the devolved parliament's legislative competence but some sections were. 
Both sides claimed victory. 
Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, said the ruling was an important vindication of her government's approach to Brexit. 

But Britain's Scotland minister David Mundell said the ruling brought ""much-needed legal clarity that the Continuity Bill goes beyond the powers of the Scottish parliament.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli commandos killed two fugitive gunmen overnight in the occupied West Bank and Hamas claimed them as its members on Thursday, a measure of the Palestinian Islamist faction's resilience in areas controlled by its more moderate rival Fatah.
The first gunman was wanted for an attack near a Jewish settlement on Sunday that wounded seven people, including a pregnant woman who lost her baby, and the second for shooting dead two Israelis at a settlement industrial park on Oct 7.
West Bank violence has simmered since Palestinian statehood talks with Israel stalled in 2014. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas maintains security cooperation with Israel there, mindful of the grassroots appeal of Hamas since it seized Gaza from him in 2007.
""Resistance in the West Bank will never stop until the (Israeli) Occupation is removed from all our land and we regain all our rights,"" Hamas, which confirmed the slain gunmen had carried out the two attacks on its behalf, said in a statement.
Abbas's administration sought to shift focus to Israel's West Bank settlements, which most countries regard as illegal.
""The international community bears part of the responsibility for the aggression by the occupation and the settlers because of its silence toward these attacks,"" said Palestinian government spokesman Youssef Al-Mahmoud.
Asked whether they had cooperated on the overnight raids, Israeli and Palestinian security officials declined comment.
The diplomatic impasse between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abbas has deepened since the Palestinians boycotted the Trump administration over the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Separately on Thursday, a man stabbed and wounded two Israeli police troopers in East Jerusalem, another area where Palestinians seek statehood, and was shot dead, police said. His identity was not immediately clear. 
Israel and the United States have pressured Abbas's administration over stipends it pays relatives of Palestinians jailed or killed by Israeli forces. The allies say this money fuels militancy. 
""We will bring all terrorists and those who dispatch them to justice. Abu Mazen (Abbas), who finances the terrorists' families, must also pay the price,"" Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz said on Twitter. 
Avi Dichter, chairman of the Israeli parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, described Hamas operations as targeting both Israel and Abbas. 

""Hamas has an interest in carrying out terrorist attacks from the Gaza Strip, but even more so in carrying them out inside the West Bank,"" Dichter told Israel Radio.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 04:24AM ET</span>",China says second Canadian being probed for harming state security,"By Christian Shepherd and Michael Martina
BEIJING (Reuters) - Canadian businessman Michael Spavor, who worked with North Korea, is being investigated on suspicion of harming China's security, China said on Thursday, days after a former Canadian diplomat was detained in an escalating diplomatic row.
The state security bureau in the northeastern Chinese city of Dandong, which borders North Korea, has been investigating Spavor since Dec. 10, an official news site for the Liaoning province government said.
It gave no further details.
The announcement follows the detention in Beijing on Monday of former diplomat Michael Kovrig, who works for the International Crisis Group (ICG). 
State media in China has reported Kovrig is being investigated on the same charges.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked about Spavor's detention, said both he and Kovrig were suspected of harming national security, reiterating state media announcements.
""The legal rights and interests of these two Canadians have been safeguarded,"" Lu told a daily news briefing. ""These two cases are in the process of being investigated separately.""
The Canadian embassy has been notified of the detentions, he added, declining to provide further details of the investigations. 
Lu said he had not heard of any other cases of Canadians being investigated.
China has reacted angrily to Canada's arrest on Dec. 1 of Chinese executive Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], and Spavor's investigation is likely to escalate the diplomatic row.
Meng's arrest was made at Washington's request. She has been accused by U.S. prosecutors of misleading banks about transactions linked to Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating sanctions.
Officials say China had not tied Kovrig's detention to Meng's arrest, though Canadian diplomatic experts have said they have no doubt the two cases are linked.
Asked if Meng's release would see the two Canadians released, Lu reiterated that Meng's arrest was mistaken action and Canada should immediately let her go. 
He said authorities had taken measures ""according to the law"" in the Canadians' cases, and China welcomed foreign visitors, and they had nothing to fear so long as they obeyed the law.
Hu Xijin, editor of the state-backed Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid, said on the Weibo social media platform the Chinese government would never concede that the Canadians' detentions were related to Meng's case.
""But the use of a complete set of laws to prove the rationale for arrest is one and the same as what the U.S. and Canada did to Meng Wanzhou,"" he wrote.
Canada has been unable to contact Spavor since he notified the government that he was being questioned by Chinese authorities, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guillaume Bérubé said in statement issued in Canada.
Canadian officials were working hard to ascertain Spavor's whereabouts and would continue to raise the issue with the Chinese government, Bérubé said.
Phone calls, messages and emails to Spavor went unanswered.
NORTH KOREA LINKS
Friends of Spavor told Reuters he was due to fly out of Dalian, in Liaoning province, on a Korean Air flight to South Korea at 2:05 p.m. (0605 GMT) on Monday but had not arrived. 
Kovrig and Spavor were acquainted, according to people who know them, although there has been no official indication from China that their cases are linked or are related to North Korea.
Kovrig had carried out research on China's diplomatic ties to North Korea in his work on security issues for the ICG, a think-tank focusing on conflict resolution.
Spavor, who is based in Dandong, is the head of Paektu Cultural Exchange, a China- and UK-based non-profit social enterprise.
The group says on its website it is ""dedicated to facilitating sustainable cooperation, cross-cultural exchanges, activities, trade, and investment"" with North Korea.
It also says it maintains an ""array of contacts"" within North Korea and is ""nonpolitical"".
Spavor has acted as a translator and facilitator for former U.S. National Basketball Association star Dennis Rodman on trips to North Korea and shared Long Island Iced Teas with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on board one of his private boats after they went jet-skiing in 2013.
More recently, he has been trying to facilitate investment in North Korea in anticipation of sanctions being lifted, often hosting both North Korean officials and potential investors at his office in Dandong, as well as on trips inside North Korea, Spavor told Reuters in earlier interviews.
A U.S.-based friend of his told Reuters that Spavor was involved in a few projects in North Korea, including sporting exchanges and trying to broker investment, though given U.N. sanctions that was a challenge. 
""It was as far as I know pretty anodyne stuff,"" the friend said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""He is a very gregarious, affable guy and Korea watchers know him and like him. North Koreans seem to like him a lot too. I'm not sure what he could have done to get in this sort of situation.""
China's foreign ministry suggested on Wednesday that Kovrig might have broken laws on non-governmental organizations if he was conducting work in China for the ICG, which is not registered.

Reuters could not find a registration for Spavor's group on government databases for NGOs or social enterprises.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 04:23AM ET</span>",Number of journalists jailed for doing job near record high: report,"By Joseph Ax
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A near-record number of journalists around the world are behind bars for their work, including two Reuters reporters whose imprisonment in Myanmar has drawn international criticism, according to a report released on Thursday.
There were 251 journalists jailed for doing their jobs as of Dec. 1, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in an annual study. For the third consecutive year, more than half are in Turkey, China and Egypt, where authorities have accused reporters of anti-governmental activities.
""It looks like a trend now,"" the report's author, Elana Beiser, said in an interview. ""It looks like the new normal.""
The number of journalists imprisoned on charges of ""false news"" rose to 28, up from 21 last year and nine in 2016, according to the CPJ, a U.S.-based nonprofit that promotes press freedom.
The report criticized U.S. President Donald Trump for frequently characterizing negative media coverage as ""fake news,"" a phrase that is also used by leaders against their critics in countries like the Philippines and Turkey.
The study was published the same week that Time magazine named several journalists as its annual ""Person of the Year."" 
That group included Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were imprisoned one year ago on Wednesday, and Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two months ago.
Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were found guilty in September of violating Myanmar's Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison. They had been investigating the massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys amid an army crackdown that has driven hundreds of thousands of refugees into Bangladesh.
Lawyers for the two Reuters reporters have lodged an appeal against their conviction and sentence.
Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has said the jailing of the reporters had nothing to do with freedom of expression. In comments made the week after their conviction, she said they were sentenced for handling official secrets and ""were not jailed because they were journalists."" 
Turkey remains the world's worst offender against press freedom, the CPJ said, with at least 68 journalists imprisoned for anti-state charges. At least 25 journalists are in prison in Egypt.
Turkey has previously said its crackdown is justified because of an attempted coup to overthrow the government in 2016. Egypt has said its actions to limit dissent are directed at militants trying to undermine the state, which saw a popular uprising in 2011 topple the county's longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.
Asked about journalists being jailed, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said: ""Legal measures are not taken because of these suspects' or criminals' professions. This is unrelated.""
The overall number of jailed journalists is down 8 percent from last year's record high of 272, the CPJ said. 
The total does not take into account journalists who have disappeared or are being held by non-state actors. The CPJ said there are dozens of reporters missing or kidnapped in the Middle East and North Africa, including several held by Houthi rebels in Yemen.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led militia alliance that holds roughly one quarter of Syria east of the Euphrates, had advanced into the center of Hajin, an SDF spokesman said. ""The battles continue,"" Mustafa Bali said.
Backed by U.S.-led air strikes, the SDF has been attempting for several months to take Islamic State's last pocket of territory near the Iraqi border.
Colonel Sean Ryan, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, said: ""The SDF has progressed into (Hajin), and the advancement is going well"". But it was too early to say the entire city had been captured.
A video posted on FuratPost newsportal showed SDF fighters walking in the market place of the town near a mosque where damage was extensive. Gunfire was heard in the background.
A former resident, Abdullah Baker, who had been in touch with relatives who recently fled the city, said most of the remaining militants, who numbered in the hundreds, had fled to the nearby villages that are still under Islamic State control.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and former residents of the area have reported heavy civilian casualties in U.S.-led coalition air strikes during the campaign to capture Hajin and nearby areas.
The coalition says it takes great measures to identify Islamic State targets to avoid civilian casualties and that looks into the credibility of reports of civilian casualties.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Nine people were killed and nearly 50 injured in Turkey when a high speed train collided with a locomotive and crashed into a station platform and overpass in an Ankara suburb early on Thursday, officials said. 
Rescuers worked to free people trapped under the mangled wreckage at Marsandiz train station, 8 km (5 miles) from central Ankara. It was not clear at which speed the train and locomotive were traveling when the collision occurred. There was light snow on the tracks.
The train had been heading from Ankara to the central Turkish province of Konya and was not due to stop at Marsandiz. Ankara Governor Vasip Sahin said the locomotive, which lay battered 20 meters (22 yards) further ahead, carried out track inspections. 
Three train drivers were among the nine killed in the crash, Transport Minister Cahit Turhan told reporters on the scene.
There were 206 passengers on the high speed train, according to state-owned Anadolu news agency, which also reported that the Ankara state prosecutor's office had launched an investigation.

Turkey has been developing a network of high-speed rail links during Tayyip Erdogan's 16-year-old rule as it looks to ease the burden on increasingly congested highways.

The fortified jail of Sosa is located near the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya and include mainly militants of the hardline Islamist group who were captured during the fight against Islamic State which started in 2014.
Kurdish security officials launched manhunt operations after the break-out late on Wednesday and 15 of the 21 were recaptured, two security officials said. The whereabouts of the other six remains unknown.
Although Sosa jail is located in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq, the federal government has full control over the prison.
""Almost all of the convicted inmates who escaped are from Daesh,"" said one Kurdish security source. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
It was not clear how the inmates managed to escape the highly secured prison.
Islamic State, which once occupied a third of Iraq's territory, has been largely defeated in the country but still poses a threat along the border with Syria.
The group has resorted to guerrilla tactics since it abandoned its goal of holding territory and creating a self-sufficient caliphate that straddles Iraq and Syria.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union ""stands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided"" to Britain over the Irish ""backstop"" and their tentative divorce agreement, a draft seen by Reuters showed on Thursday. 
The draft, a six-point document the EU is preparing for British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday to help convince the divided UK parliament to approve their Brexit deal, said any such assurances would not ""change or contradict"" the agreement. 
The other 27 EU states are not yet in agreement on large parts of the draft text and diplomatic sources expected it to change considerably. The paragraph on the EU's readiness to provide more assurances to Britain was likely to change later in the day because of opposition from Ireland and others.
Several EU diplomatic sources said Britain was seeking to terminate the backstop after three years. 
There was no immediate confirmation from the British side but the draft EU text had no end-dates and only reiterated the bloc's long-standing line:
""The European Council underlines that the backstop does not represent a desirable outcome for the Union. The backstop is only intended as an insurance policy ... It is the Union's firm determination to work speedily on a subsequent agreement.""
Even if triggered, the backstop would ""apply only temporarily unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement,"" the draft said. 
The bloc also commits in the document to ""best endeavors"" to swiftly agree a new EU-UK deal even after the backstop is triggered ""so that it would only be in place for a short period and only as long as strictly necessary.""
May is going to Brussels on Thursday for a two-day summit of all the bloc's 28 national leaders that will be dominated by Brexit. 
After listening to May and asking her questions, the other 27 leaders will stay in the room and try to agree on what to offer her. 

Beyond the backstop, the draft currently reiterates that the EU wants to build ""as close as possible a partnership"" with Britain in the future, promises swift EU ratification of the tentative Brexit deal but also calls for preparations for a no-deal Brexit.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 03:28AM ET</span>",Detained in China: Canadian businessman known for ties to North Korean leader,"By Josh Smith and David Ljunggren
SEOUL/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Michael Spavor has jet skied with Kim Jong Un, felt the ground shake from a North Korean nuclear test, and now it appears, been detained by Chinese authorities.
Spavor, a business consultant with deep ties to North Korea, is being investigated on suspicion of endangering state security, Chinese state media reported. The Canadian government says it has been unable to contact him and phone calls, messages and emails to Spavor went unanswered on Thursday.
When North Korean leader Kim launched a bid to engage the world and attract international investment this year, Spavor was uniquely positioned to play a role.
As one of the few Westerners with personal ties to the North Korea government and Kim himself, Spavor has been trying to drum up international interest in investing in North Korean economic projects, in anticipation of sanctions being eased amid warming ties.
Spavor is best known in the region for his relationship with Kim Jong Un, and his role in facilitating a visit to Pyongyang by American basketball star Dennis Rodman in 2013.
""That was the most amazing experience I've had in my life .. We hung out for three days,"" Spavor told Reuters in a 2017 interview. 
Images from that time show Spavor sharing cocktails with Kim on board one of his private boats, after they had been jet-skiing in the bay next to Wonsan, one of Kim's pet economic development areas.
In 2015, Spavor was involved in efforts to attract more than $150 million in foreign funds for Wonsan, including $39 million to fund a new brewery.
SPECIAL ACCESS
The investigation into Spavor follows the detention in Beijing on Monday of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig, who Chinese state media report is being investigated on the same charges.
China has reacted angrily to Canada's arrest on Dec. 1 of Chinese executive Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], and Spavor's investigation is likely to further escalate the diplomatic row. 
Now based in the border city of Dandong in China, Spavor has been cultivating ties between potential Chinese investors and North Korean officials. 
Spavor's experience with North Korea dates to at least 2001. In 2005, he lived in Pyongyang for several months teaching at a school run by a Canadian non-governmental organization, according to the website for his organization, Paektu Cultural Exchange. 
Since then he's mastered the Korean language - with a distinctly North Korean accent - and maintained regular contact with many people in North Korea, including Kim Jong Un. 
Spavor's contacts in the isolated and tightly controlled nation have allowed him access when other outsiders were blocked. 
In February, North Korea barred most foreign media from covering a large military parade in downtown Pyongyang. Spavor was front and center in the parade area, streaming online video of tanks rolling by as North Koreans celebrated.
Gregarious and affable, Spavor is a fixture in the small community of North Korea watchers, with analysts and journalists often seeking his rare insight into the country.
Spavor keeps a number of photos of his meetings with Kim on his phone, and describes the North Korean leader as charismatic and smart.
But Spavor also is discrete about his contacts with the controversial regime, declining to comment on politics and noting that his work focuses on cultural and business ties.
""For me, encouraging these sports engagement events, these nonpolitical friendship interactions, promoting these kind of events can show people that Americans and Koreans can get along very well,"" he said in the 2017 interview. ""I guess if we can continue to increase these exchanges, then we hope that has an effect on politicians too.""
SANCTIONS
But North Korea's weapons programs in defiance of UN resolutions and dismal human rights reputation has always been a lingering presence.
In September 2017, Spavor was among those in the Chinese border city of Yanji who said they felt the jolt from North Korea’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test.
Spavor told Reuters at the time he was eating brunch when he felt the building shake for about five seconds, before the city's air raid sirens sounded.
Ahead of a major publicity push by North Korea around its foundation day events in early September, Spavor told Reuters he was taking dozens of Chinese investors and entrepreneurs into North Korea to ""attend matchmaking sessions with various government officials and stakeholders as well as visiting existing and future development zones"".
There have been some signs that enforcement of sanctions has eased amid diplomatic outreach, but Washington has said sanctions will remain in force until more progress is made toward denuclearizing North Korea.
When asked about the sanctions in September, Spavor said his clients ""are aware of the current sanctions and are waiting for potential investment projects and other business for when the Chinese government gives the green light on business as usual.""
In his latest posts on social media on Monday, Spavor said he was on his way to the South Korean capital of Seoul for new consulting work and meetings with friends.
His friends say he never arrived.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Families of some of the 189 people killed in a Lion Air plane crash plan a protest rally in Indonesia on Thursday, while stalled efforts to bring the main wreckage to the surface and find the second black box are set to resume next week.
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX jet crashed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29 shortly after take-off from Jakarta, but the families expressed concern that the remains of 64 passengers have yet to be identified, with just 30 percent of the plane's body found.
""The relatives hope that all members of our families who died in the accident can be found and their bodies buried in a proper way,"" a group that says it represents about 50 families said in a statement.
""We hope the search for the victims will use vessels with sophisticated technology,"" it added, ahead of the rally planned for outside the presidential palace in Jakarta. 
Lion Air is paying for a specialized ship to help lift the main wreckage of flight JT 610 and give investigators a better chance of finding the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) in a search that has lacked sophisticated equipment for the last month, Reuters reported.
Indonesia's national transport panel said the vessel was due to arrive on Monday.
The enhanced search will cost $2.8 million for the first 10 days, a source close to the airline said on Thursday, on condition of anonymity, adding that Lion Air is paying because the government does not have the budget.
A spokesman for Lion Air was unable to respond immediately to a request for comment. 
""Funds for the CVR search will be borne by Lion Air which has signed a contract for a ship from a Singaporean company,"" a finance ministry spokesman told Reuters. 
Lion Air's decision to foot the bill is a rare test of global norms regarding search independence, as such costs are typically paid by governments.
In this case, investigators said they had faced bureaucratic wrangling and funding problems before Lion Air stepped in.
Safety experts say it is unusual for one of the parties to help fund an investigation, required by U.N. rules to be independent, so as to ensure trust in any safety recommendations made.
There are also broader concerns about resources available for such investigations worldwide, coupled with the risk of agencies being ensnared in legal disputes.
The clock is ticking in the hunt for acoustic pings coming from the L3 Technologies Inc cockpit voice recorder fitted to the jet. It has a 90-day beacon, the manufacturer's online brochure shows. 

The flight data recorder was retrieved three days after the crash, providing insight into aircraft systems and crew inputs, although the cause has yet to be determined.

More than 72,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last year, including illicit drugs and prescription opioids. U.S. President Donald Trump declared the opioid addiction crisis a public health emergency. 
Fentanyl is the most lethal type of opioid used in the United States, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and gained notoriety after an overdose of the painkiller was deemed to have killed pop singer Prince in 2016. 
The drug is trafficked into the United States largely from China and Mexico but it is not currently possible to determine which country is a bigger supplier, the DEA said in a report in October.
Investigations led to the discovery of the lab in the northwest of Mexico City, the attorney general's office in the Mexican capital said in a statement.
Officers in white protective jumpsuits raided the site at night and found small blue pills and large plastic jugs containing dark liquid, images from the prosecutor's office showed.
Their finds also included chemical substances, machinery and supplies likely to be used to fabricate fentanyl, it said.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Militia leader's bravado shows limits of Libya reforms,"By Aidan Lewis and Ulf Laessing
TRIPOLI (Reuters) - For the United Nations, it was a chance to clip the wings of powerful armed groups who had held the levers of power in the Libyan capital for years.
The militia were on the back foot after suffering losses to rival factions in the latest convulsion of violence to shake Tripoli; the UN brokered a ceasefire in September, then encouraged the government to start replacing the militia with regular police.
Before they got far, Haithem Tajouri, a powerful militia leader who had left the country two months before, returned with a flourish.
The head of the Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade (TRB) toured the city center with his entourage, stopping their vehicles outside banks which unexpectedly extended their opening hours, allowing cash-starved residents to withdraw money.
""Do you want cash?"" Tajouri shouted to women queuing at one bank, an eyewitness said, declining to be named for security reasons.
Tripoli residents posted messages on social media saying Tajouri had arranged the extra access, causing more people to flock to the banks.
Last month, TRB forces patrolling central Tripoli showed Reuters the spot behind the central bank where they said they had driven black market money traders away several times over recent weeks, another crowd-pleasing move.
Tajouri may have acted partly to shore up his own position after his absence and the subsequent killings of commanders affiliated with him sparked speculation his forces were fragmenting.
But his actions also demonstrated the power accumulated by men whose armed followers dominate the city of three million, blocking efforts to end Libya's post-revolution turmoil.
Curbing the militias is crucial to plans, guided by the United Nations, to stabilize the oil-rich North African state nearly eight years after an uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, backed by NATO, splintered the country.
Their presence has also complicated plans for elections, initially planned for Dec. 10 and now postponed to next year.
Fighting broke out in August when some militias based outside Tripoli attacked the TRB and three other large groups with strongholds in the capital, angered by their dominance over public money and state contracts.
Since September a ceasefire has been largely observed, with the United Nations and the weak Government of National Accord (GNA) trying to secure a lasting truce.
As part of this, authorities say militias have begun a gradual retreat from strategic sites in Tripoli including banks and ministries. A new interior minister, Fathi Bashagha, has made high-level changes.
The militias are supposed eventually to be integrated into security forces or demobilized, as police take control of two inner rings in Tripoli and military units secure the outskirts, according to three people briefed on the arrangements.
  REAL CHANGE?
Western countries had previously tried building up an army and police, but largely gave up when the country split between rival governments in 2014. 
Under a U.N. deal that bought a new government to Tripoli in 2016, a handful of armed groups entrenched their power, hampering efforts to reunite rival governments and factions in Tripoli and the east. 
Some analysts and diplomats say the current U.N.-backed security plan has more chance of succeeding than in the past, arguing that militia leaders are seeking to protect their earnings from a new threat, sanctions.
This year the U.N. Security Council and the U.S. Treasury have issued asset freezes and travel bans against six alleged migrant smugglers, a former oil port blockader and, last month, Salah Badi, a militia leader from the military and business stronghold of Misrata.
But the depth of militia influence meant it was unclear if the GNA had the will to enact change, or could find recruits for a professional force and employment for those who demobilize, a Western diplomat said.
""A lot of militia leaders are suing for peace because they want to keep their ill-gotten gains,"" he said. ""The problem is that there are no jobs (for their followers).""
Some residents see the new arrangements as largely cosmetic, with guards changing uniforms while staying loyal to militia commanders.
U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame told Reuters in a statement that ""key appointments have been made and brave decisions have been taken"" since the ceasefire.
But, he added, ""like most Libyans, we feel frustrated with the GNA for their very slow implementation of the arrangements"". 
For now, key armed group leaders remain in the foreground.
Tajouri, known for his fashion sense and white G Class Mercedes, was widely seen as more powerful than the prime minister before his absence during recent fighting raised questions over his standing.
His return from the Gulf in a private jet, dressed in blue Emirati robes, triggered speculation that he was aligning himself with the United Arab Emirates, one of the major external players in Libya's conflict.
A report by a U.N. panel of experts last year documented what it said was UAE support for Khalifa Haftar, a veteran commander who controls eastern Libya and has long pledged to ""liberate"" Tripoli by forging alliances in the west. The panel said its requests for information from the UAE had received no response.
Reuters asked the UAE's foreign ministry and media council whether the country supported Haftar and Tajouri and saw an alliance between them as a way to stabilize Libya: officials were not immediately available for comment.
Rada, another major group with a base at Tripoli's only functioning airport, is led by Salafist Abdulraouf Kara, who has links to a network of brigades beyond the capital aligned with the ultraconservative religious ideology.
Tajouri and Kara, neither of whom agreed to an interview, hold high-value prisoners including ex-Gaddafi figures. Their fortunes have roused the envy of groups outside Tripoli.
Some come from Misrata, home to a mix of moderates and radical groups; the latter have been trying to regain lost influence in Tripoli.
Badi, under U.S. and U.N. sanctions for his Al Somoud brigade's attacks on Tripoli, said the international community had helped install militias that mixed the ""tyranny"" of the Gaddafi era with Salafist ideology from Saudi Arabia.
Kara and other ""quietist"" Salafists, including some who have fought for Haftar, tend to respect the authority in power. By contrast, Badi and other Islamist-leaning figures cast themselves as militant defenders of the revolution.
""Their (armed group) leaders protected the government and now control it. They rob the government,"" Badi told Reuters.
Misrata moderates view Badi as a marginalized figure discredited by the assaults on Tripoli. But experts say officials need to engage with a wide range of actors. 
""If there is not sufficient outreach to armed groups outside Tripoli to get their buy-in, the new security arrangements risk exacerbating existing tensions,"" said Juan Garrigues of DAG, an independent group that works on dialogue in western Libya.
 
ELECTIONS
With elections pushed back, the international community is pinning its hopes on a national conference planned by the U.N. for early 2019 that would hash out the basis of a settlement.
Until then ""the danger is that you're merely shifting the deckchairs on the Titanic"", as the underlying situation for most Libyans continues to deteriorate, said the diplomatic source.
Despite plans for an audit of central bank spending, there was still a ""total lack of transparency"" in the way rising oil revenues are spent, he said.
Militias have penetrated financial institutions, analysts say.
Libya's sovereign wealth fund was forced to recruit staff from Nawasi, one of the main Tripoli groups, and a TRB faction tried to gain influence over the state oil firm NOC, according to a report by the U.N. panel of experts on Libya.
Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeg told Reuters this trend would be reversed as a currency devaluation and increased access to foreign currency deprive militias of key sources of revenue – extortion rackets at banks they control and privileged access to dollars resold at huge profits on the black market.
There was more communication with the armed groups, he said.

""We see some improvement, but not as much as expected ... that's why from time to time we see some pressure on Tripoli -- that militia will not hand over very easily.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - A prominent church pastor in southwest China is being held by authorities on suspicion of inciting subversion, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday, amid a campaign by Beijing to clamp down on religion unapproved by the state.
On Sunday night in the city of Chengdu, police and state security officials detained dozens of churchgoers and leaders from the Early Rain Covenant Church, one of the better-known unregistered Protestant 'house' churches in China.
Head pastor Wang Yi was detained and held on suspicion of ""inciting subversion of state power"", HRW said in a statement, citing an official document sent to Wang's mother. 
The authorities have also searched homes, offices, a seminary, a kindergarten and a bible college related to the church, HRW said. Reuters confirmed the group's account with activists and churchgoers who had spoken with Wang's mother.
China's constitution guarantees religious freedom, but since President Xi Jinping took office six years ago, the government has tightened restrictions on religions seen as a challenge to the authority of the ruling Communist Party.
""The shutdown of a Protestant church in Chengdu epitomizes the Xi Jinping government's relentless assault on religious freedom in China,"" Yaqiu Wang, an HRW researcher, said in a statement. 
""It makes a mockery of the government’s claim that it respects religious beliefs.""
China's Public Security Ministry did not respond to faxed requests for comment. A Chengdu government official declined to comment when reached by Reuters by phone.
Chinese law requires that all places of worship register and submit to government oversight, but some churches have declined to register, for various reasons.
Late on Tuesday, members of the congregation published a statement from Wang that he had given to them for release in the event that he was held for over 48 hours.
""I am filled with anger and disgust at the persecution of the church by this Communist regime, at the wickedness of their depriving people of the freedoms of religion and of conscience,"" Wang wrote, according to the statement.
Wang also wrote that he did not consider it his mission to change the institutions that ruled China: ""I accept and respect the fact that this Communist regime has been allowed by God to rule temporarily.""
""Regardless of what crime the government charges me with, whatever filth they fling at me... I categorically deny it,"" he wrote.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>",In fear of the state: Bangladeshi journalists self-censor as election approaches,"By Ruma Paul, Serajul Quadir and Zeba Siddiqui
DHAKA (Reuters) - With less than a month to go to a general election, many journalists in Bangladesh say they are living in fear of ever-tightening media laws and engaging in self-censorship as a result.
While Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's administration has won plaudits globally for welcoming hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in Myanmar, critics have lashed out at it for cracking down on free speech and an increasingly authoritarian rule. 
In interviews Reuters conducted with 32 journalists and editors across print, digital and broadcast media in Bangladesh, the vast majority said the recent strengthening of defamation laws with a new Digital Security Act (DSA) has spread a climate of fear in the industry. 
Dozens of journalists were arrested for defamation under the earlier law, the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act. 
The DSA goes further - penalizing obtaining papers, information, or pictures from government offices without official consent, said Asif Nazrul, a professor of Law at the University of Dhaka. ""It would make investigative journalism on corruption, human rights abuses and bad governance very tough, if not impossible,"" he said.
Another piece of legislation, the Broadcast Act 2018, was proposed in October to regulate broadcast news portals. 
Both laws restrict bail and allow arrests without a warrant.
The government has denied accusations it’s trying to curb press freedom and Hasina assured a press briefing in October that ""journalists who do not publish false news need not worry"" about the DSA.
Journalists, however, question the timing of the laws and have staged protests in recent weeks in the capital Dhaka, particularly against the DSA, which they say will thwart their ability to report independently, especially on the upcoming election. 
Critics of Hasina, who is seeking a third straight term in power, say the Dec. 30 election will be a litmus test for the strength of democracy in Bangladesh. The last election in 2014 was boycotted by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) as unfair and shunned by international observers, with more than half the seats uncontested. 
Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, editor-in-chief of Manab Zamin, a popular Bengali-language daily, said self-censorship was becoming common.
""As an editor, I feel sad when I kill a report that was the outcome of several days of exhaustive work by a reporter. But I take the decision purely to save the reporter, because I know the risks involved in publishing it,"" he said. ""I fight every moment with myself and with my shadow.""
""DISTORTING THE TRUTH""
H. T. Imam, a member of the ruling Awami League and Hasina's political adviser, said journalists need not fear doing their jobs, and ""can write on whatever is happening on the ground."" 
""But they should restrain themselves from distorting the truth – that is very important,"" he told Reuters. ""You should not equate liberty with license.""
The government also says new licenses to operate have been issued to several media organizations under Hasina's rule, indicating its support of an independent press.
But while Bangladesh has a bevy of news outlets, many journalists say they can't write as freely as they once did. The case of The Daily Star, the country’s most widely-circulated English newspaper, stands out:
""I used to write a column regularly and fearlessly. Now, I seldom do,"" said Mahfuz Anam, who has been the editor of The Daily Star for 25 years. 
Anam was charged with defamation and treason in more than 80 cases filed by Awami League workers in 2016, with damages sought exceeding $8 billion. They were filed in various lower courts across Bangladesh, forcing him to run around the country seeking bail, and he's had to obtain periodic stays on them ever since.
Anam says his paper is barred from covering the prime minister's events, and advertisers have privately told him that officials have pressured them to stop advertising in his paper.
Two officials at two of Bangladesh's biggest telecom operators said the government had instructed them in 2015 to stop advertising in The Daily Star. They declined to be named for fear of reprisals. 
""We never interfere or influence any private organization as it is completely their wish and right,"" Information Minister Hasanul Haq told Reuters, referring to the advertisers. He said decisions on who should be allowed to attend the prime minister's events were taken by Hasina's security department. 
VAGUELY-WORDED LAWS
Government assurances that the laws won't be used against them have failed to assuage concerns of many journalists, who point to past arrests.
While the police says it doesn't maintain figures on detained journalists, global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders says at least 25 journalists and several hundred bloggers and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users were prosecuted under the ICT Act in 2017 alone.
The new DSA has ""vaguely-worded provisions that would allow authorities to clamp down even more on dissent,"" the group said.
Under the proposed broadcast law, media outlets publishing or broadcasting anything deemed to be ""false"" or against national interest could be fined, lose licenses or see their staff jailed. 
It's unclear how the election results might impact media freedoms. The BNP says it would strike down the DSA if it wins, but it cracked down on media organizations seen as unfriendly when it was in power more than a decade ago. 
Bangladesh now ranks 148th out of 180 countries on the press freedom index compiled by Reporters Without Borders, sliding from 121 in 2009 when Hasina came to power. Haq, the information minister, said the ranking was not fair as it reflected views of only private organizations. ""It could be standard if it reflected both government and private views.""
Many journalists say there is a growing and conspicuous silence on public criticism of the government, especially online. 
Those who speak out have faced action: On July 13, a day after Hasina told parliament it was impossible to accede to some student demands, Maidul Islam, a university professor, posted two words on Facebook ""Hasi Na."" In the Bengali language, the words mean ""Not Laughing."" 

Days later, an activist backing the Awami League filed a complaint against Islam under the ICT Act, accusing him of defaming the prime minister. Islam was arrested and jailed for more than a month before he got bail, and if he loses the case he faces up to 14 years in prison.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>",Trump intervention comment may be gift to Huawei CFO,"By Julie Gordon, Sijia Jiang and Anna Mehler Paperny
VANCOUVER/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, released on bail on Tuesday to await a ruling on U.S. extradition at one of her luxury Vancouver homes, may have received welcome ammunition in court from an unlikely source - President Donald Trump.
As the hearing was winding up in a Canadian court, Trump told Reuters he would intervene in the U.S. Justice Department's case against Meng if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.
Legal experts and Canadian officials said the comments could allow Meng's lawyers to contend her prosecution is politically motivated, an argument that would resonate in Canada where judges are particularly wary of abuse of the court system.
""He has handed her lawyers an opportunity to argue that the prosecution has been politicized and the extradition proceedings should end,"" said Robert Currie, a professor of international law at Dalhousie University in Halifax. A Canadian official agreed that the comments could be raised.
Currie also said, however: ""It's not a sure thing.""
U.S. prosecutors accuse Meng, the chief financial officer and daughter of the founder of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], of misleading multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. Meng says she is innocent.
If a Canadian judge rules the case is strong enough, Canada's justice minister must next decide whether to extradite Meng to the United States. If so, Meng would face U.S. charges of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, with a maximum sentence of 30 years for each charge.
The Justice Department bristled at Trump's remarks, which referred to current efforts by China and the United States to negotiate a deal to resolve their trade war.
Asked about the comments at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Assistant Attorney General John Demers said his department was not ""a tool of trade."" 
""What we do at the Justice Department is law enforcement. We don't do trade,"" said Demers, the department's top national security official. 
Meng's lawyer was not reachable for comment on Wednesday. The White House did not reply immediately to a request for comment.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the legal process should not be hijacked for political purposes and that Meng's lawyers would have the option of raising Trump's remarks if they decided to fight extradition.
""Our extradition partners should not seek to politicize the extradition process or use it for ends other than the pursuit of justice and following the rule of law,"" she said. 
BARGAINING CHIP
Meng is one of her country's most powerful businesswomen and her father, Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, is a former People's Liberation Army engineer.
The company, which builds everything from networks to handsets, is China's largest technology company by employees, with more than 180,000 staff and revenue of $93 billion in 2017.
Bennett Gershman, a professor at Pace Law School in New York, said it was hard to see how national security or foreign policy could justify a possible intervention by Trump in the Huawei case.
""It seems like Trump is using this case as a bargaining chip in our trade deals and for financial gains,"" Gershman said.
There is precedent for White House involvement in criminal cases for foreign policy reasons. The Obama administration in 2016 dismissed charges against a man based on ""significant foreign policy interests"" related to Iran's nuclear program and agreed on a prisoner swap with Iran. 
Earlier this year, Trump revisited penalties against Chinese company ZTE Corp (HK:0763) for violating trade sanctions with Iran, saying the telecom maker is a big buyer for U.S. suppliers.
The case against Meng stems from a 2013 Reuters report that Huawei had close ties to a Hong Kong-based firm that attempted to sell U.S. equipment to Iran despite U.S. and European Union bans. 
ANKLE MONITOR, MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR HOMES
No matter what the politics, one thing seems clear - Meng will be staying in Vancouver for a long time. It can take up to 12 years to exhaust all legal avenues in the Canadian extradition process. 
Meng appeared to be settling into one of the two multimillion-dollar properties she owns in the city, a likely relief after spending 10 days in a women’s prison that a former inmate described as spartan, with little privacy.
""I am in Vancouver, got back with my family,"" Meng posted on her account on Chinese instant messaging platform WeChat after her release. ""Thanks to everyone for your concern.""
Fitted with an ankle monitor and hampered by severe restrictions on her movements, the executive faces a dramatic comedown from the jet-set lifestyle described in court documents.
Meng's seven passports issued by China and Hong Kong held stamps showing travels around the world including to the United States, Mauritius, South Africa, Madagascar, Ghana, Mali and Myanmar, court documents showed.
She became a Canadian permanent resident in 2001, but her status expired in 2009, according to the court hearing. 
U.S. prosecutors believe she stopped traveling to the United States after Huawei learned of the criminal investigation being pursued by the Justice Department in April 2017.
Her lawyers told the court that she will spend Christmas with her husband, Liu Xiaozong, 43, her daughter and one of her sons. Liu identified himself in court documents as a venture capitalist and Meng's lawyer said he previously worked for Huawei in Mexico.
The couple married in Hong Kong in 2007 and have the one daughter together, said Liu, in addition to Meng's three sons from previous marriages, aged between 14 and 20. One is enrolled at Eaglebrook school in Massachusetts in the seventh grade, according to a Dec. 6 character reference from its headmaster.

""I have been working hard for 25 years and ... my only simple goal would be to be with my husband and daughter,"" Meng's lawyer quoted her as saying on Tuesday. ""I haven’t read a novel in years.""

Foreign ministry spokesman Guillaume Bérubé said in a statement issued in Canada late on Wednesday the missing Canadian was Spavor, a businessman who is based in the northern Chinese city of Dandong and who runs cultural exchanges with North Korea.
Canada was working hard to ascertain Spavor's whereabouts and would continue to raise the issue with the Chinese government, Bérubé said.

The two leaders discussed the possibility of creating a joint program for development and job creation in Central America and Mexico, Lopez Obrador said.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Thousands of migrants are living in crowded shelters and encampments in Tijuana after traveling from Central America to escape poverty and violence. They may have to wait weeks or months to claim asylum at the U.S. border.
Illegal immigration was a central theme of Trump's presidential bid, and he repeatedly invoked the issue ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm elections and deployed some 5,800 U.S. troops to the border.
Trump has reiterated his campaign promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, even after Mexico repeatedly rejected his demand that it pay for the multibillion-dollar project.
Funding for the border wall has been a sticking point in spending bills before the U.S. Congress, and Trump clashed with leading Democrats over the issue during an Oval Office meeting on Tuesday.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to discourage migration through economic development, and wants the United States to contribute to a plan focused on Mexico's poorer south and Central America. 

Shortly after Lopez Obrador took office on Dec. 1, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard to discuss border issues.

The pair, both employed as subcontractors at the NSF-managed McMurdo Station in Antarctica, were found unconscious on the floor of the building after a helicopter pilot flying over the area saw what appeared to be smoke coming from the structure and landed to investigate.
One of the technicians was pronounced dead by medical personnel called to the scene. The other was pronounced dead a short time after being flown to the McMurdo medical clinic, the NSF said in a statement.
The two workers, described as fire technicians, were performing preventive maintenance on the building's fire-suppression system before they were found, the agency said.
No further details were immediately provided, and the incident was under investigation, the foundation said. 
The NSF said it was not releasing any personal information about the two workers, except to say they were employed by a Virginia-based company, PAE, which in turn was hired by the U.S. Antarctica Program's logistics contractor Leidos, headquartered in Colorado.
The research station, established by the United States in 1955, is situated near Antarctica's McMurdo Sound, named for a British naval officer who was part of the expedition that first charted the area in 1841.
The largest outpost in Antarctica, it lies at the tip of Ross Island in the New Zealand-claimed territory known as the Ross Dependency. The incident in question occurred on Dec. 12 local time, which goes by New Zealand time.

Daytime highs in December, in the middle of the Antarctic summer, average 31.5 degrees Fahrenheit or minus 3 degrees Celsius. More than 1,000 people, including scientists and support personnel, work at the station this time of year.

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 07:59PM ET</span>","Defying Trump, U.S. Senate advances measure to end support for Saudis in Yemen","By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a rare break with President Donald Trump, the Senate voted on Wednesday to move ahead with a resolution to end U.S. military support for the Saudi Arabian-led coalition in the war in Yemen and lawmakers vowed to push for sanctions against the kingdom in the new year.
Eleven of Trump's fellow Republicans joined Democrats to provide the 60 votes needed to advance the war powers resolution in the Republican-led chamber. The vote paved the way for debate and a vote on U.S. involvement in a conflict that has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians, many of them young children and left millions more at risk of starvation and death by disease. 
The nearly unprecedented break the 11 Republicans made from Trump was largely symbolic because the House of Representatives is not expected to take the matter up this year. Trump has threatened a veto. 
But backers of the resolution said it sent an important message that lawmakers are unhappy with the humanitarian disaster in Yemen, and angry about the lack of a strong U.S. response to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers also vowed to keep pushing after the new Congress take office in January for further tough action against Saudi Arabia, including legislation to impose human rights sanctions and opposition to weapons sales.
""If you want to buy our weapons, there are certain things you have to accept. How you use them matters,"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told a news conference.
""The individual, the crown prince, is so toxic, so tainted, so flawed, that I can't ever see myself doing business with Saudi Arabia unless there's a change there,"" said Graham, generally a close Trump ally in the Senate.
Republicans will hold a slightly larger majority in the new Senate, but Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives, increasing the chances of sanctions legislation passing.
The Trump administration had urged Congress not to oppose U.S. fueling, targeting help and other support for the Saudi-led coalition as it battles the Houthis, Shi'ite Muslim fighters viewed by Yemen's neighbors as agents of Iran.
Earlier on Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the administration's handling of Khashoggi's killing.
Pompeo repeated his assertion there was no direct evidence linking Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the Oct. 2 killing of Khashoggi in Istanbul, despite a CIA assessment it was likely he ordered the killing.
Riyadh initially denied knowledge of Khashoggi’s disappearance, then offered contradictory explanations, including that he was killed in a rogue operation.
TRUMP STANDS BY CROWN PRINCE
Trump condemned the murder but has stood by the Saudi crown prince. ""He's the leader of Saudi Arabia. They've been a very good ally,"" Trump told Reuters on Tuesday in an Oval Office interview.
Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel briefed leaders of the House of Representatives behind closed doors about the killing. After the classified meeting, House members said they had not heard anything to change their minds about Khashoggi's death.
Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, likely the next chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee when Democrats take control of the House in January, said he intended to hold hearings starting early next year on all aspects of Saudi behavior and the U.S.-Saudi relationship.
""Saudi Arabia's an important ... partner, but I don't think we can simply look the other way when things happen and talk about business as usual,"" Engel said.
Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who held a separate briefing for the entire Senate, are due to discuss Saudi Arabia with the entire House on Thursday.
But several lawmakers have urged that Congress keep the Yemen conflict separate from anger over the killing of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist.
They view Saudi Arabia as an essential counterweight in the Middle East to Iran, arch-enemy of close U.S. ally Israel. White House officials see Saudi support as a linchpin for an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan yet to be unveiled by the Trump administration.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Wednesday in Jerusalem that Saudi Arabia's role in the Middle East must be taken into account in responding to Khashoggi's ""horrific"" fate.
""If Saudi Arabia were to be destabilized, the world would be destabilized,"" Netanyahu told foreign reporters, speaking in English.

By agreeing to limit senior leaders to three, two-year terms, which would apply retroactively, Pelosi hopes to mollify a small group of Democrats who had opposed her bid for the top job in the House and wanted a new generation of leaders.
""For some time, there have been a number of conversations to advance a proposal to institute term limits for senior leadership positions in our caucus,"" Pelosi said in a statement announcing her support for the plan.
After Pelosi's announcement, a group of seven House Democrats who had not previously pledged their support said they would back her when the full House votes on Jan. 3.
Pelosi, 78, made history as the first woman speaker, holding the top spot from 2007 to 2011.
Democrats won back a majority in the House in Nov. 6 elections. Pelosi captured the Democratic nomination for speaker in a 203-32 vote of House Democrats two weeks ago. Steny Hoyer, 79, is in line to become the Democratic majority leader, and James Clyburn, 78, to hold the No. 3 post of majority whip.
Under the term limits proposal, senior leaders could serve three, two-year terms, with an additional term possible if they receive two-thirds support of the Democratic caucus. But the two terms when the Democrats controlled the House from 2007 to 2011 would count toward the total, limiting Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn to four years at most in their leadership positions.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 07:36PM ET</span>",Ex-Venezuela oil minister Martinez dies in state custody,"(Reuters) - Former Venezuela oil minister Nelson Martinez, who was arrested in 2017 as part of a sweeping graft probe at state oil company PDVSA, has died in state custody, the prosecutor's office said on Wednesday. 
Martinez, a chemist who also ran PDVSA and its U.S. subsidiary Citgo Petroleum, had been transferred to a military hospital from prison because of kidney problems, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier. He had a heart attack while receiving dialysis, they said.
In a statement, the prosecutor's office said Martinez had a ""serious chronic disease"" that led to his death and offered condolences to his family.
Martinez was jailed after the country's top prosecutor said he allowed a poor refinancing deal for Citgo to go ahead without government approval. He was arrested alongside Eulogio del Pino, another former oil minister and PDVSA president, who remains jailed.
Martinez's death will likely fuel debate over the conditions of imprisoned former politicians and government officials, who in recent years have increasingly included former top leaders whom President Nicolas Maduro has accused of wrongdoing. 
The death two months ago of a municipal legislator, Fernando Alban, sparked a nationwide scandal, with the government saying he committed suicide and opposition leaders insisting he was murdered in prison.
""The death of Nelson Martinez is the responsibility of Nicolas Maduro, who...held him hostage for a year knowing he was ill,"" Rafael Ramirez, a fugitive oil minister and PDVSA president under late President Hugo Chavez who is wanted on corruption charges, wrote on Twitter. 
The prosecutor's office said Martinez was given adequate care.
""Until the last moment, the citizen in question received treatment and the required medical attention,"" the prosecutor's office said in its statement.
The opposition to Maduro's socialist government, which has overseen a collapse of the OPEC nation's economy, dismisses the probe as an internal power struggle within Maduro's inner circle, noting that the industry has been under tight control of the ruling Socialist Party since early in Chavez's 14-year rule.
Martinez had yet to appear before a judge at the time of his death, and the date for his preliminary hearing was pushed back several times, two of the people said. His lawyers began asking authorities months ago for Martinez to be granted house arrest, citing his ill health, one of the people said.
Martinez started having health problems while leading Citgo, based in Houston. Maduro named him oil minister in January 2017, and he assumed the dual role of PDVSA president later that year, replacing del Pino.
He had joined PDVSA in 1980 and oversaw the company's offices in London, Argentina and Ecuador before being tapped to lead Citgo.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Prosecutors have requested the arrest of a self-proclaimed faith healer known as ""John of God"" following accusations by over 200 women that he abused them sexually while they were seeking spiritual guidance and treatment.
A law enforcement source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that an arrest warrant was sought from a court in Abadiania, a small town in central Brazil where João Teixeira de Faria, which is his real name, has his spiritual center. 
Since the first accusation was aired on television on Friday, 258 women - some of them foreigners - have come forward accusing Faria of abuses, according to the prosecutors office for the state of Goias where Abadiania is located.
Faria, who became internationally famous when TV host Oprah Winfrey broadcast a report on his psychic healing methods in 2013, maintained on Wednesday that he is innocent, in his first comments since the scandal began. He denied the accusations and said he would comply with the law.
The women's accusations range from fondling their bodies to intercourse and making them practice oral sex on him while he allegedly said he was possessed by a spiritual entity, according to victims interviewed by local media.
The healer's fame has been boosted by supposedly miraculous surgeries he claims to have performed with his hands and without anesthesia.
Winfrey said in a statement that she visited Faria's center in 2012 to explore his controversial healing methods for an episode of 'Oprah's Next Chapter' that aired the following year, she said.
""I empathize with the women now coming forward and hope justice is served,"" she said.
The scandal has shocked the town of Abadiania, whose economy has become dependent on the tourism brought by Faria's healing center, which opened in 1976. Thousands of Brazilians and foreigners flocked there but the industry has now come to a halt.
Some followers of Faria have rejected the accusations and harassed reporters who descended on the town on Wednesday for the first public appearance of the healer since the scandal broke, receiving him with loud cheers and applause.
""Brothers and my dear sisters, I thank God for being here. I want to comply with Brazilian law. I am in the hands of the law,"" he told them in a brief appearance. ""John of God is still alive,"" he said.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz party pushed the law through the legislature earlier in the day, using its big majority as opposition parties sought to block the vote.
Protesters shouting ""Traitors, traitors"" and ""Orban go to hell"" faced off against hundreds of police who stood on the steps of the parliament building. 
A Reuters photographer said the crowd then moved toward a side gate, where some threw objects at police, who responded with pepper spray.
The changes to the labor code had already sparked a street protest at the weekend.

Assange first took asylum in the embassy in 2012, but his relationship with Ecuador has grown increasingly tense, with President Lenin Moreno saying he does not like his presence in the embassy. 
The government in October imposed new rules requiring him to receive routine medical exams, following concerns he was not getting the medical attention he needed. The rules also ordered Assange to pay his medical and phone bills and clean up after his pet cat.
Inigo Salvador told reporters Ecuador did not have access to results of the tests, which were conducted by doctors Assange trusted, out of respect for his privacy. But he said Assange, who has sued Ecuador arguing that the new rules violate his rights, appeared coherent and lucid to him.
On Wednesday, Assange appeared via videoconference in an Ecuadorean court to appeal a previous ruling that had upheld the new rules. Assange is concerned that Ecuador is seeking to end his asylum and extradite him to the United States, but Ecuador has said the United Kingdom told it he would not be extradited.
U.S. officials have acknowledged that federal prosecutors have been conducting a lengthy criminal probe into Assange and Wikileaks. Wikileaks published U.S. diplomatic and military secrets when Assange ran the operation.
A lawyer for Assange said he did not know the results of the medical tests, and called on Ecuador to produce documentation proving that the UK would not extradite him to any country where his life was at risk. 
""We insist that they show us the letter from the United Kingdom,"" said the lawyer, Carlos Poveda. ""The protocol is meant to set the rules of his living situation, but it seems more like a penitentiary regime."" 
Assange initially took asylum to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where authorities wanted to question him as part of a sexual assault investigation. 

That investigation was later dropped. The United Kingdom says he will be arrested for skipping bail if he leaves the embassy, but that his jail time will not exceed six months.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will offer Ukraine help for its regions affected by Russia's actions in the Azov Sea when they meet on Thursday, according to a draft summit statement seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
But there is no mention of consideration of further sanctions against Russia, reflecting division among member states. Diplomats expect a rollover of existing sanctions but no consensus on increases sought by more hawkish governments.
Condemning Russia, the EU will reiterate its support for Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea's 2014 annexation by Moscow and - referring to the capture of Ukrainian naval vessels off Crimea last month - said: ""there is no justification for the use of military force by Russia"". 
The statement demanded the release of Ukrainian sailors seized during the incident, the return of their vessels and free passage to all ships passing through the Kerch Strait.
It concludes with the offer of financial and other measures to help areas of eastern Ukraine whose maritime access is affected by Moscow's action.
""The EU stands ready to adopt measures to strengthen further its support in favor of the affected areas of Ukraine,"" the statement said.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko met summit chair Donald Tusk in Brussels on Wednesday and will hold talks at NATO headquarters in the city on Thursday. EU leaders will discuss Ukraine and Russia over a summit dinner later in the day.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey will launch a new military operation in northern Syria within days, targeting Kurdish militia fighters who are supported by U.S. troops east of the Euphrates river, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday.
Ankara and Washington have long been at odds over Syria, where the United States has backed the YPG Kurdish militia in the fight against Islamic State insurgents. 
Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist organization and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency against the state in southeastern Turkey for 34 years.
Turkey has already intervened to sweep YPG fighters from territory west of the Euphrates in military campaigns over the past two years, but up until now, it had not gone east of the river - partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces. 
But Erdogan's patience with Washington over Syria - specifically a deal to clear the YPG from the town of Manbij, just west of the Euphrates - seems to have worn thin. 
""We will start the operation to clear the east of the Euphrates from separatist terrorists in a few days. Our target is never U.S. soldiers,"" Erdogan said at a speech at a defense industry summit in Ankara.
""This step will allow for the path to a political solution to be opened and for healthier cooperation.""
Turkey has repeatedly voiced frustration about what it says are delays in the implementation of the Manbij deal, saying last month that the agreement should be fully carried out by the end of this year.
Turkish and U.S. troops began joint patrols near Manbij last month, but that cooperation has also been complicated as Turkey has shelled Kurdish fighters to the east of the Euphrates.
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Erdogan's comments had created concern in the Pentagon that the fight against Islamic State militants could be affected. 
The official said there was concern that a Turkish operation could distract Kurdish YPG fighters away from the middle Euphrates River Valley. 
In March, another Turkish offensive against the YPG affected the fight against Islamic State and led to an ""operational pause"" in eastern Syria.
OBSERVATION POSTS
The Pentagon says it has about 2,000 troops in Syria.
Last month the United States said would establish observation posts on the border between Kurdish-held northern Syria and Turkey after Turkish cross-border shelling killed four Kurdish fighters.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the Turkish attacks had led to a temporary halt in the U.S.-backed campaign the SDF are waging against Islamic State near the Syria-Iraq border. 
Three observation posts have now been set up, a U.S. official told Reuters on Wednesday. The official said the positions were clearly marked and any force attacking them ""would definitely know they are attacking the United States"".
Erdogan's announcement came after Turkish officials held talks in Ankara this week with the U.S. special representative for Syria, Jim Jeffrey. An SDF military source said Jeffrey met the SDF leadership in northern Syria on Wednesday.
Erdogan said Turkey was the victim of a ""stalling tactic"" over Manbij and Islamic State no longer posed a threat in Syria.
""Now, it's time to realize our decision to disperse the circles of terror east of the Euphrates. The fact that we have deep differences in perception with the United States is no secret,"" he said.
""A stalling tactic has been used in Manbij and is still being used... There is no threat named Daesh in Syria anymore. This is a fairytale,"" he said, using an Arabic acronym for the militant group.

The YPG still controls a large swathe of northeast Syria, on Turkey's southern border. Turkey regards the YPG as an extension of the PKK. More than 40,000 people, mostly Kurds, have died in the PKK's conflict with Ankara. Turkish authorities fear the conflict could be stoked by the YPG presence across the border.

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 03:45PM ET</span>",PM May pledges to quit before next UK election as she fights leadership challenge,"By Kylie MacLellan, Elizabeth Piper and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May promised on Wednesday to step down before the next parliamentary election due in 2022, hoping to win over wavering lawmakers before a no confidence vote triggered by Brexiteers in her Conservative Party.
Less than four months before Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, the country's exit is in chaos with options ranging from a potentially disorderly ""no-deal"" departure to another referendum that could reverse it.
At a closed meeting with her lawmakers before they were due to decide her fate, May announced she would not take the party into the next election due four years from now.
""She did say she wouldn't be fighting the next general election,"" work and pensions minister Amber Rudd told reporters. ""It was quite emotional the way she put it, she said in my heart I wanted to do that but now I recognize that I am not going to."" 
The Conservative lawmakers are casting their votes in the confidence ballot from 1800 GMT in a parliamentary committee room. An announcement is due at 2100 GMT. 
May could be toppled if a simple majority of 317 Conservative members of parliament (MPs) vote against her, though a large rebellion could also leave her fatally weakened.
At least 198 indicated public support for her and one bookmaker put the likelihood she would win at 89 percent.
The numbers will be significant, and will also indicate the level of opposition in the ruling party to the Brexit deal she has negotiated with Brussels.
""If much more than 100 MPs vote against her then I think she is going to be struggling to remain for very long and would find it difficult to get that deal through the House of Commons,"" said polling expert John Curtice. 
Brexit is Britain's most significant political and economic decision since World War Two. Pro-Europeans fear the departure will weaken the West as it grapples with the presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. 
The outcome will shape Britain's $2.8 trillion economy, have far reaching consequences for UK unity and determine whether London keeps its place as one of the top two global financial centers.
The British pound rose to $1.2652 on bets that May would keep her job.
SCHISM OVER EUROPE 
Division over Europe among the Conservatives helped bring down all three of the party's previous premiers - David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher. Now, May's fate also hangs on Britain's often tempestuous relationship with Europe, by far its biggest trading partner. 
May, who voted to remain in the EU in a 2016 referendum, told opponents of her withdrawal deal - struck after two years of negotiations - that if they toppled her, then Brexit would be delayed or stopped.
""A change of leadership in the Conservative Party now would put our country's future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it,"" she said. ""I stand ready to finish the job.""
May said a new leader would not have time to renegotiate Brexit and secure parliamentary approval by the end of March, meaning the Article 50 withdrawal notice would have to be extended or rescinded.
BREXIT CHAOS
May, a 62-year-old daughter of a Church of England priest, won the top job in the turmoil that followed the EU referendum but promised to implement Brexit, while keeping close ties to the bloc, to heal a divided nation. 
But on Monday she called off a parliamentary vote on her deal - which seeks to keep Britain closely aligned with the EU after the exit - to avoid a humiliating defeat. 
Her trade minister, Liam Fox, said the government might not even put it to a vote unless the EU gave more reassurances on the Irish ""backstop"", an insurance policy aimed at preventing border controls on the island of Ireland.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also said the 27 other EU members would not change the deal.
Pro-Brexit hardliners say May has betrayed the people's vote in negotiations, while other critics say she struck a deal that is the worst of all worlds - leaving Britain out of the EU but with no say over rules it has to abide by.
""Theresa May's plan would bring down the government if carried forward,"" eurosceptic lawmakers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker said in a statement. ""Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May’s leadership. In the national interest, she must go.""
Ministers said changing leader at such an important moment in British history was folly. ""I am absolutely sure the prime minister will win,"" said Michael Gove, the most senior Brexiteer in May's government.
But if the deal fails in parliament and Brexit is not delayed, Britain could be heading toward a disorderly exit that investors fear will clog the arteries of trade, dislocate supply chains and upset markets.

""We are working hard to make sure we get an orderly Brexit,"" said Merkel, the EU's most powerful leader.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 03:14PM ET</span>","Yemen warring parties agree to reopen Sanaa airport, resume oil, gas exports","By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Maha El Dahan 
RIMBO, Sweden/ADEN (Reuters) - Yemen's warring parties agreed on Wednesday to reopen Sanaa airport in the Houthi-held capital and resume oil and gas exports, sources said, as Western nations pressed them to accept confidence-building steps before the end of U.N.-led peace talks in Sweden.
The Iranian-aligned Houthi movement and the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi were still discussing a United Nations proposal on the contested port city of Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions of Yemenis facing starvation.
Hadi's premier, Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed, told reporters in the government's base in the southern port of Aden that there might not be enough time for full agreement on Hodeidah as the talks, the first in over two years, conclude on Thursday.
""We talked about (it) a lot but with the limited time we have, we can’t talk about all the points in this round. The important thing is to build confidence and then go into the details of the Hodeidah file,"" he said.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was due to attend the final day of talks to support efforts to launch a political process that would end the nearly four-year-old war. 
Gueterres called Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss Yemen, Saudi state news agency reported.
Another round of talks could be held in early 2019. 
The Houthis hold most population centers, including Hodeidah and Sanaa from which it ousted Hadi's government in 2014.
A U.N. spokeswoman said both parties had received a ""final package"" of agreements covering the status of Hodeidah, Sanaa airport. ""We hope to receive positive responses,"" she said.
The two parties agreed that international flights would stop at a government-held airport for safety s to be carried out before flying in or out of Sanaa, two sources familiar with the talks said. 
Houthi delegate Abdelmajid Hanash said international flights from and to Sanaa would stop in Aden and the airport in Sayun in the south, but the U.N. would oversee the safety procedures. The U.N. declined to comment.
As part of confidence-building measures, both sides agreed to resume oil and gas exports to help shore up central bank coffers. Revenues would be used to pay salaries in both government and Houthi-held areas, delegates from both sides told Reuters.
The Saudi-led military coalition that intervened in the war in 2015 to restore Hadi's government controls Yemen's air space.
The coalition has faced increased scrutiny from Western allies, some of which supply it with arms and intelligence, over the war that has killed tens of thousands of people.
TRUMP GESTURE
U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters on Tuesday he could abide by legislation to end U.S. support for coalition forces in the war following outrage over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
""I hate to see what's going on in Yemen,"" Trump said. ""But it takes two to tango. I'd want to see Iran pull out of Yemen too.""
The conflict is seen in the Middle East as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which welcomed peace efforts.
Asked about the U.S. Senate deliberations, Saeed said Yemen's stability was important for regional security: ""The U.S. cannot overlook what Iran is doing in Yemen.""
U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths, trying to avert a full-scale assault on Hodeidah, where coalition forces have massed on the outskirts, is asking both sides to withdraw from the city.
His proposal envisions an interim entity being formed to run the city and port and international monitors being deployed. 
Both sides have agreed to a U.N. role in the port, the entry point for most of Yemen's commercial imports and vital aid, but differ on who should run the city. The Houthis want Hodeidah declared a neutral zone, while Hadi's government believes the city should fall under its control as a matter of sovereignty.
""The devil is in the details - withdraw how far (from Hodeidah), the sequence, who governs and delivers services,"" said one diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The sides have also yet to agree on a transitional governing body, although a deal was struck on a prisoner swap that could see 15,000 prisoners freed.

A small group of Yemenis demonstrated outside the talks venue in Rimbo, north of Stockholm, waving the flags of former South Yemen in support of a separatist movement that is fighting alongside the coalition while trying to undermine Hadi's government.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States will push the U.N. Security Council to toughen its stance to prevent Iran from working on ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and carrying out test launches, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday.
Pompeo also told the Security Council an arms embargo on Iran should not be lifted in 2020 and called on the council to establish ""inspection and interdiction measures, in ports and on the high seas, to thwart Iran's continuing efforts to circumvent arms restrictions.""
""Iran is harboring al Qaeda, supporting Taliban militants in Afghanistan, arming terrorists in Lebanon, facilitating illicit trade in Somali charcoal benefiting al-Shabaab, and training and equipping Shia militias in Iraq,"" Pompeo said during the meeting on the implementation of U.N. sanctions on Iran. 
Russia and China - which are council veto powers along with the United States, France and Britain - are unlikely to support the measures proposed by Pompeo. In February Russia vetoed an attempt by the West to have the Security Council call out Tehran in a resolution on Yemen.
Without naming countries, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused some council members of using Wednesday's meeting ""to discuss the so-called regional behavior of Iran, which they depict as though it were the only source of all the woes in the Middle East."" 
""What they do not voice is any kind of a substantive proposal on this topic and sometimes we're left with the impression that the only goal is to further escalate anti-Iran hysteria and to demonize Iran,"" Nebenzia told the council. 
A 2015 U.N. resolution ""called upon"" Iran to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Some states argue that the language does not make it obligatory.
The United States wants the council to toughen that measure, Pompeo said, to reflect language in a 2010 resolution that left no room for interpretation by banning Iran from ""activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using ballistic missile technology.""
""This Security Council has a responsibility to protect citizens of the Middle East, Americans traveling through the Middle East, Europeans who are now at risk from Iranian missiles,"" Pompeo told reporters after the meeting. 
The United States, Britain and France have accused Tehran of flouting the current U.N. restrictions on Tehran's missile program by carrying out ballistic missile launches. Iran says the missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons.
Tehran's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Eshagh al-Habib accused Washington of an ""addiction to sanctions and warmongering,"" saying Iran was in compliance with its commitments under a 2015 international nuclear deal, which the Trump administration withdrew from in May. 
""What we heard today was another series of lies, fabrications, disinformation and deceptive statements by the U.S. It is not unprecedented,"" al-Habib told the council. 
Most U.N. sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted in January 2016 when the U.N. nuclear watchdog confirmed that Tehran fulfilled commitments under the nuclear deal with Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia and the United States. But Iran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions.

The U.N. sanctions and restrictions on Iran are contained in the 2015 resolution, which also enshrines the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. European powers have been scrambling to salvage the deal.

Maduro made his accusation just days after Russian bombers landed in Venezuela to carry out joint military exercises, sparking a war of words between Moscow and Washington. 
The White House said Russia has told the United States that the bombers will leave Venezuela on Friday.
""Mr. John Bolton has been assigned, once again, as the chief of a plot to fill Venezuela with violence and to seek a foreign military intervention,"" Maduro told a news conference, adding that Bolton was coordinating the training of mercenaries in military bases in Colombia and the United States.
There was no immediate comment on Maduro's remarks from Bolton's office. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said last year that ""the military option"" was on the table with regards to Venezuela, fueling Maduro's contention that Washington seeks to overthrow his leftist government, which U.S. officials deny. 
The Trump administration has levied several rounds of sanctions against Venezuela since last year. 

Bolton is a longtime opponent of leftist governments in Latin America and he announced the most recent sanctions against Venezuela last month as part of a pledge to crack down on Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, which he dubbed the ""troika of tyranny.""

LONDON, (Reuters) - - More children worldwide are now immunized against killer diseases but the task has become harder due to conflicts, epidemics, urbanization and migration, the head of a global vaccine group said.
Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI vaccines alliance, said his agency was now focusing on how to get vaccines to people in rural areas, those isolated by war and refugees.
GAVI uses its funding by private philanthropies and government donors to negotiate down vaccine prices for poorer nations, buying them in bulk to supply countries most in need.
Since its launch in 2000, the alliance has helped save the lives of about 10 million children and immunized 700 million children with new and generic vaccines against everything from measles to diarrhea to cervical cancer.
""Ninety percent of children in the world are now reached by routine immunizations, but there are 10 percent that aren't,"" Berkley told Reuters by telephone from a GAVI meeting in the United Arab Emirates.
""And there are more and more (disease) outbreaks around the world - partly because of climate change, partly because of instability - and we have the largest number of refugees in history,"" he said.
He cited U.N. data showing there were now almost 70 million displaced people worldwide.
""So to deal with those challenges, GAVI has to adapt its model to work more flexibly,"" Berkley said.
The alliance has traditionally worked with governments to raise routine vaccine coverage rates in poor countries.
More recently it has also worked on emergency projects, including getting oral cholera shots to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, stockpiling an experimental Ebola vaccine for use in an epidemic in Democratic Republic of Congo, and trying to help prevent infectious disease flare-ups in Syria.
Berkley said GAVI was also now finding new partners.
In Uganda, it is working with the delivery firms UPS and Freight in Time Ltd, and with Parsyl, a data start-up, to use customized apps, data and wireless temperature monitoring to overcome vaccine supply chain issues.
GAVI is also working with the German development bank KfW to explore using blockchain technology in its cash support and supply chain management. 
Payments firm Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has said it would offer advice and technology to help provide digital immunization record cards in poorer countries.

""It's about understanding where people are being missed,"" Berkley said, adding that this was increasingly in ""urban slums, isolated rural areas and conflict areas in fragile countries"".

Wednesday's move ratchets up pressure on Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel who is already under fire for personnel and equipment shortages. 
Merkel's fourth and probably final government has already come close to collapsing twice, and she can ill afford another setback as she tries to lead the coalition forward after giving up the leadership of her party - a sign of her waning authority.
Opposition lawmakers agreed to convene a special committee to investigate possible misconduct over the use of outside consultants after failing to get sufficient answers from the defense ministry.
There was no immediate public comment from the ministry.
The decision follows a scathing internal report by the Federal Audit Office, leaked to the media, that cited dozens of irregularities in hiring outside advisers in contracts worth hundreds of millions of euros in total.
Under German law a special investigative committee can subpoena witness and experts and to order other investigative work by courts and administrative agencies.
Senior members of the opposition Greens, pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the hardline Left party announced the move.
""We view it as imperative to carry out our own probe through an investigative committee,"" Greens lawmaker Tobias Lindner said in a statement after a six-hour hearing on the issue. 
""The violations of rules and inconsistencies in the processes of the Bundeswehr are too egregious to not clear them up,"" he said.
The ministry last month told lawmakers it was implementing reforms to prevent further mistakes but said it had not detected any cost to taxpayers from the use of outside experts.
Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, defense spokeswoman for the FDP, said the new investigative body would force former armaments chief Katrin Suder, a former senior executive with McKinsey, and other key players, to testify.

France is on course to overshoot the European Union's budget deficit ceiling next year after Macron caved in to a near month-long public revolt and unveiled 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion) worth of tax cuts and spending increases.
""The president's European message will be very clear,"" a source close to Macron said ahead of an EU summit set for Thursday and Friday. ""To be able to reform, you can't have blockages or incomprehension in society, and we need to overcome this anger and impatience.""
The ""yellow vest"" protests erupted out of nowhere on Nov. 17, when nearly 300,000 demonstrators nationwide took to the streets to denounce high living costs and a fuel tax.
Roadblocks around the country and violent clashes in central Paris have already taken their toll on the economy.
In his response on Monday, Macron insisted that the subsidies for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners were not a U-turn but an acceleration of his pledge to ""make work pay"".
He also said he would push ahead with planned reforms of the pension system and unemployment benefits next year. Some analysts have expressed doubts that could now happen after the sharp loss in public support he suffered.
""The reform agenda is not jeopardized, it would have been stalled had French society been durably blocked,"" the source close to Macron said.
""None of the major economic reforms that had been well received by our partners have been called into question,"" the official said, citing reforms of the labor market and railways introduced last year.
After his election in 2017, Macron made reducing the French deficit below the EU limit of 3 percent the cornerstone of his push to reform the euro zone, arguing that fiscal credibility would help convince Germany to back his plans.
Asked about the reaction in the German press -- which said Macron had lost credibility as one newspaper mocked him as 'France's Gulliver' -- the official said he expected to have some explaining to do but that Berlin politicians would be more understanding.
""Yes, some off-the-cuff comments are a bit rough, but we have to take that into account, because they reflect a concern,"" the official said.

""The German political system will look into this more thoroughly than a few columns done in the heat of the moment.""

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he would stand firm against what he called ""inflammatory"" Catalan separatist rhetoric, hardening his stance towards the region and upping the stakes in a broader political game.
Sanchez has adopted a more open approach towards Catalonia's pro-independence leaders than his conservative predecessor Mariano Rajoy, ousted in a no-confidence vote in June and whose government took control of the region for several months after it unilaterally declared independence in October 2017.
But a deepening polarization within Spain over matters of regional autonomy on Dec. 2 cost Sanchez's Socialists votes in an election in Andalusia, one of its traditional regional strongholds, that in turn highlighted the risk of an early national election.
The Socialists control fewer than a quarter of seats in the Madrid parliament and need the support of smaller parties, including Catalan nationalists, to pass legislation, in particular the 2019 budget.
Wednesday's speech was closely watched for signs of whether Sanchez would make concessions to Catalan separatists to secure their backing for the budget and help him stay in office for the rest of a parliamentary term due to run until 2020.
But he took no such step.
""Over the past few days we have heard, from some of the leaders of the independence movement, an unacceptable inflammatory rhetoric,"" Sanchez told lawmakers.
Speaking in Brussels on Saturday, the head of Catalonia's pro-independence government Quim Torra praised what he called ""the Slovenian way"" to independence.
Slovenia declared independence in June 1991, prompting a 10-day war against the Yugoslav army in which 64 people died. 
Sanchez also said that national police could be sent to Catalonia if local authorities did not do more against protests like one that shut down highways at the weekend.
""BIG MISTAKE""?
Sanchez's speech drew unfavorable initial reactions from across the political spectrum.
Catalan separatist lawmaker Carles Campuzano called it ""a big mistake,"" adding: ""You can't govern Spain ignoring the demands of Catalonia.""
The conservative Partido Popular (PP) and centre-right Ciudadanos said the speech was too soft.
""You have said absolutely nothing on Catalonia,"" PP chief Pablo Casado said. ""You can't say anything as you depend on their votes (for the government) to survive.""
Analysts said the Socialists' fiasco in Andalusia, where the far-right Vox also made an unexpected breakthrough, was partly due to anger with Sanchez's overtures to Catalonia.
""The government is toughening its stance, it seems it has understood that its position on territorial issues has cost it votes,"" said Pablo Simon, a political science professor at Madrid's Carlos III university.
The issue may well come to a head in January, when Sanchez puts the 2019 budget proposal to parliament.
If that fails to pass, he could be forced to call an early election, though he would be able to do so while saying he has not yielded to separatists' demands, analysts say.
""The question (for an early election) is not so much when as why. It can be a good argument to say they wanted to push the budget through to implement their policies but couldn't for lack of support,"" Simon said.

Sanchez said he was still willing to talk with Catalan leaders, but that they must first come up with proposals representing all of the region and not just its separatists. His government's economic policies would help heavily-indebted Catalonia, he added.

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 11:52AM ET</span>","To neighbors, suspect in French market killings seemed just a local boy","By Gilbert Reilhac and John Irish
STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - The fugitive Strasbourg man suspected of shooting and knifing people as he shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" at the French city's Christmas market is a criminal who turned radical Islamist in jail, officials say. 
Neighbors remember Cherif Chekatt as an ordinary local guy, but to security agencies the 29-year-old had represented a potential threat for some time, his beliefs hardened behind bars.
Chekatt grew up in the Cite du Hohberg, a large, tough housing estate built in the 1960s, where he lived at his parents' apartment in the Rue Tite Live. 
He has 27 criminal convictions for theft and violence, officials say, and has spent time in French, German and Swiss prisons. Now police are seeking him as the suspect who killed at least two people on Tuesday night.
Neighbors said they believed Chekatt's brother was a radicalized Muslim but had always seen Cherif as a typical young man who dressed in jogging pants and trainers, unlike his sibling who preferred a traditional robe. 
""He had spent quite a bit of time in prison and since then we didn't see him much. He had a radicalized big brother who was always in a djellaba, always at the mosque,"" said a 20-year-old youth who has known Chekatt since he was young, withholding his name. ""It's frightening when you know he lived just next to you.""
Police were interrogating Chekatt's father, mother and two brothers on Wednesday in custody.
France has long struggled to integrate western Europe's largest Muslim population, for years mired in a virulent debate over national identity and the role of Islam in a country that holds fast to state secularism.
A wave of militant attacks since 2015, most of them commissioned or inspired by Islamic State, has killed about 240 people and exposed France's difficulties in tackling homegrown militants and jihadists returning from wars abroad.
Strasbourg deputy mayor Robert Herrmann said about 400 people living in and around Strasbourg were on the security agencies' ""Fiche S"" watchlist, including the suspect. 
""We know this risk and we trust our services to put an end to these murders,"" he said, before adding: ""There will, though, always be a way through the net."" 
WATCHLIST 
Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said Chekatt had been radicalized in jail, becoming an apologist for terrorism, but there had been no signs he would turn violent.
""He encouraged a radical religious practice in prison but nothing indicated that he would carry out an attack,"" Nunez said on France Inter radio. 
Police said the attack followed a police search of Chekatt's flat in Strasbourg in a homicide investigation on Tuesday morning. Chekatt was absent, but a .22 caliber Long Rifle and four knives were found. 
A German security source said that following a conviction for ""aggravated theft"" Chekatt had been jailed in the southern German city of Constance from August 2016 to February 2017. 
He was released before the end of his two-year, three-month prison sentence into the custody of German police so that he could be deported to France. 
A second German security source said he had been banned from re-entering the country. 
Several German officials and sources said Chekatt had not been identified as a security threat. It was not immediately clear if or how French officials had communicated their concerns to German authorities.
The rampage surprised neighbors. ""It's a shock. We ask ourselves questions when something like this happens, especially as it is a calm area,"" said a teenage acquaintance of Chekatt. 
Nunez said more than 20,000 people in France were designated as Fiche S and that a little over half of those were being monitored. 

""We follow many individuals like him ... Being labeled Fiche S does not forecast the level of threat they may pose,"" the deputy minister said.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","As Modi takes a beating at Indian polls, small parties see big chance","By Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - After suffering an electoral thrashing at the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party in 2014, India's small regional and caste-based parties are back in the reckoning months ahead of the next general election.
Losses for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced in three key states on Tuesday - blamed mainly on rural anger at weak farm prices and sluggish job creation - have opened the door for new and old alliances between the main opposition Congress and smaller parties bitterly opposed to Modi.
Most political strategists still expect the BJP to cling on to national power, albeit with a smaller majority, in an election due by May next year. But they also acknowledge this week's results in three big heartland states have opened up the outside possibility that Congress could stitch together enough support from smaller parties to form the next government.
""At the central level, Prime Minister Modi maintains overwhelming popularity over his competitors, and anecdotal evidence suggests BJP has more boots on the ground than other parties to mobilize during its re-election campaign,"" Nomura said in a research note. ""However, we do expect talks of a grand (opposition) coalition to raise political uncertainty into the 2019 general elections.""
A Congress-led coalition involving multiple smaller parties could find it difficult to govern, and make economic reforms particularly contentious. That is because almost all of the smaller parties have their own local or community-based agendas that may not fit with many national policies.
For investors that could mean dealing with more policy uncertainty or even gridlock over some critical issues.
Adding to that uncertainty, Congress says it will not announce that its president, Rahul Gandhi, would be its prime ministerial candidate in the event it could put together a coalition, as it seeks to respect the aspirations of its alliance partners.
Many of the regional leaders are highly ambitious with years of experience in office. Gandhi, although heir to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has dominated Indian politics since independence, has never held any government position.
DETHRONING GOAL
One of the smaller parties, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) established in 1984 to mainly represent people in the lowest strata of India's ancient caste hierarchy, said on Wednesday it would support Congress in forming governments in the big states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where it fell just short of a majority.
Congress has the numbers to form a government on its own in the central state of Chhattisgarh, while regional parties won two other states that also went to the polls in recent weeks.
""We fought these state elections mainly to dethrone the BJP. Unfortunately we were not able to do that on our own,"" BSP President Mayawati, who goes by only one name, told reporters.
""Despite having some differences with the Congress party, we have decided to support them to keep the BJP out. Our people should give their best, starting now, for a good showing in the next general election.""
Another BSP leader, M.H. Khan, told Reuters the party hoped to fight the 2019 general election alongside Congress and other parties, and then see Mayawati become India's next prime minister.
In the 2014 general election, the BJP won 282, or nearly 53 percent, of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament - the biggest majority an Indian government has had in three decades. Meanwhile, the BSP drew a blank, after winning as many as 21 seats in 2009. Many other small parties, such as the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Nationalist Congress Party, also fared poorly as a Modi's development-for-all pitch swept the country.
SP spokesman Ghanshyam Tiwari said the party hoped to easily surpass its tally of five parliamentary seats next year by forming a ""formidable alliance to ensure that we have a better agenda to work on"".
WORK IN PROGRESS
On Monday, a day before the state election results were announced, Congress led a meeting of nearly two dozen opposition parties who pledged to oust the BJP government and ""confront and defeat the forces that are subverting our constitution and making a mockery of our democracy"".
One of the leaders who attended was Mamata Banerjee, the left-of-centre firebrand who is head of the All India Trinamool Congress party based in the big eastern state of West Bengal.
She had famously pulled https://in.reuters.com/article/mamata-banerjee-trinamool-congress-upa/trinamool-congress-walks-out-of-upa-coalition-idINDEE88H0BE20120918 her party out of a Congress-led coalition government in 2012, in protest at a decision to raise diesel prices and open India's supermarket sector to investment from foreign chains such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Though the government survived back then thanks to support from the BSP and SP, the uncertainty roiled financial markets.
But Congress said it was wrong to assume a coalition government would be fractious and bad for the economy. The trend of multi-party governments began in the late 1980s and strengthened onwards as the BJP rose to prominence, weakening the dominance Congress enjoyed for years.
""The mahagathbandhan (grand-coalition) is a work in progress, it is going to be a reality,"" Congress spokesman Sanjay Jha said. Referring to the administration led by Congress until 2014 he added: ""In 10 years of a coalition government we had better GDP growth, we had a very stable society. The myth that majority governments provide better governance has been totally disproved.""

The government contends that recent downward revisions to official data shows that GDP growth in those 10 years between 2004-2014 averaged 6.7 percent, below an average of 7.4 percent under the current government.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>","With farmers watching, France sets food price rise plan","PARIS (Reuters) - Weighing up pressure from both France's powerful farmers and violent ""yellow vest"" protests, the government on Wednesday put forward a schedule for next year's postponed rise in minimum food prices and curbs on bargain sales.
Food prices are a major element of a wide ""field-to-fork"" review promised by President Emmanuel Macron to appease farmers, a large and active constituency in France, who have long complained about low margins and retail wars.
In a proposal at the Council of Ministers, Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said the minimum floor below which retailers cannot sell food products would be raised by 10 percent from Feb. 1. 
This was in time for yearly price negotiations between retailers and suppliers between November and end-February.
The government also aims to curb promotional offers on food, including those under negotiation since Dec. 1, 2018, according to the council meeting minutes.
From Jan. 1 next year, discounts on food products will be limited to 34 percent of a product's price. That halts major promotions such as two-for-one.
In addition, from March 1, the overall volume of promotions will be limited to 25 percent of sales of planned purchases between supplier and distributor. 
The measures will be trialled for two years with regular follow-ups to assess the impact, the government said.
Street protests over the cost of living have convulsed France in recent weeks, causing violence in Paris and threatening President Emmanuel Macron's authority.
Analysts say the price measures would reduce aggressive competition among retailers and accelerate food inflation. However, many retailers said the final impact on consumers' total spending would be minimal.
France's largest farm union FNSEA had said the delay in food price measures was a ""disastrous signal"" for farmers and called protests this week against that and what they call excessive taxes and increasing hostility towards them.
There was no immediate reaction from FNSEA to Wednesday's news.
French food industry lobby Ania welcomed the government decision, urging quick implementation to ease the yearly price talks between retailers and suppliers.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 10:55AM ET</span>",Italy's Salvini changes tack on EU in bid for center ground,"By Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - Right-wing firebrand Matteo Salvini is softening his eurosceptic policies in a bid to capture the middle ground of Italian politics and eventually take centre-stage in Europe, even if it means disappointing his more radical supporters.
Setting a new course for his increasingly popular League party, in the last few days Salvini, who is deputy prime minister and interior minister, has scrapped its previous anti-euro position and vowed to reform the EU ""from the inside"".
In a seismic shift, he even said Italy should forge a political ""axis"" with Germany, a country the League has always accused of commandeering the euro zone for its own benefit while condemning Italy to economic decline. 
""The Franco-German axis is showing its limits, I will do everything I can to renew a new Rome-Berlin axis,"" Salvini told foreign reporters in Rome this week.
He acknowledged that the last ""axis"" between the two countries, in World War Two, had not ended well.
Salvini, say League insiders and analysts, has a two-pronged strategy: to appeal to more moderate and undecided voters while carving out a pivotal role for himself on the European stage after elections to the European parliament in May.
When in 2013 Salvini became leader of what was then called the Northern League, it was reeling from a corruption scandal and was backed by less than 4 percent of Italians. His success since then has been remarkable.
Campaigning on a fiercely anti-migrant and anti-euro platform, he attracted voters who resented high unemployment, stagnant wages and uncontrolled immigration from Africa, while transforming the party from a regional to a national force.
The League took 17 percent of the vote in March elections to become the largest party in a centre-right bloc which Salvini then abandoned to form a government in June with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
The League is now Italy's largest party with more than 30 percent support in opinion polls.
""COMMON SENSE""
Giovanni Orsina, professor of politics at Rome's LUISS University, said Salvini was a shrewd politician whose recent policy shifts were just the latest stages of a long-term strategy going back years.
""When he had 3 percent of the vote Salvini needed very extreme rhetoric to get himself noticed and build support, but now he is in government he doesn't have to be so radical and he is moving towards the center,"" Orsina said.
Salvini, a formidable communicator with a huge social media following, made no apologies when asked this week about his new desire to engage with EU institutions rather than fight them. 
""The world changes, this is a phase when we need common sense and concrete solutions,"" he said.
His U-turn on the euro has been particularly striking.
The League's March election program said the euro was ""the main cause of our economic decline"" and proposed a ""return to a pre-Maastricht situation"", a reference to the 1992 treaty that paved the way for the single currency. 
The party promised to prepare for euro exit and look for partners in Europe with whom to quit the currency together.
On Sunday, Salvini said in an interview with state television: ""We don't want to leave anything, we want to change the rules of the EU from the inside."" 
The following day he said the League had dropped talk of leaving the euro ""some years ago.""
The coalition's government ""contract"" drawn up in May made no reference to exiting the euro. That was because of resistance from 5-Star and the head of state, as well as fears of a market backlash. 
EUROPEAN ELECTIONS
Claudio Borghi, the League's economics spokesman and one of Italy's best-known eurosceptics, toured the country with Salvini in 2014 to present a 31-page pamphlet, penned by Borghi, entitled: ""Quit the euro: how to get out of the nightmare."" 
Yet he was ""neither disappointed nor surprised"" by Salvini's change of stance. It showed an ability to adapt to political circumstances, he said.
""I am practical, you have to act on the basis of what is possible and now it's useless to talk about leaving the euro because it's not possible,"" Borghi told Reuters.
The proposed axis with Germany was aimed at exploiting the weakness of French President Emmanuel Macron, struggling with street protests against his government, in a strategy focused on the European elections in May.
""Salvini could become the strongman of Europe ... it's an incredible opportunity,"" Borghi said, forecasting that European right-wing and anti-system parties, led by the League, could overtake the Socialists and vie for power with the centre-right. 
Some of the League's more diehard supporters are less enthusiastic. They are disorientated by Salvini's change of tack on the euro and have vented their frustration on social media where they accuse the party of betrayal.
However, Orsina said Salvini had little to fear because, bar a few minuscule movements, ""there is nothing to the right of the League"" for angry hard-right or eurosceptic voters to turn to. On the other hand, by presenting a less extreme image, he had ""enormous political space"" to exploit by attracting moderate, undecided voters.
Salvini's less hostile approach to the EU and the euro is also likely to please the business community in the League's northern heartland, where some have complained the party is not doing enough to help companies.
Lorenzo Pregliasco, head of polling and political analysis firm YouTrend, said Salvini's latest moves were aimed mainly at draining support from Forza Italia (Go Italy!), the conservative party led by his pre-election ally Silvio Berlusconi.
Forza Italia, which dominated the centre-right for more than two decades until the last election, got 14 percent at the March vote and is now polling at around 8 percent.

""Salvini wants to complete his takeover of the centre-right, and the best way is to increase his appeal to the center,"" Pregliasco said. If the strategy works, the League could get close to 40 percent at the European elections, he forecast.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Erly Marcial of Honduras joined the United States-bound migrant caravan with her family even though the 21-year-old was nearly eight months pregnant. She gave birth to a healthy baby on the grueling trail and is now hoping for another miracle.
She and her family are stuck in Tijuana, Mexico, at the doorstep of the United States, with President Donald Trump vowing to keep the migrants out.
""If only God would soften his heart,"" she said of Trump. ""Because he has a heart of flesh and blood, not of stone.""
Thanks to the generosity of strangers in her path, plus the intervention of Mexican healthcare workers and the Honduran consulate in Mexico City, Marcial completed the more than 2,800-mile (4,500-km) journey over several weeks, sometimes walking in rubber sandals for hours with a bulging belly.
She and her family have started on the long path to seeking asylum but it could be months before they get their first interview with U.S. officials.
The United States has granted only 13.8 percent of Honduran asylum claims in the latest fiscal year compared to 20.9 percent for asylum seekers worldwide, according to Justice Department data. 
If denied, Marcial and her husband, Alvin Reyes, 39, said they would try to build a life in Mexico and possibly in Tijuana, where they are living in a spartan church dormitory whose bunk beds are luxurious compared to the camps where thousands of other migrants from the caravan sleep in tents on hard ground.
Reyes could not make a living as a cobbler in the town of Sabá in Honduras, so they decided to join the caravan, usually lagging behind while pushing a baby carriage with their 2-year-old son David and their 6-year-old daughter María.
Alvin Jr. was born with a shock of dark hair in a hospital in Puebla, Mexico, on Nov. 12, about six weeks premature. 
If they have any asylum claim, it would be related to violence in their hometown, where a shootout at the cantina near their house peppered their walls with bullet holes and killed a man whose body lay in a pool of blood at their doorstep, they said. 
Marcial and Reyes said they were not home at the time, but were shaken and further motivated to abandon Honduras.

Guterres told delegates from over 130 countries meeting in the Polish city of Katowice that they had less than three days to find the political will to reach difficult compromises, sacrifices and common ground needed for a deal.
""Failing here in Katowice would send a disastrous message to those who stand ready to shift to a green economy,"" he said. ""To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.""
Three years to the day after the Paris climate accord was adopted by over 190 countries, delegates in the Polish coal-mining city are still grappling with how the accord will be implemented.
This slow progress after more than a week of negotiations prompted Michal Kurtyka, the Polish president of the talks, to tell delegates time was precious and they needed to find wordings which were acceptable to all.
Environmental activists and some developing countries have also raised concern that the rule book could fall short of pushing countries towards curbing their emissions to meet the Paris targets.
""The clock is ticking. While we spend time debating texts and demanding their implementation, the planet outside is deteriorating. Species are becoming extinct. Habitats disappearing. Emissions piling up,"" Brazilian Environment Minister Edson Duarte said.
Guterres said a recent report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change acknowledged what global warming beyond 1.5 degrees will mean for billions of people, especially those who live in small island states. 
The report outlined a catastrophic future if no action was taken by countries immediately, he said, adding that the window of opportunity was closing.
The Paris Agreement aims to restrict warming to ""well below"" two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.

""This may sound like a dramatic appeal, but it is exactly this: a dramatic appeal,"" Guterres said.

Prosecutors say Patrice-Edouard Ngaissona was the ""senior leader"" of the Anti-Balaka militia that carried out systematic attacks on the country's Muslim population in 2013-2014.
Ngaissona, who denies wrongdoing, was elected in February to the executive committee of the Confederation of African Football despite objections from groups including Human Rights Watch. It named had him as a leader of the Anti-Balaka in a report in 2016.
The ICC said Ngaissona was suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, extermination, deportation, persecution, torture, attacking civilians, and recruiting child soldiers.
A chamber at the court ""found reasonable grounds to believe Mr. Ngaissona is liable for having committed jointly with others... the abovementioned crimes.""
Ethnic and religious conflict has raged for years in Central African Republic. Christian Anti-Balaka militias have been fighting mainly Muslim Seleka rebels after the rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in 2013. Thousands have died in the violence. 
A court spokesman confirmed French authorities had carried out the arrest after the warrant was issued on Dec. 7. The ICC had formally requested Ngaissona's transfer.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has removed from his group of close advisers two cardinals hit by sexual abuse scandals, including his economy minister, Australian George Pell, the Vatican said on Wednesday.
Pell has taken an indefinite leave of absence from his job as head of the Secretariat for the Economy, one of the most powerful posts in the Vatican, to defend himself from prosecution for historical child sexual offences in Australia.
Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said: ""The Holy See has the utmost respect for Australian judiciary. We are aware that a suppression order is in place (on media reporting on judicial procedures) and we intend to respect it.""
Asked if Pell, 77, was still economy minister, Burke suggested he was, saying there had been no announcement to the contrary.
The other member removed from the so called C-9 - a group of nine cardinals that meets periodically with the pope in Rome - is Francisco Javier Errázuriz of Chile. 
Errázuriz, 85, the former archbishop of Santiago, has been accused by abuse survivors in Chile of discrediting victims and not investigating their cases, which he denies.
Chile’s sexual abuse scandal prompted all of the country’s 34 bishops to offer their resignation to the pope who has so far accepted seven.
A third C-9 cardinal, Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya, 79, of the Democratic Republic of Congo, was also leaving the group, Burke told a briefing on the C-9's latest meeting, which ended on Wednesday. None of the three attended.
Burke said the six remaining members - from Italy, Honduras, the United States, and India, would continue to advise the pope. There were no immediate plans to appoint new members, he said.

The pope told Reuters last June in an interview that he planned to use the five-year anniversary of the C-9 to ""to renew it a bit"".

Local officials said the Shebkoh district of Farah province, bordering Iran, has been under Taliban siege for months, making it difficult for the government to send reinforcements.
Mosa Nazari, deputy governor of Farah, said Afghanistan's military leadership faced difficulty supplying and reinforcing the troops in Shebkoh district and it had been decided to withdraw in order to avoid casualties.
""The plan to leave the district was there for months and it was finally decided,"" Nazari told Reuters, adding that the forces withdrew all ammunition and vehicles to the provincial capital of Farah.
U.S. military advisers have regularly pressed Afghan commanders to concentrate their forces and avoid exposed outposts that are difficult to defend and supply.
The Taliban, fighting to drive out foreign forces and re-impose its version of strict Islamic Law, said in a statement the Afghan government abandoned the district after a heavy firefight overnight, and the group seized an amount of ammunition.
A sparsely populated province, Farah has been the scene of intense fighting since the beginning of the year. Afghan forces have suffered heavy losses, including the killings of dozens of well-armed elite special forces there.
Shebkoh is a route for narcotics being smuggled from Helmand, the main source of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, to Farah and Iran.
Afghan officials have accused Tehran, which the United States says is trying to extend its influence in western Afghanistan, of providing the insurgents with money, modern weapons and explosives. Iran denies the accusation.
Areas of western Afghanistan have seen heavy fighting in recent days. Last week, at least 14 Afghan soldiers were killed and 20 captured when Taliban fighters attacked an outpost in Shindand district in Herat, the province neighboring Farah.
Afghan and foreign forces have recently increased air strikes, targeting and killing senior Taliban commanders, including the powerful shadowy governor of Helmand province last week.
U.S. diplomatic efforts to begin peace talks with the Taliban have picked up with appointment by Washington of Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul, as a special peace envoy.

Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's comments suggest it will be months or longer before the government reaches a decision that it had said it would announce this year.
Newspaper Die Presse reported last week the coalition government was split over whether to get rid of the jets, with Kurz's conservatives favoring keeping them and the far-right Freedom Party, which controls the Defense Ministry, taking the opposite view. The dispute is delaying a decision, it added.
""It is important to reach a decision when you are able to,"" Kurz told a news conference after a weekly cabinet meeting, when asked about a possible delay.
Austria is locked in a legal battle with planemaker Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium, which also includes BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo. 
Vienna accuses them of fraud and wilful deception in connection with its $2 billion Eurofighter order in 2003. They deny Austria's allegations. 

""We need clarity on whether anyone has done anything wrong, on whether partners currently being worked with have done anything wrong and when there is clarity on this then we will be able to reach further decisions,"" Kurz said, referring to the legal dispute and an ongoing parliamentary inquiry.

GAZA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Gazans on Wednesday attended the funeral of a four-year-old boy who died after being hit by Israeli shrapnel at a border protest last week, according to Palestinian medical officials.
Wrapped in a Palestinian flag, the body of Ahmed Abu Abed was carried on people's shoulders as mourners threw flowers into the procession in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.
Reuters footage from the protest last Friday showed the boy being carried by a medic into a field hospital not far from the border after being injured.
Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said he ""was hit by shrapnel from Israeli gunfire"".
""There was one piece of bullet shrapnel in the eye that settled at the bottom of the brain, that was the most serious of all, and that what most likely killed him,"" Mohammad Abu Hilal, director of emergency department at Khan Younis hospital, told Reuters.
Gaza's health ministry, run by the Islamist militant group Hamas, said more than 220 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops since March at border protests demanding an end to an Israeli-led blockade of the coastal strip.
Israel's military said it did ""everything possible to avoid harming children,"" and accused Hamas of endangering the lives of civilians by orchestrating the protests.
""The Hamas terrorist organization cynically uses Gaza residents, especially women and children, as human shields and places them at the forefront of the violent riots, terrorist attacks and the terror of arson, demonstrating their contempt for human life,"" the military statement said.
Hamas denies the allegation and Palestinians accuse Israel of using excessive force against protesters.

The South Asian island nation has been locked in political gridlock for more than a month since President Maithripala Sirisena replaced former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with pro-China strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa. 
Parliament has twice in the past few weeks voted to sack Rajapaksa but he has refused to resign.
Sirisena has repeatedly said he will not appoint Wickremesinghe ""even if he has the backing of all 225 lawmakers in parliament"". 
It was not immediately clear whether the confidence vote, passed by 117 votes to none, would help to see Wickremesinghe reinstated.
Lawmakers backing Sirisena and Rajapaksa chose not to participate in the parliament vote.
Sirisena dissolved parliament last month after Rajapaksa could not get majority support there. 
The Supreme Court is considering whether to rule that the dissolution is unconstitutional. If it does, parliament will then need to pass a budget for 2019, or risk triggering a government shutdown. 
""If there is no budget, no government officials could draw money and there could be a government shutdown. The government can't even repay loans,"" former finance minister Mangala Samaraweera told parliament. 
A Supreme Court ruling is expected this week.
Many foreign countries have yet to recognize the new government.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan on Wednesday denounced the United States for placing it on a list of countries violating religious freedoms, calling the designation politically motivated.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday added mainly Muslim Pakistan to the U.S. list of ""countries of particular concern"", which have violated religious freedoms or tolerated abuses against religious groups.
The move is likely to put further strain on relations between Islamabad and Washington, who have repeatedly clashed over how to deal with Islamist militants waging war in Afghanistan.
Pakistan's addition to the list comes despite efforts to end what in recent years has been its most controversial case involving a member of a minority religion.
The Supreme Court in October acquitted a Christian woman held on death row for more than eight years on a charge of blasphemy that she denied. The acquittal sparked days of violent protests by hardline Muslims.
Pakistan's foreign ministry said preserving the rights of minorities was a ""cardinal principle"" of the constitution, and it denounced the inclusion on the U.S. list.
""Pakistan rejects the U.S. State Department’s unilateral and politically motivated pronouncement,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Last year, the United States put Pakistan on a watch-list of countries that violate religious freedom.
This year came the designation, along with Myanmar, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Pakistan was created out of Muslim-majority areas in colonial India in 1947, and for decades portrayed itself as a progressive Islamic nation. 
Starting in the 1980s, however, it has drifted towards a more conservative interpretation of Islam that has reshaped the political landscape, fueled militancy and cowed champions of tolerance and members of minorities into silence.
The vast majority of Pakistan’s 208 million people are Muslims, with minorities accounting for about 4 percent of the population, including Christians, Hindus, Sikhs and members of the Ahmadi Muslim sect, who say they are singled out for persecution.
Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari said Pakistan's inclusion on the U.S. list was ""pure political blackmailing"" and an attempt by the United States to pressure Pakistan to implement U.S. policy goals in Afghanistan.
Pompeo urged counties on the list to increase respect for religious freedom.
""In far too many places across the globe, individuals continue to face harassment, arrests, or even death for simply living their lives in accordance with their beliefs,"" he said in a statement.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Thailand sent back to Cambodia on Wednesday a labor activist wanted by authorities at home over his role in making a documentary about sex-trafficking that the government said contained fake news, police said.
Cambodia's ruling party of Prime Minister Hun Sen has launched a crackdown on those it sees as critics, including human rights advocates and opposition politicians.
Rath Rott Mony, 47, was arrested in Bangkok on Friday as he attempted to travel to the Netherlands with his family after helping produce the documentary for the Russia Today channel that was broadcast in October.
Cambodian police spokesman Chhay Kim Khoeun said that Rath Rott Mony, president of the Cambodian Construction Workers Trade Union Federation (CCTUF), was deported from Thailand at Cambodia's request.
""When the procedure with the police is finished, we will send him to court,"" Chhay Kim Khoeun told Reuters. 
""It will be up to the court to determine what the charge is.""
Thai immigration officials were not immediately available for comment.
Rath Rott Mony's wife, who had earlier expressed fears her husband would be sent to prison if sent back to Cambodia, said a U.N. human rights worker had informed her about his deportation.
""I hope the court will investigate my husband's case fairly,"" his wife, Long Kimheang, told Reuters. 
The documentary he worked on, titled ""My Mother Sold Me"", included an account of a poor Cambodian girl who was sold into sex work, prompting authorities to question those involved.
Authorities later said the girl and her mother were paid $200 to lie in the documentary, which had damaged the country's reputation.
Russia Today said in a statement on Friday it never pays participants or interview subjects for a report.

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Holed up in supermarket with Strasbourg shooter on the prowl,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - For three tense hours last night I was hunkered down in a Strasbourg supermarket as a gunman prowled the city center after a deadly attack on a Christmas market.
It was dark, cold and nerve-wracking. But at least we had fruit, chips and chocolate and a few bottles of wine courtesy of the store to comfort us.
I had been heading towards Monoprix at Strasbourg's Place Kleber in search of some snacks after a hard's day at the European Parliament when a group of people ran past me screaming.
I did not think much of it as other shoppers around me did not react, and I thought it might just be youngsters having fun.
At the supermarket, the security guard mentioned a shooting but did not appear worried. I browsed among the racks of clothes, moisturisers and lingerie with other customers.
Ten minutes later, staff told us to move to the back, away from the glass doors after getting a call, presumably from the police.
I suddenly thought of the school shootings in the United States and how some of the gunmen methodically searched for victims as they went from one classroom to another. Hiding among the clothes did not seem like a great option.
Half an hour later, the staff told us to go down to the basement, where the food department was, because it was safer.
Safer meant switching off the lights and so about 40 of us, including the staff, were left in the dark, all working our mobiles to find out what was happening outside. 
Some sat on the cold floor, others stood by the cash registries while one woman raged, wanting to go home.
To their credit, the Monoprix supervisor handed out bottles of water to break the tension. Bananas, mandarins and apples were next on the menu. They also opened packets of chips and chocolates.
That definitely took people's minds off the situation outside and the possibility that the gunman might decide to do some supermarket shooting.
Mobile phones were overworked as all of us called home or loved ones or texted them, or just to tune into the news to find out the latest. I also filed some notes to Reuters colleagues.
Remembering my hostile training course, I noted to myself where the exits were. 
Two hours later, after someone complained about the cold from the freezers, the staff shepherded us up to the top floor of the supermarket via some narrow steep steps where it was much warmer.
One opened up a couple of bottles of wine and we sat around in a circle for a sip. We were not allowed to go near the windows. The lights were not switched on so we waited in the dark.
The police called around 11.30 pm, saying we could go home. We left in groups of 10, following a route marked out by the police. Everyone was frisked at checkpoints before they were allowed to go further.
Going to a supermarket will never be the same for me.

(Reuters) - More than 100 Myanmar activists marked the anniversary on Wednesday of the arrest of two Reuters journalists sentenced to seven years in jail in a landmark free speech case by releasing balloons at a rally in the country's largest city Yangon.
Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were found guilty in September of violating the country's Official Secrets Act, in a case that has raised questions about Myanmar's progress towards democracy and sparked an outcry from human rights advocates.
Students, journalists and writers sporting t-shirts that read ""Journalism is not a crime"" and ""Free Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo"" lit candles and held a minute's silence for the two reporters. 
Some held copies of the latest cover of Time magazine featuring the journalists and their families after they were named among a group of reporters as the publication's ""Person of the Year"".
""A year ago, Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested in a set-up by police, intended to interfere with their reporting on a massacre in Myanmar,"" said Reuters editor-in-chief Stephen J. Adler in a statement on Wednesday.
""The fact that they remain in prison for a crime they did not commit calls into question Myanmar’s commitment to democracy, freedom of expression and rule of law.""
The journalists have appealed against their conviction, citing evidence of a police set-up and lack of proof of a crime. An appeal hearing is scheduled for Dec. 24.
During eight months of hearings, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo testified that two policemen they had not met before handed them papers rolled up in a newspaper during a meeting at a Yangon restaurant on Dec. 12. Almost immediately afterwards, they said, they were bundled into a car by plainclothes officers.
On Feb. 1, a police witness said under cross-examination that information in the documents had already been published in newspapers. In April, a prosecution witness testified that a senior officer had ordered subordinates to plant documents on Wa Lone to ""trap"" the reporter.
Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said in September that the jailing of the reporters had nothing to do with freedom of expression. In comments made the week after their conviction, she said they had been sentenced for handling official secrets and ""were not jailed because they were journalists"".
Government spokesman Zaw Htay said at a news conference last month that the government could not interfere in the case as Myanmar's courts were independent. He could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
The United States called on the Myanmar government to release the journalists. ""After spending a year in prison, it is past time for journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo to go home to their families,"" said the country's embassy in Yangon in a statement.
Several media organizations and journalists' clubs, including the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong and the BBC World Service, as well as many Reuters journalists, have posted photographs on social media featuring Wa Lone's signature ""thumbs up"" gesture, which he displayed to supporters throughout the trial.

Before their arrest, the reporters had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and local Buddhists in western Myanmar's Rakhine state during an army crackdown that began in August last year. The operation sent more than 730,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.

Heavily indebted and with a stagnant economy, Lebanon desperately needs a new government to implement economic reforms that are required to put its public finances on a more sustainable footing and unlock pledges of foreign aid. 
""Partnership between the president and the prime minister along with the national consensus will certainly lead to the formation of a new government, despite all obstacles,"" Gebran Bassil, Aoun's son-in-law and head of the political party he founded, told an investment conference in London. 
Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri, also attending the conference, told reporters, said he was ""always optimistic"" when asked about the prospects of forming a new government following seven months of political wrangling. 
In Beirut, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said he was ""optimistic for the possibility of a solution soon"", according to a member of parliament from his own party.
Berri believed there was now a serious effort to form a government and his optimism stemmed from Aoun's intervention in the process, the lawmeker, Ali Bazzi, said. 
Aoun said on Tuesday the government formation could not be resolved in the traditional way between the prime minister-designate and other parties, meaning he had to get involved. 
Hariri said on Twitter that the new government would be firmly committed to reforms agreed at a donor conference this year, including fiscal reforms.
Agreement on the make-up of the new cabinet has met a series of obstacles as Hariri has sought to forge a deal parceling out 30 cabinet posts among rival groups according to a sectarian political system.
The final hurdle has been over Sunni Muslim representation, with the powerful Iran-backed Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah demanding a cabinet seat for one of its Sunni allies who gained ground in the election.

Analysts believe one compromise could be for Aoun to nominate one of the Hezbollah-aligned Sunnis, or a figure acceptable to them, among a group of ministers named by the president.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. human rights watchdog has urged Saudi authorities to free over a dozen rights activists detained in the kingdom, alleging that some had been tortured or mistreated during interrogation.
The panel of 10 independent experts also sought information on whether an impartial investigation is underway into allegations that ""high-level officials were involved in the torture and extrajudicial execution of Jamal Khashoggi"".
Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and critic of the nation's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Riyadh has denied that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing.
The U.N. Committee against Torture, in a letter dated Tuesday and posted online, cited ""serious allegations"" that activists including Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan, Aziza al-Yousef, prominent women's rights campaigner Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sada, Mohammad al-Rabe'a and Ibrahim Modeimigh have been detained without charge in Dhahban prison near Jeddah since May 2018. It said they had suffered ""torture, sexual harassment and other forms of ill-treatment during interrogation"". 
The panel called for their release and that of six other activists, including blogger Raif Badawi - who has been publicly flogged for expressing dissenting opinions online and is serving a 10-year sentence handed down in 2014 for breaking technology laws and insulting Islam. 
Given the serious nature of these cases involving ""reprisals against and harassment, intimidation and arrest of human rights defenders and journalists"", the panel asked the kingdom to provide information within 90 days.
Saudi Arabia should ""acknowledge, in law and in practice, the legitimacy of peaceful criticism and advocacy"", it said.
There was no immediate comment from Saudi authorities. Riyadh has previously denied using torture and said that arrests have been made on the basis of suspicious contacts with foreign entities and offering financial support to ""enemies overseas"".
On Khashoggi, the panel asked whether Saudi Arabia would allow international experts to be involved in the investigation, as requested by both the U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet and Turkey.
Saudi Arabia, which has joined the U.N. treaty banning torture, is obliged to ""ensure that all perpetrators are prosecuted and to ensure that the relatives of the victim obtain redress"", it said. 
U.S. senators briefed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have said they are certain that the Saudi crown prince was responsible for Khashoggi's killing - a view U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is skeptical of. The crown prince has denied knowledge of the operation that killed Khashoggi.
Saud al-Qahtani, his top aide fired for his role in the killing, personally oversaw the torture of at least one detained female activist earlier this year, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters last week.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",'A very uncivil war': Britain's Conservatives on the brink over Brexit,"By Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - The divorce deal British Prime Minister Theresa May agreed with the European Union after months of tortuous negotiations was meant to unite her ruling Conservative Party over Brexit. 
But a month later, rifts over Europe run so deep lawmakers have triggered a leadership contest that some members fear could tear apart a centuries-old institution that has produced prime ministers such as Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.
Divisions over how close Britain should be tied to Europe contributed to the downfall of May's three predecessors: David Cameron, John Major and Thatcher. May will become the next victim if a simple majority of her lawmakers move against her in a confidence vote on her leadership on Wednesday evening.
While a party split may still seem a distant option, former Conservative party leader William Hague and former attorney general Dominic Grieve have both raised the specter of an end to the Conservative Party in its current form.
With her job on the line, May too appealed on Wednesday for an end to the bitter Conservative infighting.
""Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country,"" she said outside her Downing Street office.
As the scheduled date for Britain's departure from the European Union on March 29 draws near, Brexit supporters are doing little to hide their disdain for the government or their pro-EU colleagues - and vice versa.
May and her team are often now described in brutally harsh terms, with some lawmakers feeling betrayed by what one calls the ""sophistry"" of using soundbites and ""clever language"" to cloud what they say is her soft position towards the EU.
""A very uncivil war has broken out,"" one Conservative lawmaker said on condition of anonymity.
He said he had broken a long tradition of having breakfast in the parliament canteen because it had become a ""toxic place"". He now eats in a nearby cafe.
TRENCHANT OPPOSITION
More worrying for May is the lack of trust she now inspires in her so-called backbenchers, the lawmakers she needs to get any legislation, including the Brexit deal, through parliament.
""So many MPs were opposed to the prime minister, and so trenchantly, that it is hard to see them coming to a consensus,"" Hague wrote in pro-Conservative The Telegraph newspaper.
""If they fail to do so, they will have to brace themselves for the divisions among them to be exacerbated by a party leadership election, or a general election, or another referendum campaign or all of those one after the other.""
The Conservative Party, which returned to power in 2010 after more than a decade of Labour Party rule, has been divided over the EU for decades but the 2016 referendum Cameron called to settle the rows for good have only worsened the schisms.
Since the text of a divorce deal was agreed on Nov. 13 setting out the terms on which the country would leave on March 29, positions have hardened among Conservatives. 
Pro-Brexit campaigners accuse May of trying to keep Britain too closely aligned with the EU even after the country leaves when they want a clean break with Brussels.
May's decision to delay a parliamentary vote on the deal this week provoked anger among members because ministers had promised until the very last minute it would go ahead. One had confirmed Britain must push head with the debate just hours before May's U-turn.
""Theresa May's plan would bring down the government if carried forward. But our party will rightly not tolerate it,"" pro-Brexit campaigners Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker said in a statement. ""In the national interest, she must go.""
'FEEDING THIS MONSTER'
Pro-EU Conservatives were equally entrenched with the future of Britain's $2.8 trillion economy at stake in the country's most significant political decision since World War Two.
""I think this is a disgraceful move by a small group of people who are engaging in their ideologically driven self interest,"" Conservative lawmaker Anna Soubry said on Wednesday after the leadership challenge was announced.
""Unfortunately, Theresa has been feeding this monster that now has turned on her to try and, in turn, eat her ... If she doesn't sort these people out, then our party is doomed."" 
For many Brexit supporters, trust in the government has long been undermined. They felt May had taken on their Brexit platform of leaving the EU's single market and customs union when she launched the negotiations to leave.
But that confidence has been whittled away since she lost the party's majority in an election she need not have called in June 2017, with one Brexit supporter saying: ""Since the election ... it's been downhill all the way.""
The Labour Party is now pressing for an election, something several Conservative lawmakers say the squabbling party is far from prepared for. But Labour also is deeply divided over Brexit and some in its ranks say it too would suffer under the spotlight of an election.
Still, the Conservative Party has been disciplined in its pursuit of power, and some say that while the atmosphere is bad at the moment, it may pass when Brexit is over.

""There are some people who disagree profoundly with other people,"" one Conservative lawmaker said. ""You might get one of two disaffected people swanning off, but I don't think it will amount to a split.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korean officials inspected work to ease tension on their militarized border on Wednesday, checking on the demolition of bunkers and probing for secret tunnels, despite scant progress on persuading the North to give up nuclear arms.
The two sides destroyed 11 guard posts within 1 km (0.6 mile) of each side of the heavily fortified border and withdrew equipment and personnel late last month, as a first step in a military pact reached in September between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
""Our verification team brought stethoscope-like equipment to see if there were underground tunnels, but the North side did not stop them nor express discomfort and actively cooperated,"" Moon's spokesman, Kim Eui-kyeom, told a news briefing.
A year ago, such a joint operation by some 77 officials from the two sides would have been unthinkable.
North Korea's repeated missile tests and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September 2017, in defiance of U.N. and U.S. warnings, had stirred fears of war.
But things have changed at a head-spinning pace over the past 12 months.
In a New Year message last year, Kim extended an olive branch to old enemy South Korea, then sent a team to the Winter Olympics there in February, and held three summits with Moon over the course of the year.
Kim also met U.S. President Donald Trump for an unprecedented summit in Singapore in June.
Moon said the removal of the border guard posts and Wednesday's two-way verification exercise marked a ""new milestone"" in the 65-year division of the peninsula.
""It's something we couldn't even imagine in the past that the South and the North build trails in the Demilitarized Zone where they confronted each other, and pull out the guard posts and transparently verify it,"" Moon told aides after watching a broadcast of the inspection.
Live video footage showed soldiers equipped with telescopes and other equipment gathered at the Military Demarcation Line then crossing the border together to visit the demolished posts on both sides.
The soldiers checked that all firearms, personnel and lookout posts were removed, and tunnels and other facilities destroyed, the South's defense ministry said. 
The atmosphere was ""cordial"" and soldiers chatted and shared cigarettes, Moon's spokesman said.
Moon is hoping to host Kim in Seoul for their fourth summit, perhaps as early as this month, but North Korea has been aloof amid stalled nuclear talks with the United States.
North and South Korea are technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Kim and Trump vowed in their June talks in Singapore to work toward denuclearization, but they have made little progress.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Thousands of people held candlelight vigils in New Zealand on Wednesday to mourn a 22-year-old British woman who was killed while she was on a backpacking tour, as the national outpouring of grief focused attention on violence against women. 
Events were held in towns and cities across the country to mourn Grace Millane and other female victims of violence, four days after a man was charged with her murder. 
Auckland's iconic Sky Tower was bathed in white light to commemorate the backpacker, who went missing in New Zealand's largest city on Dec. 1 while on a world tour after finishing university.
In the capital Wellington, the city's mayor and New Zealand's justice minister joined about 500 people who lit candles, sang and prayed in the indigenous Te Reo Maori language. They demanded action on gender-related violence.
""I've been Grace. I've been around the world, I've gone on dates...it really shook me,"" said Katie Brown, who attended the vigil in Wellington.
""It also reminded me of women that have had their lives taken, have been murdered by men and I wanted to honor them too,"" she said.
The shock triggered by the discovery of Millane's body on the outskirts of Auckland on Sunday has fueled a national debate over the country's high rates of violence against women. 
New Zealand has some of worst rates of family and intimate partner violence among the 37 member countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a government report said this week. 
Police in the nation of 4.5 million people are called out to an incident of domestic violence roughly every four minutes, the report said, and at least a third of woman have been subjected to sexual or physical violence. 
The government introduced a law this year requiring companies to give paid leave for employees who faced domestic violence. It also imposed tougher penalties for strangulation, which can lead to more serious violence such as death. 
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, holding back tears, publicly apologized to Millane's family on Monday, describing the country's ""sense of collective shame"".
Police have declined to say whether Millane knew the man charged with her murder, but he had been seen with her in several places before she went missing. 
A judge refused the 26-year-old man's request to suppress his name in media coverage. But the man cannot be named while his lawyer appeals that decision. 
The case has sparked a debate on social media about whether New Zealand was still safe for female backpackers and whether the killing would discourage women from traveling alone.
David Millane said he would return to the United Kingdom with his daughter's body on the weekend.

""We would like to thank the people of New Zealand for their outpouring of love, numerous messages, tributes and compassion,"" Millane said in a statement.

The justice minister will have big powers in appointing the judges and will oversee the courts' budgets. Rights groups said that compromised the separation of the executive and judicial powers in what they see as a further step towards authoritarianism by right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
""(The law) is a serious threat to the rule of law in Hungary and runs counter to values Hungary signed up to when it joined the European Union,"" the rights group Helsinki Committee said in a statement.
""As the Bill undermines the separation of powers, the boundaries between the executive and judicial power in Hungary will be blurred and it could pave the way for the government’s political interference.""
In September the European Parliament voted to impose sanctions on Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption. Hungary rejected the accusations.
The new administrative courts, including a separate new supreme court, will start operating in 2020. 
""Like any other court, public administration courts will be filled with independent judges solely governed by the word of the law,"" the government's spokesman said on his blog.
The government has requested an opinion on the of the Venice Commission, a panel of constitutional law experts of the human rights body Council of Europe, about the legislation. 

The Venice Commission confirmed it has received the request and is expected to adopt an opinion next year. It declined comment on Wednesday.

STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - Security forces searched through eastern France on Wednesday for a man suspected of killing three people in an attack on a Christmas market in Strasbourg and who was known to have been religiously radicalized while in jail. 
With the gunman on the run, France raised its security threat to the highest alert level, strengthening controls on its border with Germany as elite commandos backed by helicopters hunted for the suspect.
French and German agents checked vehicles and trams crossing the Europa Bridge on the Rhine river, along which the Franco-German frontier runs, police said, backing up traffic in both directions. Hundreds of French troops and police were taking part in the manhunt. 
Police identified the suspect as Strasbourg-born Cherif Chekatt, 29, who is on an intelligence services watch list as a potential security risk.
""The hunt continues,"" Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said on France Inter radio. Asked whether the suspect might have left France, he said: ""That cannot be ruled out.""
The gunman struck at about 1900 GMT on Tuesday, just as the picturesque Christmas market in the historic city was shutting down, He shot dead three people and wounded at least 12 others.
He engaged in two brief gunfights with security forces as he evaded a police dragnet and was thought to have been wounded in the exchanges, Nunez said. 
The Paris prosecutor's anti-terrorism unit has taken up the investigation, suggesting that the authorities are treating the shooting as a possible terrorist attack. 
No one has yet claimed responsibility, but the U.S.-based Site intelligence group, which monitors jihadist websites, said Islamic State supporters were celebrating.
Nunez said the suspect Chekatt had spent time in prison in France and Germany.
""It was during these spells in jail that we detected a radicalization in his religious practices. But we there were never signs he was preparing an attack,"" the deputy minister said.
A spokeswoman for Germany's BKA criminal police said Chekatt was deported to France in 2017 and was known to French authorities as a radical Islamist. 
BORDER CONTROLS
The attack took place at a testing time for President Emmanuel Macron, who is struggling to quell a month-long public revolt over high living costs that has spurred the worst public unrest in central Paris since the 1968 student riots.
The revelation that Chekatt was on a security watchlist will raise questions over possible intelligence failures, though some 26,000 individuals suspected of posing a security risk to France are on the ""S File"" list.
Of these, about 10,000 are believed to have been radicalized, sometimes in fundamentalist Salafist Muslim mosques, in jail or abroad. 
Police had raided the suspect's home early on Tuesday in connection with a homicide investigation. Five people were detained and under interrogation as part of that investigation.
More than 600 security forces personell were involved in Wednesday's manhunt in France, as well as border agents in Germany.
At the Europa Bridge, the main border crossing in the region used by commuters traveling in both directions, armed police inspected vehicles. Police were also checking pedestrians and trains arriving in Germany from Strasbourg.
""We cannot predict how long these measures will stay in place,"" a spokeswoman for the German border police Bundespolizei said. ""We don't know where the attacker is and we want to prevent him from entering Germany.""
French Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet told Public Senat television there was no need for the government to declare a state of emergency as new legislation gave police adequate powers to handle the situation.
Secular France has for years grappled with how to respond to both homegrown jihadists and foreign militants following attacks in Paris, Nice, Marseille and beyond.
In 2016, a truck plowed into a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, killing more than 80 people. In November 2015, coordinated Islamist militant attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and other sites in Paris claimed about 130 lives. 
There have also been attacks in Paris on a policeman on the Champs-Elysees avenue, the offices of satirical weekly publication Charlie Hebdo and a kosher store.

A Christmas market in Berlin was the target of an attack on Dec. 19, 2016, in which 12 people were killed and 56 wounded when man drove a truck into a crowd.

Morawiecki's nationalist and eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party has overhauled the judiciary and taken more control over public media - attracting criticism from the EU and from rights groups who have accused Warsaw of undermining the rule of law.
With a year left until national elections, the party has shown signs of rowing back on some of the changes - for example letting Supreme Court judges who had been forced to retire return to work - as it seeks to broaden its support base amid signs that its support might be waning.
""It's been three years since PiS came to power ... and we have seen a decisive change in how economic and social policy is viewed in Poland,"" Morawiecki told lawmakers.
PiS has grown increasingly isolated in the EU because of accusations at home and abroad of a tilt towards authoritarianism.

In recent months, it was also rattled by allegations of corruption at the financial regulator and anger amid some voters over its decision to celebrate Poland's century of independence with far-right groups.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - The regional Supreme Electoral Court building in Bolivia's biggest city was burned down on Tuesday night during a protest against President Evo Morales' bid to seek a fourth term.
The government blamed opposition parties for the attack on the court in Santa Cruz. Opposition groups said it had been razed by thugs that had infiltrated the protests.
Earlier this month, the court ruled Morales is eligible to run for re-election. 
Thousands of university students staged an initially peaceful protest that descended into acts of vandalism, including the destruction of the three-story court building.
One person was killed in a protest last week and the opposition has said demonstrations will continue unless Morales reverses his decision to run.
Morales' own 2009 constitution set a limit of two five-year terms, but he asked voters in a 2016 referendum to let him run again in 2019.
When they said no, Morales convinced the Constitutional Court to let him anyway. The court, consisting of jurists nominated by congressional allies, ruled that term limits were a violation of his human rights. 
The leftist 58-year-old former coca farmer has presided over an economy that has grown by an annual average of 4.6 percent since he took office, more than twice the rate for Latin America. 
But dissatisfaction over the removal of term limits and proposed development of indigenous lands has marred his reputation as a leader emblematic to first peoples' movements worldwide.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 05:03AM ET</span>",Crisis Group says no word from China on detained Canadian employee,"By John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The International Crisis Group (ICG) on Wednesday said it had received no information from Chinese officials about the detention of its employee, former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig, and that it was seeking consular access to him.
The ICG, a think-tank focused on conflict resolution, said in a statement to Reuters Kovrig was detained by state security officials in Beijing on Monday night.
His detention, first reported by Reuters, came after police in Canada arrested the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities, which infuriated Beijing.
The Canadian government said it saw no explicit link to the Huawei case.
Diplomats in China said the apparent involvement of the secretive state security ministry, which engages in domestic counter-espionage work, among other things, suggests the government could be looking at leveling spying accusations.
However, ICG President and Chief Executive Robert Malley said the group did not engage in such activity. 
""I don't want to speculate as to what's behind it but I am prepared to be categorical about what's not behind it, and what's not behind it is any illegal activity or endangering of Chinese national security,"" Malley told Reuters.
""Everything we do is transparent, it's on our website. We don't engage in secretive work, in confidential work.""
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he had nothing he could say on the details of the case. He added the ICG was not registered in China as a non-government organization (NGO) and Kovrig could have broken Chinese law.
""If they are not registered and their workers are in China undertaking activities, then that's already outside of, and breaking, the law, revised just last year, on the management of overseas non-governmental organizations operating in China,"" Lu told reporters.
The ICG must make clear the relevant situation, he said.
""With regards to the group, I must make it clear, that they are not legally registered in China, so if they engaged in that kind of activities, then that's outside Chinese law.""
The Ministry of Public Security, which has oversight over foreign NGOs, did not respond to a request for comment. China's Ministry of State Security has no publicly available contact details. 
The foreign NGO law, which took effect in January, is part of a raft of new national security measures introduced under President Xi Jinping.
""All foreigners that come to China, so long as they respect the law, have nothing to worry about,"" Lu added.
'NO COINCIDENCES'
William Nee, China Researcher for Amnesty International's East Asia Regional Office in Hong Kong, said Kovrig's detention was alarming, especially as it appeared to be the first time the law has been used to detain a foreign NGO worker.
""We need to wait for the official explanation from the Chinese side, but this detention could have a chilling effect on the foreign NGO and business communities in terms of their feeling safe while traveling in China,"" he told Reuters. 
""This comes in the context in which the procedural safeguards in cases deemed to be political by the Chinese authorities are routinely ignored.""
Guy Saint-Jacques, Canada's former ambassador to China, was asked by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp on Tuesday whether the Kovrig detention was a coincidence after the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.
""In China there are no coincidences ... If they want to send you a message, they will send you a message,"" he said.
A Western diplomat in China, who asked not to be identified, was even more blunt: ""This is a political kidnapping.""
China had threatened severe consequences unless Canada released Meng immediately and analysts have said retaliation for the arrest was likely.
Meng was granted bail by a Canadian court late on Tuesday, 10 days after her arrest in Vancouver on U.S. claims that she misled multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions sparked a diplomatic dispute.
Malley said Kovrig, who was based in Hong Kong, had been working on issues related to Chinese foreign policy in Asia and Africa.
""I'm just going to hope that whatever process is under way is going to be a fair one and one that will quickly show that there's nothing against him,"" he said.
The U.S. State Department was considering issuing a travel warning for its citizens, two sources said on Tuesday.

The Canadian government was considering issuing a similar warning, Canada's CTV network said. Reuters was not able to confirm the report.

1384,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 02:47AM ET</span>","On Iraq's border with Syria, Iran-backed militia warily eye U.S. forces","By John Davison
Al-QAIM, Iraq (Reuters) - From a desert hillside guarded by Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitaries, commander Qasim Muslih can spot Islamic State hideouts across the frontier in Syria. But he also keeps a wary eye on U.S. warplanes soaring overhead.
""The Americans are spying on us,"" he said, squinting skywards. ""But we can hold the borders. We'll fight whoever lays a finger on Iraq and its holy shrines."" 
The fighters Muslih commands are part of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a grouping of mostly Shi'ite militias backed by Iran, which the United States regards as the biggest threat to security in the Middle East.
The PMF has been deploying in growing numbers at the border, fearing hundreds of Islamic State militants who fled Iraq are trying to cross back into Iraqi territory. 
The deployment is strengthening the PMF's de facto control over large stretches of the frontier while its leaders are calling for a formal, permanent role securing the border.
But with fewer Sunni militants to contend with on the Iraqi side a year after Baghdad declared victory over IS, many Shi'ite paramilitaries now see the United States as a bigger threat.
The White House has indicated the U.S. military presence is as much about countering Iran's influence as fighting IS, which is also known as ISIS. Asked about the suggestion of spying on the PMF, a coalition spokesman said: ""The Coalition is concerned with the enduring defeat of ISIS.""
As the battle against a mutual foe rumbles on, Washington and Tehran are keeping a close eye on each other in this part of the region, raising the risk of new violence.
The PMF officially became part of Iraq's security forces this year after playing an important role fighting IS.
Factions including Iran-backed groups that fight inside Syria have concentrated their recent build-up around the town of al-Qaim, which was recaptured from IS in November 2017 and was the last IS bastion in Iraq to fall last year.
The PMF control movement in and out of the town near the border with Syria. One commander, Abu Seif al-Tamimi, said the PMF now held a 240-km (150-mile) stretch of frontier in the area.
""We're ready to take over security,"" Muslih said in al-Qaim. ""We liberated these areas and didn't need help from the Americans.""
Military commanders in units not allied with Iran say U.S. air power was crucial to the defeat of IS in a three-year campaign involving the military, Iraqi Kurdish fighters and the PMF.
U.S. forces have kept their bases in place. On the road to al-Qaim, U.S. armored vehicles passed PMF pickup trucks with masked fighters behind machine guns.
'WILD WEST SITUATION'
South of the town there are signs of growing PMF control and an increasingly crowded battlefield. The watchtowers of Iraq's border guard which nominally polices the frontier disappear, and the paramilitaries are the only force. Flags of Shi'ite factions fly at outposts a short drive from a one of the U.S. bases.
In Syria, the U.S. coalition supports Kurdish-led forces who control areas east of the Euphrates and have been fighting off a new IS offensive. In Iraq it supports the Iraqi military.
Fighting the militants on the other side of the river is the Syrian army, backed by Iran, Russia and the PMF, whose elite factions straddle the frontier.
A fighter at one outpost said a U.S. warplane recently made a low pass over their position. ""They're trying to scare us,"" he said.
Tension rose in June when the PMF blamed the United States for the deaths of 22 of its fighters in an air strike near the border and threatened to retaliate.
The U.S. coalition denied involvement in the strike.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said ""outright"" aggression was not expected by Shi'ite militias before IS was fully defeated.
""The question is what are they going to do once things are done,"" the official said.
The build-up of forces already risks a clash even if both sides wish to avoid it, said Philip Smyth, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
""Nearly every major Iranian-backed Shi'ite militia has forces deployed near al-Qaim ... that is the glowing hot dot on the map,"" he said. ""The danger is always there (and) the Americans clearly don't have the forces to handle that. We only have a couple of thousand guys in the area. If the militias want to turn on the problems, they can. It's a Wild West situation.""
Muslih said there were 20,000 fighters deployed near the border under his command, from al-Qaim to areas to the southwest near Jordan, and more reinforcements were ready. The PMF is estimated to have a total of about 150,000 fighters.
Iran is seeking to secure its growing sway over a corridor of territory from Tehran to Beirut.
Washington says it is prepared to counter that with force. ""We're not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies,"" White House national security adviser John Bolton said in September.
POWERFUL POLITICAL ALLIES
The U.S. coalition says it is focused on defeating Islamic State militants who analysts estimate number thousands along the frontier.
""The Coalition has an outstanding relationship with the Iraqi security forces and all decisions are made with close coordination with our partners,"" coalition spokesman Colonel Sean Ryan said.
But those partners do not include the PMF, and this complicates coordination and Washington's relations with Baghdad. The PMF has powerful political allies, some of whom have seats in Iraq's parliament and say they seek an end to the U.S. military presence in Iraq.
""The army coordinates with the U.S. but doesn't understand the threat posed by the American presence,"" Muslih said. 
Qais al-Khazali, a powerful militia leader whose political wing counts 15 parliamentary seats, told Reuters in an interview there was no reason for U.S. combat troops to remain.
Formed in 2014 as an unofficial umbrella group for Shi'ite fighters battling Islamic State, the PMF has always been dominated by factions close to Iran, and now reports to Iraq's prime minister. 
A recent wage increase from the government brought PMF pay into line with that of Iraqi soldiers. Many PMF commanders say they are now funded only by the Iraqi state, but praise Iran for support that has included weapons and advisers.

""Iran sent everything when we needed help,"" Muslih said. ""America is an enemy.""

A joint legislative session voted 235-28 in favor of retaining military rule in Mindanao until the end of 2019, prolonging what was already the country's longest period of martial law since the brutal 1970s era of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
Mindanao's mostly poor Muslim areas have for decades been troubled by banditry, piracy and armed rebellions by separatist and communist militias, some of which have been managed by truces and decentralization moves. 
However, May last year saw the eruption of the country's fiercest conflict since World War Two, when an alliance of extremists seeking to create an Islamic State enclave attacked and held Marawi City through five months of government air strikes and ground offensives.
""Notwithstanding the substantial gains achieved during the martial law period, we cannot turn a blind eye to the reality that Mindanao is in the midst of rebellion,"" Duterte wrote in a letter to Congress.
Duterte's spokesman and the military thanked lawmakers after the vote, and said rights and civil liberties would be preserved under martial law intended to prevent radical groups from expanding beyond Mindanao.
Opposition lawmakers said the extension was unjustified because there was no longer a rebellion to quell.
""It makes me wonder, is this the new normal?"" Senator Franklin Drilon told the session.

Representative Edcel Lagman said what remained of Islamic State's allies in Mindanao were ""quixotic and phantom fighters who are unable to revive a vanquished 'rebellion' or launch a new one.""

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2018 01:46AM ET</span>","Syrian state seizes opponents' property, rights activists say","By Dahlia Nehme
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syria's government has been using a little-known anti-terrorism law to seize property from dissidents and their families as it takes back control of areas that were held by rebel groups, rights groups and some of the people affected say. 
With Syria's conflict stabilized, at least for now, and President Bashar al-Assad back in control of the biggest cities, there is an increasing focus on how he will handle the areas where the 2011 uprising against him flared. 
International attention has focused on policies, such as legislation known as Law 10, that could eventually enable the government to dispossess people in the opposition strongholds worst damaged in the war.
But while Law 10 has not yet been put into effect, the separate anti-terrorism law has already been used to seize property, including from people who had no hand in violence, according to human rights groups. 
One man, an architect who joined street protests against Assad early in the uprising, and posted anti-government material online, lost his house, office and farmland in Ghouta in southwestern Syria as well as his car, he said. 
""I built my house brick by brick. I built it with my bare hands, tended to every corner and to every inch,"" the architect said. He now lives in the northwestern province of Idlib after fleeing with many other Ghouta residents after its surrender in April. 
As they stand to lose property permanently, and because in many cases they have family members still living under government control, none of the six people who spoke to Reuters after being named in seizure orders wanted to be identified. 
Lists circulating online -- which rights groups believe to be accurate -- show that hundreds of such orders have been made, affecting potentially thousands of people. 
SEIZURE
The architect first knew a government security order had targeted him when the Architects and Engineers Syndicate terminated his membership because of a security order and canceled his pension. 
He had joined the protests against Assad early on, but said he never took up arms or played a role in local government in his area of eastern Ghouta, which the army recaptured in April. 
In 2016, he tried to sell his car. ""The broker in Damascus told me that a seizure for security had been imposed on all the properties owned by me, my partners, my wife and children,"" he said via a messaging app. 
The family needed money, so he sold the car for parts for 190,000 Syrian pounds - about $580 at that time. 
When they left for Idlib along with thousands of others as part of a surrender deal with the government covering eastern Ghouta, the family had to abandon their family home, an office and farm land that is now all forfeit to the state. 
""It is hard to describe a house you lived in your whole life and land you planted with trees that you watched grow. I miss the doors, windows and even the doorstep,"" the architect's son said. 
UPRISING
About a year into the uprising, Assad updated Syria's anti-terrorism laws, issuing a decree to give courts the power to impose ""security seizure"" orders against individuals. 
Initially, assets are frozen under these orders, preventing owners from selling, or using them commercially. When the seizures are executed, the state will sell the assets by auction. 
A doctor from the eastern Ghouta town of Douma who left in April and now lives in Turkey said his house, land, clinic and car had been seized. 
""The Syrian regime has labeled all the opposition activists as terrorists, tried them in absentia and seized their properties,"" he said. 
Human Rights Watch (HRW) said orders to freeze assets were among numerous laws the Syrian government used to punish political dissidents and opponents.
Damascus denies targeting peaceful dissidents with its anti-terrorism laws, or unlawfully dispossessing people. The government did not respond to a Reuters request for further comment. 
HRW said it could not verify lists of people affected by the court orders that are circulating online, or the scale of the property freezes. But it said it had confirmed several cases of people whose names it found on one such list. 
Two Syrian rights groups, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Syrian Network for Human Rights, said they had verified numerous cases.
The network said it had registered at least 327 individuals targeted by property seizures from 2014 to 2018. The observatory said it had registered 93 cases of property seizures targeting opposition activists. It was aware of many other cases, but was not able to verify them because those involved were too scared to speak freely, it said. 
FEAR
Those affected, already fearing for their lives if they return after being branded terrorists, also face a loss of property that could discourage family members from going home. 
""They left the people whose property they seized with nothing to return to, not even hope,"" said the architect, who now lives in rebel-held Idlib province with his family. 
Paradoxically, it is often the people who left eastern Ghouta who are in most need of the property they left behind. One man left eastern Ghouta for Idlib and now lives in poverty far from home. 
He cannot find work there and wants to pay smugglers to cross the border into Turkey. But his once rich parents, who stayed in eastern Ghouta, cannot raise the money by selling or renting land because their assets have been frozen.
They found out about the court order before the government retook eastern Ghouta in April. 

""My parents are now guests in their own home. The house they have lived in for their whole lives is now put under seizure by the government because we were opposition activists,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president escalated a conflict with the judiciary on Tuesday, calling the country's supreme court judges the ""best paid public servants in the world,"" after the tribunal froze plans to impose pay cuts on the civil service.
On Friday, the Supreme Court said it had suspended a law stipulating no public servant can earn more than President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has slashed his own pay to 108,000 pesos ($5,331) a month, less than half that of his predecessor.
The veteran leftist, who took office on Dec. 1, has put public sector austerity at the center of his plans to reduce corruption and inequality in Mexico.
Critics including judges say he is trying to undermine independent organs of the state like the court in order to control them. He has denied this.
Lopez Obrador has hit out at the court since it said it would freeze the pay cuts, pending a review.
""I have no doubt that they're the best paid public servants in the world,"" the 65-year-old told a regular morning news conference on Tuesday, repeating that Mexico's judges earn 600,000 pesos ($29,619) a month. Last week, before the court ruling, he described such a salary as tantamount to ""corruption"" in Mexico.
""With all due respect, only Donald Trump earns more than the president of the supreme court,"" he added.
On Twitter, the Supreme Court on Monday dismissed his figures as not ""remotely"" in line with the facts.
It was not immediately clear from publicly available sources exactly how much pay and benefits the judges receive.
According to figures in the 2018 budget, justices appointed before a 2009 law was passed, lowering the judges pay, were entitled to gross compensation - including various benefits - worth about 578,000 pesos a month.
The same budget figures showed justices appointed after that change had their basic entitlement cut by over one-third.
However, a supreme court spokesman said the 10 serving justices earned the same amount - a sum based on the higher pay bracket. Earlier, the court spokesman said the eight justices appointed after the change of the law received the lower salary.
The spokesman could not immediately account for the discrepancy.
After Trump was elected U.S. president in November 2016, he pledged to give up his presidential salary of $400,000 per year before taxes.
According to the U.S. Federal Judicial Center, the salary of the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court was $267,000 as of Jan. 1, 2018 and Associate Justices of the court, $255,300.
On Monday, Mexico's national association of magistrates and judges issued a public statement condemning the criticism of the judiciary as an attempt to ""weaken the system of checks and balances on our democracy and damage the rule of law.""
Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) said on Tuesday it had filed a complaint to try to stop the decision to suspend the pay cuts. They hope to overturn the ruling before Dec. 15, when the government will present its 2019 budget.
Support for the judges is by no means solid in a country where many serious crimes go unpunished.

A 2013 study by watchdog Transparency International found 80 percent of respondents viewed the judiciary as corrupt in Mexico. Still, political parties and members of Congress fared even worse.

STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - A gunman on a security watchlist killed three people and wounded a dozen others near the picturesque Christmas market in the historic French city of Strasbourg on Tuesday evening before fleeing.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the shooter had evaded a police dragnet and was on the run, raising concerns of a follow-up attack. 
""The government has raised its security threat to the highest level and is bolstering border controls,"" Castaner told a late-night news conference. ""We will also reinforce security at all Christmas markets to prevent copycat attacks.""
With France still on high alert after a wave of attacks commissioned or inspired by Islamic State militants since early 2015, the counter-terrorism prosecutor opened an investigation.
Police identified the suspect as Strasbourg-born Cherif Chekatt, 29, who was known to the intelligence services as a potential security risk.
Castaner said the gunman exchanged shots with security forces twice as he escaped. His whereabouts now were unknown, and elite commandos and helicopters were involved in the manhunt. 
The Paris prosecutor said the motive for the attack was not known. No one immediately claimed responsibility, but the U.S.-based Site intelligence group, which monitors jihadist websites, said Islamic State supporters were celebrating.
The attack began at about 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) as stallholders prepared to close down and restaurants filled in the city, which sits across the Rhine River from Germany. Bystanders were swiftly ushered into nearby shops.
""There was confusion initially but they locked the front doors pretty soon after the gunshots,"" said U.S. citizen Elizabeth Osterwisch, who was sheltering on the top floor of the Galeries Lafayette department store. ""They moved us several times, eventually settling on the place with the most protection.""
European Parliament lawmaker Emmanuel Maurel said he had heard the shots.
""From my hotel window I saw passersby dragging someone who was injured and onlookers panicking,"" he tweeted. ""Soldiers and police have cordoned off the area. We're being told to stay in the hotel.""
CHRISTMAS MARKET SECURITY
The European Parliament, which is sitting in Strasbourg this week, was put into lockdown.
On the opposite side of the Rhine river German police also tightened border controls, officials said.
The Strasbourg prefecture said the gunman was on an intelligence services watchlist.
Sources familiar with the police operation said the suspect's home had been raided earlier in the day in connection with a robbery during the summer, but he was not found there.
A Reuters reporter was among 30 to 40 people being held in the basement of a supermarket for their own safety, waiting for police to clear the area. Lights were switched off and bottles of water handed out.
Security was tight this year for the Christmas market, which is popular with visitors to the city's old quarter, with its Gothic cathedral and half-timbered houses.
Unauthorized vehicles were excluded from surrounding streets during opening hours and checkpoints were set up on bridges and access points to search pedestrians' bags.
President Emmanuel Macron was being updated on events, an Elysee Palace official said. Castaner was on his way to Strasbourg.
ATTACK FEARS
Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the European Commission, the EU executive body, tweeted: ""My thoughts are with the victims of the Strasbourg shooting, which I condemn with the utmost firmness. Strasbourg is an excellent symbol of peace and European Democracy. Values that we will always defend.""
British Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""shocked and saddened."" 
Some 26,000 individuals suspected of posing a security risk to France are on the ""S File"" watchlist, of whom about 10,000 are believed to have been radicalized, sometimes in fundamentalist Salafist Muslim mosques, online or abroad. 
European security agencies have feared for some time that Islamist militants who left Europe to fight for Islamic State in Syria and Iraq would return after the jihadist group's defeat, with the skills and motivation to carry out attacks at home.
Secular France has been grappling with how to respond to both homegrown jihadists and foreign militants following attacks in Paris, Nice, Marseille and beyond since 2015. 
In 2016, a truck plowed into a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, killing more than 80 people. In November 2015, coordinated Islamist militant attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and other sites in Paris claimed about 130 lives. There have also been attacks in Paris on a policeman on the Champs-Elysees avenue, the offices of satirical weekly publication Charlie Hebdo and a kosher store.

Almost exactly two years ago, a Tunisian Islamist rammed a hijacked truck into a Christmas market in central Berlin, killing 11 people as well as the driver.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 07:55PM ET</span>","Trump awarded nearly $300,000 in legal fees in Daniels defamation lawsuit","By Alex Dobuzinskis
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Adult film actress Stormy Daniels must pay more than $290,000 to reimburse President Donald Trump for legal fees he spent defending himself in a defamation lawsuit she brought against him over a tweet, a judge ruled on Tuesday. 
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, lost her defamation lawsuit in October, with a federal judge in Los Angeles saying the president's tweet was protected by the freedom of speech clause of the U.S. Constitution.
Following that ruling, Trump's attorneys at a hearing last week requested nearly $800,000 in legal fees and sanctions, but U.S. District Judge James Otero in his latest ruling awarded a fraction of the sum.
Otero's ruling awarded Trump most of the legal costs his attorneys had sought, but only $1,000 in sanctions.
""The court's order, along with the court's prior order dismissing Stormy Daniels' defamation case against the president, together constitute a total victory for the president, and a total defeat for Stormy Daniels in this case,"" Charles Harder, an attorney for Trump, said in a statement.
Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, in a statement suggested the attorneys' fees in the defamation case were of small importance in Daniels' broader litigation battle with Trump.
Daniels, who has written a ""tell-all"" book about Trump called ""Full Disclosure,"" has separate from the defamation lawsuit gone to court to challenge the validity of a $130,000 hush money agreement over a tryst she claimed she and Trump had more than a decade ago.
Trump has denied he had an affair with Daniels, saying she was paid to stop ""false and extortionist accusations.""

Daniels sued Trump for defamation after he denied her assertion that she had a sexual encounter with him in 2006 and disputed her account that she was threatened in 2011 for agreeing to a press interview about the alleged encounter.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday to let his order barring asylum for immigrants who enter the United States illegally take effect even as litigation over the matter proceeds.
The U.S. Justice Department asked the court to lift a temporary restraining order against the asylum rules issued by San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar. Trump has taken a hard line toward legal and illegal immigration since taking office last year.
Citing what he called an overwhelmed immigration system, Trump issued a proclamation on Nov. 9 that authorities process asylum claims only for migrants crossing the southern U.S. border at an official port of entry. Tigar blocked the rules on Nov. 19, drawing Trump's ire.
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused on Friday to lift Tigar's injunction pending an appeal by the administration, saying the government ""has not established that it is likely to prevail.""
The Justice Department said in its request to the Supreme Court that the injunction frustrated the government's effort to re-establish control over the southern border and reduce illegal crossings. 
Trump issued his proclamation alongside a new administration rule that effectively prohibited asylum for migrants crossing from Mexico outside a port of entry. The policy came as the government sought ways to block thousands of Central Americans traveling in caravans to escape violence and poverty at home from entering the United States. 
Immigrant rights groups immediately sued, arguing the policy violated federal immigration and administrative law. 
In his ruling, Tigar said Congress clearly mandated that immigrants were eligible for asylum regardless of where they enter the country.
The ruling prompted Trump to blast the 9th Circuit as a ""disgrace"" and dismiss Tigar as an ""Obama judge."" Tigar was appointed to the bench by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.
That criticism led to an extraordinary rebuke by U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, who issued a public response to Trump. 

""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,"" said Roberts, a conservative who was appointed by Republican former President George W. Bush.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 05:13PM ET</span>",Ex-Ford Argentina executives convicted in torture case; victims may sue in U.S.,"By Cassandra Garrison and Nicolás Misculin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - An Argentine court on Tuesday convicted two former executives of a local  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) plant of involvement in the torture of workers during the country's dictatorship in the 1970s, victims' lawyers said, adding they may sue Ford in U.S. federal court.
It is the first time former executives of a multinational company working in Argentina during the dictatorship have been convicted of crimes against humanity, one of the lawyers, Tomas Ojea Quintana, told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""It is clear that Ford Motor Company had control of the Argentinian subsidiary during the '70s. Therefore, there is a direct responsibility of Ford Motor Company and that might give us the possibility to bring the case to the U.S. courts,"" Ojea Quintana said.
Ford Argentina said in a statement it was not part of the case and had participated fully with prosecutors. Ford officials in the United States could not immediately be reached for comment.
Legal experts said the Argentinian Ford workers would face an uphill battle in bringing a successful U.S. lawsuit. 
The case concerns the 1976 kidnapping and torture of 24 workers employed by Ford at their factory on the outskirts of Buenos Aires during the 1976-83 military dictatorship.
Former local Ford executives Pedro Muller and Hector Sibilla were sentenced to 10 and 12 years in prison, respectively, for their involvement in the crimes, Elizabeth Gomez Alcorta, a lawyer representing the victims, told Reuters after the sentencing.
Muller and Sibilla were accused of providing photographs, home addresses and other personal data of the victims to agents of the dictatorship so they could be abducted.
The duo also ""allowed a detention center to be set up inside the premises of that factory, in the recreational area, so that the abductees could be interrogated,"" according to court papers.
""There they were handcuffed, beaten and had their faces covered so they could not see who was interrogating then,"" the accusation against Muller and Sibilla said.
Family members of victims linked arms and held photos of their relatives as the verdict was announced. Some held or wore white scarves, an emblem of Argentina's Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, an association of women whose children disappeared during the Dirty War.
Some 30,000 people were killed during the dictatorship, according to figures from human rights organizations. Many of the victims were abducted, tortured and even thrown from helicopters while still alive into the sea.
In the Ford case, Kevin Clermont, a law professor at Cornell University, said the victims would have a “real problem” to overcome the U.S. statute of limitations in a civil lawsuit, which usually allows claims only up to six years.
Foreign nationals can sue in U.S. courts, but several decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court over the past years have made it harder for plaintiffs to sue corporations for alleged violations abroad.
A 2013 Supreme Court decision held that plaintiffs have to show their claim “touches and concerns” the United States, a high bar to clear, legal experts said.

The workers would need to prove that the actions of the Argentinian subsidiary were “completely controlled” by Ford’s U.S. parent, a fact that is hard to show in most cases, said Ralph Steinhardt, a law professor at the George Washington University.

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 05:13PM ET</span>",Egyptian lawyer held for wearing yellow vest as sales restricted: activist,"By Mohamed Abdellah
CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian prosecutor ordered on Tuesday that a lawyer be detained for 15 days after the publication of a picture of him wearing a yellow vest similar to those worn by protesters in France, a local rights activist said.
The arrest in the northern city of Alexandria came as traders said authorities were blocking the sale of the vests to forestall any copycat protests ahead of the Jan. 25 anniversary of Egypt's 2011 uprising. 
Since the election of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in 2014, Egypt has seen a crackdown on political opposition and dissent that activists say is the most severe for decades.
The yellow safety vests have been the trademark of French demonstrators whose violent weekend protests since Nov. 17 forced President Emmanuel Macron to cancel planned fuel tax increases and grant wage rises for the poor.
Alexandria's public prosecutor ordered the detention of rights lawyer Mohamed Ramadan after the publication of a picture of him sporting a yellow vest in solidarity with the French protesters, said Mahienour El Masry, an activist in the city.
Authorities considered the photo an incitement to hold similar protests, she said, adding that Ramadan was also accused of charges including ""spreading false news"" and ""spreading the ideology of a terrorist group"".
Two security sources said Ramadan had been found in possession of eight such vests. The Alexandria prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In downtown Cairo traders said they had been stopped from selling the vests to walk-in customers.
""They made us sign statements that we won't sell yellow vests,"" said one trader who like others declined to give his name. ""Anyone who sells a single vest will put himself in big trouble.""
He refused to sell any of the yellow vests in his shop window, which were priced at just over $1. ""Now they're for display only,"" he said. 
UPRISING ANNIVERSARY
An employee at another downtown shop said the restriction on selling the vests had started on Saturday and would continue until Jan. 25, the eighth anniversary of the popular uprising that toppled then-president Hosni Mubarak.
At a third shop, a worker said the vests could only be supplied for commercial orders.
Security sources confirmed that authorities had prevented industrial security suppliers from selling the yellow vests. 
""It is a question of caution, rather than fear,"" said one of the sources, when asked if authorities were afraid of protests ahead of the anniversary.
In the crackdown since Sisi's 2014 election, thousands of his opponents and critics as well as alleged Islamist militants and secular rights activists have been arrested.
Sisi's backers say he is working to keep Egypt stable as it recovers from political turmoil after the 2011 uprising and tackles deep economic challenges. 
One activist contacted by Reuters said spontaneous protests such as those in France were now impossible in Egypt.
""Opposition political movements do not have a presence on the ground and current political parties are part of the regime,"" said the activist, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Mustafa.

""More importantly, the location of all activists is now known...They are either in prison or in their houses subject to police supervision.""

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 04:52PM ET</span>",U.N. proposes Yemen's warring parties pull out of key port: sources,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi
RIMBO, Sweden (Reuters) - The United Nations proposed at initial talks between Yemen's warring parties on Tuesday that they withdraw from the contested port city of Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions facing famine, and place it under the control of an interim entity.
It was not clear if the Iran-aligned Houthi movement and the Saudi-backed Yemeni government would accept the proposal made at peace talks in Sweden that aim to avert a full-scale assault on Hodeidah, now a focus of the nearly four-year-old war. 
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres will attend the closing of the talks on Thursday to meet with both delegations and support his Yemen special envoy's efforts, a U.N. spokesman said. Another round could be held in early 2019.
After the two sides agreed to exchange around 15,000 prisoners, the consultations revolve around thornier issues such as the status of Hodeidah and the reopening of Sanaa airport.
The Houthis control most population centers in Yemen, including Hodeidah - with coalition forces massed on its outskirts - and the capital Sanaa, from which the group ousted the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in 2014.
Another three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters that the proposal presented by U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths envisions a ""joint committee or independent entity"" be set up to manage the city and port after both sides withdraw. 
U.N. monitors could be deployed in Hodeidah, they said, adding that discussions were continuing.
The United Nations declined to comment. The two parties could not be immediately reached to respond to the proposal.
Yemeni Foreign Minister Khalid al Yamani, who is heading the internationally recognized government’s delegation to the peace talks, said on Monday that Hodeidah should be placed under Interior Ministry control as a matter of sovereignty.
Both parties have agreed to a U.N. role in the Red Sea port, the entry point for most of Yemen's commercial goods and vital aid, but differ on who should run the city itself. The Houthis say Hodeidah should be declared a neutral zone.
WESTERN PRESSURE
Western allies are pressing Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, leaders of the coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 to restore Hadi's government, to end a war that has pushed the long impoverished nation to the verge of famine. 
Ambassadors of the five permanent member states of the U.N. Security Council are present at the talks and were pressing the parties to agree to the Hodeidah proposal, the sources said.
A source in the government team said Griffiths brought the heads of the two delegations together for the first time in a meeting attended by the ambassadors.
Griffiths wants agreement on confidence-building steps and a transitional governing body ahead of political negotiations to end the conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of people.
The two sides on Tuesday exchanged lists of some 15,000 prisoners for a swap agreed at the start of the talks.
Delegates said the swap would be conducted via Houthi-held Sanaa airport in north Yemen and government-held Sayun airport in the south - a process overseen by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
""We have exchanged more than 7,000 names from each side, including some 200 high-ranking officers,"" said Ghaleb Mutlaq, a Houthi delegate. 
Hadi's foreign minister said the government had submitted a list of 8,576 prisoners, including activists and journalists. 
Johannes Bruwer, the outgoing ICRC head of delegation in Yemen, said in Geneva the exchange would take weeks and might involve the repatriation of third-country nationals.
The parties have also yet to agree on shoring up the central bank. Most basic commodities are out of reach of millions.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE want to exit a conflict that has become very costly and is bogged down in stalemate, with pressure for a peace deal rising among Western allies, some of which supply them with arms and intelligence.

Yemen's war is widely regarded in the Middle East as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort told a U.S. judge on Tuesday they needed more time to evaluate prosecutors' allegations that Manafort lied to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team and breached his plea deal.
During a U.S. District Court hearing in Washington, Manafort's lawyer Richard Westling said the defense team had learned more details earlier in the day about the allegations and was not sure yet if any of the issues were in dispute.
Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered the defense to file a response by Jan. 7 raising any concerns, and tentatively set a hearing for Jan. 25. Westling said he was not sure if a hearing would be necessary.
Mueller's team in November accused Manafort of breaching a plea agreement reached two months earlier by lying repeatedly to investigators, and prosecutors on Friday for the first time provided details to back up their assertion.
They said Manafort among other things lied about interactions with a former business partner named Konstantin Kilimnik accused by prosecutors of having ties to Russian intelligence, and about contacts with Trump administration officials after being charged by Mueller.
Manafort, who earned millions of dollars for his political consulting work for Ukraine's former pro-Russia government, has emerged as a key figure in Mueller's ongoing investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election and whether Trump's campaign conspired with Moscow's operations.
The judge said the prosecution's submission lacked ""sufficient information"" to help inform her decision on whether Manafort did lie and breach his deal. Westling said he agreed.
Asked by Jackson whether the defense team agrees with the basic facts in the Mueller team's filing, Westling said he still could not say.
""We had a conversation with the government earlier today where they were more forthcoming ... and I think we can continue to work through getting the detail we need to be able to answer that question,"" Westling said.
Mueller's investigation, which threatens Trump's presidency, has led to guilty pleas by a series of former Trump aides and criminal charges against a variety of Russian individuals and entities. Trump has called the investigation a witch hunt and has denied colluding with Russia.
Prosecutors said in Friday's filing Manafort falsely denied trying to contact administration officials either directly or indirectly, but they uncovered evidence showing he was in touch with one senior official through February 2018 and authorized another person to contact the administration on his behalf.
Many of the details of his alleged lies, particularly relating to Kilimnik, were heavily redacted from the filing.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 04:35PM ET</span>",Nigerian opposition candidate absent from election accord ceremony,"By Felix Onuah and Camillus Eboh
ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's main opposition candidate did not attend an event on Tuesday to sign an election agreement stating a commitment to hold a peaceful election early next year due to a ""communication lapse"", his party said.
The opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) confirmed in an emailed statement on Tuesday that its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, had not participated in the signing ahead of February's election. President Muhammadu Buhari attended the event in the capital, Abuja. 
The peace accord ceremony was held days after the PDP said authorities had frozen the bank accounts of its vice presidential candidate, Peter Obi.
Elections to choose the leader of Africa's most populous country - the continent's top oil producer and by many measures its largest economy - have in the past been marred by violence, vote-rigging and voter intimidation.
The ceremony was an attempt to mirror the signing of an acclaimed deal ahead of voting in 2015, when Buhari came to power. It was credited with helping prevent a repeat of violence in the wake of the 2011 election which Human Rights Watch said killed 800 people and displaced 65,000. 
The accord aims to ensure that the 2019 elections are ""free, fair and credible,"" the document said. Signatories pledged that their campaigns would refrain from ""religious incitement"" and ""ethnic or tribal profiling"", and that they would not incite violence, according to the document.
The PDP said it was investigating the circumstances behind the ""unfortunate communication lapse"" between party officials and the National Peace Committee (NPC), the non-governmental organization that arranged the event, which resulted in Abubakar's absence.
""Our presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar and the party are fully committed to a peaceful electoral process and elections in 2019,"" said PDP spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan in an emailed statement. 
He said the PDP would visit the NPC office to ""fulfill all necessary obligations toward the peace accord ahead of the 2019 general elections"". 
The NPC earlier said it had sent invitations for the event to all 91 registered parties and the 73 presidential candidates.

Independent observers for the 2015 race, the first time the agreement was signed, have since praised the accord for helping Nigeria pull off its first-ever peaceful transition from the ruling party to the opposition. Buhari defeated the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan.

Police identified the shooter as Euler Fernando Gandolfo, 49, a systems analyst with no criminal record. 
Gandolfo entered the cathedral and sat down among mainly elderly worshippers who remained to pray after midday mass.
""I suddenly saw a man stand up, take position in front of a couple and shoot them point blank. I ran out fast and he continued firing, many shots,"" said Pedro Rodrigues, a 66-year-old retiree.
""It was frightful,"" said another witness, Alexandre Moraes, on GloboNews channel. ""He shot randomly at people. They were all praying.""
Campinas police chief Jose Henrique Ventura said security cameras showed Gandolfo walk into the cathedral and sit down. A little later he started shooting at people.
Police in the plaza outside rushed in when they heard the shots, Ventura told a news conference.
The gunman ran to the altar while firing at police and was hit in the side. He fell to ground and shot himself in the head, Ventura said. Gandolfo had two guns with 28 rounds left when he died.
Four people were shot dead and four others were wounded, but Ventura said they were out of danger in a hospital in Campinas, an industrial city 100 kilometers (62 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo. 
Police have not established a motive.
Brazil had nearly 64,000 murders last year - more than any other country, according to the United Nations. However, random mass shootings are relatively rare, with few American-style shootings in schools or other public areas.
The rise in armed violence helped far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro win October's presidential election, vowing to crack down on corruption, drug gangs and crime in the streets of Brazilian cities.

Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, plans to ease gun laws to allow Brazilians to arm themselves against criminals, a policy his critics say will only increase the murder rate.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (Reuters) - A Virginia jury on Tuesday sentenced to life in prison a self-described neo-Nazi who killed a woman when he rammed his car into a crowd protesting two days of white supremacist rallies in the college town of Charlottesville.
The Charlottesville, Virginia, jury urged a judge to send James Fields, 21, to prison for the rest of his life four days after finding the Ohio man guilty of first-degree murder and nine other crimes for killing Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 19 people after the ""Unite the Right"" gathering in August 2017.
The event proved a critical moment in the rise of the ""alt-right,"" a loose alignment of fringe groups centered on white nationalism and emboldened by President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential victory. 
Trump was criticized from the left and right for initially saying there were ""fine people on both sides"" of a dispute between neo-Nazis and their opponents, and subsequent alt-right gatherings failed to draw the crowds of hundreds of people that assembled in Charlottesville.
Fields sat impassively, dressed in a light blue sweater and black-rimmed glasses, during Tuesday's sentencing.
Judge Richard Moore said he will decide whether to accept the jury's recommendation at a March 29 hearing. In addition to a life term for murder, the jury suggested a total of 419 years in prison for the nine other crimes Fields was convicted of.
Heyer's mother, Susan Bro, tearfully told the jurors on Monday that her daughter's message of tolerance would live on.
""I trusted the system of justice to handle what it needed to handle,"" Bro told reporters after Tuesday's decision was announced. ""I was not going to be consumed by hatred for this young man.""
Fields' attorneys, who did not speak to reporters after Tuesday's court session, never disputed that Fields accelerated his Dodge Charger into a group of counter-protesters, sending bodies flying. The lawyers instead suggested that he felt intimidated by a hostile crowd and acted to protect himself.
Fields, a resident of Maumee, Ohio, was photographed hours before the attack carrying a shield with the emblem of a far-right hate group. He has identified himself as a neo-Nazi.

He also faces separate federal hate-crime charges, which carry a potential death sentence. He has pleaded not guilty in that case.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 02:22PM ET</span>","Russian nuclear-capable bomber aircraft fly to Venezuela, angering U.S.","By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two Russian strategic bomber aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons have landed in ally Venezuela, a show of support for Venezuela's socialist government that has infuriated Washington.
The TU-160 supersonic bombers, known as ""White Swans"" by Russian pilots, landed at Maiquetia airport near capital Caracas on Monday after covering more than 10,000 km (6,200 miles), the Russian and Venezuelan governments said. 
Their deployment came days after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose left-wing administration is the most significant U.S. foe in Latin America, held talks with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
As OPEC member Venezuela's socialist-run economy implodes, Russia has become a key lender of last resort, investing in its oil industry and providing support to its military. 
Capable of carrying short-range nuclear missiles, the planes can fly over 12,000 km (7,500 miles) without re-fuelling and have landed in Venezuela twice before in the last decade. 
""Russia's government has sent bombers halfway around the world to Venezuela,"" fumed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Twitter. 
""The Russian and Venezuelan people should see this for what it is: two corrupt governments squandering public funds, and squelching liberty and freedom while their people suffer."" 
'HIGHLY UNDIPLOMATIC'
The Kremlin on Tuesday rejected Pompeo's criticism, saying it was ""highly undiplomatic"" and ""completely inappropriate.""
""As for the idea that we are squandering money, we do not agree. It's not really appropriate for a country half of whose defense budget could feed the whole of Africa to be making such statements,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Russia's Defence Ministry, which said the bombers had been accompanied by two other Russian military planes, did not say if the planes were carrying missiles, how long they would stay for, or what their mission was.
Russia has used them in the past to flex its military muscles under the nose of the United States, delighting Venezuelan officials who have cast such flights as evidence it is able to defend itself, with allies' help, from any attack.
Maduro frequently invokes the possibility of a U.S. invasion in the South American nation, a notion U.S. President Donald Trump's administration denies.
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza called Pompeo's comments ""not only disrespectful, but cynical,"" highlighting the number of military bases the United States owns abroad.
""It's strange the U.S. government questions our right to cooperate on defense and security with other countries, when @realDonaldTrump publicly threatens us with a military invasion,"" Arreaza tweeted, referring to Trump's Twitter handle.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for details on the bombers.
Maduro said the talks with Putin in Moscow this month yielded Russian investment in Venezuela's oil and gold sectors. 

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told his Venezuelan counterpart at the time that such long-range flights provided pilots with excellent experience and helped maintain the planes' combat readiness.

PARIS (Reuters) - France is on course to overshoot the European Union's budget deficit ceiling next year without new spending cuts after President Emmanuel Macron caved in to anti-government street protests.
Macron announced wage increases for the poorest workers and a tax cut for most pensioners on Monday to defuse discontent, leaving his government scrambling to come up with extra budget savings or risk blowing through the EU's 3 percent of GDP limit.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe was due on Tuesday to address parliament to detail how the measures will be financed in a redraft of the budget weeks before it takes effect.

""Under all likelihood, the 2019 public deficit will print above the 3.0 percent benchmark,""  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) economist Michel Martinez wrote in a research note.
However, the deficit was unlikely to hit 3.5 percent, as some French media suggested, because the government would look to offset the extra strain on the budget, he said.
Any failure to respect the EU deficit ceiling could shatter France's fiscal credibility with its European partners after flouting it for a decade before Macron took office.
Equally, any sign of leniency could at the same time complicate the Commission's already tense discussions with Rome about keeping its deficit down.
""There is a very strong interest to put Italy and France in the same pot,"" one EU official told Reuters. 
""In Italy they themselves are planning this very blunt breach. The situation in France serves their purpose, they will say they are preventing social unrest like in France and they will say: what about equal treatment?""
His concessions to protesters have put pressure on French bond yields with the spread over German yields spiking up to the highest level since May 2017. 
The measures announced by Macron on Monday would put a 8-10 billion euro ($9.1-11.4 billion) hole in the budget, ministers said, on top of the 4 billion euros lost after Macron scrapped hikes to fuel taxes in a first wave of concessions last week. 
""We are going to make savings, just as we have said we would, starting with savings in government and that's for us to make happen,"" government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux.
In its original 2019 budget, the government targeted a public deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP. That, though, was based on a growth estimate of 1.7 percent, which now looks increasingly optimistic as the economy slows in the face of the protests.
However, the 2019 deficit would have been only 1.9 percent without the long-planned one-off impact of a payroll tax rebate scheme becoming a permanent tax cut at a cost of 20 billion euros.
Asked whether the budget deficit would be kept below the EU limit, an Elysee official said on Monday France had some wiggle room on spending if the tax rebate was not taken into account.

Nonetheless, France faces tougher scrutiny from the European Commission, which is likely to demand firm commitments to reforms for any leeway.

The colorful and peaceful protest, which has been going on for a week outside the education ministry, is a rare spontaneous show of anger in a country where rallies are usually organized by political parties.
The protest puts pressure on Socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama whose offers for talks have been rejected.
""Once our eight demands are met, we can have dialogue. There will be no dialogue before that,"" a female student told a live broadcast. Those demands include doubling university funding, better student representation, more money for research and better accommodation.
Rama told the protesters in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post: ""I will be waiting for you at any hour and I am willing to work with you, not only to respond to your 8 requests, but also to turn this moment into a new, transformative phase for the universities.""
A 21-year-old third-year IT student, Ledion Mema, carried a poster showing Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler and Education Minister Lindita Nikolla captioned: ""No can win a war in winter"".

""I am here because the fees are too high and I also want better conditions in class. I rarely use computers ... and we are still taught with chalk on a blackboard,"" Mema told Reuters.

Palestinian medics said 22-year-old Mohammed Habali suffered a bullet wound to the head in Tulkarm. A military spokeswoman said at the time that soldiers resorted to live fire after first trying less lethal methods against ""a violent riot ... in which dozens of Palestinians hurled rocks"".
In the video published by rights group B'Tselem, a man is seen collapsing in a street. Footage from different cameras, and which B'Tselem said it synchronized with the first, shows troops crouching behind a car, two of them apparently aiming rifles. 
The felled man cradles what appears to be a stick under his right arm and several other men are seen scattering around the time that he falls. The more than minute-long video clip does not show any of them throwing rocks at troops, nor any rocks on the tarmac.
Responding to B'Tselem's findings, the Israeli military repeated its original account of violence by the Palestinians in Tulkarm, adding that the shooting was under investigation. 
Israeli troops frequently mount raids in the West Bank, where violence has simmered over long-stalled Palestinian statehood talks. 
Rights groups have often accused the Israeli military of excessive force and lax handling of such allegations. Israel says its armed forces are kept to a high ethical standard. 
""It stands to reason ... that the killing of Mohammed Habali, just like so many cases in the past, will be followed by an investigation that comes to nothing, that the incident will be whitewashed and criticism silenced,"" B'Tselem said in a statement. 
Habali's relatives confirmed to Reuters that he was the man seen in the B'Tselem video. The stick he was carrying was a broom, they said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The identity card, issued more than three decades ago by East Germany's Stasi secret police, would be of little interest were it not for the name of the man staring out: Vladimir Putin.
The card was issued in 1986 when Putin was a mid-ranking KGB spy stationed in Dresden in communist East Germany, then under Russian occupation. It has lain in archives since at least 1990, when the two Germanys were reunified.
Found in archives by U.S. historian Douglas Selvage, the card was trumpeted on Tuesday by Bild newspaper as evidence Russia's now long-serving president was also working for the hated East German security service, wound up in 1990.
Bearing the serial number B 217590, the card bears Putin's signature next to the black-and-white photograph of a tie-clad young man. On the reverse side, quarterly stamps show it remained in use to the final quarter of 1989, when spreading protests precipitated East Germany's final collapse.
In a statement, the authority in charge of the Stasi archives said it was common for KGB agents stationed in the fraternal socialist German Democratic Republic to be issued passes giving them entry to Stasi offices.
""It allowed KGB representatives to access regional offices of the Ministry for State Security (Stasi),"" the statement read. ""That went also for Vladimir Putin, who then worked in the KGB office in Dresden... There is no evidence he worked for the Stasi.""
Asked about the report on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters there would be nothing unusual in Putin having such a card.
""As is well known at the time when the Soviet Union existed, the KGB and the Stasi were partner intelligence agencies so you probably can't rule out an exchange of such identity cards,"" he said.
Putin worked for the KGB in Dresden from 1985 to 1990. 
When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Putin, who held the rank of major, said he brandished a pistol to stop an angry crowd from ransacking his intelligence agency's offices in Dresden and purloining its files, a tactic that worked. 
A fluent German speaker, his work there included recruiting informants and saw him promoted twice. Before he left, Putin said he and others burned reams of secret KGB files.

Putin went on to head Russia's FSB, the main successor agency to the KGB, before assuming the presidency in 2000.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Two launch units for anti-tank guided missiles recovered by a Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen appear to have been manufactured in Iran during 2016 and 2017, according to a confidential United Nations report seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
But U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres does not specifically state whether the discovery of the units in Yemen was a violation of a U.N. resolution that took effect in January 2016. It prevents Iran from importing and exporting arms or related materiel unless the Security Council has given approval.
""The Secretariat found that they had characteristics of Iranian manufacture and that their markings indicated production dates in 2016 and 2017,"" Guterres said in his biannual report to the Security Council on the implementation of sanctions on Iran.
""The Secretariat also examined a partly disassembled surface-to-air missile seized by the Saudi-led coalition and observed that its features appeared to be consistent with those of an Iranian missile,"" he wrote. 
A proxy war is playing out in Yemen between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-allied Houthis. The Houthis have been subject to a separate arms embargo since 2015. Iran has repeatedly denied supplying weapons to the Houthis.
The U.N. Security Council is due to discuss the latest report from Guterres on Wednesday, diplomats said. 
The United States has loudly and unsuccessfully pushed the United Nations to hold Iran accountable over accusations it is meddling in the wars in Syria and Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East. In February Russia vetoed a Western attempt to have the Security Council call out Tehran in a resolution on Yemen. 
Guterres also said the United Nations had also examined the debris of three more ballistic missiles fired at Saudi Arabia on March 25 and April 11, 2018, and found ""specific key design features consistent with those of the Iranian Qiam-1 short-range ballistic missile."" However, it could not determine if it was a violation as it was unknown when they were transferred to Yemen.
He said the United Nations ""is still working on establishing the production date range of guidance subcomponents with the assistance of the foreign manufacturers."" 
In his June report, Guterres said debris from five missiles fired at Saudi Arabia by the Houthis since July 2017 ""share key design features with a known type of missile"" manufactured by Iran and some components were manufactured in Iran, but also could not determine when they were transferred to Yemen. 
Most U.N. sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted in January 2016 when the U.N. nuclear watchdog confirmed that Tehran fulfilled commitments under a nuclear deal with Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia and the United States. But Iran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo and other restrictions.
The U.N. sanctions and restrictions on Iran are contained in a resolution that also enshrines the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from in May. European powers have been scrambling to salvage the deal.
In the U.N. report, Guterres called on all countries to ""ensure the continuity of this agreement that is fundamental to regional and international peace and security.""

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","France gives weapons to Central Africa, favors end to embargo","By Paul Lorgerie and Sophie Louet
BANGUI/PARIS (Reuters) - France on Tuesday delivered hundreds of assault weapons to Central African Republic (CAR) to fight the growing influence of armed groups in its former colony and said it had no objections in principle to lifting a U.N. arms embargo on the country.
Paris is worried about growing Russian influence and military presence in CAR, which has struggled with fighting since a 2013 civil war, often between Christian and Muslim militias.
Speaking in the capital Bangui, Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly said the 1,400 assault weapons would be for the 7,000 national forces, who face an equivalent number of armed militia.
""What is important is that Central African armed forces are equipped, armed. If they were not then it would be the armed groups who would have the advantage and this is obviously not the goal,"" Parly told reporters. 
Despite electing a new leader in 2016, the country has been mired in tit-for-tat inter-communal violence and political instability.
It pleaded for help in 2017 to fight the militias, arguing it was hobbled by a U.N. arms embargo since 2013 which meant weapons shipments had to be approved by the U.N. Security Council's CAR sanctions committee, which includes France and Russia.
Despite initial French efforts to deliver arms, Moscow obtained the go-ahead from the U.N. last December and has since given additional equipment and deployed instructors, escalating its most significant military foray in Africa in decades.
France was given an exemption to the embargo in February. 
""It is key that these weapons ... can be identified, stored, traced, and once these conditions are met, there is no reason for the embargo not to be lifted,"" Parly said.
""These conditions have progressed enormously, so there is no difficulty in principle."" 
The embargo is due to be renewed at the end of January. 
The rivalry with Moscow has also played out at the U.N. Security Council. It must renew the mandate for the peacekeeping mission by Saturday.
In November the council extended the mandate for a month as diplomats said France and Russia wrangled over language on CAR peace efforts.
Paris in private accused Moscow of undermining existing peace efforts by pushing its own initiatives, a charge Moscow has denied.
""It's vital that the help provided, notably by Russia, respects the rules that have been put down by the international community and United Nations,"" Parly said. 
As part of efforts to curb Russia's influence, France, which still has about 200 soldiers on the ground, upped its development aid in November.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Time on Tuesday presented its ""Person of the Year"" honor to a group of journalists, including a slain Saudi Arabian writer and a pair of Reuters reporters imprisoned by Myanmar's government, as the magazine warned the ideal of truth as critical to democracy is under assault.
The publication also honored the founder of a Philippines news website critical of that country's authoritarian government and a Maryland newspaper that was the target of a mass shooting, marking the first occasion in the magazine's 95-year history that Time has bestowed the distinction on its own profession.
A cover story in the issue highlighted the role of journalists including Reuters' Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who Myanmar imprisoned for violating a state secrets act and Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi writer and critic of the nation's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was slain two months ago inside a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey. 
""I hope that this is received by the public at large far, far beyond the United States as a reminder of the importance of defending free expression and the pursuit of truth and facts,"" Ben Goldberger, Time magazine's assistant managing editor, said during an interview. ""That is the baseline for all free societies. Democracy certainly cannot function without a shared understanding of the facts.""
The annual distinction is intended to recognize the person, group, thing or idea that had the greatest influence on world events that year. It has been given to a wide range of influencers over the decades, from U.S. civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. and Queen Elizabeth II to Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, who was honored before the start of World War Two.
Wednesday will mark one year since Reuters journalists Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were imprisoned for their work investigating the killing of villagers from Muslim Rohingya minority by Myanmar's security forces and civilian mobs. They were convicted on Sept. 3 under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act in a case seen as a test of democratic freedoms in Myanmar.
Khashoggi was killed two months ago at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul when he went there to collect documents for his forthcoming marriage. He was the first person to be named a Time Person of the Year after his death.
U.S. senators briefed by the Central Intelligence Agency have said they are certain that the Saudi crown prince was responsible for Khashoggi's killing, a view U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is skeptical of. The crown prince has denied knowledge of the operation that killed Khashoggi.
Time also honored Maria Ressa, the founder of the Philippine news site Rappler that has been a frequent critic of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, and the staff of the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, where a gunman shot and killed five people in June.
Ressa and her site were charged with tax evasion by the Philippines' justice department in November.
The four groups were highlighted on four separate covers of the magazine, one of which features the wives of the imprisoned Reuters reporters embracing one another as they hold photos of their husbands.
""We couldn't be happier with @TIME's choice for Person of the Year,"" the Society of Professional Journalists said on Twitter. ""In 2018, journalists gave their lives and freedom in pursuit of telling the truth. Their sacrifices deserve to be recognized.""

Goldberger emphasized journalism's vital role in providing the information needed for democracies to function: ""These guardians are the ones fighting the war on truth and the war against misinformation. It is one of the most essential jobs in the world.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Anarchists claimed responsibility on Tuesday for an overnight graffiti attack on the Swiss headquarters of the World Trade Organization that has a history of attracting anti-globalization protests.
The red paint on the facade of the building beside Lake Geneva was quickly cleaned off, but those behind the stunt posted pictures on the web, declaring it part of an anarchist campaign against capitalism. 
One piece of graffiti read ""OMCriminelle"", playing on the letters ""OMC"", the French abbreviation for ""WTO"". 
""We attacked the International Headquarters of the WTO in Geneva, the World Criminal Organization, symbol of agreements between the powerful, of frantic free trade, destructive production, sly imperialism, anti-social capitalism,"" the authors of the attack wrote on their blog.
At the WTO ""food, oil, metals and human beings are just pieces of an equation whose sole purpose is the accumulation of capital. The pen-pushers from multinationals, states and financial markets decide the value of the world, who will live and who will die,"" they added.
The WTO condemned the vandalism as contrary to its values of dialogue and respect for different perspectives.
""In a world as complex and tense as the world of today, the only way we can resolve the problems that confront us is through a multilateral approach,"" spokesman Keith Rockwell said. 
The graffiti protest came as neighboring France grapples with ""yellow vest"" protests against the policies of President Emmanuel Macron.
There has been no such movement in Switzerland, but the WTO headquarters in Geneva, the most prosperous city in the French-speaking region of Switzerland, is just 15 minutes' drive from the border. 
Two decades ago, in what became known as the ""Battle of Seattle"", nearly 50,000 protesters plunged the U.S. city of into chaos during a WTO ministerial meeting.
Subsequent WTO meetings have been less eventful, as the ""Doha round"" of trade talks gradually ran out of steam and protesters turned their attention elsewhere. 

After years in the doldrums, the WTO is in the eye of a new storm this year, with U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff wars and U.S. complaints about the way the it has referred trade disputes leaving the world body in an existential crisis.

It was the latest in a string of violent incidents in the remote jungles of the once-booming OPEC nation, where people are increasingly taking to informal gold mining as the country's socialist economy unravels and hyperinflation leaves millions struggling to afford basic food items. 
Padrino said he regretted the death of 21-year-old Charlie Penaloza in the clash, which took place in Canaima National Park, home to the world's tallest waterfall. He said the armed forces were working to protect indigenous people and the environment from ""mafias"" that control illegal mining. 
""It would be naive to think that only the indigenous are behind illegal gold mining. The indigenous, I repeat, are victims,"" Padrino said on state television. He did not provide further details of the operation or how Penaloza died. 
President Nicolas Maduro in 2016 declared war on wildcat miners as part of a plan to boost gold output in the so-called 'Mining Arc' of southern Venezuela to provide an alternative source of revenue as the economy experienced a dramatic drop in oil production. 
But opposition politicians and indigenous groups have accused the military of seeking to control the informal gold trade. 
""The Venezuelan state is responsible for the physical loss of our companion Charlie Penaloza Rivas, as a result of an uncontrolled armed incursion by the security forces, or with their complicity"" the council of Pemon chiefs said in a statement on Saturday. 
As a result of the incident, the chiefs suspended municipal elections in the area that were set to take place on Sunday.
In October, seven Venezuelans were killed in a remote gold mine in an apparent clash between armed groups for control of the area. In February, 18 were killed when soldiers clashed with illegal miners in Bolivar.

Israel says Hezbollah, Lebanon's most powerful armed group, dug the tunnels with the aim of launching attacks into Israel with backing from its regional sponsor Iran. Hezbollah has yet to comment.
""We certainly took this issue seriously - the presence of tunnels at the border - and Israel informed us via the United States that it does not have aggressive intentions and it will continue to work on its (territory),"" Aoun told a news conference.
""We also do not have aggressive intentions... We are ready to remove the causes of the dispute, but after we obtain a final report and we set out the matters that need to be dealt with.""
During a televised visit to the border, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was ""methodically dismantling the tunnel weapon,"" and warned Hezbollah not to re-establish the front.
""If Hezbollah makes the big mistake of deciding in any way to strike at us or resist the (anti-tunnel) action we have undertaken, it will get hit with blows that it cannot even imagine.""
The U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, last week confirmed the presence of one tunnel near the Israeli town of Metulla. The force's head, Major General Stefano Del Col, said on Tuesday that a second one had been found while Israel's military said it had discovered a third. 
Del Col, in a statement issued after meeting Aoun, said the matter was ""serious"". UNIFIL was making ""every effort to maintain clear and credible channels of communication with both sides so that there is no room for misunderstanding"".
Israel has said it is up to UNIFIL to deal with the tunnels on the Lebanese side of the border, and its military said it held the Beirut government responsible for ""another blatant breach"" of a U.N. resolution that ended a 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel.
Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, said in a separate statement that Lebanon was committed to implementing that resolution.

Israel and Hezbollah have avoided major conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border since 2006, though Israel has mounted attacks in Syria targeting what it said were advanced weapon deliveries to the group.

The Aegis ashore system used in the latest test was fitted with a Standard Missile 3 Block IIA (SM-3 IIA) interceptor being developed in a joint venture between Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co and Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.
Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Director Lieutenant General Sam Greaves said the successful test was significant.
""(It) was of great significance to the future of multi-domain missile defense operations and supports a critical initial production acquisition milestone for the SM-3 Block IIA missile program,"" Greaves said. 
In the recent test, a U.S. Air Force C-17 launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile and the interceptor was launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility at Kauai, Hawaii, the MDA said.
In October, the U.S. military said it successfully tracked and intercepted a medium-range ballistic target missile.
In August, the Pentagon was given the mandate to pursue more options for defeating U.S.-bound North Korean missiles by using radar and more missiles to spot and shoot down inbound threats.
The military has been exploring whether the United States can add another layer of defenses to those already in place for intercepting incoming missiles.
The SM-3 IIA is expected to be equipped on U.S Aegis ashore stations in Romania and Poland. The Polish section of the defense shield is expected to be operational in 2020. The United States switched on the missile shield in Romania in 2016, which has angered Russia. 
Earlier this month, the United States delivered Russia a 60-day ultimatum to come clean about what Washington says is a violation of an arms control treaty that keeps certain missiles out of Europe.
In 2017, Japan decided it would expand its ballistic missile defense system with U.S.-made ground-based Aegis radar stations and interceptors in response to North Korean rockets.

(Reuters) - The Arctic had its second-hottest year on record in 2018, part of a warming trend that may be dramatically changing earth's weather patterns, according to a report released on Tuesday by the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.
""Arctic air temperatures for the past five years have exceeded all previous records since 1900,"" according to the annual NOAA study, the 2018 Arctic Report Card, which said the year was second only to 2016 in overall warmth in the region.
It marks the latest in a series of warnings about climate change from U.S. government bodies, even as President Donald Trump has voiced skepticism about the phenomenon and has pushed a pro-fossil fuels agenda.
The study said the Arctic warming continues at about double the rate of the rest of the planet, and that the trend appears to be altering the shape and strength of the jet stream air current that influences weather in the Northern Hemisphere.
""Growing atmospheric warmth in the Arctic results in a sluggish and unusually wavy jet-stream that coincided with abnormal weather events,"" it said, noting that the changing patterns have often brought unusually frigid temperatures to areas south of the Arctic Circle.
Some examples are ""a swarm of severe winter storms in the eastern United States in 2018, and the extreme cold outbreak in Europe in March 2018 known as 'the Beast from the East.'""
Environmentalists have long warned of rapid warming in the Arctic, saying it threatens imperiled species like polar bears, and is a harbinger of the broader impacts of climate change on the planet. 
Scientists have warned that the region could suffer trillions of dollars worth of climate change-related damage to infrastructure in the coming decades.
But the melting of Arctic ice has piqued the interests of polar nations like the United States, Canada and Russia by opening new shipping routes and expanding access to a region believed to be rich in petroleum and minerals.
The United States and Russia have both expressed an interest in boosting Arctic drilling, and Russia has bolstered its military presence in the north.
The NOAA report comes weeks after more than a dozen U.S. government agencies released a study concluding that climate change is driven by human consumption of fossil fuels and will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century.
Trump, who has been rolling back Obama-era environmental and climate protections to maximize production of domestic fossil fuels, said of the update to the National Climate Assessment: ""I don't believe it.""

Trump last year announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Deal agreed by nearly 200 nations to combat climate change, arguing the accord would kill jobs and provide little tangible environmental benefit.

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",India's Modi seen forgiving farm loans as he seeks to win back rural voters,"By Mayank Bhardwaj and Rajendra Jadhav
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is likely to announce loan waivers worth billions of dollars to woo millions of farmers ahead of a general election, government sources said, after his ruling party suffered a rural drubbing in state polls.
Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost power to the opposition Congress in three big heartland states, where agriculture is still a mainstay, according to vote counting on Tuesday.
To claw back support among India's 263 million farmers and their many millions of dependents, Modi's administration would soon start working out the details of a plan allocating money to write off farm loans, government sources said.
With a national election due by May 2019, Modi and the BJP have run out of time to announce other easy, popular measures such as raising the support, or guaranteed, prices for staples such as rice and wheat, farm analysts said.
""Elections are round the corner and you know that you've failed to fix the problems being faced by these farmers, so you will soon go to town promising agri-loan waivers,"" said Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised India's last government on crop prices.
The plan could see as much as 4 trillion rupees ($56.5 billion) in loans written off, the government sources and analysts said.
Farm loan waivers would be the biggest help the government has ever provided to farmers, said the officials, who did not wish to be identified in line with government policy.
The previous Congress party-led coalition government announced farm loan waivers worth nearly 720 billions rupees in 2008, helping it return to power with a bigger mandate in 2009.
ANGRY FARMERS
Economists caution that farm loans waivers would widen a fiscal deficit the government has aimed to cap at 3.3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), or 6.24 trillion rupees. 
Even without the farm loan waiver, some credit rating agencies have estimated the country's fiscal deficit at 6.67 trillion - or 3.5 percent of GDP, on muted tax collections. 
The loan waiver also risks deepening the malaise at public sector banks saddled with most of India's $150 billion in stressed loans.
If the government finds very limited fiscal space, it could go for loan waivers only in a few geographies that have suffered extreme weather conditions, sources and analysts said.
The results announced on Tuesday were from elections that took place over the past few weeks in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, three large states in the Hindi-speaking northern belt that is the BJP's traditional stronghold.
The BJP lost power in Madhya Pradesh after holding power there for 15 years.
""Tuesday's election result clearly demonstrates farmers' anger against Modi and his administration,"" said Dharmendra Malik, a farm leader from Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state that borders all three.
The last time a BJP government lost power, in 2004, it was largely because rural voters abandoned the party.
""Farmers very well know that the state governments don't have the financial war chest to write off agricultural loans, so it's only Modi's government which can waive loans,"" Malik said.
Although farm loan waivers are a populist move, debt write-offs help only relatively well-off farmers with larger plots of land. India's small farmers - 80 percent of the total - often cannot borrow from banks and turn instead to local money lenders who charge exorbitant interest of 25-50 percent.
Both the BJP and Congress have promised farm loan waivers in a number of state elections in the past few years. About seven state governments have promised to write off farm loans worth 1.8 trillion rupees.
Low food prices, export curbs, anti-inflation policies that keep rural incomes low and a broad shift from subsidies to investment spending under the pro-business Modi have all infuriated and demoralized farmers.
Both India's capital New Delhi and Mumbai, the country's financial hub, have been recent targets of protests by farmers, mirroring rising anger in the countryside where more than two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live.
Other than writing off crop loans, the government would also try to step up purchases of farmers' produce, government sources said, without giving details.
Mahesh Salve, a wheat farmer from Madhya Pradesh, said he was counting on farm loan waivers.
""I will vote for the party that will write off our loans,"" said Salve.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 10:51AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Red tape, funding problems hamper Lion Air black box search","By Cindy Silviana
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Bureaucratic wrangling and funding problems have hampered the search for the cockpit voice recorder of a crashed Lion Air jet, prompting investigators to turn to the airline to foot the bill in a rare test of global norms on the probe's independence.
Weeks of delays in the search for the second 'black box' may complicate the task of explaining how 189 people died when the Lion Air Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29.
Indonesian investigators told Reuters budgetary constraints and the need for approvals had limited efforts to raise the main wreckage and find the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), thought to hold vital clues to Indonesia's second-worst air disaster.
""We don't have further funds to rent the ship,"" a source at Indonesia's transport safety committee (KNKT) said, in reference to specialized equipment needed for the search. 
""There is no emergency fund for us, because there is no legal basis,"" the source said on condition of anonymity. 
""We have already asked the coordinating minister for the economy, but there is no regulation and it would need to be discussed by the parliament,"" the source added.
The clock is ticking in the hunt for acoustic pings coming from the L3 Technologies Inc cockpit voice recorder fitted to the jet. It has a 90-day beacon, according to an online brochure from the manufacturer.    
Safety experts say it is unusual for one of the parties to help fund an investigation. Under United Nations rules, such probes must be conducted independently to maintain trust in any recommendations made to prevent future accidents. 
There are also broader concerns about the resources available for such investigations worldwide, coupled with the threat of agencies being dragged into separate legal disputes.
A rare exception was the costly search for black boxes of an Air France jet in the Atlantic in 2009, parts of which were funded by the airline and Airbus after a failed two-year effort.
The Lion Air jet crashed in relatively shallow water of 30-35 meters but only the data recorder has been found as the remaining device lies among oil pipelines requiring an expensive self-positioning vessel without an anchor.
A Lion Air spokesman said a chartering contract had been signed and a specialized ship would arrive once all international regulatory approvals were obtained.
Even though the airline is helping to fund the search, officials from the KNKT will oversee all operations on board.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said she was not aware of a lack of funding for the CVR search operation.
LAST TRACE
The voice recorder could help answer questions over whether the crew responded correctly to potentially faulty sensor data and any role that a newly modified anti-stall system on the 737 MAX may have played. 
The flight data recorder was recovered three days after the crash, giving insight into aircraft systems and crew inputs, though the cause has yet to be determined.
The need for an adequate support ship has been highlighted ever since tests on Nov 12 suggested the CVR's locator beacon was broken, KNKT head Soerjanto Tjahjono told Reuters.
The search requires a heavy-duty supply vessel with a large enough deck and crane capacity to help recover the main fuselage wreckage as well as support a remotely operated underwater vehicle, deputy chief Haryo Satmiko said.
He estimated the search would cost about 25 billion rupiah ($1.73 million) every 10 days and cited the need to obtain ""administrative progress"" on funding as the main obstacle over the last month.
Potential funding sources had included the finance ministry, the aviation regulator and Lion Air's insurers, he said. 
A source at Lion Air said its insurers had been reluctant to pay for the search and so the airline had stepped in.
The Lion Air spokesman referred questions to insurer Asuransi Tugu Pratama Indonesia, a subsidiary of government-controlled oil company Pertamina [PERTM.UL]. 
The insurer was not immediately available for comment.

(This amends paragraph 17 to show that Nov 12 pinger exercise was a trial, no ping detected from crashed jet's CVR; removes following paragraph.)

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 10:25AM ET</span>","Britain must revoke notice to quit EU now, former PM John Major says","By Graham Fahy
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Britain must revoke its notice to quit the European Union with immediate effect to allow for ""serious and profound reflection"" by both parliament and the people, former Prime Minister John Major said on Tuesday.
British Prime Minister Theresa May postponed a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal on Monday in an abrupt move that opened up a range of possibilities from a Brexit without a deal, a last-minute agreement or another EU referendum.
The European Union's top court also ruled on Monday that the British government may reverse its Article 50 formal divorce notice that has set its withdrawal date from March 29 without having to consult other member states.
In order to calm financial markets and protect the economic wellbeing of the British people, the Brexit process needs to be stopped, Major said.
""We need to revoke article 50 with immediate effect. The clock, for the moment, must be stopped,"" Major, who also faced a revolt inside the Conservative Party over Europe, said in a speech at an international affairs think tank in Dublin.
""It's clear we now need the most precious commodity of all: time. Time for serious and profound reflection by both parliament and people. There will be a way through the present morass, there always is.""
Major, who led Britain from 1990 to 1997 and campaigned to stay in the EU, is among three of the four former British prime ministers still alive to have called for a second referendum as a way to resolve the crisis.
The former prime minister, who faced down Eurosceptic members of his own cabinet to win a vote of confidence over his handling of the EU's landmark Maastricht Treaty in 1993, said he believed Brexit reduced Britain's international influence.
""We are a more valued ally for America because of our influence in Europe and we are more valued by Europe because of our close relationship with America,"" he said.

""Britain, shorn of both these long-standing allies, will be seen by the world as a mid-sized, middle-ranking power that is no longer super-powered by her alliances.""

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Opposition UK lawmakers call for second Brexit referendum preparations,"By Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May's government and the European Union should begin planning for a second Brexit referendum because parliament cannot agree on a divorce deal and voters will be asked to break the deadlock, opposition lawmakers said.
Less than four months until the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, Brexit was plunged into chaos on Monday when May accepted that British lawmakers would not accept her deal and withdrew a key vote on it.
The ultimate outcome of Brexit is now uncertain. Possible scenarios include May's deal ultimately winning approval in a new parliamentary vote; May losing her job; Britain leaving the bloc with no deal or another referendum.
""The UK is in the middle of a constitutional crisis, which is unparalleled in modern history,"" said Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party in Westminster. ""There now appears to be scant potential for consensus to be found.""
May has repeatedly said that British lawmakers face a choice of approving her deal or facing an exit with no deal or even the reversal of Brexit. So far there has been no indication that the government has been preparing for a second vote.
Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said the government must ask the Electoral Commission, the independent body which oversees referendums, to begin looking at what question might be asked and when another vote could be held.
A new vote, Cable said, must ask whether voters wanted a Brexit deal or to stay in the EU. He said a ""no deal"" exit should not be one of the options.
""You prepare for what might happen rather than what you want to happen,"" he said. 
His comments were echoed by Blackford, the Green Party, the Welsh nationalist party, the Labour Party's Margaret Beckett and the Conservative lawmaker Anna Soubry. 
Bookmakers are offering almost an even chance of another EU referendum before 2020.
An array of smaller parties including the SNP and the Liberal Democrats said European leaders should prepare by agreeing to allow an extension of Britain's Article 50 departure notification.
Blackford also issued the opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn with an ultimatum to call a vote of no-confidence in the government or they would attempt to do so without them.
""This is a government that is in chaos and crisis and that is why I would appeal to Jeremy - we have no option,"" he said.
""We cannot delay and if Jeremy does not accept that responsibility then I am afraid the rest of us will have to accept that responsibility.""
On Monday the speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow said that while smaller parties could table a no-confidence motion, it was usually only put forward for a debate and vote if it came from the main opposition party.

A previous inquiry against Paolo Macchiarini ended in 2017 without charges, with prosecutors saying they found no legal evidence he caused the death of the three patients from experimental surgery. 
Macchiarini, who denied any negligence in his transplant of synthetic tracheas into the three patients in 2011-12, was fired from Karolinska Hospital in March 2016.
But the 2017 decision was appealed and Prosecutor Mikael Bjork said on Wednesday that because relevant law was not clear, he would reopen the case regarding two of the patients.
""I draw different legal conclusions than previous prosecutors,"" he said in a statement.
The investigation sparked controversy concerning the Karolinska Institute, which awards the Nobel Prize for medicine. The Swedish government dismissed the institute's board in 2016 after an investigation found negligence in the decision of Karolinska Hospital to hire Macchiarini. 

Macchiarini's lawyer Bjorn Hurtig could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Critics label Putin a hypocrite for attending veteran dissident's wake,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critics accused President Vladimir Putin of hypocrisy for attending the wake on Tuesday of a veteran Soviet and Russian dissident who was a staunch critic of his administration.
Putin has been accused by rights groups of muzzling the media, jailing his opponents and clamping down on civil society over the 19 years in which he has dominated Russia's political landscape and enjoyed consistently high popularity ratings.
The president joined hundreds of others who paid their respects at the open-cask ceremony for Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the founder of Russia's oldest human rights group who died on Saturday aged 91.
But while Putin attended, a notable absentee was Alexeyeva's fellow human rights veteran Lev Ponomaryov, jailed last week for calling in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post for rallies in support of activists at two political groups that authorities have labeled extremist.
""Instead of Lev Ponomaryov, Vladimir Putin will bid farewell to Alexeyeva. This is what it means to spit on someone's grave,"" journalist and long-standing Kremlin critic Viktor Shenderovich wrote on Facebook. 
Ponomaryov, 77, is serving a 16-day sentence. A court rejected his appeal for dispensation to go to the funeral. 
Asked on Monday about Putin's possible attendance, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be impossible for the president to not pay his respects on the same day that he was due to meet the Kremlin human rights council, on which Alexeyeva sat for many years. 
Alexeyeva went into exile during the Communist era, returning to Russia after the break-up of the Soviet Union. She was briefly detained by police at an anti-Kremlin protest at the age of 82 in 2009, and denounced Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Putin laid a bouquet at her cask and sat briefly nearby, exchanging words with another attendee before leaving through a side exit. 
""Maybe it's crappy PR, maybe something else,"" wrote opposition politician Gennady Gudkov.
""But it's entirely obvious that human rights defenders, environmentalists and in fact everyone who disagrees with the authorities' course is persecuted in Russia with his (Putin's) silent agreement.""

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 10:05AM ET</span>",Former Canadian diplomat detained in China: sources,"By John Ruwitch and Michael Martina
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - A former Canadian diplomat has been detained in China, two sources said on Tuesday, and his current employer, the International Crisis Group, said it was seeking his prompt and safe release.
Michael Kovrig's detention comes after police in Canada arrested the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities, a move that has infuriated Beijing.
It was not immediately clear if the cases were related, but the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver has stoked fears of reprisals against the foreign business community in China.
""International Crisis Group is aware of reports that its North East Asia Senior Adviser, Michael Kovrig, has been detained in China,"" the think-tank said in a statement.
""We are doing everything possible to secure additional information on Michael's whereabouts as well as his prompt and safe release,"" it added.
China's Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Public Security did not respond immediately to questions faxed about Kovrig's detention.
The exact reason for the detention, which was made sometime early this week, according to the sources, was not immediately clear.
The Canadian embassy declined to comment, referring queries to Ottawa.
Calls to Kovrig's phones were not answered.
DIPLOMATIC SPAT
Kovrig, a Mandarin speaker, has been working as a full-time expert for the International Crisis Group since February 2017.
From 2003 to 2016, he worked as a diplomat with stints in Beijing and Hong Kong, among others, according to his profile on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
Following Meng's arrest, China on Saturday summoned Canada's ambassador in Beijing and warned of severe ""consequences"" if Ottawa did not see that she was immediately released.
Meng is set to return to a Vancouver courtroom on Tuesday, as the judge weighs final issues in determining whether she should be freed on bail while awaiting proceedings for her possible extradition to the United States.
Washington has made accusations that Meng misled multinational banks about Huawei's control of a company operating in Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions and incurring severe penalties.
Locked in a bitter trade war, Washington and Beijing earlier this month agreed to delay a planned Jan. 1 increase in U.S. tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, allowing more time to negotiate over China's huge bilateral trade surplus and U.S. complaints that it steals technology.
Chinese experts have said that Beijing was trying to separate Meng's arrest from the trade negotiations, but also warned that public anger in China over Canada's move could compel officials there to take measures that would further sour U.S.-China ties and endanger talks.
In 2014, a Canadian couple, Kevin and Julia Garratt, were detained a week after Canada accused China of hacking into the national computer system. Kevin Garratt was charged with spying, but released and deported after he spent two years in detention.

Nearly 100 would-be migrants, most of whom claimed they were Iranian, made similar journeys across the Channel to the UK last month. 
The recent rise in the number of Iranians trying to enter the UK has been widely linked to Serbia’s offer of visa-free access to Iranians in August 2017 in an attempt to increase tourism. Hundreds of Iranians subsequently flew to Europe to take advantage of the offer. 
Last month, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, called on more government funding to deal with the arrivals.

The political decision, to be formalized after talks with EU leaders in Brussels this week, would allow Swiss stock exchanges to maintain access to EU clients until the end of June under a temporary extension of the ""equivalence"" regime that permits foreign financial firms to operate in the 28-country bloc.
The Swiss government on Friday dodged an EU deadline to agree on a draft treaty by the end of this year and said it would revisit the subject in spring 2019 after political consultations. 
No decision will be announced on Tuesday, a commission spokeswoman said. 
But the two senior officials said the political decision had been made.
""It is a last gesture of goodwill from our side accompanying their consultation, which runs into spring,"" one told Reuters.
The move is a U-turn from the more belligerent stance Brussels had adopted until last week. 
The Commission told EU diplomats last week that it would not have extended the equivalence regime for Swiss exchanges after it expires in December, if they did not agree on a new treaty by the end of the year, minutes of an EU meeting show. 

Talks over a new treaty, which would replace more than 120 sectorial pacts currently regulating EU-Swiss relations, have been ongoing for more than four years.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 09:05AM ET</span>",Stay or go? Syrian refugees face a life-changing choice,"By Angus McDowall 
BEIRUT (Reuters) - As the bus pulled out of a Beirut car park heading for Damascus, Ahmed Sheikh waved from the window, excited, he said, to be returning home to Syria after years as a refugee in Lebanon. 
Sheikh and his two sons are part of a steady trickle of refugees going back as the Syrian government tightens its grip on areas it controls and the prospect of new fighting recedes. 
But not everyone wants to go home just yet. While Beirut says 90,000 Syrians have returned this year, more than a million remain in Lebanon, including many who fear reprisals or army conscription, or whose homes were destroyed in the war. 
In a refugee camp in northern Lebanon, Abu Ibrahim recalled how government shellfire had obliterated his home town, saying it was too dangerous to return to Syria while Bashar al-Assad remains president. 
Whether the millions of refugees outside Syria, like Sheikh and Abu Ibrahim, will return to areas where fighting has ended is becoming a pressing issue in the country and abroad. 
Assad now controls most of Syria and the front lines appear stable for now between government territory and two big enclaves in the north and east still outside Damascus' control. 
The refugees' fate is important to Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, which have each buckled under the strain of hosting so many, but also to Europe, where the refugee crisis has caused political ructions. It will play a critical role in shaping Syria's own gradual economic recovery too. 
About half Syria's pre-war population fled after war broke out in 2011, 6.3 million of them as refugees abroad and 6 million displaced in their own country. Many were forced to flee numerous times. 
About a million remain in Lebanon, 3.6 million in Turkey and nearly 700,000 in Jordan, the UNHCR said. One million Syrian children have been born in exile as refugees since the crisis began.
The agency said on Tuesday that up to 250,000 Syrian refugees were expected to go home next year, while around 37,000 returned in 2018, a figure its officials say may not be complete. 
GOING HOME
For Sheikh, 46, the decision to return came after a legal problem in Lebanon. His residency permit had expired and he faced a large fine. Police told him he would not have to pay if he agreed to return to Syria.
Still, with the war calmer, he was happy to be going. ""There is security here, but living conditions are hard. There is not much work and everything is very expensive,"" he said. 
He had fled Aleppo with his family in late 2012 after rebels there threatened him, accusing him of links with the government. 
In Syria he owned a bakery, and later worked in Lebanon as a baker after making the long, circuitous journey through war-ravaged Syria with his wife and five children. 
But he will not go back to his old Aleppo district, ruined in the fighting. He and his sons will stay with his sister in Manbij, which is controlled by local U.S.-backed forces. 
His wife and three daughters will not return to Syria yet. The young women have married and had children while in Lebanon. 
Returning is complicated. Syrian security checks on those who seek to come back can take weeks. Not all are approved. Important documents may have been lost. Young children may have no passport at all. 
The Lebanese and Syrian governments have organized numerous returns for groups of refugees who register to go back. Sheikh's return was one of these. 
As he got on his bus, another family group hugged and cried - some staying, some going. A father looked through the window at his wife and disconsolate child who were returning to Syria while he stayed on to work in Lebanon. 
STAYING ON
Abu Ibrahim, by contrast, swears he will not take his wife and three children back. He is haunted by the carnage of an early battle that destroyed Baba Amr, their neighborhood of Homs, which they fled by night as bullets sang overhead. 
He had a workshop there, repairing televisions. His parents lived nearby, as did his 11 siblings with their families. People in Baba Amr were close-knit. ""Everyone used to know each other,"" he said. 
When protesters marched in 2011, he joined them, though he did not take up arms, and by early 2012, protests had given way to war. 
In a fierce assault on Baba Amr, the army shelled his street, which faced the front line. His building took a direct hit, wounding him and his son. A nephew disappeared, presumed among the hundreds killed. 
When the bombardment abated, they left by night, braving sniper fire to cross the fields. ""The children couldn't take it any more,"" he said. 
In a new neighborhood, as the army advanced again, he witnessed summary shootings. The family kept on moving, before paying money to cross into Lebanon. 
Abu Ibrahim's old house and his neighborhood are now rubble - a military zone controlled by army checkpoints. His siblings scattered during the fighting. None stayed in Syria. 
In Lebanon, he still fixes electrical goods, going house to house on a motorbike with his toolkit. He makes little money and sees no future there. 
But he is alarmed by rumors among the refugees in Lebanon that some who have returned were abused or killed, which Damascus denies. In Syria, his oldest boy, now 16, would soon face conscription. His two-year-old daughter lacks a proper birth certificate or passport. 
""I will never go back unless the regime is changed, and especially Bashar al-Assad,"" he said. 
He wants to go to the West, a journey few manage. Of the million Syrians in Lebanon, only a small number have gained permission to relocate there as refugees. 

Others attempt the dangerous sea crossing to Cyprus. In September a boat sank, drowning a child whose family could not face a return to their homeland.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's government met on Tuesday to discuss whether to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, two sources familiar with the matter said, a decision that would break with decades of policy and risk angering Asian neighbors.
""Cabinet met today and the issue of moving the Israeli embassy was discussed. The decision is still pending,"" said one of the sources who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media.
Prime Minster Scott Morrison in October said he was ""open"" to moving the embassy to Jerusalem, following the lead of U.S. President Donald Trump.
The United States opened a new embassy in Jerusalem in May, a move that delighted Israel, infuriated Palestinians and upset the wider Arab world and Western allies.
The Australian newspaper reported several senior cabinet members were leaning toward recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital while stopping short of moving the embassy.
Jerusalem's status is a major obstacle to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel regards all of the city, including the eastern sector that it annexed after a 1967 war, as its capital.
The Australian newspaper said a decision could be announced this week.
By recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Morrison would be hoping to keep his conservative backbench happy but it would likely anger neighbors, including Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country.
The Palestinian question is sensitive in Indonesia and it has refused to sign a free trade agreement with Australia until it confirms its plans toward Israel.

Israel’s government regards Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the country. Palestinians feel equally strongly, saying that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a future Palestinian state.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has delayed a vote in parliament to approve her Brexit deal in search of extra assurances from the European Union that will win over deeply skeptical lawmakers. Britain cannot ratify any withdrawal agreement without parliament's consent.
So what happens now?
BACK TO PARLIAMENT
The government has said it intends to hold a vote before January 21. But, critics are already lining up to say that May will not be able to get enough from EU leaders to make members of parliament change their mind about a deal they say is flawed.
By law, if the vote is held and the deal is rejected, ministers have 21 days to state how they intend to proceed.
The government has rejected suggestions it could seek to bypass parliament and proceed towards a no-deal exit. It has promised that lawmakers will get the chance to debate the next steps by Jan. 21 whether there is a deal or not.
RESIGN
May could resign as leader of the Conservative Party, triggering an internal contest to replace her without a general election. 
OUSTED
A long-running effort by some members of May's own party to get rid of her could gain renewed impetus. If 48 out of 315 Conservative lawmakers want her to go, the party holds a leadership ballot. If she loses, there is an internal contest to replace her without a general election.
VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE
The opposition Labour Party could call a vote of no confidence in the government, seeking to take control of the country without holding an election.
If a majority of lawmakers vote against May's government, Labour would have 14 days to prove, by a vote, that it could command a majority and form its own government.
BACK TO THE BALLOT
If May's government loses a confidence vote and Labour is unable to form a new government, an election is called. May could also call a general election herself if two-thirds of lawmakers in parliament agree to it. May has said that a general election is not in the national interest.
LONGER-TERM OPTIONS: 
SECOND REFERENDUM
The route to a second referendum on Brexit - or a People's Vote - is unclear but would almost certainly require the backing of the government of the day. A new referendum can be called only if it is approved by parliament.
With May dead set against a second referendum, and the opposition Labour Party not committed to one (but not ruling one out), a second referendum would need either a change in prime minister, a change in government, or an abrupt change in policy. 
An increasingly vocal contingent of lawmakers from across the political spectrum supports a fresh vote to break the deadlock in parliament. But, so far they have not been able to prove there is a majority in parliament for this view. 
Even if parliament did agree in principle to a second referendum, Britain would then have to ask for an extension to its timetable for leaving the EU.
DELAY OR CANCEL BREXIT
The government could seek to extend the negotiating period with the EU to give it time to try to reach a better deal, hold a general election, or conduct a second referendum.
The government could also withdraw its notice of intention to leave the EU, which the European Court of Justice has ruled this week it can do without consent of other EU countries.

May has said she does not want to delay Britain's exit from the EU, and will not revoke the notice of intention to leave.

KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Average world temperatures are on course to far exceed the main goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement on limiting global warming, a study showed on Tuesday.
But the overshoot by the end of this century could be less severe than expected thanks to significant efforts by some countries to combat climate change, said the report by Climate Action Tracker (CAT), a consortium of three independent European research groups.
The Paris Agreement aims to restrict warming to ""well below"" two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.
Countries are meeting in Poland from Dec. 2-14 to agree guidelines for implementing the pact which comes into force in 2020 but there are concerns these will be too weak to limit temperature rise to within safe levels.
The CAT report said there had been progress since 2015, but current policies meant the world was heading for warming of 3.3C.
That compared with the 3.4C it predicted a year ago, and it said that if governments were to implement policies they had in the pipeline, warming by 2100 could be limited to 3C.
Even a rise of 3C could cause loss of tropical coral reefs, Alpine glaciers, Arctic summer sea ice and perhaps an irreversible melt of Greenland's ice which would drive up world sea levels, a United Nations science panel has said.
The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in October that keeping the rise to 1.5C was possible but would require rapid and unprecedented changes in human behavior.
""We have yet to see this translate into action in terms of what governments are prepared to put on the table,"" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the three CAT research groups.
Since the Paris accord was agreed, countries including Argentina, Canada, Chile and India plus the European Union are moving in the right direction toward cutting emissions.
Countries such as Norway and Costa Rica are making progress with low-carbon transport and renewable energy deployment but China's carbon emissions rose again this year, the report said.
""With prices for renewables dropping roughly a third since Paris, both South Africa and Chile are mapping out strategies to address coal, and renewables are taking off in India,” said Niklas Höhne of research group NewClimate Institute.

But countries including the United States, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates have made either no progress or taken backward steps.

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2018 08:18AM ET</span>",Iran confirms missile test in defiance of U.S.,"By Babak Dehghanpisheh
GENEVA (Reuters) - A senior Iranian military commander confirmed that Tehran recently carried out a ballistic missile test to the anger of the United States, the Fars news agency said on Tuesday. 
The Revolutionary Guards official's comment came after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's assertion earlier this month that Iran had test-fired a missile capable of carrying multiple warheads and reaching the Middle East and Europe.
""We will continue our missile tests and this recent action was an important test,"" Guards' airspace division head Amirali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency. 
""The reaction of the Americans shows that this test was very important for them and that's why they were shouting,"" he added, without specifying what type of missile had been tested.
The U.N. Security Council met last week over the test that the United States, Britain and France said flouted U.N. restrictions on Tehran's military program.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement on Iran's nuclear program in May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. He said the deal was flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran's development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.
Iran has ruled out negotiations with Washington over its military capabilities, particularly the missile program run by the Guards. It says the program is purely defensive and denies missiles are capable of being tipped with nuclear warheads.
Hajizadeh said Iran holds up to 50 missile tests a year. 
""The issue of missiles has never been subject to negotiations and nothing has been approved or ratified about its prohibition for the Islamic Republic of Iran in (U.N.) resolution 2231,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tuesday, according to the Tasnim news agency. 
""Our defense doctrine is basically founded upon deterrence.""
Under U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which enshrined the nuclear deal in 2015, Iran is ""called upon"" to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years. 
Some states argue the language does not make it obligatory. 
Last month, Hajizadeh said U.S. bases in Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, and U.S. aircraft carriers in the Gulf were within range of Iranian missiles.

In October, the Revolutionary Guards fired missiles at Islamic State militants in Syria after the Islamist group took responsibility for an attack at a military parade in Iran that killed 25 people, nearly half of them Guards members.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Up to a 250,000 Syrian refugees could return to their devastated homeland in 2019, while many others face problems with documentation and property that the Damascus government must help resolve, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said on Tuesday.
Some 5.6 million Syrian refugees remain in neighboring countries - Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq - Amin Awad, UNHCR director for the Middle East and North Africa, said.
They include 1 million Syrian children born abroad whose foreign birth certificates the Assad government has agreed to recognize, he said.
Some 37,000 refugees have returned to Syria this year, UNHCR figures show. They went mainly to the governorates of Deraa, Damascus and Homs, Awad said.
""Now, by and large, the war has ended. We have a few pockets (of hostilities), including Idlib, as you know that there is a negotiated ceasefire and a de-escalation zone,"" Awad told a news briefing. 
""As the situation in Syria improves some of these refugees are making the journey home,"" he said. ""We are forecasting, in what we call phase one, up to 250,000 Syrians go back in 2019. That figure can go up and down according to the pace with which we are working and removing these obstacles to return.""
The most important obstacles to return are documentation for the refugees and their property and homes, Awad said.
""Then there are issues related to conscription, there are issues related to amnesty for those who deserted the army. These are drivers that would basically keep people away, they are obstacles.""
Other hindrances include mines and unexploded ordnance, and it will require a huge demining operation to clear agricultural and civilian areas, Awad said.
The UNHCR appealed to donors for $5.5 billion on Tuesday to support neighboring countries in providing health, water, sanitation, food, education, and psycho-social support to Syrian refugees.
""Their living conditions have deteriorated as their existence in exile prolongs. They have been borrowing money, they are indebted and a lot of them are living below the poverty line, 70 to 80 percent of them are living below the poverty line in their host communities or countries,"" Awad said.

""We are asking donors to stay the course,"" he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Armed British police used a Taser stun gun to restrain a man inside the grounds of parliament in Westminster on Tuesday, a Reuters photographer who witnessed the incident said. 
""Stop. Get down,"" police shouted at the man shortly before noon just inside parliament's main Carriage Gates, the photographer said.
Reuters pictures showed armed police using a stun gun on the man on the cobbled forecourt. He was later handcuffed as police pointed a gun at his head.
""A man was detained and arrested by Carriage Gates inside the Palace of Westminster on suspicion of trespassing at a protected site,"" police said. ""A Taser was deployed. Enquiries into the circumstances continue.""
The incident happened near where 52-year-old Khalid Masood stabbed an unarmed police officer to death in March 2017 after killing four people on nearby Westminster Bridge. He was shot dead.

In August, a man was arrested after driving a car into pedestrians and cyclists before ramming into barriers outside the parliament building in what police said appeared to be a terrorism attack.

Ernesto Araújo - who will take office in January under right-wing president-elect Jair Bolsonaro - said the international accord was ""an inappropriate instrument"" to deal with the issue and nations should set their own policies.
With a record 21.3 million refugees globally, the United Nations began work on the non-binding agreement after more than 1 million people arrived in Europe in 2015, many fleeing civil war in Syria and poverty in Africa.
The accord, which addresses issues such as how to protect migrants, integrate them and send them home, has been criticized by mostly right-wing European politicians who say it could increase immigration.
All 193 U.N. members except the United States agreed its wording in July, but only 164 - including representatives of Brazil's current administration - formally ratified it at a ceremony in Marrakesh on Monday. 
""The Bolsonaro government will dissociate from the Global Compact for Migration ... an inappropriate instrument to deal with the problem,"" Araújo wrote on Twitter late that same say.
""Immigration shouldn't be treated as a global issue, but rather in accordance with the reality of each country.""
Araújo said Brazil would continue to take in refugees from neighboring Venezuela, but that ""the fundamental point is restoring democracy"" in that nation. 
Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, has adopted what opponents have called a harsh stance on immigration. In 2015 he was quoted describing refugees coming to Brazil as ""the scum of the earth"".

Ten countries, mostly in formerly Communist Eastern Europe, have announced they are pulling of the U.N. immigration pact, and a Chilean official said over the weekend Santiago would do the same.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian court found six union leaders guilty on Tuesday of instigating violent protests against the government in 2013 and 2014, but suspended their jail terms. 
Striking workers and the now dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) had marched against Prime Minister Hun Sen's government to demand a re-run of a July 2013 election that the opposition said was rigged.
During one protest in 2014, military police fired on stone-throwing textile workers who were also demanding higher wages. A human rights group said at least four people were killed and more than 20 wounded.
The Phnom Penh Municipal Court on Tuesday found six union leaders guilty of initiating intentional violence and causing damage in the 2013-2014 protests. They were given suspended jail terms of between eight months and four and a half years.
""All of these jail terms are suspended,"" Judge Im Vannak told the court, without elaborating. He ordered the union leaders, who did not appear in court, to pay a total of $8,692 in compensation to people injured in the 2014 clash. 
Hun Sen told his ministers last month to ease pressure on labor leaders, after threats by the European Union to remove the Southeast Asian country's duty-free trading access.
Representatives from apparel and footwear companies, including Adidas (DE:ADSGN),  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Puma, had urged the government to drop what are seen as politically motivated criminal charges against trade unionists.
The labor leaders said on Tuesday they would appeal their convictions, which effectively bans them from leading a union.

""We can't accept this criminal conviction record. The situation is now more tense than before,"" said Ath Thon, the president of the Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers' Democratic Union, who was among those found guilty.

More than six months since an election, efforts to form the new cabinet led by Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri are still logjammed with rival groups vying for cabinet posts.
Aoun said the challenges in the government formation could not be resolved ""the traditional way"" between the prime minister-designate and the other parties, and it was his duty to get involved.
""The risks are greater than we can bear,"" he said, in an apparent reference to difficulties facing the heavily indebted Lebanese economy. 
""We are launching an initiative ... and it has to succeed, because if it doesn't ... there is a catastrophe, we want to say it with all frankness, and this is the reason for my intervention,"" Aoun said in a televised news conference.
Aoun held separate meetings with Hariri and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri on Monday.
Agreement over the make-up of the new cabinet has met a series of obstacles as Hariri has sought to forge a deal parceling out 30 cabinet posts among rival groups according to a sectarian political system.
The final hurdle has been over Sunni representation, with the powerful Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah demanding a cabinet seat for one of its Sunni allies who gained ground in the election. 
Hariri, a Western-backed leader whose family have long dominated Lebanese Sunni politics, has ruled out giving them one of his seats.
Lebanon is in dire need of a government able to implement the economic reforms the IMF says are needed to put its public debt on a sustainable path. Lebanon has the world's third largest public debt as a proportion of the economy, and growth is stagnant.

Analysts believe one compromise could be for Aoun to nominate one of the Hezbollah-aligned Sunnis, or a figure acceptable to them, among a group of ministers named by the president.

Fernando Grande-Marlaska accused the local Catalan police of doing nothing to prevent pro-independence protesters blocking the AP-7 toll road, which runs up Spain's Mediterranean coast, for more than 15 hours on Saturday.
The involvement of national police would be a contentious issue in the northeastern region which has its own administration and where polls suggest almost half the population wants to split away from Spain.
It would also stir memories of Madrid's decision to send in a large contingent of national police in September last year after the Catalan government called an illegal independence referendum.
""Serious disruptions of public order and traffic security, such as those seen in the last few days, need to be dealt with by the regional police,"" the minister wrote to his regional counterpart in an open letter late on Monday. 
""If this does not happen ... the government will order an intervention by the state police,"" he added.
There was no immediate reaction from the Catalan authorities. 
Spain's previous conservative government took control of the region in 2017 when the regional administration unilaterally declared independence following the referendum.
Many of the Catalan politicians that took part in the declaration are in prison awaiting trial for rebellion or in exile.
Spain's new Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez - who came to power in June - has said he is open to a referendum on greater autonomy and has promised to lay out detailed plans in parliament on Wednesday.
But Grande-Marlaska said the local authorities had to show they could keep order and prevent a repeat of Saturday's protests.

""It was observed that there was no intervention (by the regional police) ... a reality that is difficult to deny,"" he said in a radio interview on Tuesday morning.

Security forces have launched an operation to hunt down members of the military wing of the Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed responsibility for killing at least 16 workers and a soldier in the mountainous Nduga area.
The OPM has said it viewed the men as members of the military and casualties in a war against Indonesia's government. Indonesian officials said the workers were civilians. 
Papua, the resource-rich western part New Guinea island, has been plagued by a violent separatist conflict since the former Dutch colony was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969.
In a video posted on YouTube on Monday, OPM spokesman Sebby Sambom read an open letter to President Joko Widodo in which he dismissed calls on their military wing, known as the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), to surrender and start dialogue.
Standing behind the banned separatist Morning Star flag, Sambom demanded Widodo hold another referendum for native Papuans to decide whether they want to be integrated with Indonesia. 
""TPNPB will not surrender under any circumstances before the independence of the nation of Papua is realized from Indonesian occupation,"" Sambom said.
""The war will not stop before the demands of the TPNPB are carried out by the government of Indonesia.""
He called for unrestricted access to Papua for foreign journalists and for the U.N. refugee agency and the international Red Cross to help take care of civilians caught up in the conflict.
Sambom confirmed to Reuters on Tuesday the authenticity of the video.
A spokesman for President Widodo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In 2017, a senior government official, in response to a petition to the United Nations for a new referendum, said Papua was a legal part of Indonesia and already incorporated through a referendum process.
The OPM had accused the military of killing civilians in its operations which it said included bombings.
Chief Security Minister Wiranto rejected that accusation but said soldiers did use grenades in clashes. 
Two soldiers were wounded on Tuesday and three separatists had been killed in clashes, the military said.
Since coming to power in 2014, Widodo has tried to ease tension in Papua by freeing prisoners, addressing rights concerns and stepping up investment, including through a Trans Papua road.

Chen Ziliang, 47, and Zhao Yucun, 43, both forklift truck operators, face a fine of up to S$100,000 ($73,000) or prison for up to five years, or both.
Chen was charged with one count of attempting to obtain a S$1 bribe from a truck driver in exchange ""for not delaying the collection of a container onto"" his truck, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau said in a statement.
He was also charged for obtaining similar bribes from other truck drivers over the course of nearly two years. 
Zhao, was charged for obtaining similar bribes over the course of 3-1/2 years. 
""Employees are expected to carry out their duties fairly instead of obtaining bribes in exchange for favors,"" the bureau said in the statement.
""Even if the bribe amount is as low as $1, they can be taken to task. Bribes of any amount or any kind will not be tolerated,"" it said.

The proposed spending plan, first reported by the Nikkei business daily on Saturday, would see spending rise an average 1.1 percent per year, exceeding the 0.8 percent average under the previous plan.
""We still need some more discussion for the final approval,"" the source said, adding that it would be reviewed by cabinet later this month. 
Defense ministry officials were not immediately available to comment.
Some of the new money would be used to buy U.S.-made equipment, including two Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense radars and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co F-35 fighters.
The purchases could help Tokyo ease trade friction with Washington as President Donald Trump pushes Japan to buy more American goods, including military gear, while threatening to impose tariffs on Japanese auto imports to cut a trade deficit with Tokyo.

The junta imposed the strict ban on political activity citing the need for order after months of street protests against the democratically elected government of former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
The election, which many hope will restore democracy in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy, will likely pit the populist political movement backed by former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and supported by many in rural areas against the military and royalist establishment.
The Bangkok-based establishment seized power in successive coups in 2006 and 2014 and now has its own proxy political parties.
The junta began easing the ban in September, when it allowed political parties to resume organizing ahead of an election expected in February.
It still retains sweeping powers to maintain law and order despite lifting the ban, including conducting searches, freezing assets, and making arrests.
The Election Commission confirmed the Feb. 24 election date on Tuesday, just before a statement announcing the ban on political activity had been lifted was published in the Royal Gazette.
""The people and political parties will be able to take part in political activities during this period leading up to the election in accordance with the constitution,"" the statement said..

The ""Bells of Balangiga"" landed in a military cargo plane at a Manila air base ahead of their return on Saturday to a church in Samar, the central island where U.S. troops in 1901 massacred hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Filipinos to avenge an ambush that killed 48 of their comrades.
""I'm a little bit excited and a little bit emotional. At last we have seen the bells,"" Father Lentoy Tybaco, the parish priest of Balangiga, told domestic television as the bells were lifted from boxes and displayed on a runway. 
Two of the bells had been on display at an air force base in Wyoming, the other at a U.S. army museum in South Korea. 
Their return follows years of lobbying by former presidents, priests and historians, and challenges from Wyoming veterans and lawmakers opposed to dismantling a war memorial, resulting in legislation that barred their removal.
The battles in Balangiga that took place toward the end of the 1899-1902 Philippine-American War marked one of the darkest chapters of U.S. colonialism.
Historians say the bells were rung to signal the start of the surprise attack on American forces, who retaliated with a massacre in which women and children were killed. 
Last year U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis promised Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte that he would push hard for their return, which Duterte had demanded during his annual state of the nation address.
The move could help to appease Duterte, who has made a point of lashing out regularly at Washington, despite a tight U.S.-Philippines defense alliance.
He has condemned what he sees as the United States' history of hypocrisy, arrogance and political interference.
Dueterte has yet to visit the United States as president, calling it ""lousy"", although his foreign minister last month hinted the bells' return might prompt a change of heart.
Giving the bells back was ""overwhelmingly viewed as the right thing to do"", said Sung Kim, the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines. 

""Our militaries have fought together, bled together, at times died together,"" he wrote in the Philippine Star newspaper. ""As your ally and friend, we will forever honor and respect this shared history.""

The five missing crew of a KC-130 Hercules refueling plane were officially declared deceased.
""We know this difficult decision was made after all resources were exhausted in the vigorous search for our Marines,"" Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell Maury, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps' (USMC) Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron, said in a statement.
""Our thoughts are heavy and our prayers are with all family and friends of all five aircrew.""
Two marine pilots flying an F/A-18 Hornet jet fighter and the five crew members onboard the KC-130 Hercules went missing in waters about 320 km (200 miles) off the Japanese coast following what U.S. officials have said may have been a mid-air collision.
One of the two Hornet pilots found by search and rescue teams died. The other was injured. 
U.S. and Japanese ships and aircraft did not, however, locate the crew of the Hercules. Both aircraft flew from the USMC's Iwakuni air station in Japan. 
The accident added to a lengthening list of U.S. military aviation accidents around the world in recent years. 
The spate of incidents has prompted Congress to hold hearings to address concern over the toll on personnel and equipment taken by continuous combat operations, deferred modernization, lack of training, and aging equipment.

The military government imposed the strict ban when it took power in a 2014 coup, citing the need for law and order after months of street protests against the democratically elected government of former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra. 
It began easing the ban in September, when it allowed political parties to resume organizing.

""The people and political parties will be able to take part in political activities during this period leading up to the election in accordance with the constitution,"" the military government said the statement.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was trailing on Tuesday in three big heartland states, two TV networks said, as counting began from local elections seen as a final trial of strength for Prime Minister Narendra Modi before general elections next year. 
Analysts say a big loss for the BJP would signal rural dismay and help unite opposition to Modi, though his personal popularity remains high, despite criticism that he was unable to deliver on promises to create jobs for young people and improve conditions for farmers.
The elections are also a test for Rahul Gandhi, the chief of the main opposition Congress party, who is trying to forge a broad alliance with regional groups to mount the most serious challenge to Modi yet in the election that must be held by May.
In the western state of Rajasthan, the Congress was leading in 81 seats of the 199-member assembly against the BJP's 56 in the initial round of voting, India Today TV said. 
In the central state of Chhattisgarh, the Congress was ahead in 46 of the 90 seats at stake with the BJP at 22 and was holding to a slender lead in the most populous state at stake, Madhya Pradesh, the network said.
The Times Now channel also said the BJP was trailing in all three states, where it had grabbed almost all the parliamentary seats in its landslide win in the last general election in 2014.
Poll analysts cautioned that with the counting in preliminary stages, it was too early to predict the outcome of state races involving millions of voters.
Local issues usually dominate state polls, but politicians are seeing the elections as a pointer to the national vote just months away.
The Indian rupee dropped as much as 1.5 percent to 72.465 per dollar, while bond yields rose 12 basis points to 7.71 percent after the resignation of the central bank governor.
The broader NSE share index was down 1.3 percent with investors cautious ahead of the state election results. 
Equity analysts had warned that Monday's surprise resignation of Urjit Patel, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, after a long tiff with the government, could send the markets crashing.
""As the three erstwhile BJP states have a large agrarian population, the BJP's drubbing could be interpreted to mean that farm unrest is real,"" Nomura said in a research note.
""A rout of the BJP on its homeground states should encourage cohesion among the opposition parties to strengthen the non-BJP coalition for the general elections.""
Regional parties are likely to retain two smaller states that also report results on Tuesday, southern Telangana and northeastern Mizoram, the polls show.
Gandhi, the fourth generation scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, has sought to build a coalition of regional groups, some headed by experienced firebrand, ambitious politicians.
Congress has already said it would not name Gandhi, who is seen as lacking experience, as a prime ministerial candidate.

""When one and one become eleven, even the mighty can be dethroned,"" opposition leader Akhilesh Yadav said of the prospect of growing opposition unity.

SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Kneeling in front of riot police, 32 religious leaders and activists were arrested at the U.S. border fence in San Diego on Monday during a protest to support the Central American migrant caravan. 
More than 400 demonstrators, many leaders of churches, mosques, synagogues and indigenous communities, sought a halt to detention and deportation of migrants and for the United States to welcome the caravan that arrived in Tijuana, Mexico in November.
Singing and praying, religious leaders moved forward in lines of four to six, some wearing T-shirts reading, ""Love Knows No Borders."" They were handcuffed and led away by federal agents upon entering a restricted area in front of the fence.
""As a Quaker who believes in our shared humanity...We’re calling on the U.S. to respect the rights of migrants,"" said Joyce Ajlouny, general secretary of the American Friends Service Committee, which has run a week of actions to back migrants.
U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Theron Francisco said 31 people were arrested by Federal Protective Services for trespassing and one was arrested by Border Patrol for assaulting an agent.
The arrests marked the second confrontation with U.S. authorities since the caravan reached Tijuana. U.S. Border Patrol agents fired tear gas at migrants on Nov. 25 after they said they had stones thrown at them.
Thousands of migrants are living in crowded shelters and encampments in Tijuana after traveling from Central America to escape poverty and violence. They may have to wait weeks or months to claim asylum at the U.S. border.
Data released on Monday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) showed asylum claims at the U.S.-Mexico border rose 67 percent in the 2018 fiscal year from a year earlier.
U.S. immigration officials say these claims, most of which are accepted, exploit a legal loophole allowing migrants to enter the United States while they await a court hearing on their asylum case. 
""As the majority of these claims will not be successful when they are adjudicated by an immigration court, we need Congress to act to address these vulnerabilities,"" CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in a statement.
Protest leaders said President Donald Trump had portrayed the caravan as a security threat to advance his ""anti-immigrant"" agenda and further restrict migrants' ability to seek asylum.

A U.S. judge in November blocked Trump's proclamation to bar migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally from seeking asylum.

Under pressure from the United States, Mexico is grappling to halt the northward flow of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America.
Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told a United Nations-backed conference on migration in Marrakech that the investment would accompany a broad policy shift he expected would stem migration better than ""containment measures."" 
He did not detail what policies Mexico may change, or exactly how the $30 billion investment will be funded and deployed. 
""What happens to a migrant today in our nation is a disgrace,"" he said, seated beside counterparts from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras who have pledged to work together on regional development.
""Mexico can't let this happen anymore."" 
Several thousand people set off on foot in a caravan from Honduras in October, enduring hot sun and rain on the long route in hopes of reaching the United States.
Roughly 6,000 made it to Mexico's northern border city of Tijuana, many encountering hostility from locals and dirty conditions at crowded shelters. 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, is pushing for U.S. support to fight poverty and crime in Central America that prompt thousands of people to abandon their homes every year and risk the journey north. 
He says his plans for major infrastructure projects, including a refinery and two railways, will provide jobs to both Mexicans and Central Americans. 
Ebrard previously said Mexico was likely to invest more than $20 billion in southern Mexico, and that El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras should each match that sum. 

On Monday, he added that the three countries just south of Mexico had finished an initial ""diagnostic"" and were expected to present their priority projects at the beginning of 2019.

1457,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>",Accused Russian agent Butina poised to plead guilty: U.S. court papers,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Accused Russian agent Maria Butina, suspected of trying to infiltrate the National Rifle Association and influence U.S. policy toward Russia, is expected to plead guilty this week following a deal between her lawyers and U.S. prosecutors, according to court filings on Monday.
Exactly how the deal will be structured for Butina was not immediately clear. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington scheduled a hearing for Wednesday.
CNN reported on Monday that Butina had already begun to cooperate with prosecutors, citing one source familiar with the matter. A representative for the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment on the case.
ABC News first reported that Butina would cooperate with prosecutors. 
Butina, a former American University graduate student, had previously pleaded not guilty to U.S. charges in July that she was acting as an agent of the Russian government and conspiring to take actions on Russia's behalf.
Prosecutors have accused her of working with a Russian official and two U.S. citizens to try to infiltrate the powerful NRA lobby group that has close ties to Republican politicians including President Donald Trump, and influence Washington's policy toward Moscow.
Butina’s lawyers previously identified the Russian official as Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of Russia’s central bank who was hit with U.S. Treasury Department sanctions in April.
One of the two Americans mentioned in the prosecutors' criminal complaint was Paul Erickson, a conservative U.S. political activist who was dating Butina. Neither Erickson nor Torshin has been accused by prosecutors of wrongdoing.
Butina's cooperation will mainly focus on telling investigators about the role of Erickson and her interactions with Russian officials, CNN reported.
The case against Butina is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington and the National Security Division, and not U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and any coordination between Moscow and Trump campaign members.
The government's complaint against Butina did not explicitly mention Trump's campaign. Trump has denied any collusion with Moscow occurred. 
Reuters previously reported, however, that Butina was a Trump supporter who bragged at parties in Washington that she could use her political connections to help get people jobs in the Trump administration.
In a Dec. 8, 2016, class project at American University, she gave a presentation titled ""What Might President Trump's Foreign Policy Be Toward Russia?"" and listed several of Russia's policy objectives, according to a copy reviewed by Reuters.
Whether she could help shed any light on contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia is not known.

Moreover, the prosecutors in her case have previously made mistakes, including erroneously accusing Butina of offering sex in exchange for a position in a special interest group. The errors could possibly have helped give Butina more leverage in reaching a plea deal.

Such a move by Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, would be a sharp shift in Brazilian foreign policy, which has traditionally backed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
Ambassadors from Arab nations are expected to meet in Brasilia on Tuesday to discuss Bolsonaro's plan to follow U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to recognize Jerusalem is Israel's capital, according to the Arab diplomat who asked not to be named.
The letter to Bolsonaro from the league's Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit and delivered to Brazil's foreign ministry said the decision on where to locate an embassy was the sovereign decision of any country.
""However, the situation of Israel is not normal, seeing that it is a country that has been occupying Palestinian territories by force - among them East Jerusalem,"" the letter said. 
Moving the embassy to Jerusalem would be considered a violation of international law and the United National Security Council resolutions, Aboul Gheit said.
The embassy move has been praised as ""historic"" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who plans to attend Bolsonaro's presidential inauguration, according to the Brazilian's transition team.
""The Arab world has much respect for Brazil and we want not just to maintain relations but improve and diversify them. But the intention of moving the embassy to Jerusalem could harm them,"" the diplomat said.
Brazil is one of the world's top halal meat exporters and that trade could run into trouble if Bolsonaro angers Arab nations by moving the embassy. That could hurt exports to key Middle Eastern markets for Brazilian beef and poultry producers BRF SA and JBS SA. 
Halal meat is butchered and prepared as prescribed by Muslim law. 
The meat exporters lobby has pressed the incoming president not to move the embassy, and he appeared to change his mind.

But the president-elect's son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, speaking after recently visiting Trump advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner at the White House, said the embassy move was ""not a question of if, but of when.""

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 04:52PM ET</span>",U.S. sanctions three North Korean officials for alleged rights abuses,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Monday it had sanctioned three North Korean officials, including a top aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, for serious human rights abuses and censorship.
The U.S. Treasury named the men as Ryong Hae Choe, an aide close to Kim who leads the Workers' Party of Korea Organization and Guidance Department; State Security Minister Kyong Thaek Jong; and Propaganda and Agitation Department head Kwang Ho Pak.
It was not clear whether the decision to sanction the three men was related to U.S.-North Korean nuclear diplomacy, which has made little obvious progress since Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump met in Singapore in June. 
The sanctions, which freeze any assets the officials may have under U.S. jurisdiction and generally bar them from transactions with anyone in the United States, were announced as the U.S. State Department released a six-monthly report on North Korean abuses.
""Human rights abuses in North Korea remain among the worst in the world and include extrajudicial killings, forced labor, torture, prolonged arbitrary detention, rape, forced abortions, and other sexual violence,"" State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said in a statement accompanying the report.
North Korea has repeatedly rejected accusations of human rights abuses and blames sanctions for a dire humanitarian situation. Pyongyang has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs. 
In a separate statement, the Treasury said the sanctions ""shine a spotlight on North Korea’s reprehensible treatment of those in North Korea, and serve as a reminder of North Korea’s brutal treatment of U.S. citizen Otto Warmbier.""
Warmbier was an American student who died in June 2017 after 17 months of detention in North Korea, which contributed to already tense exchanges between Pyongyang and Washington, primarily over North Korea's nuclear development program.
In the lead-up to the historic Trump-Kim summit in June, North Korea released three American prisoners, although talks between the two countries have since stalled. Last month, North Korea said it would deport another detained U.S. citizen.
Talks that had been planned for Nov. 8 between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol and that aimed to pave the way for a second summit were canceled with 24 hours' notice.

Trump has said he and Kim are likely to meet a second time in January or February, with three sites for a summit under consideration.

(Reuters) - The United States Olympics Committee failed to protect athletes from the threat of sexual abuse, according to a report released on Monday that showed some top executives took no action as the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal was unfolding.
The report, which was commissioned by the USOC and carried out by law firm Ropes & Gray, offered details on what it called the ""inaction"" of former chief executive Scott Blackmun and former chief of sport performance Alan Ashley.
Nassar, who was a team doctor for USA Gymnastics, was sentenced to up to 300 years in prison in two different trials last winter after more than 350 women testified about abuse at his hands, including Olympic champions Aly Raisman and Jordyn Wieber.
According to the 233-page report, Blackmun and Ashley were made aware of allegations against Nassar by then-USA Gymnastics chief executive Steve Penny in July 2015 but neither shared the information with others in the organization.
The report also said that dozens of girls and young women were abused during the year-long period between mid-2015 and September 2016 when the Nassar story broke.
""The U.S. Olympic community failed the victims, survivors and their families, and we apologize again to everyone who has been harmed,"" Susanne Lyons, an USOC independent board member and the incoming board chair, said in a statement.
Blackmun resigned in February for medical reasons. Ashley was fired on Monday after USOC Chief Executive Sarah Hirshland was made aware of the report.
The report called Nassar's ability to abuse athletes for nearly 30 years ""a manifestation of the broader failures at USAG and the USOC to adopt appropriate child-protective policies and procedures to ensure a culture of safety for young athletes.""
According to the report, which included interviews with more than 100 witnesses and had access to over 1.3 million documents, Nassar found an environment in elite gymnastics and Olympic sports that proved to be conducive to his criminal designs.
The USOC has already implemented reforms and initiatives, including instituting new leadership and stronger accountability measures. It is also seeking to revoke USA Gymnastics' status as the national governing body for the sport.
Hirshland, who took over as USOC chief executive in July, said in the statement the organization will use the report's findings to do everything possible to prevent something similar from happening in the future.

""Sexual abuse, harassment and discrimination have no place in the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic community,"" she said. ""And it's on all of us – member organizations, institutions and individuals alike – to foster a healthy culture for competitive excellence.""

TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libya's National Oil Company (NOC) on Monday declared force majeure on exports from the El Sharara oilfield, which was seized at the weekend by a local militia group.
NOC said the shutdown would result in a production loss of 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) at its biggest oilfield, and an additional loss of 73,000 bpd at the El Feel oilfield.
Production at the Zawiya refinery was also at risk due to its dependence on crude oil supply from Sharara, NOC said in a statement, adding that it was ""reviewing"" evacuation plans.
Chairman Mustafa Sanalla NOC would not negotiate with the militia group. ""We will not pay a penny to anyone who closed the field ... and we will never sit with them,"" he told Alahrar TV.
NOC said armed militia had stormed the premises on Saturday after some guards and locals claiming to be attached to the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) force opened the gates.
Members of the group, which sources told Reuters included local tribesmen from the impoverished region, then drove around in jeeps, filming themselves in videos they sent to journalists.
They stayed overnight in the vast, partly unsecured area, making good on a threat issued in October to stop production if authorities did not provide more development funds.
In Libya armed men, often friends or relatives of existing guards, have regularly blocked oilfields to get added to the state payroll. At El Sharara there are at least 1,500 PFG members, though nearly 500 are in fact civilians, Sanalla said.
TRIBESMEN'S DEMANDS 
Libya is divided and run by two weak governments and armed groups, tribesmen and normal Libyans vent their anger about high inflation and a lack of infrastructure on the NOC, which they see booking billions of dollars in oil and gas revenues.
Sanalla said NOC had repeatedly informed the government in Tripoli about the problems at Sharara, which had been attacked 110 times since 2011, the year Muammar Gaddafi was toppled. 
But there was little coordination between the PFG in south-western Libya and the capital, he said. 
Before the force majeure, Libya had been producing up to 1.3 million barrels of oil a day, its highest level since 2013 when a wave of oilfield blockages started.
Oilfield blockades tend to be solved by authorities quickly giving more money to guards or locals living close by.
This blockade might be more complicated to resolve because the group that seized the facility included tribesmen, who have said they want funds to improve hospitals and other services which might take time to deliver.

Sanalla said the NOC had made good on its promises of help to southern communities, but the government was responsible for resolving the broader situation in the south.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia is seeking to boost its power in Europe and grip over Ukraine with the proposed Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, the top U.S. energy diplomat said on Monday, in a step-up of Washington's rhetoric against the pipeline.
""Through Nord Stream 2, Russia seeks to increase its leverage of the West while severing Ukraine from Europe,"" Francis Fannon, the U.S. assistant secretary for energy resources at the State Department, told reporters in a teleconference.
The pipeline has been opposed both by President Donald Trump, a Republican, and his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama as a political tool for Russia to consolidate power over Europe.
Much of the gas that Europe currently gets from Russia via pipeline goes through Ukraine, which collects billions of dollars in transit charges making up to 3 percent of its gross domestic product.
If Nord Stream 2, which aims to bring Russian gas to Western Europe via the Baltic Sea, and TurkStream, a pipeline to bring gas from Russia to Turkey, are completed it would mean transit revenues would evaporate, 
""It's kind of just what's left over that would be transited, potentially transited, through Ukraine,"" Fannon said. ""Even then that's only based on whether we can trust (Russia President Vladimir) Putin, I don't think the record should indicate anyone should.""
Putin has said that Nord Stream 2, a consortium of Russia's state-controlled Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and five European companies, is purely economic and not directed against other countries. Russian gas could continue to go through Ukraine if the pipeline is completed, Putin has said.
But Russia has stopped shipments of gas to Ukraine in winter in recent years over a series of pricing disputes. Critics of Nord Stream 2 say it could increase Russia's ability to manipulate European energy markets. In an increase in tensions, Russia last month seized three Ukrainian naval ships off the coast of Russia-annexed Crimea in the Sea of Azov after opening fire on them. 
Germany's foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said this month that Berlin will not withdraw its political support for Nord Stream 2 and that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had secured a pledge from Putin in August allowing gas shipments across Ukraine's territory.
Fannon made his comments after traveling to Eastern Europe to discuss projects that could offer Europe a more diverse natural gas supply. Those included a floating liquefied natural gas terminal on the Adriatic island of Krk that could one day receive gas imports from the United States, which is increasing its exports of the fuel, or the eastern Mediterranean.

Fannon said he expected Russia's aggression in the Sea of Azov to boost support for several bills in the U.S. Congress that include new sanctions on Russia's energy sector, though he refrained from commenting on any particular legislation.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Usually, a golden rule for a news photographer covering a scene of angry confrontation is to get close, but not involved. Sometimes, though, it's hard to avoid.
In recent days, “yellow vest” protests have spread to Belgium from France. I followed hundreds of people marching through Brussels on Saturday to demand lower fuel prices and better living conditions.
They were blocked from reaching the government quarter by riot police using water cannon and tear gas. Some of the crowd hurled rocks and firecrackers at them.
I could see the police were losing patience. So I picked a position close to them, so they could see I was a journalist doing my job and not part of the protest.
Police squads started surrounding protesters, sending in snatch teams to arrest individuals. As the march was organized on social media without approval from the authorities, police took the view that anyone involved can be detained and taken away. Most are quickly released without charge.
When one young man was seized, a young woman with him rushed toward the line of police, shouting that he had done nothing wrong. She had no mask or helmet and nothing in her hands. She wasn't even wearing one of the fluorescent yellow vests adopted by the movement.
As she yelled at a policewoman, another officer standing behind the front rank pointed and fired a pepper-spray gun, dousing the young woman in the face. The photo I took dramatically captured the white liquid's moment of impact and her anguished expression.

She turned away crying and sat down on the road, her eyes and face inflamed. I had a bottle of eyewash as part of my own safety equipment. I put my camera down, asked her to look up and carefully dropped the soothing liquid into her eyes.

RIMBO, Sweden (Reuters) - U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths said on Monday Yemen's warring parties had yet to agree on main sticking points in peace talks, including a ceasefire in Hodeidah and reopening Sanaa airport, but that consultations would continue.
The talks in Sweden are set to last until Dec. 13. Grifffiths said another round would be held early next year in the effort to end a war pitting the Iranian-aligned Houthi group against the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
""I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement on de-escalation to reduce fighting in (Hodeidah and Taiz). I am hoping that we can, we are not there yet,” he told reporters.
The mediator, who last week launched the first peace talks in two years, wants to avert a full-scale assault on the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, now under the control of the Houthis.
The group controls most population centers, including the capital Sanaa, which it seized in 2014 after ousting Hadi's government, now based in the southern port of Aden.
The Houthis told Reuters they want Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions of people, to be declared a neutral zone.
The Saudi-backed government said it is open to a U.N. role in the seaport, but rejected a long-term presence in Hodeidah.
Foreign Minister Khalid al Yamani told Reuters on Monday that the city should be placed under the control of the interior ministry's police forces as a matter of sovereignty.
""The concept of peacekeeping or some sort of permanent presence of the U.N. - boots on the ground - or making the city as neutral is something that we will never accept,"" said Yamani, who heads the Hadi government delegation.
SOME CONCESSIONS MADE
However, the government is willing to accept the deployment of monitors from the U.N. Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) in the port, the Houthis' main supply line and the entry point for most of Yemen's commercial goods and aid supplies. 
It could also accept the transfer of port revenues to the central bank in Hodeidah instead of routing them to Aden, the minister said.
Soaring prices have put basic commodities out of reach for many in Yemen, where more than 8 million people are facing starvation. The central bank has struggled to pay public sector wages on which many depend as foreign exchange reserves dwindle. 
The U.N. is working with the International Monetary Fund and other partners to reunite the central bank after Hadi’s government moved it from Sanaa to Aden in 2016.
The Sweden talks aim to secure confidence-building steps to pave the way for a political process to end nearly four years of war that have killed tens of thousands of people.
""It is very difficult to convince parties who are fighting each other to put down their weapons and give their trust to the agreements that the others propose,"" Griffiths said.
He said the number of prisoners to be released under a deal agreed on Thursday would be announced soon, but that the United Nations was still seeking ""common ground"" on reopening Sanaa airport.
Another sticking point is a transitional governing body. Hadi's government insists the Houthis disarm first, while the Houthis say this would require agreement on a unity government and timeframe for the transitional period.
Prospects for the talks have risen as Western nations, some of which supply arms and intelligence to the Sunni Muslim Saudi-led coalition, press for an end to the war.

The alliance intervened in Yemen in 2015 but has faced military stalemate since seizing Aden the same year.

KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Governments should not use the violent protests in France that were sparked by a carbon tax increase as an excuse to stem policies to curb global warming, French officials said on Monday.
French Secretary of State for Ecology Brune Poirson, and Laurent Fabius, who presided over the 2015 Paris climate agreement, said countries must keep up the momentum of that U.N. deal which aims to limit temperature rise to between 1.5 degrees to 2 degrees Celsius by 2030. 
""It would be a error to think that because there are problems in France, we should abandon ecological transition,"" Fabius told reporters on the sidelines of the U.N. climate conference in Poland.
The former foreign minister whose handling of the Paris negotiations earned him worldwide praise, said countries could not afford to curb climate policies because the consequences would be even more devastating.
""We must move towards that transition, but the transition must be just,"" he said, adding that policymakers must ensure that funds earmarked for green policies are used for that purpose, which was not the case in France.
Speaking in a separate briefing, ecology minister Poirson said one of the key messages from the protests was that green taxes had to target industries and not just citizens, and governments needed to communicate their aims more clearly to the public.
She said the French government was exploring ways to revamp fiscal policies to achieve environmental aims. 
""That means embracing green budgeting. It is really difficult because it means radically changing they way our institutions, the way our bureaucracy work. But I don't see how we could do it differently,"" Poirson said.

The so-called ""yellow vests"" protests in France prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to call for the end of what he said was a ""ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement."" Trump has already pulled out of the deal.

Wafa, the Palestinian Authority news service, said on its website that troops entered the server room and went through recordings at its main office in West Bank city of Ramallah.
""They withdrew from the agency's office after they took copies of the security camera footage,"" it said.
An Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment.
On Sunday, a Palestinian drive-by shooting targeted a group of Israelis at a bus stop next to a settlement, critically wounding six people, the military said. 
""Our security forces ... are pursuing those murderers. They will capture them. We will deal with them to the fullest extent of the law and settle the score with them,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in broadcast remarks on Monday.
A statement from the army on Monday said it was searching nearby villages for the perpetrators. It was unclear if the Wafa raid was connected to the shooting.
Mobile phone footage on Wafa's website showed five soldiers inside the newsroom, instructing employees to open a room as someone is heard saying ""the cameras are in there.""
Israeli soldiers were also seen operating elsewhere in Ramallah on Monday, requesting businesses to hand over security camera footage. 
Clashes broke out in some areas between stone-throwing Palestinians and Israeli soldiers firing teargas. Two Palestinians were injured by live fire, a Palestinian medical official said.

The Palestinian journalists' union condemned the Israeli raid on Wafa as ""a blatant violation committed by the occupation army against all Palestinian media.""

MADRID (Reuters) - Jailed Catalan separatists who have gone on hunger strike are protesting against their treatment by the Spanish judicial system but have no intention of starving themselves to death, one told Reuters.
Jordi Sanchez, one of nine Catalan politicians in pre-trial detention on charges including misuse of public funds and rebellion in relation to Catalonia's independence declaration last year, started a hunger strike on Dec. 1 alongside another separatist leader. Two others did so on Dec.3.
""I love freedom and life. I've made clear from the start that this hunger strike is not about risking my life. It's about protesting in the court of public opinion that the Constitutional Court has deliberately neglected to protect my rights,"" Sanchez said in answers to questions sent to him by Reuters.
""The idea that a hunger strike must lead to death is distorted,"" he wrote from his cell in the Lledoners penitentiary near Barcelona.
Catalan nationalists say they cannot get a fair trial in Spain and accuse the courts of failing to take their appeals into account. The Spanish government says justice is following its course and it cannot intervene.
""The decision to continue or end the hunger strike does not depend on one single concrete act,"" Sanchez said in his first interview with international media since starting the hunger strike that he said was aimed at turning the spotlight on the Constitutional Court.
The interview took place as signs of divisions appeared among Catalan nationalists over their future course.
The head of Catalonia's pro-secession government, Quim Torra, at the weekend praised what he called ""the Slovenian way"" to independence, saying Catalonia should follow suit - prompting some Spanish political leaders to say he was calling for armed insurrection.
Slovenia, an Alpine state of two million people, was part of communist Yugoslavia until 1991 when it declared independence, an event followed by a 10-day war.
Asked about the success of far-right Vox, which won 12 seats in Andalusia's regional parliament for the first time since Spain's return to democracy, Sanchez denied it was a reaction to Catalonia's independence drive, a view voiced by some analysts.

He said the far-right's rise in Spain was due to opposition to immigration.

ROME (Reuters) - Twenty cobblestones commemorating members of two Italian Jewish families who were deported to Auschwitz or killed in Rome were dug up and stolen in the early hours of Monday in an apparent anti-Semitic attack.
The bronze-capped cobblestones were embedded into the pavement outside a building in Rome's central Monti neighborhood that was home to the Di Consiglio and Di Castro families until World War Two.
Police said they were investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.
Asked about the incident at a news conference, deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, who is also interior minister, said he would do everything to stop such acts of ""repugnant anti-Semitism"".
The cluster of stones commemorated 18 members of the Di Consiglio family and two from the Di Castro family. Fifteen were deported to Auschwitz in 1944 and died either there or in an unknown place.
The other five were among the 335 Italian men and boys, including 75 Jews, killed in the Ardeatine Caves outside Rome in March 1944 by occupying Nazis. They were murdered as a reprisal for the killing of 33 German policemen by partisans.
On Monday morning, a gaping hole remained where the stones were.
""This is beyond vandalism. This is a deliberate attempt to deface memory,"" said Ylenja Lucaselli, a parliamentarian of the of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party.
The writing on each stone started with the words ""Here lived"" followed by the name of the person, the date of deportation or arrest and the place and date of death, if known.
The project to place such stones throughout Europe where victims of the Holocaust either lived or worked was started by German artist Gunter Demning in 1992.
Adachiara Zevi, a Jewish community leader and head of the group that places the commemorative stones around Italy, said they are commonly known as ""stumbling stones,"" because they are meant to provoke thought. 

Last year, vandals damaged about 70 Jewish graves at Rome's main cemetery.

The European Union wants the so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to help preserve the economic benefits for Iran deriving from the curbs it placed on its nuclear program under a 2015 deal with world powers, from which President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in May.
EU diplomats had hoped to have the SPV in place by now but ran into delays as member states balked at hosting it for fear of being targeted by the revived U.S. sanctions regime against Iran.
Asked about progress on the SPV, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told reporters: ""I would expect this instrument to be established in the coming weeks so before the end of the year as a way to protect and promote legitimate business with Iran.""
She did not offer any other details following a meeting of the bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels but said work on creating the mechanism was ""advancing well"".
France and Germany are now due to take joint responsibility for the SPV. But EU diplomats have said its ambitions could be scaled back to encompass only less sensitive items such as humanitarian and food products - rather than oil trade.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told the bloc's ministers in a closed-door meeting in Brussels on Nov. 19 that Paris and Berlin were working closely together to achieve something by year-end, two other EU diplomats said.
The discussion came as EU nations have debated potential new sanctions on Iran after accusations of Iranian attack plots in France and Denmark.
""Our strong support for the implementation of the JCPOA (2015 nuclear deal) doesn't mean we turn a blind eye for other issues,"" Mogherini told reporters.
Until now, the EU has been straining to uphold the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers, but has been less willing to consider sanctions, instead seeking fresh talks with the Islamic Republic.

Iran has warned it could ditch the nuclear deal if EU powers do not protect its trade and financial benefits.

Dubbed the ""maniac of Angarsk"" after his home city in Siberia, 54-year-old Mikhail Popkov drove victims to secluded spots where he killed them with axes, knives or screwdrivers. Some were also raped. 
He was detained in the Russian Far East in 2012 two decades after he began his killing spree and was sentenced to life imprisonment in January 2015 for 22 murders and 2 attempted murders. 
He confessed to 60 more crimes, including 59 murders, after he was convicted. 
Investigators said on Monday that Popkov had provided evidence allowing officers to exhume the remains of victims killed 15-20 years ago, along with their personal effects and the weapons he had used to kill them.
Investigators said Popkov's victims were women aged from 16 to 40. He also killed one man, a fellow police officer. 
A state prosecutor told the court that Popkov had a phenomenal ability to recall minute details of his crimes, including the clothes, tattoos, and jewelry worn by his victims, RIA news agency reported. 
Andrei Chikatilo, known as the Rostov Ripper, was convicted in 1992 of killing over 50 people. He was executed. 
In 2007, supermarket worker Alexander Pichushkin was convicted of killing 48 people. He became widely known as the chessboard killer as he had hoped to put a coin on every square of a 64-square chessboard for each of his victims.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union blacklisted nine locals involved in last month's rebel elections in east Ukraine on Monday, but was unlikely to heed swiftly Kiev's call for more reprisals against Moscow over the latest flare-up of tensions in the Azov Sea.
Ukraine's Pavlo Klimkin asked the EU's 28 foreign ministers in Brussels to step up sanctions against Moscow but the bloc is deeply divided on Russia and is not seen acting swiftly, if at all.
Instead, it will look at offering more assistance to Ukraine, which had its Black Sea peninsula of Crimea annexed by Russia in 2014 and then saw Moscow back separatists in the industrial east.
The ministers discussed with Klimkin ""the support of the European Union to Ukraine, to Ukrainian people, to territorial integrity of the country"", said the bloc's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini. 
Klimkin said he asked the EU to push for the release of Ukrainian sailors held by Russia after the incident off Crimea in late November and to consider setting up an international monitoring mechanism to ensure freedom of navigation in the Kerch Strait.
""I've asked about different types of sanctions,"" Klimkin said, adding he had proposed options from targeting more individuals to hitting Russian ports and assets in Azov Sea.
On Monday, the EU added nine locals in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of east Ukraine to its blacklist as a follow-up to the separatist vote held there earlier in November, bringing the total number of people barred from the EU over turmoil in Ukraine to 164. 
""They further undermined the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,"" the bloc said. ""The EU considers these 'elections' illegal and illegitimate and does not recognize them.""
Those blacklisted include Leonid Pasechnik, named as the rebel head in Luhansk. His Donetsk counterpart, Denis Pushilin, was blacklisted in 2014 as one of the initial leaders of the Russia-backed revolt. 
Any assets they have in the bloc are also frozen, as are those of a further 44 entities.
AZOV SEA
Kiev has called for more Western sanctions against Moscow after Russian patrol boats fired at Ukrainian navy ships in the Azov Sea. 
Klimkin said the EU promised him to consider that and also to look into aid for Donbas and southern Ukraine, including safeguarding water supplies for the Azov Sea port of Mariupol. Ukraine fears Mariupol could be a future target for Russia.
But the bloc is split on whether to go ahead with any new economic sanctions, a move that would require unanimity of all 28 member states. 
""We don't see yet any decision-making today,"" Austria's Karin Kneissl - who hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin at her wedding earlier this year - said when asked about more sanctions against Moscow.
On the other side of the spectrum is Lithuania, a leading EU hawk on Russia. Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said the Azov Sea standoff was a ""blatant violation of international law"" by Russia and could not be left unanswered.
""I don't expect something to be decided today but sanctions relating to this topic must be on the table,"" he said.
The 28 EU national leaders, who meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, are, however, due to extend the bloc's existing sanctions that target Russia's defense, energy and banking sectors.
Germany's Haiko Maas said the situation in the Azov Sea remained unresolved as Russia was still holding the Ukrainian sailors. Berlin and Paris were seeking to ease tensions between Moscow and Kiev.
Fighting between Ukraine and Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014 and small-scale but deadly exchanges of fire are still frequent. 
Citing the Russian threat, Ukraine in November introduced martial law and banned Russian men of combat age from entering the country. The EU has since released 500 million euros in financial assistance to Kiev.

Fireworks were scheduled to be set off later in the evening. The government has made the date a national holiday and dubbed it ""victory day"" but some Iraqis felt little cause for celebration, however.
Little meaningful reconstruction has taken place in cities decimated by battles against the jihadists between 2014 and 2017, and Iraq is in the throes of a new political crisis which has prevented it forming a government that can tackle widespread corruption and lack of jobs and services.
Meanwhile Islamic State militants are still carrying out insurgent-style attacks against security forces and have been blamed for car bombs and assassinations of local notables.
""Iraqis are scared that the problems in parliament ... and the inability to form a full cabinet ... have helped create the (unstable) environment for Islamic State cells to re-emerge,"" Najah Jameel, 48 a civil society activist, said.

Last week U.N. special Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said there was ""no major military territorial conflict"" at present, but Damascus has sworn to retake every inch of Syria and there is no sign of an imminent peace deal. 
The tide of the 7 1/2-year-old conflict turned in the government's favour in 2015 with the intervention of Russian air power to supplement Iran-backed militias fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad. 
The army general command issued an administrative order on Monday ending active service for conscripted officers who will have completed five extra years, beyond their original 18-month term of mandatory military service, in January. 
The order, which takes effect next week, also demobilizes reserve officers who joined in 2013 and who will have completed five years of reserve service by January. 
The army began demobilising some conscripts who had served long periods in May, shortly after it took back eastern Ghouta, the last major rebel enclave near the capital Damascus. 
After the conflict erupted in 2011, desertions, defections and deaths drained the Syrian army. It has relied on critical support from Shi'ite militias including Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, though devastating Russian air strikes on rebel areas proved decisive in Assad's military comeback. 
Syria conscripts men at age 18 into the army. During the conflict many conscripts said they were serving additional years with no sign of being discharged.

Damascus announced an amnesty in October for men who deserted the army or avoided military service, giving them several months to report for duty without facing punishment.

MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Villagers in the northern Afghan province of Faryab have appealed to the government for help after being cut off from food supplies for weeks by a Taliban blockade, local people and officials said.
Faryab, in the far northwest of Afghanistan, has seen a surge in fighting this year as the Taliban have battled both government forces and Islamic State militants for control of the zone's valuable transit routes into neighboring Turkmenistan.
Residents of Pashtun Kot district in the centre of the province say they have been unable to feed their children properly for weeks because of Taliban blockades of roads leading into the district.
""So far seven women, with a child and an old man, have died of hunger,"" said Wali Mohammad, a resident of Sar-e Howz, an area of Pashtun Kot.
""The area has been under siege by the Taliban for months and for the past two months they have been blocking roads into Faryab center so we can't get food.""
Mohammad Taher Rahmani, head of the local provincial council, said that around 1,000 families in the area were facing hardship in increasingly cold winter weather.
""If food aid doesn't reach them there will be a humanitarian disaster,"" he said.
Karim Yourush, spokesman for the local police, said the Taliban had targeted a dam providing drinking water and water for irrigation in the area but efforts were under way to reopen roads.
The conflict in Afghanistan has intensified over recent months, even as moves toward possible future peace talks have accelerated.
Western officials say both the Taliban and government forces are trying to make gains on the battlefield to shore up their positions if negotiations to end the war take place.
Much of Afghanistan is suffering from food shortages as a result of one of the worst droughts for years and aid groups have been struggling to help people in isolated regions.
Javid Bidar, spokesman for the Faryab provincial governor, said two lorries of food had been delivered already and security forces were preparing an operation to relieve the area.
Local residents say they are being pressed by Taliban fighters to move to other areas under insurgent control.
""We're short of food and if the government doesn't send food, people here will die,"" said Amir Mohammad. ""Over the past few days, more of our children have been falling sick.""
""We've held out so far but the Taliban are telling us to get out and go to the areas they control.""

The survey in 12 countries that are home to 96 percent of European Jews showed widespread malaise at a rise in hate crimes which Jewish communities blame in part on anti-Semitic comments by politicians that stoke a climate of impunity.
Feelings of insecurity were particularly acute among Jews in France, followed by Poland, Belgium and Germany, the study by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) found.
Facing hostility online and at work or in graffiti scrawled on walls near synagogues, nine out of ten Jews living in nations which have been their home for centuries feel that anti-Semitism has worsened over the past five years, the study said.
""It is impossible to put a number on how corrosive such everyday realities can be, but a shocking statistic sends a clear message ... more than one third say that they consider emigrating because they no longer feel safe as Jews,"" FRA'S director Michael O'Flaherty was cited as saying in a foreword to the study. 
EU officials presenting the report in Brussels on Monday called on governments to do more to combat such hate, including commemorating the history of the Holocaust in which the Nazis killed at least six million Jews in Europe during World War Two.
""What we need now is concrete action in the member states to see real change for Jews on the ground,"" European Commission deputy head Frans Timmermans told reporters. ""There is no Europe, if Jews don't feel safe in Europe.""
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn are among the most prominent EU leaders battling accusations of anti-Semitism by Jewish community leaders.
Worries over the hostile rhetoric are underscored by government figures in several European countries showing a spike in violence against Jews.
Following a number of high-profile attacks targeting Jews, soldiers and armed guards at the doors of synagogues or Jewish schools have become a familiar site in Europe.
Eighty-five percent of the 16,395 polled identified anti-Semitism as the biggest social and political problem, while almost a third said they avoid attending events or visiting Jewish sites.
However, 79 percent of those who experienced harassment said they did not report the incidents to authorities.
The results showed a loss of faith in their governments' ability to keep them safe, the European Jewish Congress (ECJ) said, causing Jews to feel torn between emigrating and cutting themselves off from their Jewish community.
""This is intolerable and a choice no people should have to face,"" ECJ head Moshe Kantor said in a statement.
A government spokeswoman in Germany said the results of the study were shocking, adding that the interior ministry ""isn't looking at it idly.""

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - A U.N. war crimes courtroom in which a Bosnian Serb general was prosecuted for atrocities committed during the siege of Sarajevo has been moved to the Bosnian capital to preserve the legacy of the first attempt to hold war criminals to account since World War Two.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which closed down last year after prosecuting 161 suspects for crimes committed during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, had agreed to move the original courtroom and archives to Sarajevo, where 11,000 people were killed during the siege.
""Sarajevo is the first city after Nuremberg which has the original courtroom of an international criminal tribunal and ... a possibility to witness its mandate,"" said Mila Eminovic, the head of the ICTY Information Centre in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The aim is to establish similar centers in Serbia and Croatia.
When the ICTY was set up in 1993 it was the first serious attempt to hold war criminals responsible for their actions since the Nuremberg trials after World War Two.
The court's architects hoped that establishing what happened during the war and punishing its worst offenders would help reconcile Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims.
However, divisions remain in the Balkans, where the court had aimed to bring reconciliation, but convicted war criminals are often revered as heroes.
The ICTY courtroom 2, which displays the original furniture and robes of the judge and prosecutor, was where Bosnian Serb General Dragomir Milosevic was sentenced to 29 years in prison over his role in the Sarajevo siege. 
A conference room with computers and TV screen provides access to millions of the court's documents and thousands of hours of video material from the trials.
""Access to this unique database is very important in confronting the culture of denial of the crimes,"" said Almir Alic, Bosnia's representative to the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, which succeeded the ICTY.
Nejra Lilic, a 22-year-old student, said her visit to the center was a very emotional one since she had lost all her male relatives in the 1995 Srebrenica genocide. 

""Young people are not interested in the past because they equate it to the conflict, and by avoiding the topic of the past they think they can avoid conflict,"" she said.

The attacks were planned from Syria's rebel-held Idlib province and were timed to coincide with Lebanon's general election that took place in May, he said in a televised news conference. 
Lebanon's Internal Security Forces monitored the plot and thwarted it, he said. The country remains safe for both residents and visitors, he added. 
Lebanese authorities say they have disrupted or foiled numerous attacks in recent years, including some linked to the conflict in neighboring Syria. From 2013-2016 jihadist militants struck Lebanon repeatedly with bomb attacks
Idlib province is part of the last remaining stronghold in Syria outside government control and much of it is held by jihadist rebel groups including the country's former al Qaeda affiliate. 
Lebanon shares power among its religious sects and has maintained a ""dissociation"" policy of staying out of regional conflicts. 

However, Lebanon's Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah has played a key military role in Syria supporting President Bashar al-Assad against mostly Sunni rebels seeking to oust him.

LONDON (Reuters) - Protesters disturbed a U.S.-sponsored event promoting fossil fuels on the sidelines of U.N. climate change talks on Monday.
The event called ""U.S. innovative technologies spur economic dynamism"", touting the benefits of burning fossil fuels more efficiently, infuriated campaigners and many government delegations who want the talks to focus on moving away from coal, oil and gas.
Some 100 protestors in the audience at the event seized a microphone and interrupted opening remarks by Wells Griffith, the man President Donald Trump appointed as senior director for energy at the National Security Council.
They waved banners and chanted: ""keep it in the ground"".
""I'm 19 years old and I'm pissed,"" shouted Vic Barrett, a plaintiff in the ""Juliana vs U.S."" lawsuit filed in 2015 by 21 young people against the government for allowing activities that harm the climate. 
""I am currently suing my government for perpetuating the global climate change crisis ... Young people are at the forefront of leading solutions to address the climate crises and we won't back down.""
Before the interruption, Griffiths said it was important to be pragmatic in dealing with climate change in a world still heavily reliant on fossil fuels.
""Alarmism should not silence realism ... This administration does not see the benefit of being part of an agreement which impedes U.S. economic growth and jobs,"" he said.
The conference, in Katowice, Poland, aims to work out the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement, the global pact on combating climate change.
The United States, the world's top oil and gas producer, is the only country to have announced its withdrawal from the accord.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - An intense snow storm was easing up on Monday after it dumped up to two feet of snow in Virginia, left one motorist dead in North Carolina and cut off power for more than 300,000 people in the U.S. southeast.
The storm headed out to sea but the region will stay cold this week, the U.S. National Weather Service said. 
Motorists in northern Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia can expect snow and ice to taper off on Monday, NWS meteorologist Bob Oravec said. 
""It's fairly light and some of it is actually mixing with rain in North Carolina, so it won't be as bad as it was in the last 24 hours,"" Oravec said. 
The storm dropped its heaviest snow in the appropriately named Whitetop, Virginia, tucked in the Appalachian Mountains along the western end of the Virginia-North Carolina border, the NWS said. Whitetop received two feet (60 cm) of snow, while Greensboro, North Carolina saw 16 inches (41 cm) and Durham, North Carolina got 14 inches (36 cm). 
""Some of the higher totals occurred in higher elevations, but there were high totals in the more populated area of North Carolina as well,"" Oravec said. 
A motorist died and a passenger was injured in Matthews, North Carolina, on Sunday when a tree fell on their vehicle as it was traveling, causing the driver to plow through the front lawn of a church and slam into the building, Matthew police officials said in a statement. 
In Kinston, North Carolina, divers searched for a driver whose 18-wheeler was found in a river, a NBC affiliate in Raleigh reported.
More than 300,000 customers were without power in the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia, Poweroutage.us reported. 
The storm prompted more than 1,000 flight cancellations at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport, the sixth-busiest airport in the country, and other airports across the region, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware, early Monday. 

North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Sunday a state of emergency would remain in effect and the North Carolina National Guard had been activated to help with the response.

MARRAKESH, Morocco (Reuters) - U.N. members on Monday adopted a deal aimed at improving the way world copes with rising migration, but almost 30 countries stayed away from the ceremony in Morocco.
The pact, meant to foster cooperation on migration, was agreed in July by all 193 U.N. members except the United States, but only 164 formally signed it at the meeting on Monday.
Ten countries, mostly in formerly Communist Eastern Europe, have pulled out. Six more, among them Israel and Bulgaria, are debating whether to quit, a U.N. spokesman said after the pact was adopted. He did not say whether the rest of the countries absent from the conference in Marrakesh might also pull out.
With a record 21.3 million refugees globally, the United Nations began work on the non-binding pact after more than 1 million people arrived in Europe in 2015, many fleeing civil war in Syria and poverty in Africa.
But President Donald Trump's administration said the global approach to the issue was not compatible with U.S. sovereignty. 
Since July, the accord, which addresses issues such as how to protect migrants, integrate them and send them home, has been criticized by mostly right-wing European politicians who say it could increase immigration from African and Arab countries.
Angela Merkel, accused by critics of worsening the refugee crisis by opening Germany's borders in 2015, said cooperation was the only answer to tackle the world's problems.
""The pact is worth fighting for,"" the German chancellor, one of around a dozen national leaders in Marrakesh, told the forum. ""It's about time that we finally tackle migration together.""
Without naming Trump or his ""America First"" stance, she said multilateralism was the way ""to make the world a better place"".
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said migration needed better management and rich countries would benefit.
""In the many places where fertility is declining and life expectancy is rising, economies will stagnate and people will suffer without migration,"" he said in his opening address.
""It is clear that most developed countries need migrants across a broad spectrum of vital roles, from caring for elderly people to preventing the collapse of health services,"" he said. 
On Sunday, Chile withdraw from the pact, while Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel saw the biggest party in his coalition quit in a dispute over the accord.
In November, Austria's right-wing government, which holds the EU presidency, said it would withdraw, saying the pact would blur the line between legal and illegal migration.

Australia said it would not sign up to a deal it said would compromise its hardline immigration policy.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Bar associations from nearly 20 countries called on Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday to release Wang Quanzhang, saying that the lawyer has been held incommunicado for more than three years with his legal rights denied.
Wang, who took on sensitive cases of complaints of police torture and defended practitioners of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement, went missing in August, 2015 during a sweeping crackdown on activists.
""At the time of writing, he has been held incommunicado for over three years without any form of due process, and risks further deterioration of his health condition while in detention,"" said the petition letter to Xi issued on the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the initiative of the Geneva Bar Association.
""We are profoundly concerned about lawyer Wang, and all the other lawyers who face continuous harassment simply for the exercise of their mandate as legal professional and defenders of the basic rights of citizens,"" it said.
Chinese authorities launched what rights groups say was a coordinated attempt to quash China's rights movement in what is known as the ""709"" crackdown.
Charged in January, 2016 with alleged ""subversion of state power"", Wang is the only one of 321 lawyers and activists arrested in that crackdown who has yet to be tried or released, the letter said.
""We understand that no evidence of any form or shape has substantiated the charges put against him,"" it said.
""Wang Quanzhang was not given access to an independent legal counselor of his choosing and has been denied access to his family lawyer, who was allegedly intimidated into withdrawing from his case,"" said the letter, whose other signatories include the New York City Bar, the Swedish Bar Association, The Law Society of England & Wales, and the China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group.
Wang's wife Li Wenzu has filed 30 lawsuits demanding a trial for her husband, in line with Chinese law, it said, adding that she and their son have been harassed and denied the right to visit Wang. Li set off this year on a march of more than 100 kilometers from Beijing to Tianjin city where she believes her husband is being held.

China rejects foreign criticism of its human rights record and points to its successes in pulling millions of people out of poverty as proof of human rights progress in the country.

In coordination of Israel and the United Nations, Qatar has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to various Gaza projects that the partners say are designed to stave off Palestinian poverty and prevent escalations in violence. 
""They (Israel) said it would be discussed and they procrastinated ... We will renew our request,"" Qatari Ambassador Al-Emadi told the Gaza-based news agency SAWA.
""The Israeli side had security concerns and we told them we can resolve them by having the planes fly to Doha and return to Gaza from there and under Qatari security supervision,"" 
Israel had not responded, Al-Emadi said, but had proposed that such an airport be built on its side of the border - an idea the diplomat said had been rejected by Qatar.
Cogat, the Israeli government agency that has been coordinating with Qatar on the Gaza aid efforts, declined comment on Al-Emadi's remarks. Gaza is under the control of Hamas Islamists, who have fought three wars against Israel. 
In 1998, the Palestinians got their first international airport as a result of the historic peace treaty with Israel, but Israel destroyed its radar antenna and runway a few months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
The Israeli government deemed it a security threat at the height of the second Palestinian uprising known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada.
Israel withdrew its settlers and soldiers from Gaza a few years later, in 2005, but maintains tight control of Gaza’s land, air and sea borders. Egypt controls access from the south.
Israel says the restrictions are to stop weapons entering the Strip and to isolate Hamas, which has controlled Gaza’s two million population since 2007.

OSLO (Reuters) - Presidential elections in Democratic Republic of Congo this month could lead to conflict if they are not free, fair and peaceful and indications show that they will not be, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Denis Mukwege said on Monday. 
The elections on Dec. 23 will mark Congo's first democratic transfer of power and end President Joseph Kabila's rule that began in 2001 after the assassination of his father.
Mukwege will jointly receive the 2018 prize in Oslo for his work as a doctor who helps victims of sexual violence in the eastern Congo city of Bukavu. He has performed surgery on scores of women after they were raped by armed men and has campaigned to highlight their plight.
Nadia Murad, a Yazidi rights activist and survivor of sexual slavery by Islamic State, will also receive the prize.
(Graphic of Nobel laureates: http://tmsnrt.rs/2y6ATVW) 
""What I have seen as I was leaving my country did not reassure me,"" Mukwege told Reuters, hours before receiving the Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony in front of King Harald. 
""There is very little electoral preparation and a lot of military preparation. I am very worried that these elections will not be free, fair, credible and peaceful and that if there are massive frauds .... supporters (from losing candidates) will not accept them."" 
He said election authorities were struggling to meet deadlines ahead of the vote and that violence was worsening in the eastern borderlands with Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. 
""These ... elements suggest to me that oppression is being prepared, at the very minimum, and it could be that a war against its own people is being prepared,"" he said.
Kabila was due to step down in 2016 at the end of his constitutional mandate. But the election to replace him was repeatedly delayed, igniting protests in which dozens were killed.
Kabila told Reuters on Sunday preparations for the election were proceeding smoothly and he wanted it to be ""as close to perfection"" as possible.
He also said he planned to stay in politics when he steps down after elections and did not rule out running again for president in 2023. Critics say he could rule from behind the scenes if his candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, wins. 
Mukwege said Kabila had the right as every Congolese citizen to run for president in 2023 but he hoped voters would remember Kabila's ""broken promises"". 
""None of the elements needed to install a real democracy have been made during his time in power,"" he said.
A war in which some 5 million people died, most from hunger and disease, ended in 2003, but violence is still a problem and militias target civilians.
Mukwege called for pressure on manufacturers that use cobalt and coltan that Congo produces to control their supply chains to prevent child and slave labor.
He also called for pressure on Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda to pacify armed groups that fight in eastern Congo.
He also called on ""serious mining players"" to push the government to pacify the country's east so they can mine and do so ethically. 

It was not possible to reach a spokesman for the government.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Moscow residents have taken up car-sharing to combat soaring parking costs and a dwindling number of spaces, a trend that has made the Russian capital one of the world's fastest growing markets for such schemes.
Authorities in the city of 12.5 million have cut the number of parking spaces to encourage residents to walk while increasing parking fees to raise revenue and ease traffic in one of the world's most congested cities.
Those are among the factors that have seen the number of car-sharing journeys leap to at least 30,000 per day, or 9.1 million, between January and September this year, according to Moscow's city authority. JP Morgan put the number of daily car journeys at 60,000 this autumn. 
That's a big increase -- in 2016, there were just 45,000 car-sharing journeys in the entire year. 
Roman Tulnov is one of the new adopters. He sold his Audi A5 after working out it would be $50 cheaper a month to take a taxi to work and back home than to drive. Car-sharing came out at $100 cheaper a month. 
He based his calculation on car insurance, petrol costs, garage upkeep and the cost of changing tires every winter and spring, but did not factor in the price of parking, which can cost more than $20 for a full working day in the city center. 
""No car, no problem,"" Tulnov said.
""I don't need to worry when I'm going to book a tire change or if I'm going to make it before the first snowfall, I don't need to worry where I'm going to park. Last new year, some kind folk scratched my car with a key. Why do I need this headache?"" Tulnov said.
JP Morgan deems Moscow's car-sharing market to be one of the most developed among major world cities by number of cars and by their number per resident, in research reviewed by Reuters. 
There was one shared car per 5,000 residents in Moscow last year, while Washington was the leader with a car for 692 residents, JP Morgan found. 
Now, however, there is one car per 1,082 residents in Moscow and city authorities predict that number will fall to one car per 500 residents in the next few years.
There are 15 car-sharing companies operating in Russia, including Delimobil, Yandex.Drive, BelkaCar and YouDrive.
Owning a car is still seen by many Russians as a symbol of status and success, a legacy of the Soviet era, but the increased popularity of car-sharing means some Russians, especially in big cities, are less interested in ownership. 

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) research suggests that the car-sharing boom is not expected to undermine new vehicle sales because the service life of shared cars is 3.5 times shorter than privately-held ones.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 08:04AM ET</span>",UK court orders Indian tycoon Mallya to be extradited on fraud charges,"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya should be extradited from Britain to India to face fraud charges resulting from the collapse of his defunct  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines, a London court ruled on Monday.
India wants to bring criminal action against Mallya, 62, whose business interests have ranged from aviation to liquor, over $1.4 billion in loans Kingfisher took out from Indian banks which the authorities argue he had no intention of repaying. 
Mallya, who co-owned the Formula One motor racing team Force India until it went into administration in July, has denied all wrongdoing and argued the case against him was politically motivated.
Judge Emma Arbuthnot, England's chief magistrate, decided there was a prima facie case against Mallya, who moved to Britain in March 2016, and his human rights would not be infringed if he were extradited. Her ruling will now be passed to the interior minister who must also approve it.
Arbuthnot said there was no sign that the case had been brought for political reasons.
An extradition would be a huge win for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi months before an election, after opposition parties said the government had given a ""free passage"" to Mallya to flee, an accusation it denies.
Modi has faced pressure from political opponents to bring to justice several people who have fled India in recent years to escape prosecution in an array of cases, many of them loan defaults.
""KING OF GOOD TIMES""
Mallya, nicknamed ""the King of Good Times"" after the slogan on bottles of one of his premium beers and his hard partying lifestyle, was arrested by British police in April 2017.
Monday's ruling is unlikely to be the end of the long-running case. Mallya can appeal Arbuthnot's decision within 14 days to London's High Court. The interior minister's decision can also be appealed to the High Court and ultimately the Supreme Court.
The Indian government said Kingfisher took out a series of loans from Indian banks, in particular the state-owned IDBI, with the aim of palming off huge losses which Mallya knew the failing airline was going to sustain.
It argued that Mallya had no intention of repaying money it borrowed from IDBI in 2009 and that the loans had been taken out under false pretences, on the basis of misleading securities and with the money spent differently to how the bank had been told.
Westminster Magistrates' Court was told Mallya had been ""squirreling money away to keep it from the bank"". 
However, his defense team said the Indian government had failed to provide any substantial evidence to justify extraditing him.
His lawyer Clare Montgomery said Kingfisher had been open about what it needed the loans for and there had been no attempt to cover up losses. 

She said the Indian authorities had relied on testimony from people who were not involved at the time of the loans and that they had failed to prove any false statements had been made.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 07:21AM ET</span>","Climate change creates mutant fugu, a deadly Japanese delicacy","By Mari Saito
SHIMONOSEKI, JAPAN (Reuters) - The road, hemmed in on one side by empty warehouses and the other by a concrete seawall, ends abruptly in a desolate parking lot. Men step out of their cars and into the darkness, then slip behind the sliding doors of a warehouse. Inside, they huddle under floodlights and wait. A clock on the wall ticks to ten past three in the morning.
""Ready? Ready? Ready?"" shouts a man whose arm is covered to the elbow by a black nylon bag. One by one, the men step forward and their hands disappear into the bag.
And so begins a surreal auction in this port city in southwestern Japan. The buyers grip the dealer's hand, and after a few seconds of secret gesturing felt only by the auctioneer, he yells out the winning bid.
""13,000!"" Thirteen thousand yen, or $114, a kilo.
The furtive bidding, a relic of a time when fish traders wore kimonos whose sleeves obscured their hands as they signaled their bids, is part of the insular world of Japanese pufferfish, or fugu, a fish best known for its ability to kill a person in as little as a few hours.
Although deaths are extremely rare, the whiff of danger associated with the fish's poison is a significant element of the delicacy's enduring allure in Japanese culture. A kilogram fetches as much as 30,000 yen at the market here, and in the December holiday season, when fugu is particularly popular, a luxury fishmonger in Tokyo can sell up to $88,000 worth of the fish on any given day.
News of poisonings elicits fevered national coverage. When a supermarket in western Japan accidentally sold five packets of the fish without its poisonous liver removed in January, the town used its missile alert system to warn residents.
And now, climate change is adding a new element of risk: Fishermen are discovering an unprecedented number of hybrid species in their catch as seas surrounding the archipelago – particularly off the northeastern coast – see some of the fastest rates of warming in the world.
With pufferfish heading north to seek cooler waters, sibling species of the fish have begun to inter-breed, triggering a sudden increase in the number of hybrid fish. Hybrids are no more dangerous than your average lethal pufferfish. The problem is that they can be hard to distinguish from established species. To avoid accidental poisonings, Japan prohibits their sale and distribution. With the rise of these unclassifiable hybrids, fishermen and fish traders are having to discard a sizable share of their catch.
Kaniya, a seafood-processing company here in Shimonoseki, is one of many in the industry frustrated by the government's rule to discard such hybrids, considering that most subspecies of pufferfish frequently found in Japan's northeastern waters have poison in the same organs and can be safely eaten if handled correctly.
""But we have to follow the rules, because if there's any problems it leads to hysteria,"" says Naoto Itou, the gruff patriarch of the company.
Out of 50 or so species of pufferfish found around Japan, 22 of them are approved as edible by the government. Chefs and fish butchers handling pufferfish are specially trained and licensed to remove its liver and reproductive organs, which contain tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin. Confusingly, the location of the deadly neurotoxin differs in certain types of pufferfish; it can sometimes be found in its skin or muscle, as well as its reproductive organs.
Every morning at 8 a.m., Kaniya receives boxes of pufferfish from fishermen in northern Japan. By 9, an experienced fish handler is at his post in an apron and hairnet, sorting as many as seven or eight different groupings of pufferfish at a metal counter.
His bare hands moving quickly, the man picks up one slippery fish after another, holding it up for several seconds, examining its fins and checking for prickles. He pauses on one, turns it to the side, traces its back with his finger, then throws it into the discard pile.
The entire process has a hazmat feel: Workers in latex gloves, white masks and plastic aprons gut the fish and take away the toxic parts and dump them into a lock box. The waste is then collected and incinerated.
Asked why he would continue handling such inherently dangerous fish despite all the headaches surrounding hybrids, Itou points to two of his salesmen hovering nearby, fielding calls from buyers.
""Isn't it a blessing to be able to handle something customers love and want so much? There aren't many other fish out there like this.""
SWEEPING IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE
The rise in hybrid species is yet another example of the sweeping impact of climate change on marine creatures, which have undergone a mass migration as water temperatures increase.
Hiroshi Takahashi, an associate professor at the National Fisheries University, first noticed the increase in hybrid pufferfish six years ago. He started receiving calls from a scientific facility on the northeastern coast of Japan's main island that had buckets of pufferfish it couldn't identify. In the fall of 2012, nearly 40 percent pufferfish caught in the area were unidentifiable, compared to less than 1 percent studied previously.
""It wasn't one out of a thousand as it had been in the past; this was on a completely different scale,"" he says. To an untrained eye, hybrids are barely discernible. Even veterans in the industry say it's nearly impossible to tell apart ""quarters,"" or second-generation offspring of hybrid fish. At the end of June, more than 20 percent of pufferfish caught in a single day off the Pacific coast of Miyagi prefecture, 460 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, were hybrids.
Genetic tests found that the unidentifiable pufferfish were a hybrid of Takifugu stictonotus and Takifugu snyderi. Although they're close relatives, the T. stictonotus usually swim around the Sea of Japan and the T. snyderi in the Pacific Ocean. Takahashi believes that the T. stictonotus escaped their gradually warming habitat by riding the Tsushima current north and crossing the strait just below Japan's northern island of Hokkaido to emerge in the Pacific Ocean. There, they bred with their sibling species and multiplied. The resulting hybrid, which has fine spots and yellow-white fins, could pass for either one of its parent species.
A division of Japan's health ministry in charge of food safety said it began collecting information about the reported increase in hybrid pufferfish in September. Each prefecture has its own tests for issuing licenses to chefs and others, and an industry group has pushed the government to standardize those tests.
Before dawn on a recent weekday, dozens of hobby fishermen throng a deserted dock in the Ohara port, a two-hour drive from Tokyo, to get a chance to catch the creature. They return on the Shikishima-maru around noon, sunburnt and tipsy, carrying white buckets filled with pufferfish.
While the anglers smoke cigarettes and hunch over noodles, Yoko Yamamoto grabs a knife and sits down on a low plastic stool. She works quickly, first striking the fish's spinal cord, then peeling back its skin to remove its poisonous outer layer. Her son, who captained the boat, then takes over and slashes the fish to its gills to remove its liver and intestines as a moored fishing boat with pastel pink bench seats blasts ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" from its speakers.
We have to go a bit further now to find them,"" says Yukio Yamamoto, 49, crouching next to his mother. ""You see all kinds of hybrids now; it's been this way for the past few years.""
Toshiharu Enomoto, a 71-year-old hobby fisherman, walks over after his lunch and ties a knot in a plastic bag filled with ice and a few pufferfish. Laughing, he talks about the little thrill of the poison. ""Some people like it when they feel a bit of tingling on their lips,"" he says.
The Japanese have eaten the fish for thousands of years. After it was outlawed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a samurai general who unified Japan in the 16th century, peasants continued to eat it in secret and died in droves. The ban on fugu was finally lifted after World War II following years of petitioning by avid fans.
Despite its deadly nature, the fish has an almost comical face and, with its puffed cheeks and open mouth, looks as though it's perpetually surprised to be so sought after for special occasions.
In Tokyo, high-end restaurants serving pufferfish rely on Otsubo Suisan, a luxury wholesaler at the Toyosu fish market. At the company's wide stall, Koichi Kushida taps his smartwatch and answers calls on his silver Sony Bluetooth. In the span of an hour, the 34-year-old sells thousands of dollars worth of pufferfish.
""It's tasty, isn't it? It's a luxury and has class; that definitely attracts people,"" he says, deftly packing an airtight bag of gutted pufferfish into a golden box. With more hybrids appearing on the market, Kushida personally checks all the fish himself.

""When we hand it to our customers, we have to be sure it's absolutely safe,"" he says. ""We can't have any problems.""

KINSHASA (Reuters) - The European Union renewed sanctions on Monday against the ruling coalition's candidate for presidential elections in Democratic Republic of Congo, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, and 13 other senior officials.
The decision is likely to worsen relations between the EU and President Joseph Kabila's government, which has lobbied against sanctions it calls an illegal violation of its sovereignty. 
Kabila has also refused to accredit EU election observers despite concerns by opposition politicians, civil society activists and foreign powers about the credibility of the Dec. 23 vote.
He is due to step down next month after 18 years in power and wants Shadary as his successor. Many experts consider him the favorite given the ruling coalition's institutional advantages. 
The EU imposed sanctions in 2016 and 2017 on Shadary and 15 other nationals over violent crackdowns on protests and repeated delays to the election, which was originally meant to take place two years ago. Two of the 16 have since been transferred to a U.N. sanctions list. 
Shadary served as interior minister during some of the protests and as a senior official in Kabila's PPRD party. 
The sanctions include travel bans and asset freezes, the EU said in a statement, adding it would ""review the restrictive measures in the light of and following the elections in the DRC and stands ready to adjust them accordingly"".
The vote will mark the country's first democratic transition of power since independence from Belgium in 1960. 
Kabila told Reuters on Sunday his government planned to retaliate against the EU.
""There will be (retaliatory) measures, definitely, because we believe those sanctions are politically motivated,"" he said. ""We are not talking about expelling anyone but definitely we will have to pay back in kind one way or the other."" 
One of the leading opposition presidential candidates, Martin Fayulu, called on Saturday for the sanctions to remain in place. 

""The EU should reinforce its sanctions against Shadary to impede the Kabila regime since it's been the cause of many human rights violations,"" he said at a campaign rally in the city of Kisangani.

Her spokeswoman said that vote would go ahead as planned and described the conference call with ministers due at 1130 GMT as routine.
""The PM spoke to numerous leaders over the weekend. She spoke with presidents Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker, she spoke with Leo Varadkar, she spoke with Angela Merkel and she spoke with Mark Rutte. So it's usual for her to do that ahead of (an EU) council,"" she told reporters.

The protests followed a decision by a Supreme Court judge last week to grant an injunction to prevent the government from fining transport companies that did not comply with minimum freight rates.
The blockade on Brazil's BR-116 was causing back-ups of two km (1.5 miles) in both directions on Monday morning, according to the federal highway police.
In May, a truckers' strike in Brazil temporarily crippled parts of the economy and disrupted commodities markets.
One of the measures the government put in place to placate the truckers were minimum freight rates.

Encouraged by the Trump administration, Israel has sought better relations with formerly hostile Arab and Muslim countries that share its worries about Iran or see potential economic benefits.
Last month, Netanyahu and Chadian President Idriss Deby renewed relations severed by N'Djamena in 1972.
Netanyahu told a briefing of diplomats his talks with Deby had helped open up a new air corridor to South America. 
""At this time, we can overfly Egypt. We can overfly Chad, that has already been set. And to all appearances, we can also overfly this corner of Sudan,"" he said, pointing to a map. 
Netanyahu spokesmen did not elaborate and it was unclear when Israeli flights might be able to start overflying Sudan en route to South America, which the prime minister described as Israel's fourth-most important air-travel destination.
There was no immediate comment from Khartoum. 
Israeli diplomats say there have been low-level contacts with Sudan in recent years though the authorities there have been reluctant to acknowledge them publicly.
Israel had seen Sudan as an Iranian ally and accused it of serving as a conduit for arms smuggling to Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli diplomats now say they believe Sudan has distanced itself from Iran.
In recent months Israel has been assiduously courting Sunni Muslim countries, notably Gulf Arab states, who have also drawn closer to Israel over a number of years due to shared concerns about the rise of Shi'ite power Iran in the region.
Some Sunni Muslim powers worry that Iranian influence could foster unrest among their Shi'ite minorities.
In October, Netanyahu made a surprise visit to Oman, a Gulf state that does not formally recognize Israel. Netanyahu said on Monday that Omani leader Sultan Qaboos had agreed to overflights by Israeli airline El Al.

Waves of Venezuelan migrants have entered the border area in recent months, seeking refuge from poverty and hunger in the neighboring country. The thousands of refugees are straining public services and the state's finances.
The person in charge of the intervention will be Antonio Denarium, the governor-elect of Roraima, who is set to take office on Jan. 1. It will last until Dec. 31, said the decree published in Brazil's Diario Oficial.
The intervention means federal resources can be used to deal with public security issues and state legislature can be bypassed.
Temer said on Dec. 7 he had reached an agreement with the current governor for a federal intervention. Now the decree has been published in Brazil's official newspaper, the intervention becomes official.

Kramp-Karrenbauer, often dubbed ""mini Merkel"", narrowly beat the more conservative Friedrich Merz in a run-off vote of party delegates. Another conservative, Health Minister Jens Spahn, lost out in a first round.
The conservative bloc - made up of the CDU and their Bavarian CSU sister party - has slumped in polls since last year's federal election but picked up 3 percentage points to hit 32 percent in the Forsa poll for broadcasters RTL and n-tv.
The survey of 1,506 people was conducted after Kramp-Karrenbauer's election. The previous Forsa poll was published on Dec. 7, the day of the CDU vote.
The new support appeared to come at the expense of the Greens who dipped 3 percentage points while support for all other parties was unchanged.
The poll found half of voters (46 percent) thought the choice of Kramp-Karrenbauer was ""a good solution"" while around a quarter (24 percent) would have preferred Merz.
Almost two-thirds (62 percent) of CDU supporters thought Kramp-Karrenbauer was a good choice while 55 percent of those who back the Social Democrats (SPD) - Merkel's junior coalition partner - were pleased.
Merkel needs Kramp-Karrenbauer to unite the CDU to help steady her awkward alliance with the SPD that has come close to collapse several times since being formed in March.
The poll showed almost two-thirds (63 percent) of Germans wanted Merkel to remain chancellor until the legislative period ends in 2021 while around a third think she should leave office early.
Merkel has said she is prepared to remain chancellor until 2021.

The poll showed the SPD on 14 percent while both the pro-business Free Democrats and the hardline Left were unchanged at 8 percent. The far-right Alternative for Germany was on 13 percent.

Dozens of Kenyan government officials and business people have appeared in court since May on charges relating to the alleged theft of hundreds of millions of shillings from public coffers in a new drive to tackle widespread graft.
Joe Sang, the managing director of Kenya Pipeline Company, and five of his colleagues were charged with abuse of office in connection with the loss of funds in the construction of a fuel jetty in western Kenya worth 1.96 billion shillings ($19 million), a figure that exceeded the original budget.
Geoffrey Mwangi, the chief executive officer of the National Health Insurance Fund, his predecessor and 16 other officials were also charged with abuse of office an irregular award and extension of a contract in which 1.1 billion shillings was lost.
They all pleaded not guilty to the charges.
""The charges are generic but not serious,"" Ahmednasir Abdullahi, lawyer representing the Kenya Pipeline officials, said in court.
""I have instructions to apply for bail and accused should be admitted to reasonable bail terms."" 
A payments processing company and two of its directors were also charged over receiving the funds that were allegedly lost at the state health insurance fund.
They also pleaded not guilty.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to stamp out graft when he was first elected in 2013, but critics say he has been slow to pursue top officials. No high profile convictions have occurred since he took office.

Iran’s missiles currently cover a range of 2000 kilometers (1,240 miles) and many ""enemy bases"" are within 800 kilometers of the Islamic Republic, Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Revolutionary Guards' airspace division, was cited as saying. 
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear program in May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. He said the deal was flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran's development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.
""We have the ability to build missiles with a broader range,"" Hajizadeh said, according to Fars News. He added, “We don’t have limitations from a technical perspective or by conventions with regard to missile range.""
The Iranian government has ruled out negotiations with Washington over its military capabilities, particularly its missile program run by the Guards.
Last month, Hajizadeh said that U.S. bases in Afghanistan, the UAE and Qatar, and U.S. aircraft carriers in the Gulf were within range of Iranian missiles.
In October, the Revolutionary Guards fired missiles at Islamic State militants in Syria after the Islamist group took responsibility for an attack at a military parade in Iran that killed 25 people, nearly half of them members of the Guards.

Quoting a source who said they had read the full translated transcript of an audio recording, CNN said that Khashoggi recognized one of the men, General Maher Mutreb, who told him: ""You are coming back"".
Khashoggi replied: ""You can't do that...people are waiting outside.""
His Turkish fiancee Hatice Cengiz waited for hours outside the consulate on Oct. 2 and, when he did not return, contacted Turkish authorities about his disappearance.
There was no further dialogue in the relatively short transcript, prepared by Turkish authorities, CNN's source said. 
As people set upon Khashoggi, he started fighting for air, repeating, ""I can't breathe"" at least three times. The transcript then used singular words to describe the noises, including ""scream"", ""gasping"", ""saw"", and ""cutting"".
Turkish sources told Reuters a bone saw was used to dismember the journalist.
The transcript included no further mention of returning Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia, and no indication that he had been drugged - as Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor said in November.
One of the voices was identified in the transcript by Turkish authorities as Dr. Salah al-Tubaigy, a forensic expert specialized in autopsies attached to the Saudi Ministry of Interior, CNN reported.
Tubaigy tells others to put in earphones or listen to music like him, the CNN source said.
Mutreb, a senior intelligence officer who is part of the security team of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, called officials and gave step-by-step details of the operation, CNN reported, finally saying: ""Tell yours, the thing is done, it's done"".
Turkish officials said last week that the Istanbul prosecutor's office had concluded there was ""strong suspicion"" that Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide to Prince Mohammed, and General Ahmed al-Asiri, who served as deputy head of foreign intelligence, were among the planners of Khashoggi's killing.
Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh later said Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.
The kingdom has come under scrutiny as details of his killing came to light. Making some of their strongest accusations so far, both U.S. Republicans and Democrats said last week they want to pass legislation to send a message to Saudi Arabia that the United States condemns the death of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist.
A Turkish official said that by extraditing all suspects to Turkey, the Saudi authorities can address the international community's concerns.
Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Sunday ruled out their extradition. ""We don't extradite our citizens,"" he said at a Gulf Arab summit in Riyadh.

Last month, Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor's office said is seeking the death penalty for five individuals, and that 11 of 21 suspects have been indicted and will be referred to court in Saudi Arabia.

A day before the vote in the House of Commons, Ireland's Simon Coveney said the tentative Brexit deal ""is not going to change"". Britain's Jeremy Hunt warned of ""real risks"" if the agreement is voted down.
As the ministers were arriving for talks, the EU's top court ruled that Britain could unilaterally revoke its decision to leave the bloc, without the consent of the other 27 EU states.
""This is the best deal we can have,"" Spain's Josep Borrell told journalists on entering the meeting. ""This is the best deal and approving this deal would be a good thing, but for sure it's up to them.""
Germany's Haiko Maas echoed that: ""I hope that good decisions will be taken this week in London, employing the utmost reason.""
Britain is due to leave the bloc on March 29 but there is broad opposition to May's deal among British lawmakers. If the deal is voted down on Tuesday, it could mean more negotiations, delaying Brexit or ousting May, among other possibilities. 
While the bloc has insisted the deal would not be reopened, Coveney's remarks point to the possibility of tweaking the political declaration on the future EU-UK ties that accompanies the legal withdrawal treaty.
In any case, the Irish backstop - a key point of contention - would remain an essential part of the agreement, Coveney said.
EU national leaders will discuss the matter when they meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. 
The most damaging scenario for both sides would see Britain crashing out of the bloc with no agreement to mitigate the disruption in trade, economy and security cooperation.

Belgium's Didier Reynders said the EU was ready to move ahead with the tentative deal, but added: ""Or, we'll manage a no-deal.""

Secretary General Antonio Guterres sought to promote a global pact on migrant flows at a U.N. conference in Morocco on Monday, saying developed countries needed more migration due to their declining birth rates and aging populations.

In July, all 193 U.N. members except the United States finalised the non-binding pact. But since then, the text has come under fire from right-wing European politicians who say it could lead to an increase in migration. 
At least six European Union members - mostly in Eastern Europe - have shunned the accord. On Sunday Chile was the latest country to pull out, while Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel saw the biggest party in his coalition quit in a dispute over the accord.
""In the many places where fertility is declining and life expectancy is rising, economies will stagnate and people will suffer without migration,"" Guterres said in his opening address.
""It is clear that most developed countries need migrants across a broad spectrum of vital roles, from caring for elderly people to preventing the collapse of health services,"" he said.

South Korea's customs agency found in August that some firms had imported coal from North Korea in violation of U.N. resolutions aimed at choking off funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The unidentified defendants were charged on Friday with bringing in North Korean coal and other material by ""laundering the origin"" through fake certificates of origin from Russian ports, after the old route for North Korean coal, through China, was blocked due to sanctions, the Daegu District Public Prosecutors Office said in a statement.
""It appears that the defendants wanted profit from arbitrage, using the fact that the prices of North Korean coal and other materials are low due to their difficulty to be traded internationally,"" the office said. 
One of the four, a 44-year-old woman, was arrested for bringing in some 28,962 tonnes of coal and 2,010 tonnes of pig iron from North Korea, worth about 4.3 billion won ($3.83 million) and 1.1 billion won respectively, between April-October 2017, the office said. 
South Korea's Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Act prohibits the import of North Korean products without special approval from the minister of unification. 
The woman was also charged with violating customs law by bringing in some 4,156 tonnes of coal briquettes from North Korea, worth about 800 million won, by falsifying customs records to say they were semi coke, the office said.
The other three people, who are indicted without arrest, were found to have brought in, or abetted the import of, millions of dollars worth of North Korean coal, pig iron and, or, coal briquettes during that time, the office said. 
The U.N. Security Council banned North Korea's sale of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood in August last year in a bid to cut by a third its $3 billion annual export income.
It also capped North Korea's import of crude oil and refined petroleum products in September. 
The United States has led the sanctions campaign to press North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs, but there have been signs that the U.S. campaign for ""maximum pressure"" has lost steam since North Korea sought to improve relations with South Korea, China, and the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for an unprecedented summit in Singapore in June to discuss North Korea's denuclearization and the easing sanctions..

BEIJING (Reuters) - Police have detained dozens of churchgoers and leaders of one of China's most prominent Protestant ""house"" churches, congregation members and activists said, in the latest government action against unregistered religious groups.
Teams of police and state security officials in the southwestern city of Chengdu came to the homes of leaders and members of the Early Rain Covenant Church late on Sunday and detained them, according to church announcements sent to members and passed to Reuters by churchgoers and activists.
""The time has come. O, Lord! Did you not establish this church for this very purpose?"" the church said in one of its announcements.
""We will wait for Thee, as one keeping vigil waits for daybreak."" 
More than 100 people are believed to have been detained, said a church elder, who declined to be identified.
Neither the Chengdu nor national-level Public Security Ministries responded to faxed requests for comment.
China's constitution guarantees religious freedom, but since President Xi Jinping took office six years ago, the government has tightened restrictions on religions seen as a challenge to the authority of the ruling Communist Party.
Chinese law requires that all places of worship register and submit to government oversight, but some churches have declined to register, for various reasons. 
The Early Rain Church is one of the best known unregistered ""house"" churches in China.
Members of the church have been unable to contact pastor Wang Yi, the church's founder, or his wife, and church groups on the instant messaging platform WeChat had also been blocked, the church said in an announcement.
Reuters was unable to reach Wang for comment.
Beijing-based journalist Ian Johnson, who wrote about Wang and his congregation in his 2017 book The Souls of China, said on Twitter that the crackdown was ""really disturbing news"".
""I'm afraid this is part of a bigger crackdown on unregistered Christian churches as the government pushes its efforts to dominate society,"" he wrote.
Police told Zhang Xianchi, 84, a well-known author and church member, not to visit the church, because it had been ""outlawed"" and that all its top leaders had been detained, according to an account from Zhang shared with Reuters by church members.
A video posted online by activists in China and overseas, which Reuters was unable to independently verify, showed a group of about a dozen plainclothes policemen taking church-goers away from a meeting. 
In the footage, police told a woman they were taking a man to the municipal public security bureau to be investigated, while a child cried in the background.
""I'm telling you, we are enforcing the law,"" a policeman said to the woman.
Churches across China have more pressure to register since a new set of regulations to govern religious affairs came into effect in February and increased punishments for unofficial churches.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2018 01:31AM ET</span>",Indian state elections could halt Prime Minister Modi's winning streak,"By Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is staring at election losses in big heartland states, polls show, suggesting that farm distress and a lack of jobs for growing numbers of young people could prove stumbling blocks for his re-election bid in May.
India counts votes on Tuesday from five states that chose new assemblies over the past month, but exit polls show Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could lose the three most important races, while it has little presence in two smaller states dominated by regional parties.
The loss would be the biggest for Modi's Hindu nationalists since they swept to power in 2014 general elections, followed by wins over the past four years in 22 of India's 29 states, on promises of thousands of jobs and a doubling in farm income.
Politicians view state polls, though they are usually decided by regional issues, as a pointer to the mood of the BJP's traditional voting base, ahead of a general election that must be held by May.
""The results will set the tone for the 2019 election,"" said Sachin Pilot, a leader of the main opposition Congress party.
Congress is tipped to win in the western state of Rajasthan, scrape through in the central state of Chhattisgarh and is locked in a photo finish with the BJP in neighboring Madhya Pradesh. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are among India's biggest states.
""The BJP has made a lot of tall claims about income, jobs etc,"" Pilot added. ""They came out with 28 slogans, 'Swachh Bharat' ('Clean India'), 'Make in India' and such, but how many were implemented?""
Modi remains the frontrunner for the general election, however, trailed in personal ratings by his main challenger, Congress president Rahul Gandhi.
Modi promised to clean up India and turn it into a top tourist destination as well as lift the share of manufacturing in its economy to a quarter of gross domestic product, following the example of China.
But it has grown only slightly, to 17 percent, with nearly all the ambitious clean-up programs for cities and the river Ganges, as well as the Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic industrial base, largely unfulfilled.
Anger over weak farm prices, slow growth in rural wages and small businesses hit by a new nationwide goods and service tax has also boiled over, provoking protests by tens of thousands of farmers in Delhi and Mumbai.
Although the BJP might drop a few seats because of anti-incumbency sentiment, it was not losing everything, as some surveys forecast, said party spokesman G.V.L. Narasimha Rao. 
""They have underassessed the BJP,"" he added. ""They have done it previously too.""
Surveys often prove wrong, partly because it is tough to forecast the outcome of elections involving India's millions of voters.
HINDU FIRST
Still, a poor performance could prompt the BJP to push its brand of Hindu nationalism harder, politicians and analysts say.
""The BJP campaign will focus on nationalism, Hindutva and corruption,"" said Shekhar Gupta, a political analyst, using a term that refers to the party's Hindu-first plank.
Hindus make up about 80 percent of India's population of 1.3 billion, while Muslims are about 14 percent.
Already hardline groups associated with the party have reignited their campaign for a temple to the god-king Rama at a site where Hindu zealots razed a 16th-century mosque in 1992.
Thousands of Hindu monks and activists linked to the BJP gathered in New Delhi on Sunday in a show of force to back the temple.
Hindu fringe groups have stepped up a campaign against the slaughter of cows, which many in India consider sacred, as vigilante groups target Muslims in the livestock trade.
Modi is expected to try to recover political ground with giveaways in the next few months for small businesses and farmers, who make up a big chunk of voters.
""The state elections will be seen as a litmus test of Modi’s popularity,"" said Simon Finch, fund manager at London-based Ashburton Investments.
""However, we would expect any blemishes to be met with a continuation of the populist measures increasingly evident during the past four years.""

The killing has shocked residents of New Zealand, where serious crimes are relatively rare and camping in remote mountains and farmlands is widely regarded as safe for tourists and New Zealanders alike.
Grace Millane, who was traveling the world after finishing university, went missing in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, on Dec. 1.
Police found Millane's body on Sunday in a bush area just a few meters from a scenic drive in Auckland's Waitakere Ranges. The body had not yet been formally identified but police said they believed it to be that of Millane.
""On behalf of New Zealand, I want to apologize to Grace's family,"" Ardern told a weekly news conference in parliament.
There was an overwhelming sense of hurt and shame among New Zealanders that this happened in their country, she said.
""Your daughter should have been safe here and she wasn't, and I am sorry for that,"" Ardern said.
A 26-year-old man appeared in an Auckland court on Monday charged with murdering Millane. He was questioned by police after being seen with Millane at several places.
The man requested that his name be suppressed in media coverage but this was declined by judge Evangelos Thomas, according to Radio New Zealand (RNZ).
However, his lawyer Ian Brookie appealed against the judge's decision and the man cannot be identified until a decision on that appeal is made, RNZ reported. 
The man was remanded in custody until he appears in court in January.
Thomas also addressed members of Millane's family, who traveled from Britain to New Zealand and attended Monday's court hearing.
""I don't know what to say to you at this time but your grief must be desperate,"" Thomas said, according to RNZ. ""We all hope justice will be fair and swift and ultimately brings you some peace.""
Tributes poured in for the young backpacker from Essex, with flowers placed on Monday near the spot where her body was found. Nationwide candlelight vigils are being planned.

The case has also sparked a debate on Twitter about whether New Zealand was still safe for female backpackers and whether the killing would discourage women from traveling alone.

""There was a decline but it wasn't too significant,"" the airline's CEO Edward Sirait told television network CNN Indonesia. ""It was under 5 percent compared to the traffic at the same month last year.""
He said Lion Air did not ""clearly understand"" whether the crash was responsible for the fall in traffic in November, which he said was a low season for travel.
The airline, Indonesia's largest, is privately owned and does not publicly release traffic statistics or financial results.
Sirait said last week Lion Air was considering cancelling orders for 737 MAX jets but it had not yet made a decision.
Sources told Reuters that relations between the airline and Boeing had worsened in a spat over responsibility for the crash.
The airline has 190 Boeing jets worth $22 billion at list prices waiting to be delivered, on top of 197 already taken, making it one of the largest U.S. export customers.
Bankers and some analysts say Lion Air and Southeast Asian rivals over-expanded and would be comfortable with fewer orders.
Boeing has declined to comment on contractual matters but industry sources say aerospace companies rarely leave room for unilateral cancellations except in exceptional circumstances.

The cause of the Oct. 29 crash into the Java Sea has yet to be determined.

1522,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2018 11:18PM ET</span>",Acting Armenian PM's bloc easily wins parliamentary vote: commission,"By Hasmik Mkrtchyan and Margarita Antidze
YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia's acting prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, bolstered his authority as his political bloc won early parliamentary elections in the former Soviet country on Sunday, the Central Election Commission's (CEC) results showed.
My Step Alliance, which includes Pashinyan's Civil Contract Party, won 70.4 percent of the vote based on results from all polling stations, the CEC said on its website.
Results showed that two moderate opposition parties - Prosperous Armenia and Bright Armenia - got enough votes to clear the 5 percent threshold to enter parliament.
Pashinyan came to power in Armenia in May after weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism. The former newspaper editor, who was jailed for fomenting unrest in 2008, marked a dramatic break from the cadre of rulers who have run Armenia since the late 1990s.
He stepped down in October so parliament could be dissolved ready for the early election but remained the acting prime minister.
""Armenian citizens created a revolutionary majority at the parliament,"" Pashinyan told reporters at his bloc's headquarters after first results were published.
""If this trend continues, the majority won't face any problems in implementing legislative changes,"" he said.
After a change of power in the South Caucasus country of around 3 million people, Pashinyan's government sought to initiate changes to the electoral code. But the move was blocked by the former ruling Republican Party, which dominated the parliament.
The Republican Party received 4.70 percent of the vote and it was not clear whether it managed to enter parliament. Under Armenia's constitution, 30 percent of seats in parliament must go to opposition parties.
Former high-ranking officials were sacked and some were arrested following the change of power. An appeals court ordered the detention of former President Robert Kocharyan on Friday on charges of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order.
He was first arrested in July but freed the following month, and the case was sent to the appeals court. Kocharyan was Armenia's second president, serving from 1998 to 2008, when mass protests erupted over a disputed election.
Pashinyan promised after taking office there would be no major shifts in Armenian foreign policy and has offered assurances he will not break with Moscow.
Armenia hosts a Russian military base and is a member of Russia-led military and economic alliances. 
Pashinyan also suggested he would stick with existing policies on the long-running issue of Nagorno-Karabakh.
A mountainous part of Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh is run by ethnic Armenians who declared independence from Baku during a conflict that broke out as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991.

Though a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia still regularly accuse each other of conducting attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the Azeri-Armenian border.

Authorities urged residents to stay off the roads as snow, sleet, and freezing rain were expected to continue through Sunday night and into Monday morning, the National Weather Service said.
The agency reported between four and 12 inches (10 to 30 cm) of snow in some areas and warned about continuing snowfalls which could bring as much as a foot and a half (46 cm) from western and northern North Carolina to southwest Virginia. 
More than 380,000 customers were without power in the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Virginia on Sunday afternoon, Poweroutage.us reported. 
The storm prompted more than 1,000 flight cancellations at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport, the sixth-busiest airport in the country, and other airports across the region, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. 
North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Sunday that the state of emergency would remain in effect and that the North Carolina National Guard had been activated to help with the response.
The effects of the storm could last for days in the state, officials warned.
In North Raleigh, residents woke up to several inches of snow that blanketed roads, cars and homes. Many people took to Twitter to share photos of the unusually harsh weather, and the hashtag #Snowmageddon2018 was trending on Twitter on Sunday morning.
In South Carolina, snow gave way to sleet and rain as temperatures hovered around freezing, the South Carolina Emergency Management Division said on Twitter. 

The storm formed earlier this week off the Texas coast and moved east, lashing parts of Arkansas and Tennessee with icy rain.

MARRAKESH, Morocco (Reuters) - More than 150 countries will join a United Nations conference to adopt a global pact to better handle migrant flows, a senior U.N. official said on Sunday, less than the number that initially worked on the plan.
In July, all 193 U.N. members except the United States finalized the so-called Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration to better handle migration.
Since then, the text has come under fire from European politicians who say it could increase immigration. At least six European Union members - mostly in formerly Communist Eastern Europe - have shunned the accord
U.N. Special Representative for International Migration Louise Arbour said more than 150 governments had registered for the event in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh set to adopt the accord on Monday, without giving details.
The pact is not legally binding but can provide very useful guidance for countries facing migration, she told a news conference.
""Many challenges will stand in the way of its implementation, not least the toxic and ill-informed narrative that too often persists when it comes to migrants,"" she said.
In the latest political turmoil over the pact, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel relaunched his government on Sunday as a minority administration after the biggest party in his coalition quit in a dispute over signing the compact.
The right-wing N-VA pulled its ministers after Michel refused its demand that he not agree to the pact.
Also on Sunday, Chile's Interior Ministry Subsecretary Rodrigo Ubilla told El Mercurio newspaper that the country's representatives would not attend the event, saying: ""We have said that migration is not a human right. Countries have a right to determine the entry requirements for foreign citizens.""
In November, Austria's right-wing government, which holds the EU presidency, said it would also withdraw, saying the accord would blur the line between legal and illegal migration.
Australia also said in November would not sign up to the migration agreement because it would compromise its hardline immigration policy and endanger national security. nL4N1XV663
Among other leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose 13-year chancellorship has been marked by her open-door migrant policy, will attend the event.
The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is a framework for cooperation and aims to reduce illegal migration, help integrate migrants and return them to their home countries.

In Caracas and other cities around the country, many polling stations appeared near empty and few had queues. In interviews, Venezuelans said they preferred to use the day to shop for scarce food and medicine.
""People have no motivation. The crisis is a beating every day,"" said opposition lawmaker Francisco Betancourt in the city of Barinas, on Venezuela's west-central plains.
Venezuela is in its fifth year of a recession that has halved the size of the economy and forced 3 million people to emigrate to escape hyperinflation and rampant crime. 
Full results from Sunday's election are expected later today or tomorrow morning and the ruling Socialist Party is expected to dominate.
At the Escuela Josefa Victoriana Riera polling station in the arid northwestern city of Punto Fijo, only 366 people had voted by midday out of 2,510 registered voters, polling officials told Reuters, and a similar proportion was seen elsewhere.
The main opposition coalition also boycotted national elections in May, which President Nicolas Maduro won in a vote deemed a fraud by the United States, European Union and most other Latin American nations. Maduro says he is a victim of a U.S.-directed plot to force him from power and blames the crisis on sanctions imposed by Washington on his administration.
Even voters loyal to Maduro said they were not satisfied with his handling of the crisis. Johan Matheus, a 46-year-old oil worker in Maracaibo, said he was voting so that ""the revolution is consolidated.""
However, he added: ""It's necessary to make changes, because the economic situation is ugly.""
Maduro appeared on state television later in the day to cast his vote in Caracas.

""Despite the conspiracies that come from the White House to divide our country, we have a strong democracy,"" Maduro said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's conservative government is on course for a landslide election defeat, a widely watched survey showed on Monday, as Prime Minister Scott Morrison struggles to win favor with voters less than six months out from a national poll.
A Newspoll for The Australian newspaper showed Morrison’s government was on course to lose 21 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament. 
The Newspoll showed support of just 35 percent for the government, just one percentage point above its record low.
The poll caps a difficult last few weeks for Morrison, who saw his conservative government plunged into further minority form when a backbench lawmaker resigned to sit as an independent.
While Morrison secured a major legislative victory with the passage of a bill that will force tech firms such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to give police access to encrypted data, it failed to sway Australian voters.
The Newspoll showed Morrison's personal approval rating fell to a three-month low.
Facing a heavy defeat at the next election, due by May, Morrison has few tools in his armory to win over voters.
Australia's parliament will not sit until February, denying Morrison any opportunity to pass major legislation. 
Morrison said late last month his government would deliver its annual budget early, which would include Australia’s first budget surplus since 2007/2008. 

The budget, for the financial year beginning July 1, will be delivered on April 2, about a month earlier than usual.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile has become the latest country to pull out of a controversial United Nations migration pact, its interior ministry indicated, provoking fury among opposition parties who accused Sebastian Pinera’s government of “shameful and authoritarian” behavior. 
Rodrigo Ubilla, Chile's Interior Ministry subsecretary, told Chilean Sunday paper El Mercurio in an interview that the country's representatives would not attend the event to adopt the pact early next week in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh.
""Our position is clear,"" he said. ""We have said that migration is not a human right. Countries have a right to determine the entry requirements for foreign citizens."" 
Chile's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for confirmation of the policy.
The migration pact addresses issues such as how to protect people who migrate, integrate them into new countries or return them to their home countries. 
It is non-binding but has met fierce resistance from governments including the United States, Austria, Hungary and Poland who frame it as encouraging migration.
If confirmed, Chile's refusal to sign reflects its hardening stance towards migrants whose population has grown fivefold in 30 years amid influxes from Venezuela, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Colombia, among other Latin nations. 
Centre-right Pinera’s government came to office in March on a promise to enforce stricter measures. In recent months, it as put on “repatriation” flights for Haitian migrants wanting to come home, tightened visa controls and deported migrants with criminal records. (https://reut.rs/2QoeFbs)
Ricardo Lagos Weber, the president of the foreign affairs commission for Chile's senate, summoned foreign minister Roberto Ampuero to explain the closed-door decision. 
""This is not a great way to find out about a subject of such tremendous importance,"" he told El Mercurio. ""I understand that foreign policy is led by the President of the Republic but we could at least discuss it."" 
Hugo Gutierrez, a human rights lawyer and lawmaker for Chile's Communist Party, wrote on Twitter that Chile was advancing down ""the ultraright path of Trump, Netanyahu and Bolsonaro,” referring to the U.S., Israeli and Brazilian presidents.
Chile's Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party described the Pinera government decision as ""shameful and authoritarian."" 

Amnesty International said it was ""alarming."" ""Chile was an active part of this pact's negotiations and was considered one of the states that favored its implementation,"" Ana Piquer, Amnesty's executive director in Chile, told La Tercera newspaper. ""The last-minute decision not to participate in the Morocco summit seems a step back on its promise of affording rights to migrants.""

Turkish officials said last week that the prosecutor's office had concluded there was ""strong suspicion"" that Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and General Ahmed al-Asiri, who served as deputy head of foreign intelligence, were among the planners of Khashoggi's Oct. 2 killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel relaunched his government on Sunday as a minority administration after the biggest party in his coalition quit in a dispute over signing the U.N. migration compact.
Michel met King Philippe to remould his government as a three-party coalition of his French-speaking liberal MR and two Flemish parties, the center-right CD&V and Open VLD, after the departure of the Flemish N-VA following four years together.
With a federal election due anyway in late May, many observers see no immediate need for an early vote.
Michel told a news conference with his remaining ministers that the government would focus in the remaining months on the economy, defending Belgium's interests ahead of Brexit, security and climate change.
He also said he would speak with members of parliament to see how his minority government, with just 52 of 150 seats, could proceed, without saying which other parties he saw as potential allies.
The N-VA's exit left Michel with three ministerial posts to fill, along with portfolios, such as immigration, held by N-VA's two state secretaries.
Alexander De Croo, one of the deputy prime ministers, will become finance minister, Pieter De Crem, a former defense minister, becomes interior minister, while foreign minister Didier Reynders will add defense to his portfolio
The right-wing N-VA, which is the biggest party in parliament, pulled its ministers from the coalition after Michel refused its demand that he not sign the U.N. migration compact in Marrakesh on Monday, in a move critics see as an opening shot in the election campaign.
Michel had secured a large parliamentary majority last week in favor of maintaining Belgium's support of the United Nations text, with support from the opposition socialists and greens.
Since it was agreed by all U.N. states bar the United States in July, the text has run into criticism from European politicians who say it could increase immigration to Europe.
The N-VA risks electoral losses in its Dutch-speaking region to the harder-right, anti-immigration Vlaams Belang. Its leader Bart De Wever issued Michel an ultimatum that it would quit the government if he signed the non-binding U.N. declaration.

At least six EU states - mostly in formerly Communist eastern Europe - have already shunned the accord to regulate the treatment of migrants worldwide, a sign of how the bloc has turned increasingly restrictive on accepting refugees and migrants alike since a 2015 spike in arrivals.

The river banks were once a war zone between Israel and Jordan, and were littered with thousands of landmines and unexploded ordnance. The two neighbors made peace in 1994 but it took many years before the defusing and clearing began.
Seven churches have lain abandoned for more than 50 years in the area of operations, about a kilometer (half-mile) from the Qasr al-Yahud baptism site in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which is a major draw for Christian pilgrims. 
Israel's Defence Ministry said on Sunday that mine-clearing had been completed around three of the shrines - belonging to the Franciscan order and the Greek Orthodox and Ethiopian churches - though they have yet to be formally opened to the clergy or the public. 
""The clearing and releasing of this land, and the opportunity to return it to its religious guardians, is a project in which we take great pride,"" Marcel Aviv, head of the ministry's de-mining department, said in a statement.
Work around the other four shrines - Syrian Orthodox, Coptic, Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic - would take months to complete, Israel said. Engineers worry that some of them might have been booby-trapped. 
The Halo Trust, a Scottish-based charity that has cleared minefields worldwide and was once sponsored by the late Princess Diana, has also been involved in the project near Qasr al-Yahud. 
The charity's CEO, James Cowan, said donations had come from Christians, Jews and Muslims worldwide. 

""This Christmas/holiday season, the Halo Trust has reached a pivotal point in our work to clear the Baptism Site of landmines and other remnants of war ... which will ultimately benefit all humanity,"" he said.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Sunday President Emmanuel Macron was to blame for the ""yellow vest"" protests that have rattled France and urged Brussels to take heed of what was happening.
Salvini, head of the rightist League, has clashed repeatedly with Macron in the past over immigration policy and has leapt on the anti-government demonstrations rocking Paris as proof the French president has lost his political touch.
""History will probably show that if (Macron) had focused more on the French and less on Salvini and Italy, he would have a few less problems today,"" Salvini, flush from the success of a mass rally in Rome on Saturday, told Rai 3 TV.
""Macron reduced taxes for the very well-off and increased them for those less well off,"" he added, saying the Italian government had no intention of following this example.
France's ""yellow vest"" protests have taken aim at Macron's liberal economic reforms, and have forced the French government to cancel a planned rise in taxes on petrol and diesel.
Salvini said the Italian government was taking a very different path to Paris and defended its big-spending 2019 budget, which has fallen foul of the European Commission.
""Do people in Italy want scenes like we seen in Paris? ... No. I want to prevent this. I want to help businesses, families and also the 5 million poor people (here). A country with 5 million poor people can't move ahead,"" he said.
The Italian budget promises to lower the retirement age and introduce income support. The European Commission has rejected the package, saying it will not cut Italy's large public debt as the rules require, and has warned it could discipline Rome unless changes are made.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is looking to negotiate a compromise, but Salvini gave no indication on Sunday that the government was willing to make substantial alterations to its budget plans.
""Seeing what is going on in Paris, I refuse to believe that Brussels, for the sake of a few decimal places, will impose sanctions, inspectors and commissars. We are Italy. We have shown ourselves to be a serious country,"" he said.
The budget forecasts a deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product next year from 1.8 percent this year, and the commission has called for this target to be cut. 
Salvini said the initial calculations were being reviewed to see if the budget could be introduced with a deficit of ""2.4, 2.5 or 2.3"". 
Italian business leaders have also expressed concern over the budget, saying it doesn't do enough to help growth or encourage investment.
Looking to win over the industrialists, Salvini met representatives of 14 professional lobby groups on Sunday to hear their complaints and recommendations.

""For the first time in six months, this government is listening to us and we have entered a dialogue,"" said Vincenzo Boccia, head of the employers' group Confindustria. ""Now however we expect to see results, facts.""

The new Islamic revolutionary courts -- whose rulings cannot be appealed, except for death sentences -- were set up in August after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for ""swift and just"" legal action to confront an ""economic war"" by foreign enemies.
Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, quoted by the body's news website Mizan, said 29 Iranians and an Afghan foreign exchange dealer were found guilty of crimes including bribery, embezzlement and ""disrupting the economy"".
Many of the men were also fined, sentenced to lashes and had the ""ill-gotten"" part of their assets seized, Ejei said.
Iran's supreme court upheld the death sentence of a businessman for economic crimes, Ejei also said, weeks after the execution of two traders on similar charges.
Iranian officials have accused arch-foes the United States and Israel, as well as regional rival Saudi Arabia and government opponents living in exile, of fomenting unrest and waging an economic and media war to destabilize Iran.
The rial currency has lost about 65 percent of its value in 2018 under the threat of revived U.S. sanctions, with heavy demand for dollars and gold coins on the unofficial market from ordinary Iranians trying to protect their savings.
The cost of living has also soared, provoking sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption.

Lima (Reuters) - Peruvians began voting on Sunday in a referendum on a raft of political and judicial reforms introduced by the new government of President Martin Vizcarra aimed at stamping out corruption and cronyism in one of Latin America's most promising economies. 
The proposals were announced in August following a series of corruption scandals involving high-ranking officials and politicians, and were reluctantly approved by a unicameral congress dominated by the opposition.
The referendum asks Peruvians whether or not they agree with the creation of a second chamber in congress and a ban on the re-election of lawmakers. 
A total of 24.3 million eligible Peruvians are set to vote on whether to approve a bill that regulates the financing of political parties, and the overhaul of the National Council of Magistrates, a seven-member panel that selects and oversees judges and prosecutors, following an influence-trafficking scandal in July.
Election day began at most polling stations at 8 am local time (1300 GMT) with the polls set to be open for eight hours. The vote is mandatory in Peru, under penalty of a fine.
Vizcarra, who took office in March after the resignation of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski amid accusations of corruption, has been accused by the opposition of politicizing the vote, resulting in a lack of enthusiasm among Peruvians weary of politicking and scandal.
""We are not saying that these reforms will resolve the problems. This is a preliminary step,"" Vizcarra told journalists on Sunday as he voted in the southern region of Moquegua. 
He has backed all the proposed reforms except for creation of a bicameral congress. Vizcarra said that had been ""distorted"" by the current congress at the last minute, by removing legislative control from the executive in favor of the new chambers of deputies and senators.
The last bicameral congress was dissolved by then president Alberto Fujimori in 1992, when he accused parliament of obstructing security and economic reforms. His detractors said he had done so to frustrate corruption investigations and consolidate his power.
A poll by Ipsos Peru released on Saturday said that a large majority of Peruvians would vote in what is likely to be seen as a political victory of President Vizcarra against the powerful Conservative opposition led by former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori. 

Keiko Fujimori was detained in October pending investigation into her party's alleged receiving of cash from the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht for its 2011 campaign. [L2N1WQ14A]

The People's Democratic Party (PDP) said late on Saturday accounts belonging to Peter Obi, its vice presidential candidate, his wife, family members and their businesses had been blocked by government agencies. The PDP did not identify them.
The presidency could not be reached for comment.
""Why is the presidency on a wild goose chase in investigating Peter Obi, who left office as Governor of Anambra state five years ago with a nationally acclaimed clean record,"" the PDP said in a statement.
President Muhammadu Buhari last month launched his campaign for re-election for a second term, running on his track record on corruption. Buhari's handling of a struggling economy will also be a central campaign issue.
PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, a former ally to Buhari, chose as running mate Obi, 57, to generate support in the southeast region, which includes Anambra, where the president has polled badly in past elections.
Geographical affiliations in Nigeria are crucial in a sprawling nation of 190 million people from 250 ethnic groups.
With a tight race in prospect, a strong showing in the southeast could give the PDP enough votes to deny Buhari, a former military ruler, a second four-year term.

OSLO (Reuters) - This year's Nobel Peace Prize winners on Sunday called for justice for the victims of sexual violence in conflicts around the world, a day before they will receive the award for their efforts to put an end to rape as a weapon of war.
Denis Mukwege, a doctor who helps victims of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nadia Murad, a Yazidi rights activist and survivor of sexual slavery by Islamic State, will jointly receive the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony on Monday in the Norwegian city.
Mukwege heads the Panzi Hospital in the eastern Congo city of Bukavu. The clinic receives thousands of women each year, many of them requiring surgery from sexual violence.
Murad is an advocate for the Yazidi minority in Iraq and for refugee and women's rights in general. She was enslaved and raped by Islamic State fighters in Mosul, Iraq, in 2014.
Murad has campaigned for a United Nations investigative team to collect and preserve evidence of acts by Islamic State in Iraq that may be war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. 
The team began its work in August, a year after it was approved by the U.N. Security Council.
Murad, speaking at a news conference at the Norwegian Nobel Institute on Sunday, said that not a single person in Iraq had yet faced justice for raping Yazidi women and girls. 
""We have not seen a single piece of justice in this light. We need to receive justice one day,"" she told reporters via an interpreter, adding that 3,000 Yazidi women and girls still remained in sexual captivity with IS fighters. 
But she was also hopeful. ""If it was not for our campaign over the past four years, we would not have seen the steps we have seen toward justice.""
Her fellow Nobel laureate, Mukwege, who lives in the grounds of the Panzi hospital and who frequently receives death threats, said justice needed to be included in any peace process.
The Second Congo War, which killed more than five million people, formally ended in 2003, but violence is still a problem in the country, where militias frequently target civilians.
""There is humanitarian law. We call on it to be applied in an impartial way. After the war ended, we have seen war lords reach the top of the state and there was no discussion of justice and violence has continued,"" he said at the news conference.
Winning the Nobel Peace Prize, he said, would help to bring perpetrators to justice.
""It will help the international community take its responsibilities when it comes to the victims of sexual violence,"" he said.

Mukwege also said he was concerned that elections in the Congo planned for Dec. 23 could lead to a resurgence of violence if they were not free and transparent.

The killings happened on a farm where activists of the left-wing MST group put up a camp last year. MST said in a statement that heavily armed men entered the camp late on Saturday and shot the two men dead.
Police at the Alhandra municipality confirmed the deaths, but said it still lack details of what it called homicides. It said two police deputies from the state's capital João Pessoa were sent by the government to help investigate the shooting and were at the farm on Sunday talking to witnesses.
No suspects had been identified or arrested, the police said, and the bodies of the activists were still at the farm. They would be transferred to the city later for the autopsies.
MST said the men killed were José Bernardo da Silva and Rodrigo Celestino. MST activists fight for land distribution in Brazil, many times invading areas it says are not producing anything and then seeking its expropriation by the government.
The group demanded a quick investigation of the crime and the arrest of the killers.
Killings related to land disputes in Brazil reached 70 last year, according to Comissão Pastoral da Terra (CPT), a group linked to the Catholic church. It said in a report in April that it was the highest amount of such deaths since 2003, when 73 people were killed in land conflicts. 
Brazil's President-elect Jair Bolsonaro strongly opposes the actions by MST, saying they should be considered as terrorism. Groups such as the MST fear that his stance regarding the issue could stimulate even larger violence in Brazilian rural areas.

PARIS (Reuters) - Workers in Paris swept up broken glass and towed away burnt-out cars on Sunday after the latest ""yellow vest"" riots, while the government warned of slower economic growth and said that President Emmanuel Macron would address the nation this week.
On Saturday, anti-government protesters wrecked havoc in the city for the fourth weekend in a row, throwing stones, torching cars and vandalizing shops and restaurants.
Across the city, bank branch offices, toy shops, opticians and other retail outlets had boarded up storefronts smashed by protesters, and walls were covered in anti-Macron slogans.
""You won't make it past Christmas, Emmanuel,"" read the graffiti on a boarded-up shop near the Champs Elysees boulevard.
Macron, elected in May 2017, is facing mounting criticism for not speaking in public in more than a week as violence worsened.
The upheaval in the Christmas shopping season has dealt a heavy blow to retailing, the tourist industry and the manufacturing sector as road blocks disrupt supply chains.
On Saturday, the Eiffel Tower and several museums closed their doors for security reasons, as did top Paris department stores on what should have been a prime shopping weekend.
The protest movement will have ""a severe impact"" on the French economy, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters on Sunday as he toured an upmarket central Paris neighborhood that had seen heavy looting Saturday night.
""We must expect a new slowdown of economic growth at year-end due to the ""yellow vest"" protests,"" Le Maire said.
In the middle of last month, before the protests, the central bank forecast 0.4 percent fourth-quarter growth. Economists said then that the economy would need to grow at 0.8 percent in the final three months to hit the government's 1.7 percent annual growth forecast.
""EVERYTHING IS BROKEN""
Gregory Caray, owner of two furniture shops in the heart of Paris, said he was relieved to see that his shop had not been vandalized, but the protective wooden boards over its windows were plastered with graffiti.
""You can understand the yellow vests movement. But this is completely unacceptable. It has been three weekends in a row now. Look around you, everything is broken, damaged. All the shops had to close and spend money to shut everything up, and it happens every week,"" he told Reuters. 
Named after the fluorescent safety vests that French motorists must carry, the ""yellow vest"" protests erupted on Nov. 17, when nearly 300,000 demonstrators nationwide took to the streets to denounce high living costs and Macron's liberal economic reforms.
The government canceled a planned rise in fuel taxes last Tuesday to try to defuse the situation but the protests have morphed into a broader anti-Macron rebellion.
""I don't know if Macron's resignation is necessary, but he must completely change course,"" said Bertrand Cruzatier as he watched cleaners scrub out anti-Macron graffiti at Place de la Republique.
A banner hanging from the statue of Marianne, symbol of the French republic, read: ""Give back the money"".
Macron's last major televised address was on Nov 27, when he said he would not be bounced into changing policy by ""thugs"".
""FIGHT UNTIL EASTER""
Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said Macron would make ""important announcements"" early in the coming week.
""However, not all the problems of the 'yellow vest' protesters will be solved by waving a magic wand,"" he said.
Yellow vest protesters demand lower taxes, higher minimum wages and better pension benefits. But, mindful of France's deficit and not wanting to flout EU rules, Macron has scant wriggle room for more concessions.
Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian said the yellow vest movement expressed a deep sense of inequality among French people.
""We need a new social contract for the 21st century,"" he told LCI televison.
Yellow vest protesters were unimpressed with the government's overtures, continuing their blockade of traffic roundabouts nationwide and vowing to fight on.

""We want our share of the pie, like everyone. I will stay here until Easter, if necessary,"" a protester called Didier told BFM television in Frejus, southern France.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Yemen warring parties hold first direct meeting of Sweden peace talks,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi
RIMBO, Sweden (Reuters) - Yemen's warring parties held the first direct talks in U.N.-led peace efforts in Sweden on Sunday to iron out a prisoner swap, one of several confidence-building measures intended to help launch a political process to end nearly four years of conflict.
Since talks began on Thursday, U.N. officials have been shuttling between delegations from the Iranian-aligned Houthi group and the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi which is backed by a Saudi-led military coalition.
The first negotiations in over two years were convened amid pressure from Western nations, some of which supply arms and intelligence to Saudi Arabia and other members of the coalition. The war in Yemen has killed tens of thousands of people and caused a major humanitarian disaster.
Mediator Martin Griffiths opened the new round due to last until Dec. 13 by announcing a deal to release thousands of prisoners. The two sides met in a renovated castle outside Stockholm on Sunday to discuss implementation of the deal.
The team from Hadi's government initially refused to enter the room, saying the Houthis needed to include more senior delegates, but the meeting went ahead, delegates said.
""We are very optimistic about having a breakthrough on the prisoners issue ... we have exchanged some lists in the past but each side needs to update them,"" said Askar Ahmed Zayl, a delegate from Hadi's government.
""BABY STEPS""
The parties have yet to agree on trickier issues such as re-opening Sanaa airport and a truce in the port city of Hodeidah, both held by the Houthis, both further confidence-building measures that are the focus of the talks in addition to a framework for negotiations.
""We have three or four days. If we end up without any agreement then this round has failed,"" the Houthi's main negotiator Mohammed Abdusalam told reporters.
""But if we have a draft on some general framework, the reopening of Sanaa airport, the prisoners release, keeping the central bank neutral and a de-escalation in Hodeidah ... then this will be a good step to hold another round in one or two months.""
Griffiths praised the parties' ""positive spirit"" in engaging constructively and urged for calm on the ground in Yemen, where sporadic battles have continued in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, a lifeline for millions, and other parts of the country.
The war has pushed the impoverished Arab country to the brink of starvation and spawned the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis.
Gulf Arab states are expected to discuss the war during an annual summit on Sunday in Saudi Arabia, which along with the United Arab Emirates leads the Western-backed Sunni Muslim military alliance trying to restore Hadi's government.
A U.S State Department official said on Sunday the United States would continue to back the coalition after the Senate last month voted to advance a resolution to end U.S. military support for the war.
One diplomat at the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity said the peace round could be considered successful if they resulted in agreements on the de-escalation of hostilities, on the prisoners swap and on a further round of consultations.
""These are still baby steps. Just having them together in the same restaurant and getting them used to talk to each other is a big deal,"" the diplomat said.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2018 09:24AM ET</span>",Iran said to hold Australian-based academic on 'infiltration' charge,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran has detained an Australian-based academic on charges of trying to ""infiltrate"" Iranian institutions, according to official media.
Meimanat Hosseini-Chavoshi was detained as she was leaving Iran, the state news agency IRNA said.
Hosseini-Chavoshi, a population expert, is affiliated with the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, according to the University of Melbourne's website.
Population control has become a sensitive issue in Iran since Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an edict in 2014 calling for a population increase after decades of state-promoted birth control.
In October, Khamenei called for greater efforts to combat enemy ""infiltration"" as tensions escalated with the United States after Washington withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran.
Asked about reports that several experts advocating population curbs had been arrested, judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei told reporters on Sunday:
""One person has been arrested in this regard ... and three or four people are being sought,"" the judiciary's news website Mizan reported.
IRNA said last week there were reports that authorities had detained an Australian-based population expert on charges that she had tried to ""infiltrate"" state bodies in Iran.
IRNA quoted an attorney as naming the detained woman as Hosseini-Chavoshi, saying that she did not yet have a lawyer.
The agency quoted the hardline daily Kayhan as saying Hosseini-Chavoshi, reported to hold dual Australian and Iranian nationality, was detained by security forces in a drive against ""enemy infiltration elements"" as she was leaving Iran.
""Everyone knows that the enemy is trying to infiltrate state bodies ... and affect decision-making."" Ejei said. ""Foreign intelligence agencies are behind many (academic) institutions ... But some individuals working there might not be aware of these intelligence agencies.""
Reuters reported in 2017 that Iran's Revolutionary Guards had arrested at least 30 dual nationals in recent years, mostly on espionage charges. Among those held is British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Iran does not recognize dual nationality and does not routinely announce arrests or charges of dual nationals, whose rights to consular assistance are enshrined in the U.N. Vienna Convention.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2018 08:27AM ET</span>","Hindu monks, large crowds call on Modi to help build Ayodhya temple","By Mayank Bhardwaj
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Dozens of Hindu monks and tens of thousands of followers, gathered under the banner of groups linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party, on Sunday urged the Indian government to help build a temple on the ruins of a 16th-century mosque.
Causing a frenzy in a crowd of more than 200,000 people, Hindu seers made a series of fiery speeches laced with religious overtones to demand action paving the way for a temple in the northern town of Ayodhya.
In 1992 a Hindu mob tore down the centuries-old mosque in Ayodhya, triggering riots that killed about 2,000 people across India in one of the worst outbreaks of communal violence since Partition in 1947.
After the demolition of the mosque, both Hindu and Muslim groups petitioned the Supreme Court to help resolve the issue. The top court has sought more time to give its verdict.
Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or the World Hindu Council, and their parent movement, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), have asked the government to issue an executive order to build a temple, bypassing the Supreme Court.
The BJP, VHP and RSS have organized a series of religious meets to drum up support for their cause and also to put pressure on the government to issue the executive order.
Exhorting the crowd to take a vow to build a temple in Ayodhya, Hindu monk Avdheshanand Giri ji Maharaj, said: ""The government and the Supreme Court must realize that it is a matter of religious sentiment for Hindus who have been waiting to see a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya.""
As millions of Hindus believe that the mosque stood at the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities, the dispute remains at the core of tensions between the Hindus majority and India's minority Muslims who constitute 14 percent of the country's 1.3 billion people.
Hindu groups insist that there was a temple at the site before the mosque was built in 1528 by a Muslim ruler.
""I've come here to attend the religious congregation as a Hindu woman; not as a politician, as I believe that the issue of Ram temple is linked with the faith of India's 80 percent people,"" said Meenakashi Lekhi, a lawmaker from the BJP.
SWORDS AND SLOGANS
Ahead of Sunday's rally, police stepped up security in the city.
Anti-Muslim slogans reverberated on roads leading to the gathering near the old part of the city, where many Muslim families live. On their way to attend the religious meeting, some youths brandished swords. 
In the run-up to a general election due by May 2019, the BJP and other Hindu groups have ratcheted up their demand for a new temple at the disputed site.
Most analysts expect Modi's BJP to fare worse than it did in the 2014 general election, and critics often accuse the party of using communal issues to whip up support. 
For the past three decades, the BJP and Hindu outfits associated with it have resurrected the Ayodhya controversy before elections, stoking tensions between Hindus and Muslims.

Uttar Pradesh, the state where Ayodha is located, has suffered repeated outbreaks of communal violence since Yogi Adityanath, a BJP hardliner seen as a potential successor to Modi, became chief minister last year.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - The president of Democratic Republic of Congo, Joseph Kabila, plans to stay in politics when he steps down after elections on Dec. 23 and does not rule out running again for president in 2023, he told Reuters in an interview on Sunday. 
The long-delayed elections will mark Congo's first democratic transfer of power and an end to Kabila's rule that began in 2001 after the assassination of his father. 
Kabila was due to step down in 2016 at the end of his constitutional mandate. But the election to replace him was repeatedly delayed and until recently it was unclear if he would seek a third consecutive term. He will be eligible to run again in 2023 after a break.
He has hand-picked a hard-core loyalist named Ramazani Shadary as his preferred candidate, who is under European Union sanctions for his involvement in human rights violations.
""Why don’t we wait for 2023 ... to envision anything,"" said Kabila in a rare interview at the presidential palace in the capital Kinshasa, wearing a dark blue suit and tie. ""In life as in politics, I don’t rule out anything."" 
The delay in elections has coincided with a breakdown in security across much of the mineral-rich country. Militants fight over land and minerals in the east near the border with Uganda and Rwanda. The violence has allowed an Ebola outbreak to spread in the east to become the second largest ever recorded. 
International observers say insecurity will make holding elections difficult and create the opportunity for cheating, especially with the use of new voting machines. 
Kabila said he aims for the polls to be close to ""perfection"".

He also said there were no plans to alter the new mining code in the foreseeable future.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Bahrain's foreign minister criticized Qatar's emir on Sunday for not attending an annual Gulf Arab summit in Saudi Arabia, a decision that shows there is little hope for an imminent resolution of a rift between Doha and three Gulf Arab states.
Qatar sent its state minister for foreign affairs to the summit, whose backdrop is the dispute that has seen trade and diplomatic ties severed between the sides since mid-2017.
""Qatar's emir should have accepted the fair demands (of the boycotting states) and attended the summit,"" foreign minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said in a tweet.
The Gulf Cooperation Council's (GCC) annual summit was set to open in Riyadh on Sunday at a time when the country is under pressure over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October.
Qatar's emir attended last year's gathering in Kuwait, while Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain sent more junior officials. 
King Salman was shown on Saudi TV greeting Omani and UAE officials upon their arrival on Sunday for the one-day gathering of the six member states that is expected to focus on security issues, including the Yemen war and Iran's regional activities.

The meeting may touch on oil politics and a diplomatic and economic boycott imposed on Qatar by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and non-GCC member Egypt since June 2017 over allegations it supports terrorism. Doha denies the charges and says the boycott aims to curtail its sovereignty.

""Good clues have been obtained and hopefully with the public's cooperation ... we will get to the main leads,"" Ashtari was quoted by the state news agency IRNA as saying. 
More suspects have been identified and are being sought, Ashtari added.
At least 48 people were also injured in Thursday's suicide car bomb attack by a Sunni militant group on a police headquarters in the port city of Chabahar in southeast Iran, according to state media.
While suicide bombings are rare in Iran, Sunni militant groups have carried out several attacks on security forces in recent years in Sistan-Baluchestan province, where Chabahar is located.
The province is home to a Sunni minority in the largely Shi'ite country, and it has also long been plagued by violence from both drug smugglers and separatists.
The U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group and Iranian state media reported that Sunni Baluch militant group Ansar al-Furqan had claimed responsibility for the attack.
Tehran accuses its Sunni-led regional rival Saudi Arabia and its arch-enemy, the United States, of funding Sunni militants, a charge Riyadh and Washington deny. 
Iran has threatened to hit militant bases in neighboring Pakistan unless Islamabad took action to secure its border area, which Tehran says has become a safe haven for anti-Iran groups to operate.

The beatification in the port city of Oran is the first of its kind in a Muslim nation. Algerian officials, delegates of Pope Francis and friends of the victims were among 1,200 people at the ceremony.
""These brothers and sisters died among tens and tens of thousands of Algerian"" Muslims,"" said Archbishop Paul Desfarges of Algiers at the ceremony, which opened with a minute's silence.
The war started after the military-backed government canceled legislative elections in 1992 a radical Islamist party was poised to win. 200,000 people died in the conflict and the economy stalled.
Pope Francis said in a message he hoped the beatification would ""heal the wounds of the past and create a new dynamic of meeting and living together"".
Christians are a tiny minority in the Sunni Muslim nation. Most of the 19 Christians who were killed were French. The Trappists were kidnapped from their monastery east of the capital and then executed.

(Reuters) - A winter storm brought snowfall and freezing rain to North and South Carolina on Saturday, creating hazardous conditions on roads and threatening to leave hundreds of thousands of people without power, officials said.
The snowfall began on Saturday evening and was expected to last until early Monday in some areas, with up to 18 inches (46 cm) forecast for North Carolina's Mount Mitchell, the National Weather Service said.
North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who declared a state of emergency on Friday, told residents to finish stockpiling food and avoid unnecessary travel.
""This weekend isn't the time to head out to see the winter wonderland. Stay safe where you are,"" Cooper said in a statement.
The effects of the storm, including power outages, could last for days in North Carolina, with the state's mountainous western region expected to be particularly hard hit by snow, officials said.
About 500,000 electricity customers could lose power in North Carolina and South Carolina, a  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK) spokeswoman said on Twitter.
By Saturday evening, the storm had dumped 5 inches (13 cm) of snow on Hendersonville, a North Carolina city about 100 miles (160 km) west of Charlotte, meteorologist Zack Taylor of the federal Weather Prediction Center said by phone. 
Charlotte, North Carolina's most populous city, was expected to also receive 5 inches (13 cm) of snow before the storm ends.
Snow was forecast for Virginia's southern region beginning early on Sunday, including up to 6 inches (15 cm) in the Lynchburg area.
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam declared an emergency for the state on Saturday, warning of potential power outages and snarled transportation.
The storm could affect airports, including Asheville and Raleigh-Durham International in North Carolina, Lynchburg and Roanoke in Virginia and Greenville-Spartanburg International, South Carolina. American Airlines said it would waive change fees for people booked through Charlotte Douglas International, a major regional hub in North Carolina.
A mix of snow and sleet fell in upstate region of South Carolina on Saturday evening, Taylor said. 
The South Carolina Emergency Management Division warned motorists to drive carefully on bridges, overpasses and remote roadways, which could quickly freeze over. 
Icy rain also threatened to cover roads with ice in the mountains of northeast Georgia, officials said.

YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenians began voting in an early parliamentary election as acting prime minister Nikol Pashinyan sought a stronger mandate, having been elected by lawmakers to the post in May following a peaceful revolution earlier this year.
Pashinyan came to power in the wake of weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism in the ex-Soviet republic. The former newspaper editor, who was jailed for fomenting unrest in 2008, represents a dramatic break from the cadre of rulers who have run Armenia since the late 1990s.
He stepped down in October so parliament could be dissolved ready for the early election.
Poll stations opened at 8 am (0400 GMT) and voting was due to end at 8 pm (1600 GMT).
Former high-ranking officials were sacked and some were arrested following the power change. And a court of appeal ordered the detention of former President Robert Kocharyan again on Friday on charges of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order.
He was first arrested in July but freed the following month and the case was sent to the appeals court. Kocharyan was Armenia's second president, serving in the post from 1998 to 2008, when mass protests erupted over a disputed election.
The former ruling Republican Party, however, still dominates the current parliament that was elected in 2017. 
Pashinyan has said he expects Sunday's vote to lead to a legislature that better reflects the nation's new political landscape.
Nine parties and two blocs are taking part in the election and opinion polls suggest the My Step Alliance, which includes Pashinyan's Civil Contract Party, will easily win a parliamentary majority.
After taking office, Pashinyan promised there would be no major shifts in Armenian foreign policy and has offered assurances he will not break with Moscow.
Armenia hosts a Russian military base and is a member of Russia-led military and economic alliances. 
Pashinyan also suggested he would stick with existing policies on the long-running issue of Nagorno-Karabakh.
A mountainous part of Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh, is run by ethnic Armenians who declared independence from Baku during a conflict that broke out as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991.

Though a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia still regularly accuse each other of conducting attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the Azeri-Armenian border.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - The United States wants to continue support to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen's war and will remain engaged in efforts to combat Iranian influence and Islamist militancy in the Arab state, a State Department official said on Sunday.
Since the Oct 2. murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate, the U.S. administration has come under pressure at home over the nearly four-year-old conflict.
The Senate last month voted to advance a resolution to end U.S. military support, which includes arms sales and intelligence sharing, for the Western-backed Sunni Muslim coalition that intervened in 2015 against the Iranian-aligned Houthis to restore the internationally recognized government.
""There are pressures in our system ... to either withdraw from the conflict or discontinue our support of the coalition, which we are strongly opposed to on the administration side,"" said Timothy Lenderking, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Arabian Gulf Affairs.
""We do believe that the support for the coalition is necessary. It sends a wrong message if we discontinue our support,"" he told a security forum in the United Arab Emirates.
The United States last month halted U.S. refueling of aircraft from the coalition, which has been blamed for air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians in Yemen.
The U.S. official's reassurances of continued support comes as Sweden hosts the first U.N.-led peace talks in two years between the warring parties and as Gulf Arab leaders hold an annual summit in Riyadh on Sunday, expected to discuss the war.
CONTAINING IRAN
Lenderking said peace talks launched last week were a ""vital first step"" in ending the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and left millions facing starvation. 
He said there were no illusions the process would be easy, but that there were signs of constructive talks and that Washington wants concrete results from the meetings focused on confidence-building measures and a transitional governing body.
""Looking down the road we seek a stable and unified Yemen that fosters rather than drains regional and global stability.""
""There is no place in a future Yemen for an Iranian-backed threat to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and vital international economic quarters,"" he said, adding that the coalition was also combating al Qaeda and Islamic State militants in Yemen.
The Arabian Peninsula country lies beside the southern mouth of the Red Sea, one of the most important trade routes in the world for oil tankers. 
The conflict, seen largely in the region as a proxy war between Riyadh and Tehran, pits the Houthi movement against other Yemeni forces loyal to the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi backed by the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
The Houthis, who have fired missiles on Saudi cities, control the capital Sanaa, after ousting Hadi's government from there in 2014, and the most populous areas of the country. Hadi's government has a base in the southern port of Aden.
Lenderking said that experts forecast there could be 1 million former combatants that need to be disarmed once a peace deal is reached, requiring security sector reform as well as restoring crippled infrastructure and shoring up the economy.

""Early recovery efforts are underway but full scale reconstruction can only occur in a peaceful environment. For that reason we want to close the space for malign Iranian influence.""

Grace Millane, who was traveling the world after finishing university, went missing on Dec. 1 in Auckland. On Saturday the police said that she was murdered and that they were questioning a man about the case.
Late on Saturday the 26-year-old man was charged with Millane's murder, Detective Inspector Scott Beard told reporters. The man, whose name was withheld, is due in court on Monday morning.
Police found the body following a search of a bush area in Auckland's Waitakere Ranges. The body had not yet been formally identified, but it was believed to be that of Millane, Beard said.
""Obviously, this brings the search for Grace to an end,"" Beard said. ""It is an unbearable time for the Millane family and our hearts go out to them.""
He added that Millane's family, including her father who has flown to New Zealand on Friday, has been informed. Asked how the father was doing, Beard said, ""Any father, any parent in this situation would struggle.""

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne has urged Thai authorities on Sunday to release a footballer who holds a refugee status in Australia and who has been detained in Bangkok since late November.
Hakeem AlAraibi, a former member of Bahrain's national soccer team who has been critical of the country's government, was arrested in Thailand on Nov. 27 based on an Interpol notice issued at Bahrain's request.
AlAraibi was convicted of vandalizing a police station in Bahrain and sentenced to 10 years in prison in absentia. He has denied wrongdoing.
""Australia is concerned by the ongoing detention of Mr. Hakeem Ali AlAraibi and calls for his immediate return to Australia,"" Payne said in a statement published on the ministry's website.
""Returning Mr. AlAraibi to Bahrain, from where he fled, would contravene his rights under international human rights law.""
At a court hearing on Friday, AlAraibi was served with a formal arrest warrant, which could pave the way for a possible extradition to Bahrain.
Bahrain's embassy in Thailand said on Twitter in early December that AlAraibi ""is wanted for security cases"".
AlAraibi told Human Rights Watch on Friday that if he is sent back to Bahrain his life ""is in danger"". He had said previously he was tortured in Bahrain and fled in 2014 to Australia, which granted him political asylum in 2017.
He has been a vocal critic of the president of the Asian Football Federation, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, who is a cousin of the king. He was tortured by Bahraini authorities because of his brother's political activities during the Arab Spring uprising in 2011, Human Rights Watch said.
FIFA, world soccer's ruling body, has also called on the Thai authorities to allow for the return of AlAraibi to Australia at ""the earliest possible moment"".
Payne said that she has raised AlAraibi's matter with her Thai counterpart.

""Australia has made, and will continue to make, high-level diplomatic representations seeking Mr AlAraibi's safe return,"" Payne said in the statement.

Grievances over military pensions and other benefits have been a long-running issue in China and there have been sporadic organized protests in recent years.
Early last year hundreds of military veterans demonstrated in central Beijing for two days, demanding unpaid retirement benefits.
State television said the Oct. 4-7 protests took place in Shandong's Pingdu city, when some 300 people from different parts of China gathered ""under the banner of being military veterans"" for what it called an illegal demonstration.
The protesters fought with police and damaged vehicles, the report added, citing the Ministry of Public Security.
The government has repeatedly promised to treat veterans better, and this year set up a Ministry of Veterans Affairs as part of a broader reshuffle of ministerial departments.
Chinese President Xi Jinping announced in 2015 the People's Liberation Army would cut troop levels by 300,000, aiming to make the bulk of the reductions by the end of 2017, which the government has said has already been broadly achieved.

MARRAKESH, Morocco (Reuters) - Officials from more than 70 cities from around the world on Saturday pledged to work closer together to tackle migration flows, supporting a United Nations pact which a rising number of countries have pulled out from.
With a record 21.3 million refugees globally, all 193 UN members except the United States finalized in July the so-called Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration to better handle migration.
The pact will be adopted early next week in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh but right-wing European governments such as Austria, Hungary or Poland have since then dropped out.
Trying to counter this officials from over 70 cities met in Marrakesh to exchange how to better work together on migrant flows such as providing housing or jobs -- or in the case of African cities skills so that people do not head to Europe.
""We want to get our voices heard by national governments,"" said Yvonna Aki-Sawyerr, mayor of Freetown in Sierra Leone in West Africa, told Reuters. ""Cities are faced with the challenges.""
Marvin Rees, mayor of the British city of Bristol, said the UN pact was necessary as it was impossible to ignore migration flows. ""People will be migrating.""
Some city representatives present were from countries that had pulled out of the pact, such as the United States, or are critical of it, such as Italy, organizers said.
In a draft for the U.N. forum the cities pledged to ""support appropriate reception of refugees and asylum-seekers"" and ""strengthen capacity for reception"".
The UN pact addresses issues such as how to protect people who migrate, how to integrate them into new countries and how to return them to their home countries.
The United Nations has hailed it as an historic and comprehensive pact that could serve as a basis for future policies. 
The pact is not binding but has met fierce resistance from Western right-wing governments and parties which frame it as encouraging migration.
Austria, for example, said in October it will back out because the pact will blur the line between legal and illegal migration, echoing comments from Hungary and Poland.

May is battling to win support for a Brexit deal which will define both the UK's departure from the bloc and her future as leader. Current forecasts suggest she will lose the vote in parliament on Tuesday. 
The critical report by the cross-party Committee on Exiting the European Union, agreed unanimously and published on Sunday, will help lawmakers decide how to vote, said the committee's chairman Hilary Benn.
""This deal would represent a huge step into the unknown,"" added Benn.
""It does not give the British people or our businesses the clarity and the certainty they need about our future trading relationship with the EU in five or ten years' time.""
A summary of the report listed over a dozen problems with the deal in its current form including the backstop - the mechanism intended to ensure there is no return to a hard border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland, an element of the deal which has come in for some of the heaviest lawmaker criticism.
""Activating the backstop would result in immediate barriers to UK-EU trade in goods and services ... the UK could face the threat of significant economic disruption which would reduce its leverage in the negotiations,"" the report said. 
It also said May's deal had avoided making choices about the future relationship with the EU, meaning that negotiations would be needed which would likely go on for ""a number of years"". 
The deal did not set out realistic or workable objectives for the future relationship between Britain and the EU, it added. 
""If the government's main priority is to secure EU-UK trade that is as frictionless as possible, it must decide how far it is willing to follow EU rules. This is not a choice the government has so far been willing to make,"" the report said.

(Reuters) - A 67-year-old Bolivian man considered to have been one of the largest drug traffickers in South America in the 1980s has escaped from a private clinic in the country's capital La Paz, police said on Saturday. 
Jorge Roca Suarez had been back in Bolivia since April after a U.S. judge ordered his early release, 28 years into a 36-year sentence for drug trafficking. 
On his arrival in La Paz, he was ordered to serve another 15-year sentence handed down locally on the same charge, but in early December was admitted to a private medical clinic for treatment for an unspecified condition.
Overnight between Friday and Saturday he escaped, police said, leaving the clinic without being detected. 
""The Bolivian Police has activated all its intelligence apparatus,"" Fernando Rojas, the deputy director of the Special Force to Fight Crime in La Paz, said. ""We are helping in the search tasks to recapture this person.""
Roca Suarez, who is known in Bolivia as ""Roof of Straw"", was an associate of Colombia's Pablo Escobar and is the nephew of Roberto Suarez Gomez, the so-called ""King of Cocaine"", who offered to pay Bolivia's external debt with his ill-gotten gains in the 1980s.
In July, lawyers obtained the conditional release of Roca Suarez on medical grounds, but in mid-November a judge revoked that benefit and ordered him back to prison. 
The police did not give more details about the escape. Roca Suarez's lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.

Alexeyeva, founder of the Moscow Helsinki Group, was well known for challenging Russian authorities over human rights issues dating back to the 1960s, including taking a strong stand against President Vladimir Putin.
Six years ago she told Reuters that when she first met Putin in her role as a member of the presidential human rights council in 2002, she was impressed by his humility and willingness to listen to activists like herself.
By the time they met again in 2006, Putin was riding high and walking with a swagger after on an oil-fuelled economic boom that made him hugely popular in Russia. He was, she said, no longer listening.
""Putin came to believe that everyone wants him to stay in power ... He doesn’t understand. It’s a terrible thing to have power. Very few people can handle it properly,” she told Reuters in 2012.
Alexeyeva was married twice, had two sons, wrote several books about the history of the struggles of individuals for civil rights in the Soviet Union and received several government awards.
Putin on Saturday sent a telegram with deep condolences to Alexeyeva's family, TASS quoted the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying.

Putin greatly appreciated Alexeyeva's contribution to the formation of a civil society in Russia and ""highly respected her principled position on many issues of the life of our country,"" Peskov said.

KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Half-way through talks to breathe life into the Paris climate deal negotiators haggled over how to share the cost of curbing global warming and struggled to bridge deep political divides.
The two weeks of talks, which began at the start of the week, are billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 agreement on climate change. 
The challenge is to meet a year-end deadline to agree a rule book to limit global warming, when the unity that underpinned the Paris talks has fragmented. U.S. President Donald Trump repeated his call to scrap the Paris climate pact.
By the end of Saturday, negotiators aim to have a simplified a draft for high-level ministerial debate starting on Monday.
""We still have a lot to do,"" Michal Kurtyka, the Polish president of the U.N. talks, told a news conference. ""It is very technical, very complex, very difficult.""
Delegates said a major issue was how to reassure developing countries that richer nations would deliver on promises to help finance the cost of shifting to a lower carbon economy.
Environmental campaigners are concerned the Katowice talks will lack ambition, after the United States said this year it was withdrawing from the U.N. process. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, in the talks on Saturday added a further challenge by blocking consensus on a major scientific report.
The U.N. report published in October said it was possible to limit the earth's temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and prevent damaging levels of global warming provided radical changes in energy consumption and other steps were implemented.
But Saudi Arabia refused to back a proposal from other nations to use wording to ""welcome"" the report.
Delegates said the task of driving the process forward would fall to ministers next week. 
""It’s a question of who wins? The likes of the European Union and China with economies deeply invested in climate action and dependent on multilateralism for global trade, or the likes of Saudi dissenters of climate science, with vested interests that put us all in the firing line?"" Camilla Born, senior policy advisor at E3G, a non-governmental organisation, said. 
On the streets of Katowice, the capital of Poland's Silesian coal-mining region, thousands of demonstrators marched to demand a deal to limit temperature rises to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Environmental campaigners also marched in Paris, where violent demonstrations triggered by a fuel tax have taken place.

Delegates in Katowice said the French social protests were unrelated to the U.N. climate debate, but U.S. President Donald Trump seized on them to call for an end to ""the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement"".

Under the slogan ""Stop the bloody shirts,"" the demonstrators chanted as they marched through the city center to condemn the assault on Borko Stefanovic, leader of the small Serbian Left party.
Stefanovic was attacked by a group of men wearing black clothing on Nov. 23 in the southern city of Krusevac and suffered minor injuries from being beaten with an iron rod. 
Vucic said Stefanovic's assailants were arrested shortly after the incident, but opposition figures maintain that his party was involved -- something vehemently denied by Progressive leaders.
""The struggle must be waged with loud chanting against this disgusting, slimy regime,"" Branislav Trifunovic, an actor and a protest leader, told the cheering crowd.
Opposition activists say Vucic is an autocrat and brand his Serbian Progressive Party as corrupt. 
Vucic's approval ratings have slipped somewhat since he won a 2016 presidential vote by a landslide, but he remains the country's most popular political leader and his ruling coalition has a comfortable majority of 160 deputies in the 250-seat parliament.
""Corruption, violence, stifling of press freedoms, they (the Progressive party) do it all and Vucic is their kingpin,"" said Radovan Peric, 49, a mechanic from Belgrade. 
Saturday's rally was called by former Belgrade mayor Dragan Djilas, leader of the Alliance for Serbia -- a heterogeneous group of 30 parties, who described the protest as a gathering of citizens against authoritarian rule.
Opposition protests have been relatively rare in Serbia since the popular unrest that ousted former strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. 

Vucic, a nationalist firebrand during the violent collapse of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, later embraced European values and set Serbia's membership in the European Union as the country's strategic goal. He also maintains close ties with Russia and China.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2018 02:24PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Dutch hospitals to drop U.S. body brokers, cite ethical concerns","By Anthony Deutsch and John Shiffman
AMSTERDAM - Two major Dutch hospitals say they will stop importing human body parts from American firms, which they have been doing without any regulation for a decade.
The hospitals told Reuters in recent weeks they made their decisions on ethical grounds. The move comes amid investigations by U.S. law enforcement into some so-called body brokers - companies that obtain the dead, often through donation, dissect them and sell the parts for profit.
Earlier this year, Reuters reported that one broker under scrutiny by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation - Portland, Oregon-based MedCure - has used a Dutch hub to distribute tens of thousands of kilograms of human body parts across Europe since 2012. U.S. authorities suspect MedCure sold body parts tainted with disease to American and foreign customers, a concern triggered in part by such shipments to Canada and Hong Kong, according to people familiar with the investigation.
Reuters found that importers of U.S. body parts included two Dutch hospitals. The news agency uncovered no evidence body parts used in the Netherlands were infected, but the Dutch hospitals said they would drop the suppliers in response to reporting by Reuters which raised questions about how the brokers acquired body donations.
The country's largest hospital, Amsterdam's Academic Medical Center (AMC), said it bought between 300 and 500 heads from U.S. brokers, which in the past included MedCure, to cover a shortfall. The parts, used for research and training courses, were bought as early as 2008 and as recently as Nov. 21, the hospital said.
Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam said it bought knees and shoulders from a U.S. supplier but declined to provide details. The hospital said it used the parts for research and training courses which were not designed to make profits.
The health ministry declined to comment on the hospitals' decision, and said there is no specific regulatory body which oversees the use of such samples.
From 2012 to 2016, according to manifest records reviewed by Reuters, MedCure shipped body parts valued at a total of more than $500,000 from the United States to the Netherlands. MedCure said it helps connect donors and scientific, research and medical entities. ""We are an accredited and regulated institution and adhere to the best-in-class industry standards for safety ethics, and transparency,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.
Dutch laws govern the use of donated organs, the transportation of bodies and cremation, but there are none pertaining to body parts used for training or research, Dutch Minister for Medical Care Bruno Bruins told parliament in April. 
The health ministry said it saw no need to regulate the trade in body parts because hospitals take precautions.
""UNACCEPTABLE""
In the Netherlands and much of Europe, people who bequeath their bodies to research do so as a charitable donation, with no payment involved. In the United States, many brokers offer donor families free cremation in return for donating a body - a potential saving of up to $1,000.
AMC's current supplier Science Care, one of the largest body brokers in America, is not under FBI investigation, the company told Reuters; an FBI spokeswoman said policy prevents the agency saying whether a company is or is not being scrutinized. But Science Care's business model rankles some Dutch lawmakers and doctors.
Freek Dikkers, the professor of ear, nose and throat medicine at the AMC whose department bought the heads, said it was stopping after learning that the company solicits donors at hospices and old age homes and that its former owners earned millions from the trade. Dikkers said that was ""unacceptable.""
One frozen head from Science Care that passed through Dutch airport customs belonged to a 53-year-old who died in April 2017 after treatment to remove a brain tumor. Although the declared value of the head on the customs form was $25, the going rate for a human head in the U.S. market is currently around $500, Reuters found. Science Care did not respond to a request for comment about the price of body parts.
Neither of the hospitals would say how much they paid for the parts. The heads were used, sometimes multiple times, to train young doctors before they operated on live patients, said Dikkers.
""It was a rising trend in recent years, initially around 30, and then increasing to 50 (per year), in four shipments,"" he said in an interview with Reuters and Dutch TV program Nieuwsuur.
The AMC said documents provided by U.S.-based brokers indicated the heads the hospital bought tested negative for disease. A hospital spokeswoman said it had not carried out its own tests, but doctors always wear protective clothing.
Science Care said it follows all regulations and has been accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB). The company uses ""an extensive medical screening process for our donors, including testing for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV-1, and HIV-2, to reduce potential risks."" All specimens are packaged and shipped according to international standards, it said.
The Rotterdam hospital, Erasmus, said it imported body parts - mostly sample knee and shoulder joints - for orthopedic surgery courses. It declined to say how long it has imported the parts, which company or companies supplied them, or how many it has bought.
RISE LABS    Even though the hospitals say they plan to stop using the U.S. suppliers, the business of sending body parts through the Netherlands continues.
Rhenus Logistics, a Dutch company, transported and stored body parts for MedCure between 2015 and 2018. The contract ended this year, said Rhenus spokeswoman Ellen Visser, when MedCure set up its own Dutch distribution hub.
    A month later, a new company was established in the Netherlands: Rise Labs, with three people affiliated to MedCure listed as board members. From two addresses in Amsterdam, it offers ""services to donors leaving their whole body and providing services to medical professionals working in the field of anatomical research.""

The company did not respond to requests for comment. A receptionist at one Rise Labs' address did not open the door when a reporter called for comment. MedCure declined to comment.

Netanyahu said this week that the tunnels were meant for use by Hezbollah fighters to infiltrate Israel from Lebanon and carry out attacks. The Israeli military sent mechanical diggers, troops and anti-tunneling equipment to the border to shut them down.
During their phone call, initiated by Netanyahu, ""The President of Russia stressed the importance of ensuring stability in the region,"" the Kremlin statement said. 
Russia has links to Hezbollah's allies in neighboring Syria where it has lent President Bashar al-Assad critical support in the country's civil war. Lebanese Hezbollah is also aiding Assad, as is its backer Iran. 
Israel has largely stayed out of the Syria conflict, but it has launched dozens of air strikes against what it said were advanced weapon deliveries to Hezbollah, with whom it fought a war in 2006.
Israel is worried that Iran, its arch-foe in the region, is using the Syria conflict to keep its forces in Syria permanently.
A statement from Netanyahu said that in his phone call with Putin he had also ""stressed once more Israel's policy aimed at preventing Iran's entrenchment in Syria and at acting against Iran and Hezbollah's aggression."" 
The relationship between Russia and Israel has been strained since September, when Russia accused Israel of indirectly causing the downing of a Russian military jet by Syrian air defenses following an Israeli air strike nearby.
In October, Moscow said it had delivered S-300 surface-to-air missiles to Syria, where Israel has struck Iranian targets.
So far the Israel-Lebanon border has remained largely quiet but there are fears of escalation. On Friday, an Israeli cabinet minister said Israel was prepared to take action in Lebanon against the cross-border tunnels if it deemed it necessary.
The United Nations peacekeeping Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) confirmed the existence of a tunnel near the ""blue line"" frontier between Israel and Lebanon on Thursday, describing it as a ""serious occurrence"".

Israel is also concerned about Hezbollah obtaining precision-missiles and in September identified three locations in Lebanon where it said the group was converting ""inaccurate projectiles"" into precision-guided missiles - something Lebanon's government has denied.

Isha Ambani, 27, daughter of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, will marry Anand Piramal, 33, in the financial capital of Mumbai next Wednesday, but the celebrations began this weekend in the desert city of Udaipur, with feasts, singing and dancing, and other pre-wedding rituals.
Security was beefed up as the high-profile guests started arriving at Udaipur's airport, said a source at the scene, who asked not to be identified. Outside, they were awaited by luxury sedans driven by chauffers wearing white uniforms and colorful Rajasthani turbans.
The Clintons and the Ambanis have an association that goes back more than 18 years and have met several times both in India and abroad, according to Indian media reports.
Then President Bill Clinton held meetings in India with the Ambanis, including deceased founder and Mukesh's father Dhirubhai Ambani, just before and after he left the presidency in 2000-2001.
In March this year, when Hillary Clinton visited India to deliver a keynote speech at a conference in Mumbai, she dined with the Ambanis at their 27-floor Antilia residence - one of the world's most expensive homes, according to local media.
Many other top industrialists, politicians, sports and Bollywood stars descended in Udaipur on Saturday to join what has been dubbed locally ""the big, fat Indian wedding.""
Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and newly-weds, actress Priyanka Chopra and singer Nick Jonas were among the guests joining the bash.
Former head of advertising giant WPP (LON:WPP), Martin Sorrell,  BP  (LON:BP) Group CEO Bob Dudley, Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington, 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch and Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih are also invited.
Guests for the celebrations, which will bring together two of India's most influential families, have access to an app mapping out the activities, which include a private concert by Beyonce.

Many in India, where millions live in dire poverty, have closely followed the preparations, including the Ivy League-graduate couple's engagement at the luxury Villa D'Este hotel on Italy's Lake Como, attended by more than 600 guests, and featuring a private performance by singer John Legend.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini filled one of Rome's main squares with tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters on Saturday in a rally that underscored the growing predominance of his rightist League party.
Locked in battle with Brussels over the government's budget plans, Salvini told the cheering crowds he would honor promises to boost state spending, warning that austerity would only fuel the sort of violence that has rocked neighboring France.
""Those who sow poverty reap protests,"" he said.
""If you call into question our right and duty to restore dignity, pride, security, pensions and work to millions of Italians, then I tell you we will not be turning back.""
Bearded and stocky, the plain-speaking Salvini took charge of the League in 2013 when it was a small, scandal-plagued regional party scoring around three percent in the polls. 
Under his leadership, and fueled by anti-migrant rhetoric, the League has become a national force that won 17 percent of the vote in a parliamentary election in March, enabling it to form a coalition with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
Since taking office, Salvini has made good on promises to slow drastically the arrival of mainly African migrants into Italy, and has seen support for the League surge to around 34 percent, making it the largest party in Italy.
League voters from around the country flowed into the huge Piazza del Popolo (People's Square (NYSE:SQ)) under a warm winter sun, their flags sporting the names of cities from the south, such as Bari and Naples, and to the north, such as Venice and Milan.

In its separatist past, the League's rallying cry used to be ""Roma Ladrona"" (Thieving Rome), but such slogans have now been replaced with calls for national unity. ""Italy lift up your head,"" said a huge banner on the main stage.
""We need to overcome our old divisions. We are one country and Salvini is the only man who can save us,"" said Ivana Di Betta, 62, a resident of the northern city of Udine, who caught one of 200 especially chartered buses to attend the rally.
Salvini vowed that the governing coalition would survive a full five-year term, though it is proving less popular in Brussels, where the European Commission has rejected its 2019 budget. The EU executive says the budget will not lower Italy's large public debt as the rules require.
Salvini said the European Union should focus on fostering growth rather than be obsessed by ""decimal places"" and reiterated a pledge to lower retirement ages and cut taxes.

""Someone has betrayed the European dream, but we will put blood and strength back into the veins of a new European community,"" he said.

Lebanon said Israeli soldiers had fired in the air when they were surprised by a Lebanese army patrol on the Lebanese side.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Israel said three people who were ""apparently Hezbollah activists"" approached its forces on the Israeli side as they carried out an operation to shut down tunnels that Israel has said were dug across the border by the Lebanese group.
""Troops fired toward the suspects in accordance with the standard operating procedures. The three fled. The work in the area continues as usual,"" the Israeli military said in a statement.
Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the Israeli soldiers shot into the air when they saw a Lebanese army patrol near the border demarcation, known as the ""Blue Line"". 
""Israeli enemy soldiers shot into the air following their deployment near the Blue Line in Kroum al-Sharaqi region to the east of Meis al-Jabal village,"" NNA said.
The Israelis ""were surprised, due to thick fog, by a routine Lebanese army patrol inside the Lebanese territories"", it added.
Israel's military said on Tuesday it had found a number of passages dug across the Israel-Lebanon border to be used for carrying out attacks inside Israel. It sent mechanical diggers, troops and anti-tunneling equipment there to shut them down.
The situation has so far remained calm on both sides of the border. But the Israeli operation has brought renewed attention to a frontier across which Israel and Hezbollah fought a war in 2006.
The Israeli military has said its activity would, for now, stop on the Israeli side of the border. But an Israeli cabinet minister said on Friday that Israel was prepared to take action in Lebanon against cross-border tunnels if deemed necessary.
The United Nations peacekeeping Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), confirmed the existence of a tunnel near the ""Blue Line"" on Thursday, describing it as a ""serious occurrence"".

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2018 09:12AM ET</span>","Iran's Rouhani says sanctions may lead to drugs, refugee, bomb 'deluge'","DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani predicted a ""deluge"" of drugs, refugees and attacks on the West if U.S. sanctions weaken Iran's ability to contain them.
""I warn those who impose sanctions that if Iran's ability to fight drugs and terrorism are affected ... you will not be safe from a deluge of drugs, asylum seekers, bombs and terrorism,"" Rouhani said in a speech carried live on state television.
Separately, Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted as saying that the United States is selling more arms into the Middle East than the region needs, making it a ""tinderbox"".
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran in May and reimposed sanctions on Iran’s vital oil industry last month.
Drug trafficking is a serious challenge for Iran as it borders Afghanistan - the world’s largest opium producer - and Pakistan, a major transit country for drugs.
""We spend $800 million a year to fight drugs which ensures the health of nations stretching from of Eastern Europe to the American West and North Africa to West Asia. Imagine what a disaster there would be if there is a breach in the dam,"" Rouhani said.
In 2012, Iran accounted for two thirds of the world’s opium seizures and one fourth of the world’s heroin and morphine seizures, a U.N. report published in 2014 showed.
""We have been just as determined in the fight against terrorism ... sacrificing hundreds of valuable troops and spending millions of dollars annually,"" Rouhani said.
""We don't expect the West to pay their share, but they should know that sanctions hurt Iran's capacity to fight drugs and terrorism,"" Rouhani added.
Iran, a key supporter of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war, has sent military advisers as well as materiel and regional Shi’ite militias to fight militant groups. 
In Iraq, Iranian-backed militias and their Iranian advisers helped Iraq defeat Islamic State.
""Economic terrorism means creating horror in a country and create fear in other countries that intend to invest (there). America's withdrawal from the (nuclear accord) is undoubtedly a clear example of economic terrorism,"" Rouhani told a meeting of heads of parliaments of China, Russia, and four other countries.
More than 700,000 undocumented Afghans have returned from Iran this year as the Iranian economy tightens, according to data from the U.N.’s migration agency, and Iranian media said some Afghans were seeking to enter Turkey to reach Europe. 
Zarif warned about the dangers of large U.S. arms sales in the Middle East, where Iran's regional rival Saudi Arabia is a major buyer of Western weapons.

""The Americans have turned the region into a tinderbox. The level of arms sales by the Americans is unbelievable and much beyond regional needs and this points to the very dangerous policies followed by the Americans,"" IRNA reported Zarif as saying.

1571,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2018 08:54AM ET</span>","As election nears, religious tensions surge in an Indian village","By Krishna N. Das
NAYABANS, India (Reuters) - Nayabans isn't remarkable as northern Indian villages go. Sugar cane grows in surrounding fields, women carry animal feed in bullock carts through narrow lanes, people chatter outside a store, and cows loiter.
But this week, the village in Uttar Pradesh state became a symbol of the deepening communal divide in India as some Hindu men from the area complained they had seen a group of Muslims slaughtering cows in a mango orchard a couple of miles away.
That infuriated Hindus, who regard the cow as a sacred animal. Anger against Muslims turned into outrage that police had not stopped an illegal practice, and a Hindu mob blocked a highway, threw stones, burned vehicles and eventually two people were shot and killed - including a police officer.
The events throw a spotlight on the religious strains in places like Nayabans since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power at the national level in 2014 and in Uttar Pradesh in 2017. Tensions are ratcheting up ahead of the next general election, due to be held by May.
The BJP said it was ""bizarre"" to assume the party would benefit from any religious disharmony, dismissing suggestions that its supporters were largely responsible for the tensions.
""In a large country like India nobody can ensure that nothing will go wrong, but it's our responsibility to maintain law and order and we understand that,"" party spokesman Gopal Krishna Agarwal said. ""But people are trying to politicize these issues.""
Nayabans, just about three hour's drive from Delhi, has about 400 Muslims out of a population of 4,000, the rest are Hindu. Relations between the communities began deteriorating around the Muslim holy month of Ramadan last year when Hindus in the village demanded that loudspeakers used to call for prayer at a makeshift mosque be removed, local Muslims said.
""For 40 years mikes were used in the mosque, calls for prayer were made five times a day, but no one objected,"" said Waseem Khan, a 28-year-old Muslim community leader in Nayabans.
""We resisted initially but then we thought it's better to live in peace then create a dispute over a mike,"" he said. ""We don't want to give them a chance to fan communal tensions.""
Reuters spoke with more than a dozen Muslims from the village but except for Khan, no one else wanted to be named for fear of angering the Hindu population. 
Several among a group of Muslim women and girls standing outside the mosque said they have been living in fear since the BJP came to power in the state in 2017.
They said that Hindu groups now hold provocative processions through the village during every Hindu festival, loudspeakers blaring, something that used to happen rarely before. They said they felt ""terrorized"" by Hindu activists.
""While passing through our areas during their religious rallies, they chant 'Pakistan murdabad' (down with Pakistan) as if we have some connection to Pakistan just because we are Muslims,"" Khan said.
HINDU PRIEST CHIEF MINISTER
The subcontinent was divided into Muslim Pakistan and Hindu-majority India at the time of independence from British colonial rule in 1947.
During the violence on Monday, many Muslims in Nayabans locked themselves in their homes fearing attacks. Some who had attended a three-day Muslim religious congregation some miles away stayed outside the area that night to avoid making themselves targets for the mob.
Muslim villagers say they are particularly fearful of the top elected official in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who is a Hindu priest and senior BJP figure. Hindu hardliners started asserting themselves more in the village after he was elected, they say.
Uttar Pradesh sends 80 lawmakers to the lower house of parliament, the largest of any state in the country. 
Considered the county's political crucible, it has also been the scene for spiraling Hindu-Muslim tensions. 
Adityanath said the lead up to the rioting in Nayabans was a ""big conspiracy"", but did not elaborate.
In the only statement from his office on the incident, Adityanath ordered police to arrest those directly or indirectly involved in the slaughter of cows and made no mention of the death of the police inspector. He announced 1 million rupees ($14,110) as compensation for the family of the other dead man, a local who is among those accused by police for the violence.
Both men were Hindus and died of bullet wounds, although police said it was not yet clear who shot whom.
Police say they have arrested up to five people for the cow slaughter but have not given their religion. Locals say all the arrested people are Muslims. Four Hindu men have been arrested for the violence leading to the deaths.
""All invidious elements who may have conspired to vitiate the situation will be exposed through a fair and transparent investigation,"" Anand Kumar, the second highest police official in Uttar Pradesh, told Reuters.
Asked if there was any bias against Muslims, Uttar Pradesh government spokesman Sidharth Nath Singh - who is also the state's health minister - told Reuters: ""We believe in equality and our motto is sabka saath, sabka vikas"", using a Hindi phrase often used by Modi that means ""collective effort, inclusive growth"".
RELATIVE HARMONY
The two communities in Nayabans have lived in relative harmony for years, residents from both groups said. 
But now Hindus in the village, who mostly say they support Yogi, accuse the Muslims of trying to turn themselves into the victims when they weren't.
""Can't believe they are raising our processions with journalists!"" said Daulat, a Hindu daily wage laborer who goes by one name. ""They are making it a Hindu-Muslim issue, we are not. Their people have been accused of killing cows, so they are playing the victim.""
At a middle school, meters from the police outpost near where the two men got killed, two women teachers, sitting on a veranda soaking in the winter sun, said its 66 students stopped coming for classes in the first few days after the violence.
""We worship cows and their slaughter can't be accepted,"" said one of the teachers, Uma Rani. ""Two Hindus died here but nothing happened to the cow killers.""
Both teachers were Hindus.
Political analysts say relations between the two communities are likely to stay tense ahead of the national vote, particularly in polarized states such as Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP made a near-clean sweep in Uttar Pradesh in 2014, helping Modi win the country's biggest parliamentary mandate in three decades, but pollsters predict a tighter contest next year because of a lack of jobs and low farm prices.
""Facing economic headwinds and lackluster job growth, Modi will rally his conservative base by selectively resorting to Hindu nationalism,"" global security consultancy Stratfor said last month.
Muslims say they increasingly feel like second-class citizens in their own country.
""The BJP will definitely benefit from such incidents,"" said Tahir Saifi, a Muslim community leader a few miles from the area of violence who supports a regional opposition party in Uttar Pradesh. ""They want all Hindus to unite, and when religion comes into the picture, other issues like development take a back seat.""

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2018 08:36AM ET</span>",Merkel protege seeks to unite German CDU after divisive leadership battle,"By Paul Carrel
HAMBURG (Reuters) - Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the new leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, sought to bind the party together after a divisive leadership battle by promoting a rival's ally to a key post on Saturday.
Delegates from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) elected Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, on Friday to replace Merkel as party leader, a decision that moves her into pole position to succeed Europe's most influential leader as chancellor.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, the continuity candidate favored by the party elite, won a narrow victory over the more conservative Friedrich Merz in a run-off. Health Minister Jens Spahn, also a more conservative candidate, was knocked out in a first round.
On Saturday, Kramp-Karrenbauer proposed Paul Ziemiak, head of the Junge Union, the conservatives' youth wing, to replace her as CDU secretary general - a role in which he will organize the party, election campaigns and congresses, and support her.
Party delegates duly elected Ziemiak, 33, but with just 62.8 percent of the votes cast - a far narrower margin than the overwhelming 98.9 percent support with which Kramp-Karrenbauer was elected to the secretary general post in February.
After the bruising leadership election, Ziemiak and other leading CDU officials sought to rally the party.
""Now the task is to renew the party with a clear course and clear communication,"" Ziemiak said. ""Let's believe together and let's win together!""
The tight nature of Ziemiak's victory reflected the divisions in the CDU after a robust campaign for the leadership. Kramp-Karrenbauer's first job as new party leader is to try to unite the CDU ahead of European and regional elections in 2019.
""Paul Ziemiak is from the home region of Friedrich Merz. He's a close friend, from the Junge Union, of Jens Spahn,"" David McAllister, a member of the CDU's executive committee, told Reuters.
""So this move to choose Paul Ziemiak is a step forward by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, trying to unite the different camps which the endorsed the three different candidates,"" he added.
However, the move quickly drew criticism from some. 
""I am not going to hide that I would have liked a secretary general from the east,"" Ingo Senftleben, Brandenburg CDU chief, told the NBR media group. He said Kramp-Karrenbauer must fulfill her promise to pay attention to the east before three state elections there next year. 
BRIDGE BUILDER
Merkel needs Kramp-Karrenbauer to unite the CDU to help steady her ruling coalition with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) - an awkward alliance that has come close to collapse several times since being formed in March.
After a series of electoral setbacks, Kramp-Karrenbauer must use her ability to reach beyond party lines to shore up the CDU.
The party bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in last September's federal election and is also losing support to the Greens, who are now running second in national polls behind the Christian Democrats.
In October, the CDU lost over 10 percentage points in a state election in Hesse. Merkel announced she would stand down as party leader after that damaging result.
Kramp-Karrenbauer is a renowned bridge-builder - a skill set that helped win her the party leadership, and in her home state of Saarland, where she led an experimental three-way coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats and the Greens.
Merkel's decision to stand down as CDU leader is part of her slow, stage-managed exit from politics. She wants to remain chancellor until the next federal election, due by October 2021 and should be able to work comfortably with Kramp-Karrenbauer.

However, some commentators have suggested that with her preferred candidate in charge of the party, Merkel may decide she could step down early and leave Germany in her hands.

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2018 08:21AM ET</span>",UK cabinet minister floats 'Plan B' ahead of key vote on May's Brexit deal,"By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - A close ally of British Prime Minister Theresa May on Saturday became the first cabinet minister to float a possible Plan B if, as expected, parliament next week rejects her plan to leave the European Union.
With her own future in the balance, May insists her deal, laboriously negotiated with the EU over many months, is the only one on the table and that the alternatives are a painful 'no-deal' exit from the EU or possibly no Brexit at all.
However, members of parliament, including from May's own Conservative Party, look set to reject her deal, which envisages continued close ties with the EU, in a move that would pitch the world's fifth-largest economy into even deeper uncertainty.
While agreeing with May that her deal provides the best option for exiting the EU, Amber Rudd, the work and pensions minister, said a Norway-style relationship with the bloc might also offer a way out of the current deadlock.
""If it (May's plan) doesn't get through anything could happen: people's vote, Norway plus, any of these options could come forward,"" she told BBC radio on Saturday.
Rudd told The Times newspaper in an interview her own preferred option, if May's deal failed, was the ""Norway Plus"" model, adding it ""seems plausible not just in terms of the country but in terms of where the MPs are"".
Norway is not an EU member but is in the bloc's single market, which allows for free movement of goods, capital, services and people. 'Norway plus' envisages Britain also staying in the EU's customs union, which Norway is not in.
Some pro-EU lawmakers have also expressed support for a second referendum on EU membership, or 'a people's vote'. 
MAY'S LEADERSHIP QUESTIONED 
The Times also reported on Saturday that plans were being made across party lines to vote against May's leadership if she loses Tuesday's vote. The Daily Telegraph quoted a senior Conservative lawmaker as saying she might be forced to resign.
Rudd said she believed May should stay on as prime minister even if parliament rejects her Brexit deal. 
""There is no question of her going,"" Rudd told the BBC.
But The Times said the main opposition Labour Party was seeking an alliance with rebel Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party, the small Northern Irish party which props up the minority government, to call a vote of no-confidence in May's premiership.
That vote would not be binding but would place enormous pressure on May to resign, it added. 
Conservative lawmaker and former leader Iain Duncan Smith was quoted in the Telegraph as saying her leadership could come into question if she lost Tuesday's vote.
""I believe that if (May's) response is ""we've lost but we will do this all over again"", it will become a leadership issue,"" it reported him as saying. 
The newspaper also said three ministers were considering resigning in opposition to her deal, without citing sources. 
If the Brexit deal is rejected, ministers have 21 days to state how they intend to proceed. The government has previously said that if the agreement is rejected, Britain will leave the EU without a deal.

May's spokesman said on Friday the vote would go ahead next week despite calls from some lawmakers for it to be delayed to avoid a defeat so big that it might bring down the government.

Murtaza Ahmadi, now aged 7, grabbed world headlines two years ago when his brother made him a shirt out of a blue and white plastic bag, with Messi's name and number 10 playing number.
His sudden fame won him a meeting with his hero but caused problems for his family, members of the Hazara ethnic minority from Jaghori district in the central province of Ghazni.
""Murtaza became famous around the world and we are not able to walk free and go anywhere. Murtaza and my other children were not able to go to school,"" his mother Shafiqa Ahmadi said in the home in Kabul where the family is staying.
""During the night suspected men were walking near our house and when the Taliban attacked our village we decided to leave.""
Ghazni, about two hours drive south of the capital Kabul, has been the scene of intense fighting this year. The Taliban briefly overran Ghazni city in August and there has been heavy fighting in Jaghori, forcing thousands to flee.

""The security situation is not good and I am afraid to go outside,"" Murtaza said. ""I want to become a footballer like Messi and I want to be able to go to school.""

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Thousands of Hungarians protested in Budapest on Saturday against a proposed new labor law that allows employers to ask for up to 400 hours of overtime work per year, a move its critics have billed as the ""slave law"".
Members of trade unions and their supporters gathered under gray winter skies and marched waving banners like ""we protest against the slave law"" and ""force your mother to do overtime"".
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has ruffled feathers in Europe and built a system his critics see as autocratic, forcing his will on business, academia, the courts and the media, but he has rarely angered large voter groups at once.
The last move that struck a nerve with so many people that it forced Orban to backtrack was a planned tax on internet data traffic, abandoned in late 2014 after tens of thousands marched against it.
The modification to the labor code submitted to Parliament this week has faced intense criticism, sparking the biggest street protest in over a year. Potentially, it could add two extra hours to an average work day, or the equivalent of an extra workday per week. 
Police blocked off the main square outside Parliament, where the protest was headed originally, forcing the march to loop around the central Budapest area and fill Constitution Road, the main street leading up to Parliament. 
""We are all really upset about the way things are going in this country,"" Zoltan Laszlo, vice chairman of the Vasas ironworkers union, told Reuters. ""This government just makes laws with scant consultation of those affected.""
""Our health status is already abysmal. People who make these kinds of laws work against society. We'll show them that we can take our fate into our own hands. We are willing to turn a lot harsher.""
According to the bill posted on Parliament's website, employers are guaranteed an extra 250 hours of overtime per worker per year. For the rest, they would have to seek employees' agreement.
Lajos Kosa, the Fidesz lawmaker who was the original author of the changes, told Parliament this week that the Hungarian workweek will continue to consist of five eight-hour days as a rule, stressing that employees will get paid for any overtime.
He added that the weekly ceiling including extra overtime will be 48 hours of work.

PARIS (Reuters) - French riot police fired tear gas and clashed with ""yellow vest"" protesters in central Paris on Saturday during the latest in a wave of demonstrations against the high cost of living that have shaken President Emmanuel Macron's authority.
Authorities said 575 people had been searched and briefly arrested and 361 people of them remained in custody after police found potential weapons such as hammers, baseball bats and metal petanque balls on them.
Hundreds of protesters were milling around the Arc de Triomphe monument, which was defaced with anti-Macron graffiti last Saturday, when rioters also torched dozens of cars and looted shops in the worst rioting in Paris since May 1968.
A police spokeswoman told reporters there were about 1,500 protesters on the Champs Elysees boulevard. Large groups of people spilled into other areas and heading to eastern Paris, where a march against climate change was scheduled for the afternoon. Some also temporarily blocked the ring road circling central Paris. 
""We took the train for 11 hours just to protest today. We feel scorned by these technocrats that govern us,"" said Gilles Noblet, a demonstrator from the southwest region of Ariege.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe appealed for restraint.
""We will do all we can so that today can be a day without violence, so that the dialogue that we started this week can continue in the best possible circumstances,"" he said on French television.
On Tuesday, Philippe announced the government was suspending planned increases to fuel taxes for at least six months to help defuse weeks of protests, the first U-turn by Macron since he came to power 18 months ago. 
About 89,000 police were deployed across France on Saturday, some 8,000 of them in Paris.
""TROUBLEMAKERS""
""We have prepared a robust response,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told online news site Brut. He called on peaceful protesters not to get mixed up with ""hooligans"".
""The troublemakers can only be effective when they disguise themselves as yellow vests. Violence is never a good way to get what you want. Now is the time for discussion,"" he said. 
""We have come here for a peaceful march, not to smash things. We want equality, we want to live, not survive,"" said Guillaume Le Grac, 28, who works in a slaughterhouse in the town of Guingamp in Britanny.
Protesters, using social media, have billed the weekend as ""Act IV"" in a dramatic challenge to Macron and his policies. 
Small groups of riot police moved quickly among protesters and clamped down on anyone trying to damage shops or public amenities.
Much of Paris looked like a ghost town, with museums, department stores closed on what should have been a festive pre-Christmas shopping day.
Many shops were boarded up to avoid looting and street furniture and construction site materials have been removed to prevent them from being used as projectiles. 
Tourists were few and residents were advised to stay at home if at all possible. Dozens of streets were closed to traffic, while the Eiffel Tower and world-famous museums such as the Musee d'Orsay, the Centre Pompidou and the Louvre were shut.
""Tourists are a bit disoriented - no subway, no shopping, no museums... but they seem to take it in their stride,"" said hotel receptionist Pascal, who declined to give his surname. 
The protests, named after the high-visibility safety jackets French motorists have to keep in their cars, erupted in November over the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes.
Demonstrations have since swelled into a broad, sometimes violent rebellion against Macron, a challenge made more difficult to handle since the movement has no formal leader.
Authorities say the protests have been hijacked by far-right and anarchist elements bent on violence and stirring up social unrest in a direct affront to Macron and the security forces. 
Despite the government's climbdown over the fuel tax, the 'yellow vests' continue to demand more concessions, including lower taxes, a higher minimum wage, lower energy costs, better retirement benefits and even Macron's resignation.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court handed President Donald Trump a defeat on Friday when it refused to allow his order barring asylum for immigrants who enter the country illegally to take effect, while a court challenge proceeds.
Trump cited an overwhelmed immigration system for his recent proclamation that officials will only process asylum claims for migrants who present themselves at an official entry point. Civil rights groups sued, arguing that Trump's Nov. 9 order violated administrative and immigration law.
A San Francisco judge last month issued a temporary restraining order against the asylum rules, which applied nationwide. The U.S. Department of Justice called that ruling ""absurd"" and asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to allow Trump's policy to take effect while the lawsuits proceed. 
Trump has often attacked the 9th Circuit, which has more judges appointed by Democrat presidents than Republicans, accusing it of frustrating his policy initiatives, particularly on immigration. 
The split 9th Circuit ruling on Friday was written by Judge Jay Bybee, an appointee of Republican president George W. Bush. Bybee agreed with the lower court that Trump's policy likely exceeds his authority.
""The Executive has attempted an end-run around Congress,"" Bybee wrote.
A Justice Department spokesman declined immediate comment, but reiterated a previous statement that the policy is a ""well reasoned exercise"" of Trump's authority.

9th Circuit Judge Andrew Hurwitz, an appointee of Democrat President Barack Obama, joined Bybee's ruling while Edward Leavy, an appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, dissented.

The report was released as the United Nations brought Yemen's warring sides together for the first peace talks in two years. Humanitarian groups say peace is the only way of ending the world's largest humanitarian crisis.
While war was the main cause of the hunger crisis, it was exacerbated by extremely high food prices, a liquidity crisis, disrupted livelihoods, and high levels of unemployment, the report said, adding food aid was not enough to plug the gap. 
""Immediate responses are required to save lives and livelihoods of millions not to slide to the next worse case which is famine,"" it said.
The survey was conducted by Yemeni officials and international experts according to the international IPC system, which uses a five point scale where 3 is ""crisis"", 4 is ""emergency"" and 5 is ""catastrophe"" and possibly famine.
The release of the report, which is based on a survey completed in October, was delayed several times without explanation and is planned to be updated in March.
It showed many pockets of extreme hunger across Yemen, concentrated in areas with active fighting, and especially affecting the 3 million displaced people, their host families, landless wage laborers and other marginalized groups.
The governorates of Hodeidah, Amanat Al Asimah, Dhamar, Hajjah, Ibb and Taiz each had more than one million people in a crisis situation or worse, and without humanitarian aid 13 governorates would be in a food catastrophe, the survey showed. 
The 15.9 million people in phases 3-5 could hit 20.1 million people, 67 percent of the population, if there is not adequate food aid. The number in ""catastrophe"" would triple to 238,000. 

Some of the figures were released by the U.N. on Thursday.

After weeks of pressure by pro-Malay groups, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's multi-ethnic government decided last month that it would not ratify the convention, without giving a reason why it was going back on an earlier commitment to sign.
Groups representing Malays, who account for around 60 percent of Malaysia's multi-ethnic population, raised fears that signing the UN pledge could have undermined Malay privileges and threatened Islam's status as Malaysia's official religion. 
Badly beaten in an election earlier this year, Malay opposition parties seized on the issue, along with activists, to organize the rally, as race is a sensitive matter for the southeast Asian nation of 32 million people.
Seeking to rebuild support, Najib Razak, Malaysia's scandal-plagued former prime minister, and Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who replaced him as head of the former ruling party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), and the leader of Parti Islam Se-Malaysia, PAS, all attended the rally.
Their supporters, wearing white, converged on the capital's Merdeka Square (NYSE:SQ) following afternoon prayers. Some chanted ""God is Great"" and slogans against the UN convention, while holding up placards calling for the defense of Malay rights and dignity. 
Citing police estimates, media put the size of the rally at around 50,000 people. 
""We are here to defend our rights as Malays,"" said Faridah Harun, a 59-year-old mother of seven, who traveled down from the northern state of Perak to join the rally with her husband. 
""We have ruled this country very well for a very long time, but now there are people who want to take over and do things like shut down MARA,"" she said, referring to a trust fund for Malays and indigenous people.
Affirmative action policies introduced after deadly race riots in the late 1960s gave Malays advantages including university quotas, housing discounts, government guaranteed savings plans, and equity ownership quotas.
Whereas Mahathir's coalition enjoyed overwhelming support among voters from the minority ethnic Chinese and Indian communities, who together account for 30 percent of the population, it remains locked in a battle to win over Malays who have remained loyal to UMNO and PAS.
In a statement published late Friday, Mahathir said the government had no objection to the rally so long as it remained peaceful and orderly.

""On behalf of the government, if the rally is held on the basis of thanksgiving, we are thankful for the support shown,"" he said in the video posted on his social media pages.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2018 12:36AM ET</span>",Mexico's top court suspends public sector pay cuts law,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's Supreme Court on Friday suspended a new law that cuts public sector pay, freezing it until the tribunal has made a definitive ruling on the legislation, and dealing a blow to Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Promulgated in November, the law stipulates that no public servant can earn more than the president.
Vowing to fight corruption and reduce inequality, Lopez Obrador has vowed to push through a raft of austerity measures. He has cut his own salary to 40 percent of what his predecessor earned, to 108,000 pesos ($5,331.36) per month.
However, opposition senators filed a challenge against the pay cut law, saying it violated the rights of public servants.
In granting the suspension, the court said in a statement the law could not be applied until a definitive ruling had been made. That complicates the government's first budget under Lopez Obrador, a veteran leftist who took office on Saturday.
The 2019 budget is due to be presented on Dec. 15, meaning the government may have to revise its spending plans.
Mario Delgado, lower house leader of Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), blamed the opposition for trying to protect what he called the ""gilded bureaucracy"" and said his party had a right to set pay levels in the budget.
""We will put the cap on the president's salary, and go downward from there for everyone,"" he told Mexican radio.
The dispute could fuel tensions between Congress and the Supreme Court, which some supporters of the law accuse of having a vested interest in protecting its members' salaries. 
Lopez Obrador won office by a landslide in July, helping to propel MORENA and its coalition allies to the first outright majority in both houses of Congress in Mexico since 1997.
After the court's decision, Lopez Obrador told a crowd in the western state of Nayarit, where he was pledging aid for victims of a recent hurricane, that the days of having a ""rich government with a poor population"" had to end.
""The guys on top have a great life,"" he said. ""Now they're angry because they were earning 600,000 pesos a month. And that's all over.""

The Ministry of Defence looks to spend at least 27 trillion yen ($240 billion) between April 2019 and March 2024, with the spending rising an average 1.1 percent per year, exceeding the 0.8 percent average during the five years ending next March, the report said without identifying its sources.
Currently, payments on equipment and personnel expenses account for 80 percent of defense spending, Nikkei said. Under the plan, funds for new equipment purchases will be separated from these expenses, making it easier to buy equipment from the United States, it added.
Japan aims to have cabinet approval for the spending in mid-December, it said. The Ministry of Defence could not be reached immediately for comment.
Purchases of American-made equipment could help Tokyo ease trade friction with Washington as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes Japan to buy more American goods, including military gear, while threatening to impose tariffs on Japanese auto imports to cut a trade deficit with Tokyo.
Japan's Ministry of Defence in August sought record spending of 5.3 trillion yen next year to help pay for major upgrades to defenses designed to shoot down any North Korean ballistic missile, which that Tokyo sees as a continued threat despite Pyongyang's promise to abandon nuclear weapons.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been reinforcing Japan's military to respond to any North Korea missile strike and counter China's growing air and sea power in the waters around Japan.

Japan remains wary of North Korean promises to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. The Ministry of Defence said in a white paper published in August Pyongyang remained Japan's ""most serious and pressing threat"".

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 08:19PM ET</span>",Many U.S.-bound caravan migrants disperse as asylum process stalls,"By Christine Murray
TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Thousands of Central American migrants spent weeks traveling north through Mexico in caravans, walking and hitching rides when possible, only for many to give up hope and turn back when they met resistance at the U.S. border.
Others hopped the border fence, often directly into the hands of immigration authorities on the U.S. side, while still others dug in at temporary lodgings in Tijuana for the long process of seeking asylum from a reluctant U.S. government.
As rain poured down on a former music venue in Tijuana that holds a diminished crowd of 2,500 migrants, Jessica, 18, grabbed her feverish 1-year-old daughter and took her inside to a friend while she figured out what to do with her broken tent.
Jessica had traveled from El Salvador, and said she and her husband were waiting in the Barretal camp for the right moment to try to cross the border illegally.
""Getting asylum is really difficult,"" she said. ""They ask you for a lot of evidence and it's impossible. It's not like they say it is."" 
Other migrants face the same dilemma. Of 6,000 who arrived in Tijuana in the caravans last month, 1,000 have scrambled over border fences, and most of those were detained, the head of Mexico's civil protection agency David Leon told local media on Wednesday.
A further 1,000 have accepted voluntary deportation, he said, while others are living on the street outside the municipal sports center where they first arrived, or in smaller shelters. The director of the Barretal camp, Mario Medina, said he expected hundreds more to arrive within days.
U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to make it harder to get asylum, but a federal court last month placed a temporary restraining order on his policy that only permitted asylum claims made at official ports of entry. 
Under former President Barack Obama a system dubbed ""metering"" began, which limits how many can ask for asylum each day in Tijuana. Lawyers say Trump is using the system more aggressively to stem the flow at the port of entry. 
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokeswoman said the agency works with Mexico and charities to manage the flow, but denied that people were being prevented from making asylum claims. 
Mexico's National Immigration Institute, which did not respond to requests for comment, has said in the past it protects migrants rights, while respecting other countries' immigration policies. 
Looking after the large groups of Central Americans is a challenge for Mexico. New President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to issue more work visas and on Friday pledged to do more to improve conditions at the Barretal shelter.
His government is in talks with Washington about an immigration plan, including a U.S. proposal to make asylum seekers stay in Mexico until their claim is decided, a process that can take years. Some believe that would deter people from seeking refuge. 
    
NAVIGATING THE LIST
Despite the wait, more people are adding their names to the semi-formal asylum list. Created a couple of years ago around the time an influx of Haitians arrived in Tijuana seeking to enter the United States, it has been challenged in a U.S. lawsuit that claims it deliberately delays asylum seekers.  
Migrants put their names in a black-and-white ledger, controlled by around eight migrant volunteers. Those on the list are given a number and must wait months to pass through for an interview. The list contains thousands of names from around the world.
Each day, CBP officials communicate with Mexican immigration officials who then tell the migrants how many can go through, according to volunteers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. They said between 40 and 100 per day are usually sent.
At the end of each day, Mexican immigration officials guard the ledger. Lawyers have cited multiple problems with this system. For instance, they have said, some people on the list could be Mexicans fleeing the federal government.
Some migrants expressed distrust of the list. Honduran Anabell Pineda, 26, said she thought the process was not for her as she left behind a daughter in Honduras.
""They say, though I don't know, that asylum is for people that don't want to go back to their country, and I do want to go back,"" she said. 
Pineda, traveling with her son, said that once she gets her paperwork, she plans find a job in Mexico City.
Pineda has applied for a humanitarian visa that will get her a work permit in Mexico, a better bet than trying to get to the United States, she said.
""It's really difficult to cross, because of what happened last time. I don't want to put my children in danger,"" she said, referring to disturbances in which U.S. officials launched tear gas at migrants last month.
At a jobs fair set up by the federal Labor Ministry, coordinator Nayla Rangel said more than 3,000 migrants, mainly from the caravan, had job interviews. 

Rangel said there were more than 10,000 jobs open in the state of Baja California, with salaries around 1500 pesos ($74) per week. For many migrants hoping to send money to families in Central America, that likely would not be enough.

Ricky Ian Swan was one of four men charged in September with using weapons to torture and kill two kangaroos. Swan chased one of the kangaroos inflicting more than 20 stab wounds and kicking the dying animal in the head.
""You subjected this particular animal to a savage and brutal attack,"" ABC cited Magistrate Deen Potter as saying. 
Potter also said that Swan's actions amounted to cruelty to an animal and included torture, mutilation and malicious behavior.
""I don't know what came over me,"" ABC cited Swan's remarks from one of his sentencing reports. ""It's disgusting. That person in the video is not me.""
The Joondalup Magistrates Court in Western Australia handed Swan an immediate 12-month jail term, seven months of which were suspended. Swan previously pleaded guilty to two animal cruelty charges. 
Earlier in the week, the court sentenced Swan's co-accused, a 26-year-old Perth man, to two years in prison for a series of animal cruelty offences, which the court said displayed ""monstrosity"", ABC reported.
According to government statistics there are about 45 million kangaroos in Australia and the number is growing rapidly, nearly doubling the human population, now at 25 million. 
Most animal welfare is regulated at the state or territory level.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 07:40PM ET</span>",Japan opens door wider to foreign blue-collar workers despite criticism,"By Linda Sieg and Ami Miyazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan, in a major policy shift, enacted on Saturday a law to let in more foreign, blue-collar workers to ease a labor shortage, despite criticism it was too hastily crafted and risked exposing the workers to exploitation.
Immigration has long been taboo in a country where many prize ethnic homogeneity, but the shrinking, aging population has increased pressure to relax strict controls on foreign workers.
The legislation, which was approved by parliament's upper house in the early hours after delaying tactics by opposition parties, will take effect from April. It creates two new categories of visas for blue-collar workers in sectors facing a labor crunch. 
One category is for workers who can stay for up to five years but cannot bring family members. The other is for more skilled foreigners who can bring relatives and might eventually be eligible for residency.
Details including how many foreign workers will be let in, what sectors are covered and what skills are needed are not spelled out in the law, one reason opposition lawmakers say more time should have been spent drafting the legislation.
The government has said that up to 345,150 blue-collar workers will be allowed in over five years. Initially, a figure of 500,000 was considered.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is eager to respond to demands from businesses facing the tightest labor market in four decades.
But he is also wary of angering conservatives in his party who fear more foreigners would mean a rise in crime and cultural clashes. 
He has therefore insisted the new steps do not add up to an ""immigration policy"", stressing instead the need to fill labor- market gaps.
But critics say the government should accept the need for long-term foreign residents, not only to fill jobs but to pay taxes and spend money, and should make better plans to integrate them.
""For the national government, foreign residents are forgotten people ... and those who stay are the exception,"" said Toshihiro Menju, managing director of the Japan Center for International Exchange think-tank.
The changes have fanned concern that the defects of a ""technical trainees"" program, introduced in the 1990s, will be perpetuated. Critics see that program as an exploitative backdoor to unskilled foreign labor and want it abolished.
""Because the trainee program got a bad image, they are just re-labelling it,"" said Yohei Moriwake, head of a non-profit organization in Akitakata, a rural city in southwest Japan that wants to attract more foreigners to stem its population decline. 
Japan has about 1.28 million foreign workers - more than double the figure a decade ago and about 2 percent of the workforce. About 260,000 are trainees from countries such as Vietnam and China who can stay three to five years. 
Japanese businesses are keen - a Reuters survey showed three-quarters welcomed the planned changes - but voters are divided over the new legislation.
A November survey by NHK public TV showed 27 percent approved, 30 percent disapproved and 36 percent were undecided.
A majority - 62 percent - saw no need to rush the revision through this session of parliament, which ends on Monday.

TERVUREN, Belgium (Reuters) - Belgium's Africa Museum will reopen to the public on Sunday after five years of renovations designed to modernize the museum from an exhibition of pro-colonial propaganda to one that is critical of Belgium's imperialist past.
The museum, full of artefacts and stuffed wildlife, was often criticized for ignoring the brutalities of King Leopold II's fiefdom, whose troops collected the hands of those who resisted slave labor at a time when millions of Congolese people are estimated to have died.
Many of the artefacts remain, but there is more commentary from African people on video screens, displays by Congolese artists, one including a 120-member family tree, in a bid to centralize Africans rather than Europeans.
Colonial history is now concentrated in one gallery, rather than dominating the whole museum, which also deals with current issues facing Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its diaspora.
""We also assume our responsibility that for more than 60 years, we've diffused, we've disseminated an image of a superior, western way of thinking to African cultures,"" said museum Director Guido Gryseels.
In the large rotunda, a statue remains of a European missionary with an African boy clutching his robes with a plaque that reads: ""Belgium brings civilization to Congo"". But now the room is dominated by a giant wooden sculpture of an African man's head, sculptured by an artist born in DRC.
The museum also features a new entry pavilion.
Many Belgians remain ignorant of their country's harsh rule in what is now Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the late 19th century. It became the setting for Joseph Conrad's influential 1899 novella ""Heart of Darkness"".
Belgium's colonial past made the small European country one of the world's most successful trading economies.
The 66 million euros ($75.1 million) renovation to the Africa museum, set in a palatial, neoclassical building in a landscaped park just outside the capital Brussels, hopes to confront Belgians with their colonial past.
But activists says that by containing stolen artefacts it represents a continuation of colonialism.
""There is no decolonization without restitution,"" said Mireille-Tsheusi Robert, who was born in the DRC before moving to Belgium, where she authored a book on racism. 
The debate about whether colonial-era art should be returned home has intensified after French President Emmanuel Macron promised to return some African art to the continent and Germany this year published guidelines for considering repatriation.
Gryseels said the museum was open to returning some artefacts.
King Philippe declined an invitation to attend the museum's inauguration on Saturday, but Prime Minister Charles Michel and some ministers will attend. 
Activists will hold a separate ceremony nearby at the graves of seven Congolese who died of influenza when they were imported for exhibition in a human zoo. The group is demanding Belgium erect a plaque in remembrance.
A plaque was put up at the location of the human zoo, while a new exhibit in the museum casts the shadows of names of Congolese people who died in Belgium over those of Belgians that perished in Africa.

Temer said via Twitter that he and the governor came to the conclusion that a negotiated intervention would be the best solution to ""pacify"" the situation in Roraima.
Waves of Venezuelan migrants have been entering the border area in recent months, seeking refuge from poverty and hunger in the neighboring country. The thousands of refugees are straining public services and the state's finances.
On Thursday, police officers and agents in Roraima's prisons called for a strike protesting delays in salary payments.

Charlottesville, Va. (Reuters) - A white nationalist who drove his car into a crowd protesting against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year, killing one of the counterdemonstrators, was found guilty on Friday of first-degree murder and nine other counts.
The jury deliberated for about seven hours before convicting James Fields, 21, of all charges stemming from the deadly attack that occurred after police had declared an unlawful assembly and cleared a city park of white supremacists gathered for the ""Unite the Right"" rally.
Fields, who did not take the witness stand to defend himself, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. The 12 members of the mostly white jury - seven women and five men - were to return to court on Monday for the start of the penalty phase of the trial.
Wearing a light-blue sweater and eyeglasses, Fields sat expressionless between his two attorneys as the verdict was pronounced, glancing briefly at spectators in the crowded courtroom.
Defense attorneys never disputed that Fields was behind the wheel of the Dodge Charger that sent bodies flying when it crashed into a crowd on Aug. 12, 2017, killing counterprotester Heather Heyer, 32 and injuring 19 others. 
Instead, Fields' lawyers suggested during the two-week trial that he felt intimidated by a hostile crowd and acted to protect himself.
Defense attorney Denise Lunsford told jurors in closing arguments that her client had expressed remorse when arrested, saying to police, ""I’m sorry I didn’t want to hurt anyone. I thought they were attacking me."" 
Prosecutors countered that Field was motivated by hatred and had come to the rally to harm others.
DAY OF TENSION 
The car-ramming capped a day of tension and physical clashes between hundreds of white supremacists and neo-Nazis who had assembled in Charlottesville to protest against the removal of statues commemorating two Confederate generals of the U.S. Civil War, and groups of opposing demonstrators.
The night before, the ""Unite the Right"" protesters had staged a torch-lit march through the nearby University of Virginia campus, chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans.
Republican U.S. President Donald Trump was strongly condemned by fellow Republicans as well as Democrats for saying afterward that ""both sides"" were to blame for the violence.
Fields, a resident of Maumee, Ohio, was photographed hours before the car attack carrying a shield with the emblem of a far-right hate group. He has identified himself as a neo-Nazi.
Fields also faces separate federal hate-crime charges, which carry a potential death sentence. He has pleaded not guilty in that case as well.
The mothers of both Fields and Heyer were present in the courtroom when the verdict was returned.
In addition to murder, Fields was convicted of five counts of aggravated malicious wounding, three counts of malicious wounding and a hit-and-run offense. 

Four other men from California described by prosecutors as members of a militant white supremacist group, Rise Above Movement, were arrested in October on federal charges of instigating violence during the Charlottesville rallies.

It said three others were injured in the accident, which happened on Thursday night in Qabqaba, a main gold mining area in the Nile River state where both licensed companies and individuals dig for the precious metal.
Gold mining is one of the main sources of foreign currency in the impoverished country, and most of it is done using traditional methods, often with few safety measures.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States has dropped a push for the United Nations Security Council to hold its fifth annual meeting on human rights abuses in North Korea this month as it does not have enough support, diplomats said on Friday. 
At least nine countries on the 15-member body need to back a request for the meeting, which Pyongyang ally China has unsuccessfully tried to block for the past four years. But diplomats said only eight members supported calling the meeting this time around.
""If we are unable to hold this important discussion this month, we hope to revisit holding this meeting in the new year,"" said a U.S. official. ""The U.S. remains deeply concerned with the human rights situation in North Korea.""
In a letter to the Security Council last week, North Korea accused the United States of trying to provoke and ""stoke confrontation"" by leading the request for the council meeting despite efforts by its leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump to work toward Pyongyang's denuclearization.
North Korea has repeatedly rejected accusations of human rights abuses and blames sanctions for a dire humanitarian situation. Pyongyang has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.
The United States could try again in January when five new members rotate onto the Security Council. Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington would likely have a better chance then of securing the minimum nine signatures needed to defeat any attempt to block the meeting. 
Since 2014, China has annually requested - and lost - a procedural vote to stop the discussion, which has always been held in December. 
""We continue to believe that discussions on human rights – and particularly concerning human rights abuses in North Korea – are a crucial part of the maintenance of international peace and security and worthy of the U.N. Security Council's attention,"" the U.S. official said. 
Some diplomats suggested the meeting could be postponed until after Trump and Kim have met again. Trump, who initially met the North Korean leader in Singapore in June, has said they are likely to meet a second time in January or February, with three sites for a summit under consideration.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley is due to step down in the coming weeks, so the job of trying to organize the Security Council meeting on North Korea could fall to her successor. Trump announced on Friday that he would nominate State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert to replace Haley.
A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities.
Then in 2016, the United States angered North Korea by blacklisting Kim for human rights abuses.
""To our deep surprise and regret, the Security Council is about to swim against the current trend by way of seeking to ... stoke confrontation, instead of encouraging and promoting the ongoing positive developments,"" North Korea's U.N. mission wrote to the council last week.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>","Cuba president says policy changes address people's concerns, not a setback","By Sarah Marsh
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said his government's last-minute changes to policies that went into effect on Friday following widespread criticism showed it listens to the people and were not a setback.
The Communist government this week watered down the most heavily criticized elements of new restrictions on free enterprise and promised to revise regulations accompanying a law on the cultural sector to address artists' concerns.
The changes to policies published in July came the same week as Cuba finally launched mobile internet, a long-awaited service that many had been skeptical would ever arrive in one of the world's least connected countries.
""There is no reason to believe the rectifications are setbacks nor to confuse them with weakness when one is listening to the people,"" Diaz-Canel, who succeeded Raul Castro in April, tweeted. ""None of us can do as much as we all can together.""
The government said on Wednesday it was lifting a cap of 50 seats for private restaurants and a ban on Cubans holding more than one business license.
Private sector workers, who make up around 13 percent of the island's labor force, criticized the government for making such big changes so late.
Some restaurants had already shrunk capacity and fired staff, while many entrepreneurs had divested licenses or started the lengthy bureaucratic process of transferring them to others.
Overall they welcomed the move.
""I think it's the first time they've really listened to the private sector,"" said Mickey Morales, the owner of a 150-seat restaurant with panoramic views of Havana's centuries-old port. ""It's a relief.""
On Thursday, the government also said it was consulting with artists on regulations on cultural activities to ease fears about increased censorship.
Ted Henken, a professor of black and Latino studies at Baruch College in New York, said Cuba's unusual volte-face suggested it was becoming more open to feedback or less able to withstand growing discontent.
Diaz-Canel lacks the historic legitimacy of Castro, who fought alongside his older brother Fidel Castro for the 1959 revolution. He took power as the ailing economy faced dwindling aid from key ally Venezuela and a tighter U.S. trade embargo.
To date, Diaz-Canel has appeared to seek legitimacy through greater public interaction with Cuban citizens, companies and institutions than his reclusive predecessor, analysts say.
Until now, that change in style had not translated into substantive policy changes, nor had he openly met with private entrepreneurs or more critical actors of civil society.

""Hopefully this is the start of a change of course,"" Ricardo Torres, an economist at a Cuban state-run think tank, wrote in a public post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), ""where the rights and interests of the island's inhabitants are adequately taken into account in the politics of the Cuban state.""

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 03:38PM ET</span>",Trump picks attorney general and U.N. envoy in fresh staff shake-up,"By Steve Holland and Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In another senior staff shake-up inside his often turbulent administration, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he has picked the two people he wants to be the next U.S. attorney general and the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
He said he will nominate William Barr, who was attorney general under former President George H.W. Bush in the 1990s, to fill that top job again at the U.S. Justice Department. 
Barr would replace Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who has been in that position since Trump forced out Jeff Sessions as attorney general a month ago.
Trump said he will put forward State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert as ambassador to the United Nations. Nauert, a former Fox News Channel host, would replace Nikki Haley, who said in October she would resign at the end of this year.
Both are likely to face tough questions at their Senate confirmation hearings. Democrats called Nauert unqualified and said they were concerned about Barr's independence. 
Republicans said they were pleased with both nominees.
Trump also said he would make a personnel announcement concerning the Pentagon on Saturday, telling reporters outside the White House, ""It will have to do with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the succession.""
Trump was expected to name the Army's top general, Mark Milley, as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the country's top military position, U.S. officials told Reuters.
Separately, two sources told Reuters that John Kelly is expected to resign in coming days as White House chief of staff after months of speculation. 
The proposed changes come as the Republican president faces another difficult stretch.
Democrats are promising aggressive oversight of Trump's administration and business activities when they take control of the U.S. House of Representatives in January following their gains in last month's elections.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller is continuing to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, any collusion between Moscow and Trump's campaign and possible obstruction of justice. More details of the inquiry were set to emerge in court filings on Friday.
Barr, who was attorney general under Bush from 1991 to 1993 and has worked in the private sector since then, would oversee Mueller's probe if the Senate confirms him in the job again.
He is likely to face pressure at his confirmation hearings to show he would protect Mueller from political interference. Critics of Trump have long been concerned that the president wants to end the Mueller probe.
Republicans, who control the Senate, said Barr was well qualified. Senator Chuck Grassley called him a ""talented, well-respected lawyer.""
""There is no one more capable or qualified for this role,"" Trump said at a law-enforcement conference in Kansas City.
Trump, who has repeatedly denounced the Mueller investigation as a ""witch hunt,"" denies any collusion with Russia or any obstruction of justice. Russia denies U.S. intelligence agencies' findings that it meddled in the 2016 election campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trump's favor.
'STEEP HILL TO CLIMB'
Barr also may face scrutiny about past comments questioning the political affiliations of Mueller's team and supporting Trump's decision last year to fire FBI Director James Comey.
""Given President Trump’s demonstrated lack of regard for the rule of law and the independence of the American justice system, his nominee for attorney general will have a steep hill to climb in order to be confirmed by the Senate,"" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. 
Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney who is currently acting head of the Justice Department, has drawn criticism for past business ventures and critical comments about the Mueller investigation before he joined the department.
Trump mocked and belittled Sessions for more than a year, angry at Sessions' decision to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia probe because he had worked for Trump's election campaign.
If she is confirmed to the U.N. ambassador post, Nauert would bring little diplomatic experience to a highly visible international role.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, praised Nauert as ""one of the United States' strongest voices on the global stage."" 
Democrats were less enthusiastic.
""She's clearly not qualified for this job, but these days it seems that the most important qualification is that you show up on Donald Trump's TV screen,"" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on CNN.
Other nations with veto power on the U.N. Security Council are all represented by ambassadors with decades of foreign policy experience.
Nauert would succeed Haley, a former South Carolina governor who also had little experience in world affairs before she took the job. Haley insisted that she be made a member of Trump's Cabinet and his National Security Council to bolster her power within the administration.
In other staff changes, White House political director Bill Stepien and public liaison director Justin Clark are leaving their jobs to help Trump's 2020 re-election campaign, the campaign said. 

Trump's White House has had the highest turnover of senior-level staff of the past five presidents, according to figures compiled by the Brookings Institution think tank.

""The stakes could not be higher. If we cannot rise to the task, then we will smooth the path to power of the fake populists,"" Corbyn said in a speech to the annual congress of the Party of European Socialists in Lisbon.
""The far right feeds on fears fueled by falling living standards, damaged communities, insecure work and underfunded public services. It diverts the blame away from the powerful few responsible for economic and social failure and onto minorities.""
Far-right anti-immigration forces have been on the rise in Europe in recent years, coming to power in Italy, Austria, Hungary and Poland, gaining clout in Germany and France, and scoring their first success in Spain on Sunday.
""If the European political establishment carries on with business as usual, the fake populists of the far right will fill the vacuum,"" Corbyn said.
He called on left-leaning leaders to work together as they do in Portugal where the minority Socialist government is backed in parliament by the two far left parties.
Speaking just ahead of a Dec. 11 British parliament vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan, Corbyn reiterated that Labour felt the deal should be rejected while a better one, ideally for a long-term customs union with the EU, remained possible. ""We think the deal she brought back is not acceptable,"" he told reporters earlier. ""It pleases nobody.""

""First thing is to oppose this deal, get the government to negotiate a better deal along the lines we set out and if they can’t do that they should resign and we have a general election.""

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 02:25PM ET</span>",Steady as she goes: Merkel 2.0 takes center stage in Germany,"By Paul Carrel
HAMBURG (Reuters) - Germany's Christian Democrats have played it safe. By opting for Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel as party leader, they have voted for a centrist who is long on party unity and short on major policy initiatives.
Merkel's decision to stand down as leader of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is part of her slow, stage-managed exit from German politics and in Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, the party has chosen a successor from the same safety-first mold.
Dubbed ""Merkel 2.0"" by opposition parties, Kramp-Karrenbauer was the continuity candidate in the leadership campaign, less bold in her policy proposals than rival Friedrich Merz.
""The CDU has opted for centrist continuity. And it let Merkel have her way, one more time,"" said Carsten Nickel, managing director at political consultancy Teneo. ""Today's close result shows: the party is as split as German society.""
After her narrow victory - by 517 votes to 482 - over Merz, Kramp-Karrenbauer's first priority is to unite the CDU after a series of electoral setbacks that threaten its role as Germany's leading ""Volkspartei"", or big popular party.
In a short speech to accept the party leadership, she called for ""all the factions, all members, everyone who carries responsibility to move forward with the goal that we share - to remain the big Volkspartei of the center.""
Her first act as leader was to invite her two rivals to take the congress stage with her in a show of party unity.
Kramp-Karrenbauer has little time to waste.
An election in Bremen next May is the first of four regional votes next year. In October, the CDU lost over 10 percentage points in another state election, in Hesse. Merkel announced she would stand down as party leader after that damaging result.
After a robust campaign for the CDU leadership, Kramp-Karrenbauer must now try to engineer a rebound in next year's state votes - a tough task that will soak up her time and energy and leave her little bandwidth for fresh policy initiatives.
Teneo's Nickel said the close leadership result ""means continuity in Europe: beyond Merkel's personal leadership in the Council, don't expect bold initiatives from Berlin. The CDU will continue to be busy with itself.""
GERMAN INTERESTS
Kramp-Karrenbauer is not prone to bold policy moves anyway.
During the leadership campaign, she took more a cautious stance on the future of Europe than Merz, who said Germany should ""contribute more"" to the European Union as it benefits from a euro that is ""too weak for our economy"".
Last month, Kramp-Karrenbauer told a business conference: ""With every wish to take Europe forward with a German-French nucleus, the proposals must always fit with German interests.""
She said Europe must move toward a banking union, ""but first the risks must be minimized so that it is acceptable in German interests as well.""
Her great strength is her record as former state premier in Saarland, where she led an experimental broad coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats -- alliance-building skills useful in Germany's fractured political landscape.
That ability to build bridges clinched her the CDU top job.
""There is a feeling that we are strengthened,"" delegate Stephan Toscani said after Friday's leadership vote. ""There is a willingness to pull together now. I am sure that Merkel will remain chancellor right through her term.""
Merkel plans to stay on as chancellor until the next federal election, due by October 2021. The CDU's election of Kramp-Karrenbauer makes that scenario more likely. Co-habiting with Merz, an old rival, would have proven harder for Merkel.
The risk for Kramp-Karrenbauer is that opposition parties seize on her similarities to Merkel, whose authority has waned since her divisive decision in 2015 to keep German borders open to refugees fleeing war in the Middle East.
""Kramp-Karrenbauer is a continuation of Merkel with other means,"" said Alexander Gauland, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany, which surged into the Bundestag for the first time last year on a wave of discontent with Merkel.

""She supported the refugee policy and will not correct it.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Turkey's head of intelligence has traveled to Washington to meet with U.S. lawmakers and intelligence officials, sources said, in an apparent bid to improve ties with the Americans after a breakdown in the NATO allies' relationship last summer.
Hakan Fidan, a close confidant of Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan, has met with senators to discuss NATO issues and was expected to meet with U.S. intelligence officials later on Friday, according to five sources familiar with the matter, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
The killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was discussed in the meeting with members and staff of the NATO Observer Group, a bipartisan group of senators that advocates for the alliance, two sources familiar with the matter said.
But it was not a central subject in discussions with senators and the Turkish side has refrained from making it the focus of their meetings, the sources added. 
Top U.S. senators have said they want to punish Saudi Arabia for the killing, despite President Donald Trump's decision to stand by the long-time ally.
While the two countries have collaborated on the Khashoggi investigation, U.S.-Turkey ties have been strained by disagreements over a number of issues from Syria to Turkey's desire to buy Russian defense systems.
Relations between Ankara and Washington began to improve after U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson, who was on trial over terrorism-related charges in Turkey, was released in October.
But the NATO allies remain divided on other issues, including U.S. policy in Syria, Ankara's ambition to purchase Russian missile defense systems and Turkey's request for the United States to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric Ankara blames for organizing an abortive 2016 putsch. Gulen denies involvement.
Fidan was expected to discuss the murder of Khashoggi, a Washington post columnist and critic of the Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in his meeting with U.S. intelligence officials, sources said. It was not immediately clear if Fidan was to meet with Gina Haspel, director of the CIA.
The CIA has assessed with medium to high confidence that the crown price, the kingdom's de facto ruler, ordered the killing of Khashoggi when he visited the consulate on Oct. 2. Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge.
Trump cast doubt on the CIA assessment, saying the agency had not formed a definitive conclusion. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said there was no direct evidence linking the prince to the killing.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 02:05PM ET</span>",Salvini says budget will prevent French-style riots in Italy,"ROME (Reuters) - Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Friday that Italy's expansionary 2019 budget, which is contested by the European Commission, will prevent the kind of unrest that has rocked France.
""There are several million forgotten Italians we are taking care of so that what has been happening in France doesn't happen in Italy,"" Salvini, who is also interior minister and leader of the right-wing League party, said in a television interview.
The draft budget raises the deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product next year from 1.8 percent this year. 
Brussels has rejected the plan and asked for changes, saying it breaks previous commitments to reduce borrowing and will not lower Italy's large public debt.
Among the main measures in Italy's budget are a reduction in the retirement age and a new income support scheme for the poor, known as the ""citizens' wage"" which together will cost state coffers around 16 billion euros ($18.22 billion).
The package will help avoid ""the chaos we have seen in France for weeks, where social poverty, fear and unemployment have blocked entire cities"", Salvini told Canale 5 shortly before a parliamentary confidence vote on the budget.
France is preparing for another wave of potentially violent protests on Saturday - a backlash against high living costs but also, increasingly, a revolt against President Emmanuel Macron himself, including his perceived loftiness and reforms favoring a moneyed elite.
Macron has made concessions to the ""yellow vest"" protesters by suspending planned increases to fuel taxes for at least six months. Senior allies of Macron said the president would address the nation early next week.
France's deficit was already targeted at 2.8 percent of GDP next year, and it could now potentially rise above the EU's 3 percent ceiling.
Officials in Salvini's League party have said the French situation strengthens Italy's hand in its ongoing negotiations with the Commission.

Italy has seen no significant social unrest in recent years, even though its economic growth has been much weaker than France's and its unemployment rate higher.

HAMBURG (Reuters) - Germany's Christian Democrats said a big thank you on Friday to Angela Merkel, their leader for the past 18 years, with warm words and long applause, and presenting her with a conductor's baton as they elected her protege to succeed her. 
Merkel, a Lutheran woman who grew up in the former Communist East where she moved when she was an infant, has always been something of an outsider in the male-dominated, Catholic party.
But her record of winning four elections can not be denied and was not lost on CDU members.
Waving orange cards with the slogan ""Thank you boss"", delegates cheered as Merkel, 64, walked onto the stage at the conference center in Hamburg, her birthplace, to end an era for the party.
""We have had very successful years with Angela Merkel. She has led us for many years in government and that is the goal of a party,"" said Julia Kloeckner, a deputy party leader.
""We need you as chancellor,"" Kloeckner told the conference.
As chancellor of Europe's biggest economy since 2005, Merkel has been the most influential leader in the European Union through the euro zone and migrant crises. Forbes magazine has repeatedly named her the world's most powerful woman. 
She plans to stay on as chancellor until the next federal election, due by October 2021. The choice of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, dubbed mini-Merkel, as her successor makes that a likely scenario.
""Merkel does not show much emotion herself but above all we respect her and want to show gratitude to her,"" said Tobias Loose, a delegate from the northern state of Schleswig Holstein. 
""I expect her to remain chancellor and even see her become a bigger star, especially internationally, as she sounds freer to say what she wants,"" he added.
All the same, Merkel, a physicist, was fighting back tears when she gave a final speech as party leader, drawing a nearly 10 minute standing ovation. 
""It has been a great pleasure for me, it has been an honor,"" she said, adding it was time for a new chapter.
Her popularity has waned since her 2015 open-doors migrant policy and the CDU has suffered heavy electoral losses at the state level. 
After losing support in the 2017 federal election, she struggled to forge a coalition which has been dogged by rows in the last six months. She announced her decision to stand down as party leader in October.
But Friday was a day to celebrate Merkel's longevity. 
As lines from The Kinks song blared out ""Thank you for the days"", Volker Bouffier, premier of the state of the western state of Hesse, introduced a film of Merkel's best moments. 
Showing pictures of her laughing and grimacing, looking stern and having selfies taken with refugees at the height of the 2015 migrant crisis, the film thanked her for her humor, her humanity and character.
Pointing to her stamina and political nouse, Bouffier pointed out that the Hamburg soccer club had been through 24 trainers and her rival Social Democrats 10 chairpeople in the 18 years Merkel had led the CDU. 
In a personal touch, he gave the music-loving chancellor the baton that Japanese conductor Kent Nagano had used at a concert of Beethoven's 9th Symphony performed at last year's Group of 20 summit in Hamburg.
Even Horst Seehofer, the former premier of Bavaria who has been a thorn in her side for years and nearly brought down her coalition in the summer due to a row over migrant policy, found kind words for her:

""She is the best. We will all miss her,"" he said. ""When you have gone through as much as Angela Merkel and me, you are bound together. There is even affection,"" he told Der Spiegel weekly.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 12:37PM ET</span>","France braces for trouble, Macron to address 'yellow vest' anger","By Richard Lough and Sudip Kar-Gupta
PARIS (Reuters) - France hunkered down for another wave of potentially violent protests on Saturday as embattled President Emmanuel Macron planned to address the nation next week over public fury at the high cost of living, senior allies said.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the three-week-old ""yellow vest"" revolt had ""created a monster"" and vowed police would have no tolerance for violence, with much of Paris in lockdown and tens of thousands of police deployed nationwide.
Named after the fluorescent safety vests that all French motorists must carry, the protesters are billing their planned action on Saturday as ""Act IV"" of worst unrest seen in the capital since the 1968 student riots. 
Castaner warned that radicals would likely again infiltrate the protest movement - a backlash against high living costs but also, increasingly, a revolt against Macron himself, including his perceived loftiness and reforms favoring a moneyed elite.
""These last three weeks have created a monster,"" Castaner told reporters. ""Our security forces will respond with firmness and I will have no tolerance for anyone who capitalizes on the distress of our citizens.""
Some 89,000 policemen will be on duty nationwide to forestall a repeat of last Saturday's destructive mayhem in exclusive central districts of Paris. Police in Paris will be backed up by armored vehicles equipped to clear barricades. 
Senior allies of Macron said the president would address the nation early next week. Navigating his biggest crisis since being elected 18 months ago, Macron has left it largely to his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, to deal in public with the turmoil and offer concessions.
But the 40-year-old is under mounting pressure to speak more fully as his administration tries to regain the initiative following three weeks of unrest in the G7 nation.
""The President will speak early next week. I think this is what the French people want, they want answers,"" Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne told Sud Radio on Friday.
Macron has not spoken in public since he condemned last Saturday's disturbances while at the G20 summit in Argentina and opposition leaders accused him of turning the Elysee Palace into a bunker where had taken cover.
""Is Macron still in Argentina? He must surely have an opinion,"" hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said on Twitter on Tuesday.
""The president himself must speak,"" main opposition conservative Republicains leader Laurent Wauquiez told Europe 1 radio on Thursday. 
""FORGOTTEN FRANCE""
After the Dec. 1 riots in central Paris and sometimes violent demonstrations in dozens of other cities and towns across France, the government offered a rush of sweeteners to soothe public anger.
It started by scrapping next year's planned hikes to fuel taxes, the first major U-turn of Macron's presidency and costing the Treasury 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion).
But protesters want Macron to go further to help hard-pressed households, including an increase to the minimum wage, lower taxes, higher salaries, cheaper energy, better retirement provisions and even Macron's resignation.
But, mindful of France's deficit and not wanting to flout EU rules, Macron will have scant wriggle room for more concessions. 
The ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) movement remains amorphous and hard to define, with a rapidly shifting agenda and internal divisions.
One faction, which dubs itself the ""Free Yellow Vests"", called on protesters not to travel to Paris on Saturday but criticized Macron for refusing to hold direct talks.
""We appeal for calm, for respect of public property and the security forces,"" Benjamin Cauchy declared in front of the National Assembly. His group are seen as moderates within the broader movement.
""The forgotten France is the France of the regions and it is in the regions that the France will show peacefully their anger,"" Cauchy said. 
""SMASHING THINGS UP""
The Eiffel Tower, opera house, and Louvre are among dozens of museums and tourist sites in Paris that will close on Saturday to pre-empt feared attacks by yellow vest militants.
Luxury boutiques and restaurants in fancy neighborhoods and near the presidential palace erected barricades and boarded up windows. Department stores Galerie Lafayette and Printemps said they would not open in the capital on Saturday. 
The trouble is jeopardizing a timid economic recovery in France just as the Christmas holiday season kicks off. Retailers have lost about 1 billion euros in revenue since the protests erupted, the retail federation said. 
On the French stock market, retailers, airlines and hoteliers suffered their worst week in months.
Patrick Delmas, 49, will shut his ""Le Monte Carlo"" bar next to the Champs Elysees on Saturday, blaming hoodlums from anarchist and anti-capitalist groups, as well as the yellow vest movement's violent fringe.
""We have lost 60 percent of business over the last 15 days,"" he said. ""The problem is all those people who arrive with the sole intention of smashing things up.""

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 12:22PM ET</span>",Merkel protege Kramp-Karrenbauer succeeds her as German CDU leader,"By Paul Carrel and Madeline Chambers
HAMBURG (Reuters) - Germany's Christian Democrats elected Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer on Friday to replace Angela Merkel as party leader, a decision that moves her into pole position to succeed Europe's most influential leader as chancellor.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, is Merkel's protege and was the continuity candidate favored by the party elite. She won the leadership with 517 votes out of 999 votes cast by delegates. Her rival, Friedrich Merz, won 482 votes in a run-off.
A former state premier in Saarland, where she led a three-way coalition, Kramp-Karrenbauer has a reputation for uniting support across the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and a talent for striking alliances with other parties.
Sometimes dubbed ""mini Merkel"", Kramp-Karrenbauer is admired by the CDU upper echelons for her appeal across the party.
""I have read a lot about what I am and who I am: 'mini', a copy, simply 'more of the same'. Dear delegates, I stand before you as I am and as life made me and I am proud of that,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer said in a passionate speech to the congress.
Playing up her experience in regional government, she added to cheers and loud applause: ""I learned what it is to lead - and above all learnt that leadership is more about being strong on the inside than being loud on the outside.""
Merkel said in October she would step down as party chief but remain chancellor, an effort to manage her exit after a series of setbacks since her divisive decision in 2015 to keep German borders open to refugees fleeing war in the Middle East. 
During the leadership campaign, Merz delighted rank-and-file CDU members hungry for a more clearly defined party after 13 years of consensus-type leadership under Merkel by calling for tax cuts and a more robust approach to tackling the far right.
But the party delegates - many of them career politicians - preferred Kramp-Karrenbauer, often known by her initials, AKK.
""She is a safe bet: a centrist candidate who does not threaten nasty surprises,"" said Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of weekly Die Zeit.
""Merz was just a bit too free-market, pro-American and pro-defense. Also, his pitch to the convention was wooden compared to AKK's passionate appeal. Still, he forced her into a run-off, which suggests that AKK will preside over a divided party.""
There was jubilation as the result of the run-off was announced. A tearful Kramp-Karrenbauer thanked her rivals and invited them to share the stage with her in a show of party unity, which delegates applauded.
The Social Democrats (SPD), junior partner in Merkel's ruling coalition, congratulated Kramp-Karrenbauer and offered to work constructively with her.
""You've got big shoes to fill,"" SPD leader Andrea Nahles wrote on Twitter. ""Good luck! Now it's time to solve problems: shoring up the future of pensions, recognizing the value of work, strengthening cohesion in Europe. I offer good teamwork.""
The hardline Left party and the far-right Alternative for Germany lamented what they saw as the dawn of ""Merkel 2.0"".
Merkel, 64, has presided over Europe's most populous country and powerful economy for 13 years.
MERKEL BOWS OUT
Earlier, an emotional Merkel bowed out as party leader, telling the congress: ""It has been a great pleasure for me, it has been an honor.""
Kramp-Karrenbauer has differentiated herself from Merkel on social and foreign policy by voting in favor of quotas for women on corporate boards and taking a tougher line on Russia.
She told Reuters last week that Europe and the United States should consider blockading Russian ships over the Ukraine crisis.
She also took a more cautious stance on the future of Europe than Merz, who said Germany should ""contribute more"" to the European Union as it benefits from a euro common currency that is ""too weak for our economy"".
But on what lies ahead for the CDU, Kramp-Karrenbauer said when campaigning: ""I have no particular recipe.""
That practical, non-ideological approach is similar to the style Merkel has employed as chancellor. Party insiders say Kramp-Karrenbauer gets on well with Merkel. ""The chemistry is good,"" said one senior CDU official.

Kocharyan served as Armenia's second president from 1998 to 2008 when mass protests erupted against a disputed election result.
He was arrested in July this year but released the following month and his case sent to the court of appeal.
""This decision was restored as a result of pressure,"" Kocharyan's spokesman Viktor Soghomonyan told reporters. Kocharyan has dismissed the charges as politically motivated.
""It's obvious that this verdict is, first of all, the result of a political decision and was rendered under conditions of tough pressure from the authorities,"" Kocharyan said in a statement on Friday before being arrested for two months of preliminary detention.
An early election will be held on Sunday in a move to cement the outcome of a peaceful revolution when demonstrators led by opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan pushed the former ruling party out of power earlier this year.
Investigators have charged Kocharyan with an attempt to overthrow the constitutional order during events after the 2008 election when his ally Serzh Sarksyan became president.
In February-March 2008 the opposition held protest rallies, contesting the result of the election. The protests were dispersed and 10 people were killed in clashes with police. The Constitutional Court upheld the election result.
Pashinyan, an opposition activist at the time who was imprisoned in June 2009 on charges of fomenting unrest during post-election protests, was elected prime minister by parliament on May 8 this year.

He stepped down in October and became acting prime minister to allow parliament to be dissolved and an early election to be held and said he expected a new legislature to emerge that better reflected the country's political realities.

GAZA (Reuters) - Qatar paid the salaries of nearly 30,000 Gazan civil servants on Friday, delighting the impoverished workers but angering some in the deeply divided Palestinian leadership who balked at the intervention of a foreign power.
Thousands queued in the winter cold to get their cash at post offices - one of which was decorated with a large mural of Qatar's emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and the message ""Thanks Qatar"".
""If the Qatari donation stops, we will be destroyed,"" said 45-year-old civil servant Ammar Fayyad, the main bread-winner in his 13-strong family.
Palestinian sources said Friday's payout, thought to be around $15 million, was part of a $90 million Qatari donation that began in November and is due to be paid into Gaza over six months.
The civil servants have become a symbol of a bitter and protracted power struggle between the two most powerful Palestinian factions, the Hamas Islamist movement which controls Gaza, and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas that controls the West Bank.
The employees were hired by Hamas after it unexpectedly won elections in 2006, and seized military control of Gaza the next year.
Hamas complained that it inherited a civil service beholden to Abbas - so it installed thousands of Hamas loyalists, effectively creating two parallel civil services in Gaza.
DIVISIONS
But after years of Israeli-led blockades, successive wars and the continued failure of internal reconciliation efforts, Hamas was left with little in its coffers. With Hamas hardly able to pay its own employees, and Abbas refusing to, they became a political football.
Abbas's strategy has been to pressure Hamas back to the negotiating table by slashing salaries and sending thousands of government workers into early retirement, thereby worsening economic conditions in Gaza. 
Wasel Abu Youssef, a pro-Abbas official, said on Friday that by sidestepping Abbas and sending money into Gaza, the Qataris would ""give hope to those willing to prolong divisions.""
Qatar - which has been working to bolster its international standing amid a diplomatic dispute with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf powers - has said it intervened to ease conditions in the impoverished Gaza Strip and restore stability.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel agreed to allow the Qatari money into Gaza, telling foreign diplomats on Thursday that a closely monitored system of ""fingerprints, photos and signatures"" would make sure the money reached its intended recipients, not Hamas.
Hamas maintained a low public profile before and during Friday's Qatari intervention. Analysts say the infusion of outside money into the area that it controls presents something a dilemma for Israel.
While it eased domestic pressure on Hamas, it also alleviated economic hardship that could provoke unrest and instability in Gaza, they said.

""It provides Hamas some relief from the domestic pressure from their employees, and it slightly stimulates the local market,"" Mohammad Abu Jayyab, a Gaza economist, told Reuters.

Elections in Spain's most populous region on Sunday left the main opposition, the right-wing People's Party, and market friendly Ciudadanos within tantalizing reach of taking power in a traditional stronghold of the ruling Socialists – if they accept the support of far-right party Vox.
""We have been the last country in Europe to suffer the emergence of the extreme right but we may be the first to see right-wing parties accept the support of that far-right, and as a result normalize it,"" spokeswoman Isabel Celaa told a press conference on Friday.
Anti-immigrant party Vox won 12 seats in the Andalusian parliament, handing it a regional kingmaker role long unthinkable in a country with bitter memories of military dictatorship still acute.
Polls have shown that the far right could win further seats in other parts of Spain in a busy electoral season that includes European elections in May, taking place amid increasing concern in the bloc about the growing influence of eurosceptic parties. 
Guy Verhofstadt, president of the Alliance of Democrats and Liberals for Europe (Alde), to which Ciudadanos belongs, congratulated the party on Sunday for its results but appeared to warn against any potential alliance with the far-right.
“Congratulations to @CiudadanosCs for their huge gains in #EleccionesAndalucía. The success of the far-right, however, should worry us all. We face a battle for Europe's soul at the European elections in May,” Verhofstadt wrote on Twitter on Sunday evening.
Celaa called for a government in Andalusia led by Socialist candidate Susana Diaz, who won the most seats but fell short of a majority in a region the party has controlled since the return to democracy.
""The priority for the Socialists is to find a solution and avoid this region becoming the cradle of the far-right,” Celaa said. 

Vox said on Friday it had received more than 2,000 new members since winning its first ever seats in Andalusian elections on Sunday.

Athens said it had expelled two Russian diplomats and barred two other people from entering the country in July for trying to bribe officials and foment demonstrations to thwart a deal that would allow Macedonia to join NATO. 
Russia has flatly denied the allegations. 
In their first meeting since that incident, the two leaders defended their countries' stance but appeared ready to turn a page.
Putin called the allegations ""rubbish"" and said that the respective intelligence services could settle such situations ""without any theatrical gestures."" 
""Firstly, right from the start we did not agree and we don't agree now with the reason why our diplomats were expelled,"" Putin told reporters.
""It's hard for me to imagine that anyone with common sense either in Greece or Russia could think that Russia would plot or intrigue against Greece. It's just nonsense, rubbish.""
""I hope that this page really has been turned,"" he said.
Athens and Skopje have agreed that Macedonia will change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia to end a decades-long dispute and potentially enable it to join the NATO military alliance and the European Union, which Russia opposes. 
Tsipras said he believed the diplomatic row was an isolated incident and that the two countries had a lot to gain from deepening future cooperation. 
""When we see some isolated, and I do believe that they are isolated, incidents that annoy us, we are obliged to send a message,"" Tsipras said.

""I believe that we are looking forward and that this case is over. What is important today is to take advantage of our big potential to deepen our cooperation in a series of sectors,"" he said.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 10:54AM ET</span>",Trump picks former Attorney General Barr to return to head Justice Department,"By Roberta Rampton and Makini Brice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he had chosen former U.S. Attorney General William Barr to once again lead the Justice Department, a role that would put him in charge of the federal probe into Russian election interference.
If confirmed by the Senate, Barr would take over from Matthew Whitaker, who has been serving in an acting capacity since Trump forced out Jeffrey Sessions a month ago. Whitaker had been Sessions' chief of staff.
Barr was ""my first choice from day one,"" and ""a terrific man, a terrific person, a brilliant man,"" Trump said, speaking to reporters outside the White House. 
Barr, a lawyer who was previously attorney general from 1991 to 1993 under the late President George H.W. Bush, has defended Trump's controversial decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 when Comey was leading the Russia probe.
After Comey's firing, Special Counsel Robert Mueller took over that investigation, which includes any possible collusion between Moscow and Trump's 2016 election campaign, and any potential obstruction of justice. The Russia probe has long infuriated Trump, who calls it a witch hunt and who has denied any collusion or any obstruction of justice. 
Barr has said there is more reason to investigate potential wrongdoing by Trump's campaign opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, than there is to probe any potential collusion.
Mueller, a Republican, was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
Barr has said political donations show Mueller's team of professional prosecutors tilt uncomfortably to the left. On Twitter, Trump calls them ""17 Angry Dems."" 
""I would have liked to see him have more balance on this group,"" Barr told the Washington Post in July 2017.
As attorney general, Barr would have ultimate responsibility for the Russia probe, unless he recuses himself. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the investigation.
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow worked to influence the election and tip it in Trump's favor. Russia has denied any interference.
Barr's comments on Mueller and Clinton could stir opposition from Senate Democrats, but the nomination will almost certainly not come up for a vote until next year. Republicans will control the chamber with a 53-47 majority in the new Congress convening in January.
""I do think he's worthy of consideration. I am concerned he has said some negative things about the Special Counsel's office and some of the prosecutors he had in place,"" Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar told MSNBC on Thursday after Barr's name surfaced.
Klobuchar is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over the nomination.
CLINTON EMAILS
In an opinion piece in the Washington Post last year, Barr argued that Comey usurped the authority of top Justice Department officials when he announced the outcome of an FBI probe into Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state, and that Trump was right in firing him.
At the time of Comey's announcement, both Clinton and Trump were candidates for president. When Trump fired Comey, the initial reason given by the White House was his poor handling of the FBI investigation into Clinton's emails.
Barr, however, did not attack the Russia probe itself, which he said was being conducted with a thoroughness that appeared lacking in the Clinton email investigation.
""Comey's removal simply has no relevance to the integrity of the Russian investigation as it moves ahead,"" Barr wrote.
Comey said in 2016, after a year-long FBI investigation into the email issue, that while Clinton had been careless in her handling of her emails the agency was not recommending charges. Clinton expressed regret for her decision to use a private server but said she violated no rules.
Barr has expressed sympathy for Trump's calls to take a second look at whether Clinton may have broken the law, telling the Washington Post in November 2017: ""I do think that there are things that should be investigated that haven't been investigated.""
That same month, he told the New York Times he thought there was more reason to investigate Clinton for any role she may have played in approving a uranium deal when she was secretary of state than any potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.

""To the extent it is not pursuing these matters, the department is abdicating its responsibility,"" he said.

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 10:38AM ET</span>",U.S. Air Force missed four chances to stop Texas shooter buying guns,"By Jonathan Allen
(Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force missed four chances to block the shooter in 2017's deadly church attack in Texas from buying guns after he was accused of violent crimes while in the military, a report by the Department of Defense's inspector general said on Friday.
Because the Air Force failed to submit Devin Kelley's fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the former airman was able to clear background checks to buy the guns he used to kill 26 people at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. 
A Reuters investigation last year found that the Air Force missed multiple chances to submit Kelly's fingerprints into the FBI's criminal databases after the November 2017 attack.
Kelley, who was 26, was shot by a bystander as he fled and was found dead soon after, having shot himself in the head.
According to the inspector general's report, the first missed chance came in June 2011, after the Air Force Office of Special Investigations began investigating a report of Kelley beating his stepson while Kelley served at a base in New Mexico.
The second chance came in February 2012, after the Air Force learned of allegations that Kelley was also beating his wife, the report said.
The third was in June 2012, when Kelley confessed on video to injuring his stepson, the report said.
The fourth was after Kelley's court-martial conviction for the assaults in November 2013.
""If Kelley's fingerprints were submitted to the FBI, he would have been prohibited from purchasing a firearm from a licensed firearms dealer,"" the inspector general's report said.
Each missed instance was a breach of Department of Defense policy, the report said. Multiple Air Force officials involved in Kelley's case did not understand these policies or were unable to explain why they were not followed in interviews with the inspector general's office.
The inspector general recommended that the Air Force improve its training of staff on submitting fingerprints and examine whether officials involved in Kelley's case should face discipline.
Previous inspector general reports have found widespread lapses in the military's reporting of criminal histories to the FBI going back years.

The Air Force agreed with the inspector general's findings and said they matched the conclusions of its own investigation last year, a spokeswoman said. The Air Force said it has been correcting other instances where it failed to submit fingerprints to the FBI going back to 1998.

Repeated attacks by armed groups on civilians, Congolese soldiers and U.N. peacekeepers have hampered efforts to contain the epidemic, the second worst in history. 
So far, it is believed to have infected 471 people and killed 273 of them. Congo's health ministry announced 13 new confirmed cases on Thursday, one of the highest one-day totals since the outbreak was declared in August. 
A local army spokesman, Captain Mak Hazukay, told Reuters the civilians were killed late on Thursday during two separate attacks near the town of Beni.
""They killed some of them and took others hostage ... dragged them into the suburbs, where they burned down a house and savagely executed the hostages,"" he said.
A Reuters witness saw the bullet-riddled bodies of five women on the outskirts of Beni. Hazukay, also present on the scene, said another 13 bodies were lying in the woods nearby.
A local civil society leader, Kizito Bin Hangi, said the attack was carried out by militants belonging to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active in the area.
Congolese authorities blame ADF rebels for dozens of attacks over the past four years that have killed more than 1,000 civilians, although independent experts say other armed groups and Congolese soldiers are responsible for some of the killings. 
The attacks have undermined health authorities' ability to reach patients and others exposed to Ebola. Mistrust of first responders has also led some locals to refuse treatment or safe burials, aggravating the outbreak.

Ignoring Western condemnation of the incident, Russia says Ukraine illegally entered its waters and is resisting calls to release the vessels and 24 sailors it seized near Russian-annexed Crimea on Nov. 25.
NATO has said it has boosted its presence in the region in response to what it described as Russia's aggressive actions and CNN reported earlier this week that the United States was preparing to send a warship to the Black Sea. 
Borissov said the Black Sea should be ""for tourism and pipelines, not ships"". Bulgaria has 378 km of coastline along the Black Sea.
""The entry of ships, combined with the entry of such a mighty Russian navy on the other side, will inevitably lead to a major crisis,"" Borissov told reporters in parliament. 
The premier said that Bulgaria's Black Sea tourist resorts would be badly affected, as would its energy supplies.
""It will be difficult to negotiate for gas diversification and tourism in a situation of escalating tension in the Black Sea,"" he said. 
Last week Bulgarian lawmakers gave the green light for the government to spend 1.4 billion euros ($1.59 billion) to build a new gas link to transport Russian gas from the TurkStream pipeline to Europe, bypassing Ukraine to the south.

In 2016 Borissov strongly opposed a proposal -- backed by Turkey and Romania, the two other NATO members along the Black Sea coast -- for Bulgaria joining a NATO fleet meant to counter Russian forces in the Black Sea, saying ""he did not want a war there"".

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - New Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is taking aim at the finances of the powerful Jalisco cartel in what a top anti-money laundering official said was the opening salvo in the fight to stop criminal gangs from flourishing with impunity. 
Santiago Nieto, the new head of the finance ministry's Financial Intelligence Unit, told Reuters on Thursday that he had filed a complaint against three businesses and seven people linked to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. On Wednesday, the finance ministry said Nieto's unit had filed its first complaint with prosecutors, but did not include any details.
The move against the Jalisco cartel, a relative newcomer that has risen to become one of Mexico's most dangerous criminal gangs, heralds a new effort to overcome Mexico's reputation for weak prosecutions against drug gang finances.
""I am convinced the best way to prevent criminal behavior is by sending a message that these types of acts that violate trust and social norms will be punished,"" Nieto said in a telephone interview. 
He said the government, which took office on Saturday, wanted to send ""a first message"" that it was going to focus on taking legal action ""and especially seek to impose penalties.""
Mexico's drug war has raged for over a decade despite the capture of kingpins such as Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. Although cartels have splintered, the flow of drugs north has continued unabated, while violence in Mexico hit record levels last year. 
In October, the United States offered a $10 million reward for information leading to the arrest of the suspected leader of the Jalisco organization, Nemesio Oseguera, also known as El Mencho.
Nieto said he was able to quickly file the complaints because the businesses and people targeted already appear on the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) black list of drug traffickers. 
Complaints from the Financial Intelligence Unit generally include evidence that is intended to prompt prosecutors to open criminal investigations.
Leftist Lopez Obrador, who has pledged to fight corruption, has repeatedly stressed that he wants good relations with the United States, Mexico's neighbor and main export partner.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international organization that sets global standards for fighting illicit finance, criticized Mexico early this year for systematically failing to punish money launderers.
The FATF report pointed to a declining rate of already-low prosecutions based on data from the intelligence unit.
Nieto said that action by authorities slowed even more in 2018, the last year of President Enrique Pena Nieto's administration. The number of complaints from the unit declined and only three of them led to charges this year, he said. 
Nieto said the new government would focus on filing more criminal complaints, freezing more bank accounts and seizing more goods and valuables from wrongdoers.

Nieto said the new government would also make a top priority of targeting the gangs and gas stations involved in rampant fuel theft. Lopez Obrador this week said he would soon unveil a plan to tackle fuel theft, which has become one of Mexico's most pressing economic and security dilemmas.

Israel's military said earlier this week that it had found a number of passages dug across the Israel-Lebanon border to be used in carrying out attacks inside Israel. The Israeli military sent mechanical diggers, troops and anti-tunneling equipment to the border to shut them down.
The Israeli military, which launched the operation on Tuesday, has said its activity would, for now, stop on the Israeli side of the border. 
But Israeli news media on Thursday quoted a unnamed senior official saying that Israel could extend its activity into Lebanon, and on Friday Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz reiterated that messages.
""If we think that in order to thwart the tunnels that one needs to operate on the other side - then we will operate on the other side of the border,"" Katz told Radio Tel Aviv 102FM. 
What form the action would take was not clear. Over the past year, at least 15 tunnels from the Gaza Strip into Israel were found and destroyed, the Israeli military said. 
The United Nations peacekeeping Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), confirmed the existence of a tunnel near the ""blue line"" frontier between the two countries on Thursday, describing it as a ""serious occurrence"".
In the aftermath of the Israeli tunnel announcement, the situation has remained calm on both sides of the border. But the Israeli operation has brought renewed attention to a frontier across which Israel and Hezbollah last fought a war in 2006.
The Israeli military said in a statement on Thursday that it ""holds the Lebanese government, the Lebanese Armed Forces and United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon responsible for all events transpiring in and emanating from Lebanon.""
It added that an Israeli military commander had shown one of the tunnels to the head of UNIFIL, Major-General Sefano Del Col, and it urged UNIFIL and the the Lebanese army to clear the area of tunnels.
UNIFIL said in its statement it was ""engaged with the parties to pursue urgent follow-up action"".
Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil has instructed the country's envoy to the U.N. to complain that Israel is waging ""a diplomatic and political campaign against Lebanon in preparation for attacks against it"", Hezbollah's l-Manar TV said. 

Since the 2006 war, Israel has largely refrained from striking at Hezbollah on Lebanese soil, but it has carried out dozens of attacks in Syria against what it said were advanced weapons shipments to the Iranian-backed Shi'ite group.

RIMBO, Sweden (Reuters) - Yemen's Saudi-backed government has proposed reopening the Houthi-held airport in the capital Sanaa on condition planes are first inspected in the airports of Aden or Sayun which are under its control, two government officials said on Friday.
The proposal was made at U.N-sponsored Yemen peace talks in Sweden aimed at building confidence-building measures that could eventually lead to a ceasefire to halt air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition that have killed thousands of civilians, and Houthi missile attacks on Saudi cities. 
Yemen's warring sides agreed on Thursday to free thousands of prisoners, in what U.N. mediator Martin Griffiths called a hopeful start to the first peace talks in two years to end a war that has pushed millions of people to the verge of starvation.
Griffiths wants a deal on reopening Sanaa airport, shoring up the central bank and securing a truce in Hodeidah, the country's main port, held by the Houthis and a focus of the war after the coalition launched a campaign to capture it this year.
Marwan Dammaj, Yemen's minister of culture in the internationally-recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, told Reuters Sanaa airport should be re-opened to put ""an end to the people's suffering regarding transportation"". 
""But it should be a domestic airport from where Yemenis can go to Aden and then leave to international destinations,"" added Dammaj, a member of the government delegation.
Hamza Al Kamali, another member of the delegation, said airplanes must stop in airports in the southern city of Aden or Sayun, east of the capital, for inspection before leaving Yemen.
The war has killed tens of thousands of people and spawned what the United Nations calls the world's direst humanitarian crisis, since a Saudi-led Arab coalition intervened in 2015 to restore a government ousted by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. 
No talks have been held since 2016, and the last attempt in Geneva in September failed when the Houthis did not attend.
STALEMATE
The war, widely seen across the region as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been in stalemate for years, threatening supply lines to feed nearly 30 million inhabitants.
The Houthis control Sanaa and the other most populated areas, while the ousted government based in the southern city of Aden has struggled to advance despite the aid of Arab states.
Humanitarian suffering in one of the world's poorest countries has added to pressure on the parties to end the conflict, with faith in the Saudi-led war effort flagging among Western allies that arm and support the coalition.

Speculation has been rife that Egyptian authorities will seek changes to the constitution, which limits a president to two four-year terms in office, since Sisi's re-election in March in a vote against a marginal opponent.
MENA said a Cairo court had set Dec. 23 to hear a petition by a number of citizens demanding that the parliament speaker call a session to ""amend the text of article 140 of the constitution"", which sets presidential term limits.
""(The petitioners are demanding) that this article be amended to allow the re-election of the president for similar periods so long that the people approve this through a referendum that all elements of the nation are invited to participate in,"" the agency said.
The constitution stipulates that any revision must be approved by popular referendum.
Egyptians in 2014 overwhelmingly approved the constitution in a referendum. Sisi, who served as an army chief before his election, ousted Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after mass protests against the Islamist president's one year in office.
MENA said the petitioners argue that article 140 of the constitution is ""unfair to the great Egyptian people"" and that eight years gives a president little time to deal with the economic and security challenges facing the country.

Students this week have been blocking access to scores of high schools across France in protest at President Emmanuel Macron's education reforms, just as the 40-year-old leader grapples with sometimes-violent demonstrations over living costs.
Videos and photos of the students from two high schools in Val Fourre, a deprived neighborhood outside Mantes-La-Jolie, 60 kilometers west of Paris, went viral on social media late on Thursday, prompting public outrage. 
""Over the past few days, the students have been joined by about 100 hooded youths armed with clubs and incendiary devices and determined to pick a fight with police,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told a news conference.
Castaner said roadblocks had been set alight, projectiles hurled at motorists and houses robbed in the area around the two schools.
""It is in this context that the security forces stepped in,"" the minister added.
No students were injured while detained in the Val Fourre incident, French media reported.
But some social media users said the scene, with some of the teenagers lined up facing a wall, resembled a mock mass-execution.
""Can anyone tell me if they've witnessed such a thing in the last 50 years,"" one Twitter user said.
Another tweet read: ""These images of teenagers on their knees at the feet of CRS (riot police) are unworthy of a democracy. The government needs to take charge and re-establish chains of command.""
Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer described the images as ""shocking"" but said the violence convulsing France in recent weeks justified the heavy-handed policing.

France is hunkering down for another wave of potentially violent protests on Saturday as Macron struggles to quell public anger at the cost of living. Senior allies said he would address the nation early next week.

China is the North's most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over its neighbour's nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year as Pyongyang's relations with both Seoul and Washington have also improved.
At a landmark June summit in Singapore, the North's leader, Kim Jong Un, and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation, but the pact was sketchy and talks since have made little headway. 
Xi ""hoped North Korea and the United States meet each other halfway and address each other's reasonable concerns, allowing positive progress on the peninsula's nuclear talks,"" the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. 
In comments made before reporters, Xi added, ""The international and regional situation, as well as the situation on the Korean peninsula, remains in flux, so timely exchanges and the coordination of positions between China and North Korea are still extremely essential.""
The North's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said its commitment to denuclearisation and safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean peninsula were unchanged, the foreign ministry added. 
Meeting the Chinese government's top diplomat Wang Yi earlier, Ri said North Korea hoped to build ""required mutual trust"" with the United States and ""move in the same direction"", it said.
Ri, who is due to leave China on Saturday, visited Syria this week.
Kim has visited China three times this year to meet Xi. Diplomatic sources say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon.
Last month, South Korea said Xi intended to visit North Korea next year at Kim's invitation, which would make Xi the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005.
Last weekend, Trump said he was likely to meet Kim again in January or February, with three possible sites being considered for their second meeting.
The two countries have held talks over a second meeting after the unprecedented June summit, Reuters reported in October, citing a senior official.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Myanmar court jails anti-war protesters for defaming military,"By Thu Thu Aung
YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar court jailed three activists on Friday for defaming the military during anti-war protests, amid growing concern about a clamp-down on civil society.
A judge in Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin state, found two men and one woman guilty of defamation, sentencing them to six months in prison and a fine of $320 each.
Lum Zawng, Nang Pu, and Zau Jat took part in demonstrations in war-torn Kachin in April, when an army offensive against ethnic minority guerrillas prompted more than 6,000 people to flee their homes.
""They used the word 'military' in their speech,"" said Doi Bu, a lawyer for one of the defendants, referring to speeches they made at the protest.
""'The military doesn’t allow people to leave the conflict zone',"" he said, giving examples of what they had said.
""'The military blocks people from the conflict zone', and 'the military is threatening people'.""
The three had denied wrong doing.
The fighting between government troops and one of the country’s biggest insurgent groups, the Kachin Independence Army, stranded hundreds of villagers in the conflict zone and sparked anti-war protests in Myitkyina.
After more than two weeks, government leader Aung San Suu Kyi sent her minister for social welfare, relief and resettlement, Win Myat Aye, to the area and in May some 150 trapped villagers were allowed passage to safety.
The European Union and Swedish embassies in Yangon condemned Friday’s verdict, urging the authorities to review the decision. 
The EU said the judgment was ""worrying news for civil society in Myanmar"".
""Protests for peace and for saving people trapped by violent conflict should not be criminalized,"" the EU said in a statement.
According to the Myanmar free-speech organization Athan, which means ‘Voice’ in Burmese, 44 journalists and 142 activists have faced trial since 2016, when Nobel laureate Suu Kyi came to power at the head of Myanmar's first civilian government in more than 50 years.
Activists say her government has failed to use its overwhelming parliamentary majority to scrap colonial-era laws used to stifle dissent, while tightening restrictions on activist groups.

""This is a somber day,"" Nelke Mander, Medecins sans Frontieres's general director, said in a statement. ""The end of our operations onboard the Aquarius will mean more death in the sea, deaths that are avoidable and without witnesses.""
The decision to moor the Aquarius is the result of a ""constant denigration, smearing and obstruction campaign led"" against Medecins sans Frontieres and SOS MEDITERRANEAN by the Italian government and supported by other European countries, the NGO said.
The Aquarius was recently accused of trafficking waste and criminal activities -- accusations that are ""ludicrous"", Medecins sans Frontieres said.
Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has repeatedly closed Italian ports to the Aquarius, forcing it to sail for days with dozens of rescued migrants aboard to find a port in other countries.
Salvini has refused to take more migrants from the Aquarius, demanding other European Union countries take a share of migrants. He also said the rescue ships like Aquarius encouraged people to take the sea to cross towards Europe.
Europe has seen the biggest influx of people for decades in the past three years, many fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. Sea arrivals have dropped sharply, but the political aftershocks are still reverberating.
The ship was commissioned in February 2016 and has rescued almost 30,000 people in international waters off Libya, Malta and Italy. She has remained moored on Marseilles since Oct. 4, after transferring 58 migrants on Malta during her last mission.
Medecins sans Frontieres estimates 2,133 people died attempting to cross the Mediterranean in 2018, mainly embarking from Libya.

DAKAR (Reuters) - A Congolese army colonel has been arrested in connection with the killing of two U.N. sanctions monitors, a prosecutor said on Friday - the first member of the security services detained over the case.
Zaida Catalan, a Swede, and Michael Sharp, an American, were killed in March 2017 while investigating reports of atrocities during an armed conflict in Democratic Republic of Congo's Kasai region between government forces and the Kamuina Nsapu militia.
Congolese authorities initially blamed the militia, arrested about two dozen alleged fighters and charged them with involvement in the killings. The government later said it could not exclude the possibility state agents were involved.
Timothee Mukuntu, the prosecutor overseeing the case, told Reuters on Friday that Colonel Jean de Dieu Mambweni had been arrested but no formal charges had yet been filed.
Calls to Mambweni's phone did not connect and it was not immediately clear if he was represented by a lawyer. He has previously denied any role in Sharp and Catalan's deaths.
The prosecutor said Mambweni was arrested after a session in the trial of some of the arrested militia members on Thursday.
RECORDING
Defense layers at the hearing in the central city of Kananga said prosecutors played an audio recording of what they said was the colonel meeting the U.N. monitors at his house two days before their deaths.
In the audio recorded by Catalan, Mambweni was heard giving the monitors the number of a translator for them to use on their mission, and then calling the translator himself, two defense lawyers told Reuters.
Mambweni denied in court testimony last month that he had introduced them to the translator or played any part in the planning of their mission or their deaths.
Defense lawyer Tresor Kabangu also said members of his team had requested that Congo's interior minister at the time of the killings, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, appear in court to explain negotiations he led with Kamuina Nsapu representatives. 
Shadary is now President Joseph Kabila's preferred candidate to replace him in a Dec. 23 election. A spokesman for Shadary did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

The Philippines had initially agreed to buy 16 Bell 412 helicopters from Canada but the deal was scrapped in February after Canada expressed concern they could be used to fight rebels.
The Philippines then considered several other helicopters including Sikorsky Aircraft's S-70 Black Hawk, Russia's Mi-171, South Korea's Surion and Agusta Westland's AW139.
Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the air force would sign a contract early next year for the 16 Black Hawks, even though the Russians offered the second lowest price.
""But it is very difficult to pay them because of the U.S. sanctions,"" Lorenzana told reporters at a security forum.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed a law last year punishing Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, its support for Syria's government and its suspected meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, an accusation the Kremlin has denied.
U.S. allies, like the Philippines, buying weapons and equipment from Russia, the world's second largest arms exporter, would also be penalized and could see the transfer of those arms disrupted.
The S-70 is classified as a utility helicopter.
The Philippine air force is also seeking to acquire up to 10 attack helicopters next year.
The Philippines is spending 300 billion pesos ($5.6 billion) over the next five years to upgrade its defense capability, replacing World War Two-era warships and Vietnam War-vintage fighters and helicopters.
It recently acquired 12 light fighters from South Korea, logistics ships from Indonesia, and armored vehicles and ship-borne missiles from Israel.

ANKARA (Reuters) - New York prosecutors have withdrawn an appeal to extend the sentence of a former executive at Turkey's state-owned lender Halkbank, Turkey's state-owned Anadolu news agency said on Friday.
Halkbank shares rose nearly 4 percent after the report as market participants saw the move as further indication of an improvement in diplomatic ties between Washington and Ankara. 
A U.S. court sentenced Hakan Atilla, an executive from Halkbank, to 32 months in prison in May for helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions in a case that has strained already tense ties between NATO allies Ankara and Washington.
Halkbank, which denies any wrongdoing, has since faced potential U.S. fines in relation to the case, which Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has condemned as a political attack against his government.
Anadolu, without citing sources, said the New York prosecutor's office had originally filed the appeal, saying the sentence was too short. It said the court had asked prosecutors to present details of the appeal by Dec. 6, but that the appeal had later been withdrawn.
No further details were immediately available and the New York prosecutor's office was not available for comment, having yet to open on Friday morning.
Halkbank's dollar-denominated bonds jumped 0.74 cents to 84.70 cents after the report.
Last month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said after talks with U.S. officials in Washington that the two sides had discussed returning Atilla to Turkey where he can serve the rest of his sentence.
Erdogan also said last month that he had discussed the case of Halkbank with U.S. President Donald Trump, saying the talks were on a ""positive path"". He said, without elaborating, that Trump had told him ""he would instruct the relevant ministers immediately"" regarding the case.
Atilla is expected to be released on July 25, Anadolu said. He had already served 14 month when was sentenced. 
""It is good news that the U.S. prosecutor's office is not appealing to have the sentence prolonged or extended – it's a sign of improving relations between Turkey and the U.S.,"" said SEB's Per Hammarlund.
Tensions between the NATO allies accelerated a lira sell-off this year, although the currency's performance has improved in tandem with diplomatic ties. 
Relations between Ankara and Washington began to improve after U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson, who was on trial over terror-related charges in Turkey, was released in October.
They remain divided on a host of other issues, including U.S. policy in Syria and Turkey's request for the United States to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric Ankara blames for organizing the 2016 abortive putsch. Gulen denies involvement.

Marx is lauded in China, and in May President Xi Jinping said the decision of the ruling Communist Party to stick with his political theories remained ""totally correct"", in a speech to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the German philosopher's birth.
Xi's speech came near the end of a week-long propaganda blitz by state media, with chat shows saying ""Marx was Right"" and cartoons of his wild youth aiming to show his theories remain relevant to modern China and the next generation.
Speaking to students at Sichuan University in southwestern China, Steinmeier noted that China had this year donated a big statue of the founding father of communism to his German birthplace of Trier - controversial at the time due to German concerns at China's poor human rights record.
""In this anniversary year, it seems to me that Germans and Chinese can have very different views not only of current issues, but also of the same historical and intellectual ideas,"" Steinmeier said, according to a copy of the speech provided by the German embassy in Beijing. 
There was no doubt Marx was a great German intellectual, an influential philosopher, economist, historian and sociologist, and a ""rather less successful educator and workers' leader"", the president said.
""However, there is also no doubt that Marx was a passionate humanist. He demanded freedom of the press, humane working conditions, universal education, political rights for women and environmental protection,"" he said.
But Marx's ideas did not remain theoretical, Steinmeier said.
""We Germans cannot talk about Marx without also thinking of the havoc wrought in his name in eastern Germany and Europe – the depressing time of the Iron Curtain.""
During that time, Marxism was everything and the individual counted for nothing, families were torn apart, neighbors pitted against each other, and ""people confined behind walls and people who attempted to flee murdered"", he said.
Steinmeier did make any specific criticisms of China, where attention most recently has focused on widespread concern in Western capitals about re-education camps for ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim peoples in China's Xinjiang region.
Germany's history, he said, was for many years marked by ""dictatorship and repression"". 
""This makes us particularly sensitive to and aware of what happens to those who do not share the prevailing opinion, belong to an ethnic minority, want to practise their religion or campaign non-violently and peacefully for their ideas and beliefs,"" Steinmeier said. 
""That is why we are worried and alarmed whenever personal freedoms are curtailed.""

Lajack, who protested parliament's vote against the global deal last month, said he reversed his decision after guarantees from Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini the country would not change course away from its active European Union and NATO military alliance memberships.
""I have received clear guarantees that Slovakia will not take any steps that would cast doubts on basic pillars of our foreign policy,"" he said, adding he did not want to weaken Slovakia's foreign policy position by resigning.
Lajcak was president of the United Nations General Assembly when the pact was adopted, following the biggest influx of migrants into Europe since World War Two, many fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and beyond.
The deal, due to be ratified formally this month, was approved in July by all 193 U.N. nations except the United States, which backed out last year. 
But other EU states like Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic have since shunned the pact, highlighting central and eastern European nations' tough line on migration that clashes with others in the EU bloc.

Pellegrini has said Slovakia would ""never"" accept the pact because of its take on migration as a generally positive phenomenon, which contradicts Slovakia's will to distinguish among migrants.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian labor activist faces deportation from Thailand back to Cambodia over his role in making a documentary about sex trafficking that angered the Cambodian government, which dismissed it as fake, his wife said on Friday.
The ruling party of Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Sen, has waged a crackdown against what it says are critics of the government, including human rights advocates and opposition politicians.
Rath Rott Mony, 47, a prominent government critic, was arrested in Bangkok on Friday as he attempted to travel to the Netherlands with his family after helping produce the documentary for the Russia Today channel in October.
His wife, Long Kimheang, told Reuters from Bangkok she was afraid Thai police would send him back to Cambodia.
""Police arrested my husband and they told me that Cambodian police had sent them a document, saying he produced a false story,"" Long Kimheang said.
""I am worried when they deport my husband, he will be put in prison.""
Thai immigration police officials were not immediately available for comment. 
The documentary, titled ""My Mother Sold Me"", included an account of a poor Cambodian girl who was sold into sex work, prompting authorities to question those involved in making the report.
Authorities later said the mother and daughter were paid to lie in the documentary, according to Cambodian police.
Cambodian police spokesman Lieutenant General Chhay Kim Khoeun confirmed they had asked that Rath Rott Mony, president of the Cambodian Construction Workers Trade Union Federation (CCTUF), be deported if found in Thailand.

Athens and Skopje have agreed Macedonia will change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia to end a decades-long dispute and potentially enable it to join the transatlantic military alliance and European Union, which Russia opposes.

Moscow denies that, accusing the West in turn of big-footing the region and pressuring to rush the Macedonian process through by early next year. It says a Macedonian parliament vote that backed the name change was rigged through blackmail, threats and vote-buying.
""It is noteworthy that such a hurry serves Washington's only aim for Skopje's forced integration to NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization),"" he added.

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2018 04:35AM ET</span>",Factbox: Britain's Brexit vote - What are 'amendments' and why do they matter?,"By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's parliament will, over the course of a series of votes on Tuesday evening, decide whether to approve or reject Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal - a pivotal decision for the world's fifth largest economy.
The main vote is on a motion stating that lawmakers in the 650-seat house of Commons approve the Brexit deal. The government needs this approval in order to ratify the deal it has agreed with the European Union.
But, before the big vote, lawmakers will make attempts to change the wording of the motion through a parliamentary device known as an amendment. 
These could have the affect of rejecting May's deal and setting out another path, or adding conditions to the approval.
Any amendments will not be legally binding and so cannot automatically change the government's course. But, they will be politically powerful and if parliament approves any of them it will be a significant defeat for May.
In some cases defeat on an amendment is so significant that the voting process is halted and the deal is considered to have been rejected. Even minor amendments, could prevent the government from getting the unequivocal approval it needs to ratify the deal.
Six amendments will be selected on Tuesday from all those submitted and can then be put to a vote before the government motion. The selection process is at the discretion of speaker John Bercow. Voting is due to start at 1900 GMT on Tuesday.
Below is a list of amendments that have been submitted so far:
MAJOR AMENDMENTS - Approval of any of these amendment would likely mean instant overall defeat for the government and halt any further votes. May's deal would have been rejected.
Amendment A
This has been proposed by the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, and would have three effects:
1) Reject May's deal
2) Attempt to block Britain leaving without a deal
3) Demand the pursuit of every alternative exit strategy
The pro-EU liberal Democrat party have put forward an amendment to Corbyn's proposal which specifically refers to a second referendum.
Amendment I
This has been proposed by a group of lawmakers from across the political spectrum, and has received widespread support. It would do three things:
1) Reject May's deal
2) Attempt to block Britain leaving without a deal
3) Call on the government to set out its next steps to parliament ""without delay"".
Amendment K
This has been proposed by Scottish and Welsh lawmakers who say the deal damages their nations. It does two main things:
1) Rejects the existing deal
2) Demands an extension to the Article 50 negotiating period
NORTHERN IRELAND - these amendments relate to the 'backstop' arrangement - a fallback policy intended to ensure there is no return to a hard border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.
Amendment M
This has been proposed by lawmakers loyal to Theresa May who, reportedly with the backing of May's office, want to find a way to get more eurosceptics to vote for the deal. So far it has been dismissed by some of those eurosceptics.
It proposes to give parliament a say on whether to enter the backstop arrangement by ordering the government to report on its progress in March 2020 and then consult on its approach. 
Any decision to enter the backstop would need parliamentary approval, and would require the government to have a plan to exit the backstop within a year. It would also require the government to seek similar assurances from the EU about ending the backstop within one year.
Amendment B
This has been proposed by members of May's Conservative Party. It sets out that Britain will tear up the withdrawal agreement if the EU refuses to agree to a way of ending the special 'backstop' arrangements in place for the province.
Amendment D
This has been proposed by a member of May's Conservative Party. It sets out to make approval of the exit deal conditional on renegotiating to guarantee that a new trade deal is in place. This would negate the need for the unpopular 'backstop'.
Amendment E
This has been proposed by a member of the opposition Labour Party. It aims to make approval conditional on Britain renegotiating the deal with the EU to win the right to terminate the backstop without needing EU consent.
It also requires the government to seek a different type of future relationship with the EU, modeled on the recently signed trade deal between Canada and the EU.
Amendment F
This has been proposed by a member of May's Conservative Party. It sets out to make approval conditional on Britain negotiating the right to terminate the backstop without needing EU consent.
OTHERS
Amendment G
This has been proposed by a member of May's Conservative Party. It would make approval conditional upon an agreement that the only half of the agreed 39 billion pound exit bill would be paid at first, with the second half of payment made only when a free trade agreement with the EU has been ratified.
Amendment H
This has been proposed by a member of May's Conservative Party. It commits the government to ""vigorously contest"" any instance where it feels the EU is breaching the requirement to negotiate a future relationship in good faith.
Amendment J
This has been proposed by opposition lawmakers to add additional reassurances that Britain and the EU will ensure open and fair competition and that standards on environmental protection, workers' rights and safety will not be lowered after Brexit.
Amendment L

The 39-year-old comedian and ""Ride Along"" actor had announced on Tuesday that he would host the Academy Awards, the film industry's highest honors.
""I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year's Oscar's ... this is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists,"" Hart said in a tweet late on Thursday.
""I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past,"" he tweeted.
In one of the old tweets, Hart described an actor's picture as a ""gay billboard for AIDS"". In another he said if his son were playing with a doll's house, he would break it over his head and tell him to stop being gay.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organizes the Oscars, was not immediately available for comment.
Chad Griffin, the president of the Washington DC-based LGBTQ advocacy group, The Human Rights Campaign, responded to Hart on Twitter late Thursday.
""You have a rare opportunity to take responsibility, teach people in this moment, & send a message to LBGTQ youth that they matter & deserve dignity & respect,"" Griffin wrote.
Hart, who also starred in the 2017 film ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"", would have followed talk show host Jimmy Kimmel who hosted the Oscars in 2018 and 2017.
Hart, writing on his Instagram page this week, called the gig ""the opportunity of a lifetime"".
""I am so happy to say that the day has finally come for me to host the Oscars,"" he said.
The Academy responded on Twitter: ""Welcome to the family."" 
Hosting the Oscars is one of the most prestigious and difficult jobs in show business, navigating the expectations of the A-list audience in the theater and millions of people watching on television, with a combination of topical and insider jokes.
Hart, who is African-American, would have been one of just a handful of black Oscar hosts over the past 90 years, including Chris Rock, Whoopi Goldberg and Sammy Davis Jr.

Oscar nominations will be announced on Jan. 22, with the 2019 televised ceremony taking place in Hollywood on Feb. 24.

Guerrillas from the Communist Party of the Philippines have been battling government forces for 50 years, in one of Asia's longest-running insurgencies.
The party said in a statement it would suspend attacks on the military from Dec. 24 to Dec. 26 ""in unity with the Filipino people's observance of traditional holidays"".
Most people in the Philippines are Christian.
The rebels also declared a New Year ceasefire from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1.
But Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana rejected the offer, saying that for the first time in 30 years, the government would not suspend offensive military operations over the holidays.
""We're fooling ourselves about this ceasefire,"" Lorenzana told reporters.
""What for? To give them freedom to regroup and to refurbish so that after the ceasefire, we'll be fighting again.""
Military spokesman Brigadier General Edgard Arevalo said government forces did not want to give the rebels the opportunity to ""propagandize"", and would not stop combat operations.
The rebel forces, estimated to number 3,000 fighters, have been waging a guerrilla war in rural areas for nearly 50 years in a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people.
Rebel attacks have stifled growth in resource-rich areas in the poor Southeast Asian country as guerrillas target mines, plantations, construction and telecommunication companies, demanding ""revolutionary taxation"" to finance their fight.

Since 1986, the government has been holding on-again, off-again talks with Maoist rebels, brokered by Norway, but President Rodrigo Duterte scrapped negotiations last year due to rebel attacks and taxation.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea plans to buy dozens of U.S.-built ship-to-air missiles, in an order worth about $300 million, to boost air defenses against North Korea, even as it moves to reduce tension with Pyongyang, Seoul's arms buying agency said on Friday. 
Since 2013, South Korea has bought Standard Missile-2s, developed by  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN), in installments to equip three Aegis destroyers preparing to be deployed in the mid-2020s.
It aimed to ramp up the capability to detect and track missiles from the North, as its neighbor developed nuclear programs ultimately targeting the United States in defiance of international sanctions. 
The latest missile purchase decision by a defense acquisition panel paves the way for delivery of the final batch, an official of South Korea's Defence Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) said. 
The official declined to state the number of missiles, citing security concerns, but said there would be ""dozens"", with the total order valued at about 340 billion won ($304 million).
The official declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal. 
In reconciliation efforts this year, the neighbors clinched a comprehensive military pact at a September summit in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, that aimed to defuse military tension over their heavily fortified border.
But the South has continued to reinforce air defenses, deciding last month to buy two Israeli early warning radar systems.
In September, the U.S. State Department approved possible military sales worth $2.6 billion to South Korea, including six Boeing-made (N:BA) P-8A Poseidon maritime reconnaissance aircraft and 64 Patriot anti-ballistic missile weapons, made by  Lockheed Martin  Co (N:LMT).
The reclusive North and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, rather than a peace treaty.

At a landmark June summit in Singapore, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to work toward denuclearization, but the pact was sketchy and talks since have made little headway.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian tech ministry officials met with senior WhatsApp executives this week to ask the  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) unit to start tracing the origins of misinformation spread through its messaging platform, a senior government official said on Friday.
WhatsApp has been working to curb the circulation of what technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad termed ""sinister"" content in India, the firm's biggest market where it boasts over 220 million users.
Such misinformation has led to the lynching of over 30 people since January last year, according to data portal IndiaSpend, prompting Prasad to call on WhatsApp to trace its origins.
WhatsApp has previously declined to trace the origin of messages, citing security issues.
""We have been asking them for traceability,"" said the official at the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, declining to be identified as the meeting was private. ""They (WhatsApp) are non-committal on it but we are forcing this issue.""
WhatsApp was represented by Director & Associate General Counsel Brian Hennessy and one other executive, and said it was working on measures to prevent the spread of misinformation, according to the official.
""WhatsApp regularly engages with the Government of India to discuss our commitment to maintaining a private and safe platform for people to communicate with one another,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We look forward to continued discussions on how we can work together toward these common goals.""
WhatsApp maintains that building traceability into its messaging service would undermine its private nature and end-to-end encryption, creating the potential for misuse. It has also said it will not weaken the privacy protection it provides.
The firm has since launched print, radio and television advertising campaigns to educate users on the dangers of misinformation. It is also conducted roadshows in partnership with mobile phone network provider Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
WhatsApp has held digital literacy training for community leaders and law enforcement as well as introduced features on its app such as limits on message forwarding and labels for forwarded messages.

""Arizona, together with our Military and Border Patrol, is bracing for a massive surge at a NON-WALLED area. WE WILL NOT LET THEM THROUGH,"" Trump wrote in a post on Twitter, appearing to maintain pressure on lawmakers seeking to approve legislation to keep the government open through to Sept. 30 next year.
Representatives for the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
It was unclear if Trump had a specific group of migrants in mind.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that border agents in Arizona had apprehended two groups of families from Honduras and Guatemala comprising a total of 124 migrants who had crossed into the United States. 
The U.S. Congress approved a stopgap two-week spending bill on Thursday but lawmakers still need to agree on a longer-term funding measure to fund government agencies until the end of the fiscal year in September.
Trump, who has made the construction of the wall a foundation of his presidency, has demanded $5 billion this year from Congress for the boundary and has threatened to shut down the government if lawmakers do not accede. 

Democrats have argued the wall would be ineffective at ending illegal migration and stemming the flow of illicit drugs across the border.

Nothing suspicious was found, CNN reported.
All vehicle and pedestrian traffic had been blocked by police, said New York Police Detective Hubert Reyes.
The call came in after 10 p.m., and the news network briefly switched to pretaped programing, before cutting to live shots of newscasters, employees and onlookers standing behind police barricades outside the building. 

The network's bureau at the Time Warner Center was evacuated in October after a package containing an explosive device, addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan, was discovered.

1648,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>",Merkel's Party Gathers to Deliver a Verdict on Her 13-Year Rule,"(Bloomberg) -- Angela Merkel’s long exit from politics begins Friday when her party gathers in Hamburg to decide whether to appoint her chosen successor as its new leader or break with the legacy of her 13 years in charge of Germany.
A group of powerful conservatives led by former Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble have chafed under her stewardship since 2000 and her decision to step down from the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union offers them a chance to take back control. If their candidate, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s Friedrich Merz, beats Merkel acolyte Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer the chancellor’s plans for a final three years in office may be called into question.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, known as AKK to the party faithful, would maintain her mentor’s strategy of looking to dominate the center ground of German politics, even though her agenda has divided their party. Merz has vowed to regain territory lost to the nationalists of Alternative for Deutschland, or AfD, while insisting he won’t drag the party to the right.
The contest is wide open as 1,001 party delegates convene for the two-day party conference. Merkel is due to address the meeting at around 11 a.m. and the vote on her successor as party chief will take place from 3 p.m. Whoever comes out on top will be seen as chancellor-in-waiting -- a status conferred on CDU leaders since the foundation of the federal republic after World War II.
The tensions within the party were evident in the conference slogan -- “Bringing people together — and taking the lead together.”
Those cracks became more obvious this week when Schaeuble, who himself handed over the party leadership to Merkel 18 years ago, openly endorsed Merz as CDU chairman. A party led by Merz “would be the best thing for the country,” Schaeuble, one of only two postwar CDU leaders not to become chancellor, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Tuesday.
A third candidate, 38-year-old Health Minister Jens Spahn, is seen as the outsider with little chance of victory.
Peter Altmaier, Merkel’s economy minister and ally, said he was “surprised and astonished” at Schaeuble’s nod to Merz -- and returned the favor by endorsing AKK.
“Now that Wolfgang Schaeuble has burst the dam, I can say this: I am convinced that with Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer we have the best chance to unite the CDU and win elections,” Altmaier told Rheinische Post newspaper on Thursday.
Although Merz vows that he can cooperate with Merkel as chancellor, a CDU under his leadership would hearken back to the party before Merkel -- a clearer tax-cutting agenda and a greater focus on security, especially when it comes to migration, as he targets voters lost to the AfD.
A Merz succession would also accelerate Merkel’s fading grip over domestic policy. She already lost her firm control over CDU lawmakers in September, when her parliamentary group staged a coup, unseating her caucus chairman in favor of a more independent rival.
An AKK victory by contrast would make Merkel’s final years leading the government easier. Merkel installed the former state premier from regional politics in February to end an ever-louder debate about her succession. AKK has consistently out-polled Merz, whose wealth and conservatism many Germans view with some suspicion.
But the 1,001 CDU members who will choose their next leader may have other priorities.
“Even if among voters there seems to be a clear preference for AKK, it doesn’t look that clear-cut among CDU delegates who are the ones voting at the end of the day,” said Famke Krumbmueller, a Paris-based partner at political-risk consultancy OpenCitiz.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Heavy rains and the threat of mudslides in Southern (NYSE:SO) California forced the closure of a key coastal highway near Malibu on Thursday and prompted authorities to order evacuations of almost 3,000 residents from hillside areas scarred by recent wildfires.
The same Pacific storm also brought snow to the region's high country, leading to the temporary closure of a stretch of Interstate 5 called the Grapevine, a major truck route that traverses a mountain pass north of Los Angeles, officials said.
The storm, which led the National Weather Service to issue flash-flood warnings for parts of Southern California, heightened concerns about the long-term risk of mudslides and debris flows around communities where wildfires have stripped foothills and canyon slopes of vegetation.
Last month, the Woolsey Fire incinerated 1,500 buildings and charred 97,000 acres (39,000 hectares) in the upscale coastal enclave of Malibu and adjacent areas near Los Angeles, leaving large swaths of hilly landscape vulnerable to slides and flooding.
""The fires have generated some risks that we need to be aware of and be cautious of for several years into the future,"" Cindy Matthews, a senior National Weather Service hydrologist, said.
About 2,700 people were ordered evacuated from Lake Elsinore and surrounding Riverside County communities about 60 miles (100 km) east of Los Angeles, where rains threatened to unleash rivers of mud, boulders and other debris down hillsides, according to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Captain Fernando Herrera.
Some mud flows occurred on Thursday in the area, burned earlier this year by the Holy fire, but no major property damage was reported, Herrera said.
The threat of mudslides in the Woolsey Fire zone around Malibu was not deemed severe enough to trigger evacuations there, Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Tony Imbrenda said.
However, as a heavy debris flow smothered a nearby section of Pacific Coast Highway, forcing authorities to close that stretch of the scenic highway for a few hours.
In all, the storm dumped more than 3 inches (8 cm) of rain in some parts of Southern California, according to the National Weather Service.

The money was wrapped in capsules made from latex gloves and consisted of funds from unidentified Mexican cartels. The cash was in exchange for cocaine sent by Colombian crime gangs, National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels and dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which demobilized last year.
The smuggling networks were broken up with help from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, the police said.
The networks would recruit unemployed and poor young people to travel to Mexico and then ingest between 80 and 120 capsules of money before returning to Colombia, said General Jorge Hernando Nieto, the head of the national police.
""With each ingestion they could bring in up to $40,000, there's even a case where they brought in $75,000 in one traveler,"" Nieto told journalists. ""The confiscated money in this investigation reaches $11 million.""
One of those captured had traveled between Colombia and Mexico 250 times since 2015, he said.

Colombia is the world's top producer of cocaine, the majority of which is sent to Mexican cartels, which largely control its distribution. Colombia's cocaine output is around 1,000 tons annually, according to security sources.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A U.S. attempt to get the United Nations to condemn violence by Palestinian militant group Hamas for the first time failed on Thursday because the draft resolution fell short of votes needed in the General Assembly.
The resolution required two-thirds support and while Assembly resolutions are non-binding, they can carry political weight. The U.S. text received 87 votes in favor, 58 against, 32 abstentions and 16 countries did not vote. 
In an earlier procedural move requested by Kuwait, the 193-member body narrowly voted to require two-thirds support and not a simple majority for adoption of the draft resolution. 
Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley had written to member states on Monday to urge them to vote for the U.S.-drafted text, warning them: ""The United States takes the outcome of this vote very seriously.""
Haley, who will step down at the end of the year, has been a staunch defender of Israel.
""Before the General Assembly can credibly advocate compromise and reconciliation between the Palestinians and Israel, it must on record, unambiguously and unconditionally, condemn Hamas terrorism,"" Haley told the body before the vote. 
The United States is working on a long-awaited plan to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians, but the Palestinians are skeptical and have accused the Trump administration of siding with Israel on core issues.
Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that ""rejecting the American drafted resolution against the resistance represents a blow to the American administration and reaffirms the legitimacy of the resistance.""
Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said the countries that rejected the draft resolution should be ashamed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commended those that voted in favor. 
Israel captured Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war but withdrew in 2005, while holding onto most of the separate West Bank, where Palestinians have limited self-rule.
For more than a decade Gaza has been controlled by Hamas under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade. The economy has collapsed, creating what the World Bank describes as a humanitarian crisis with shortages of water, electricity and medicine.
Israel says it has no choice but to enforce its blockade to defend itself against Hamas, which calls for Israel's destruction and has used Gaza as a base for missile attacks.
Iran's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Eshagh Al Habib accused the United States of trying to deflect the attention of the world from the root causes of the conflict and said ""we recognize Hamas as a legitimate resistance movement fighting for the liberation of Palestinian territory from foreign occupation.""

1652,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Swiss cabinet set to rebuff EU in watershed vote on treaty,"By Michael Shields
ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's divided cabinet looks bound for a clash with the European Union with its likely rejection on Friday of a draft treaty that has exposed deep divisions in Swiss attitudes toward its biggest trading partner.
Brussels has pressed for a decade for an accord that would have Switzerland routinely adopt changes to rules in the single market that is the lifeblood of Swiss exporters. It also wants changes to Swiss labor rules that defend high local wages.
The draft pact negotiated over nearly five years would provide a more effective system for resolving disputes, using arbitration panels to handle disagreements while still giving the European Court of Justice a say in how to interpret law.
But both the traditionally pro-Europe left and the anti-EU far right say the deal infringes too much on Swiss sovereignty. leaving the four-party coalition short of a majority to approve the political hot potato before elections next year.
That sets up a fight with Brussels, which will ban EU-based banks and brokers from trading on Swiss stock exchanges beyond the end of 2018 as a punitive measure should Bern not sign off on Friday. That would prompt Swiss retaliation. 
The talks are complicated by Britain's own tortuous negotiations on EU divorce terms, with the European Commission loath to be soft on the Swiss for fear of providing ammunition to Brexiteers. Some Swiss also want to see what Britain can wrangle for itself before striking Bern's own EU deal.
Relations between neutral Switzerland and the bloc that surrounds it have swung between friendly and fraught for decades as the Swiss balance the economic benefits of close commercial ties with a traditional wariness of foreign entanglements. 
Two-thirds of Swiss foreign trade is with the EU. Around 1.4 million EU citizens live in Switzerland - foreigners in all make up a quarter of the population of 8.5 million - and more than 300,000 commute daily, helping Swiss companies fill key jobs. 
More than 450,000 Swiss live in the EU, and Switzerland is a top trade partner for the EU after the United States and China.
Relations suffered in 1992 when Swiss voters rejected joining the European Economic Area. This led to a negotiated patchwork of 120 bilateral accords that now govern ties. 
The treaty in question would sit atop those accords and focus on five areas: free movement of people, aviation, land transport, mutual recognition of industrial standards and processed farm goods. 
If talks fail, the sectoral accords would stay in effect but relations would suffer badly. No deal would mean no increase in Swiss access to the single market, dashing hopes for a new electricity union. It could also endanger unfettered EU market access for Swiss makers of products such as medical devices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia must scrap its 9M729 nuclear-capable cruise missiles and launchers or modify the weapons' range to return to compliance with a key Cold War-era arms control treaty and avert a U.S. pullout from the pact, a senior U.S. official said Thursday.
""Either you rid the system, rid the launcher or change the system where it doesn't exceed the range"" in a verifiable manner, said U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Andrea Thompson.
On Tuesday, the United States announced it was giving Russia 60 days to end what Washington charges is the missiles' violation of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or it would begin to withdraw from the pact.
The possibility that the treaty might unravel alarms Washington's European allies, who fear its collapse would trigger a new U.S.-Russian nuclear weapons race with the danger that Europe itself could become a nuclear battleground. 
U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, who briefed reporters with Thompson, said that a U.S. withdrawal from the treaty ""does not mean we are walking away from arms control.""
""We remain committed to arms control, but we need a reliable partner and do not have one in Russia on INF or for that matter on other treaties that it’s violating,"" Huntsman said.
Sounding a similar theme on Thursday at a Washington Post event, the top U.S. military commander warned that Russia's continued breach of the INF pact could hamper extending the New START treaty, which limits U.S. and Russian offensive nuclear weapons deployments, beyond its Feb. 5, 2021, expiration.
""I will not obviously not make this decision. I’ll make recommendations,"" said Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""But it's very difficult for me to envision progress in extending (New START) . . . if the foundation of that is non-compliance with the INF Treaty.""
Unless the sides agree on a five-year extension provided by the pact, New START's expiration will end all restrictions on their deployments of offensive nuclear weapons.
Moscow denies the missile, which U.S. officials say can hit European targets with nuclear or conventional warheads, violates the INF Treaty. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday warned that Russia would develop missiles banned by the accord if the United States exits the pact.
The United States and its European allies charge that what Moscow calls the 9M729 Novator cruise missile - designated the SSC-8 by the NATO Western security alliance - breaches the treaty's range limit of 500 to 5,000 km (310 to 3,420 miles).
The treaty also bans the production and testing of missiles with such ranges and their launchers.
President Donald Trump on Oct. 20 said the United States would withdraw from the treaty after what U.S. officials said were dozens of meetings since 2013 in which their Russian counterparts first denied the 9M729's existence and then said it complied with the pact.
NATO leaders on Tuesday unanimously supported the U.S. charge that Russia has been violating the treaty. But they prevailed on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to give diplomacy another chance and allow Russia 60 days to return to compliance.
The treaty, negotiated by then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ratified by the U.S. Senate, eliminated the medium-range missile arsenals of the world's two biggest nuclear powers and reduced their ability to launch a nuclear strike at short notice.

Israel's military said this week it had identified a number of passages and sent diggers and troops close the frontier to block them.
The peacekeepers, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), confirmed the existence of a tunnel near the ""blue line"" frontier between the two countries in a statement on Thursday, describing it as a ""serious occurrence"". 
Israel said its operation would stop on its side of the border. But Israeli media on Wednesday quoted a unnamed senior official saying Israel could broaden its actions into Lebanon.
There was no immediate reaction from Hezbollah or Lebanese authorities.
All parties say the situation has remained calm on both sides of the border. But the Israeli operation has focused attention on a frontier across which Israel and Hezbollah fought a war in 2006.
The Israeli military said in a statement it ""holds the Lebanese government, the Lebanese Armed Forces and United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon responsible for all events transpiring in and emanating from Lebanon."" 
It added that one of its commanders had showed one of the tunnels to the head of UNIFIL, Major-General Sefano Del Col.
""We urge ... that UNIFIL take action together with the Lebanese armed forces to clear the area, clear the access to the tunnels and make sure that it is not used for (hostile) purposes against Israel,"" said Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, a senior military spokesman.
UNIFIL said in its statement it was ""engaged with the parties to pursue urgent follow-up action"".
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this week Hezbollah was planning to send militants through the tunnels to launch attacks and he expanded on his comments on Thursday.
""Hezbollah wants to insert several battalions to our territory with the aim of isolating communities, towns and kibbutzim (collective farms) to continue its reign of terror and abductions which could take place simultaneously,"" he told a meeting of foreign diplomats.
He said Hezbollah's tunnels were big enough to be used by motorcycles, small vehicles and groups of people.
Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil has instructed the country's envoy to the U.N. to complain that Israel is waging ""a diplomatic and political campaign against Lebanon in preparation for attacks against it"", Hezbollah's al-Manar TV said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro named a pro-life evangelical pastor on Thursday to head a new ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights that will also take over the agency looking after the country's 850,000 indigenous people.
Damares Alves, a lawyer, preacher and congressional aide, is a staunch opponent of legalizing abortion, which is allowed only in cases of rape, anencephaly or when the mother's life is in danger. 
She is the second woman named to the incoming president's 22-member cabinet, future chief of staff Onyx Lorenzoni said.
Bolsonaro won the October election on a law-and-order platform, vowing to restore Christian family values in a society where he believes leftist parties went too far in introducing sexual education in schools and advancing LGBT rights.
While the appointment of a social conservative was expected in the rights portfolio, placing the indigenous affairs foundation Funai under its guard was a surprise move.
Bolsonaro says he will deny new land claims by indigenous tribes and favors opening their land to commercial mining and farming. He argues they have a right to charge royalties to improve their quality of life and to integrate with the rest of Brazil, comparing them to animals trapped in a zoo. 
He recently considered putting Funai under the agriculture ministry, which would give farmers who backed his election an upper hand in land conflicts, but instead bundled them into the new rights ministry.
Earlier on Thursday, as his transition team decided on the new ministry, indigenous leaders in native headdresses delivered a letter asking Bolsonaro to keep Funai as part of the Justice Ministry.
Speaking to reporters after she was appointed, Alves said some indigenous land claims were questionable.
""Defining land boundaries for indigenous land is a delicate and controversial issue that we will have discuss,"" she said.
Some 517,000 natives, about two-thirds of Brazil's indigenous population, live on reservations that represent 12.5 percent of the country's territory.
Environmentalists say the indigenous people on the reservations are the best guardians of Brazil's tropical forests and their biodiversity. The issue has gained more importance as the destruction of Brazil's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit its highest level in a decade, the government said last month.

That destruction is primarily caused by illegal logging, ranching and farming, officials say. Anthropologists and rights groups say allowing mining companies into reservations would also destroy native cultures.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - “I wish I didn’t have this hand anymore,” my 4-year-old son said as he woke one winter morning.
“Why, my love?”
“Because it’s no good,” he said, pulling at the nearly lifeless fingers of his left hand with its stronger partner.
Already weary from fear and worry over Natan’s cascade of symptoms, I was pained to hear him describe how his body was betraying him.
It was March 2017. Over the previous year, the signs had mounted that something was wrong. First, Natan’s voice weakened. He repeatedly fell ill with lung infections. Each passing week seemed to bring a new warning. He choked when eating or drinking. His left foot dragged. He would trip and fall at play. His eyes moved rapidly from side-to-side. When we spoke to our bright boy, it was harder to connect, as if a heavy fog had settled between him and the world.
Now, Natan was days away from a delicate surgery to remove part of the tumor that doctors had eventually found growing, weed-like, from his spinal cord. It had invaded his brainstem and beyond, slowly suffocating the nerves that control breathing, swallowing and movement. Left unchecked, it could kill him.
But even if successful, the surgery would be only a stop-gap measure, a starting point in a process that would propel our family to the forward edges of medical science. There, the genomics revolution, as it’s known, has made it possible to understand and confront what drives some cancers and other diseases. With tissue taken from the tumor, doctors told us, they would determine whether it was caused by a rare genetic mutation, which could radically change the course of his treatment.
Just a few years earlier, that course would have been grimly straightforward: more than a year of chemotherapy that might stop the tumor from growing. Patients like Natan might need to repeat this punishing treatment several times in childhood and face a life of increasing impairment as the mass robbed them of their ability to breathe or walk on their own. Now, we were told, there was a slim chance Natan could beat back the tumor by merely swallowing a pill twice a day, with few, if any, side effects.
In the 15 years since scientists completed the first map of a person’s genome – the sequence of DNA molecules that are the unique genetic blueprint of every individual – the process has become steadily faster and cheaper. With the information such testing yields on tumor cells, researchers are developing drugs to target, one by one, specific disease-causing genetic abnormalities, prolonging and improving the lives of tens of thousands of people whose illnesses were once a death sentence. And they’ve only just begun.
“Forty years ago, we didn’t understand the cancer, and we didn’t understand the drugs,” said Dr Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer at the American Society of Clinical Oncology. “Now we are actually able to study a patient’s cancer, gain some insight into what is driving it, and in some cases, identify well-established, effective therapies that can target those drivers. That’s a huge difference.”
These advances also bring new risks to patients, already dealing with a devastating diagnosis, who may be encouraged to consider costly new treatments with little evidence of their effectiveness or safety. It is a subject of debate in the cancer community: How to temper the hope for a few against the likelihood that most patients will still not find an answer in these therapies.
“The majority of people do not benefit, but some do, and that’s what’s driving the field forward,” Schilsky said.
In Natan’s case, we learned that in a clinical trial, one of the newer targeted therapies approved to treat aggressive adult cancers had worked wonders on a small group of children with similar slow-growing tumors. If DNA sequencing turned up the relevant mutation, the experts told us, Natan would be a candidate for the drug.
I was not about to unquestioningly embrace a treatment on scant evidence, and one whose long-term effects weren’t known. As U.S. health editor for Reuters News for several years, I had worked on articles chronicling the promise and disappointments of so-called precision medicine. I knew to question claims about new drugs that “melted away” tumors.
The professional was now personal, so I and my equally skeptical husband set out to learn as much as we could about the options for Natan. We consulted with family and friends in the medical field and tapped referral networks in our Jewish community. We interviewed experts and read what research we could find. It was exhausting, especially on top of the emotional and physical toll of caring for a sick child, but we had no choice.
Our little boy’s survival was at stake.
THE ILLNESS
Natan was a healthy baby and toddler, active and mischievous at play with his older brother. Our only complaint was that he frequently woke during the night, but in those years, there was always a reasonable explanation: feeding, teething, growth spurts.
Our first real panic struck in the spring of 2016. Natan, then 3, woke one Sunday with a runny nose, but he otherwise seemed fine. I left for the gym. Within that hour, he spiked a high fever, and when I returned, my husband was holding him over the bathroom sink, splashing cold water on his face.
“He went limp, like he wasn’t breathing,” he said. “I’ve called an ambulance.”
After a few days in hospital being treated for pneumonia, Natan bounced back. The speed of his deterioration worried us, yet it seemed similar enough to other parents’ stories about scary but treatable respiratory illnesses in young children and our own preschool bouts with pneumonia and bronchitis.
Soon we began to wonder why his sleep was still so disrupted, and why his voice had begun to sound soft and hoarse.
The first doctor visits turned up nothing unusual. When anyone recommended more in-depth tests, such as a sleep study, my husband and I, wary of unnecessary medical interventions, would ask what practical difference the information could make.
Within months, it became clear that we needed more answers. When Natan returned to preschool in September, his voice was barely audible to his teachers. He would sometimes appear to choke while eating or drinking. An ear infection gave way to a sinus infection which gave way to bronchitis. When he finished a course of antibiotics, he was soon back at his pediatrician’s office or the emergency room, struggling to breathe.
“There’s no reason a neurologically normal child should sound like that,” a pulmonologist said after listening to just a few breaths.
From Thanksgiving on, the tests began to pile up, as did the medications Natan needed daily. The list of “complaints” on his chart grew longer after each visit: noisy breathing, sleep disorder breathing, chronic bronchitis, asthma. He was hospitalized again for pneumonia at Christmas. Nothing we were doing was making him better, and that helplessness fed our anxiety.
Natan now cried many mornings before school. “I’m sick!” he would say, even if his vital signs seemed normal. At work, I was haunted by the feeling that his teacher or babysitter would call at any minute to say he had stopped breathing. When I picked him up from class, I noticed his heavy gait, how he stumbled forward while walking, and how his eyes seemed dulled.
Each new specialist brought in on Natan’s case identified another symptom, now more suggestive of a neurological disorder: the rapid, involuntary eye movements, the weakness on the left side of his body. But we still had no explanation.
“What is the diagnosis?” my husband demanded at each medical visit.
THE DIAGNOSIS
In late February 2017, the two of us sat in the hospital cafeteria, waiting to hear when Natan had roused from the anesthesia for an MRI scan. We tried to keep our worst fears in check.
“When this is over, we should take the boys to the beach for a month. It’s the best medicine,” my husband said.
I looked at the clock. The call from the nurses’ station hadn’t come in, though more than enough time had passed, and I was antsy.
“Let’s go upstairs,” I said. Then my cellphone rang.
It was the neurologist who ordered the MRI. The scan showed something unusual: a large “infiltrating” lesion centered in the medulla oblongata, the structure at the lower end of the brainstem that controls breathing and other involuntary functions. The thickest part was packed tightly into the cervical spine, with tentacles snaking up into the midbrain and cerebellum, which regulates balance and motor coordination.
“What does that mean?” I asked.
“You need to speak to a neuro-oncologist,” she said, adding that she was trying to get us an appointment within a few days. “There’s no sign of fluid building up in the brain, so you can take your son home.”
“Are you telling me that my son has a massive brain tumor, but should go home now?” I asked.
We refused to leave until someone who could interpret the scan spoke to us.
An hour later, an expert on pediatric brain tumors told us Natan’s lesion was probably a rare, slow-growing type, appearing in about 100 cases a year in the United States. Natan may even have been born with it, and only now was it large enough to crush the nerves running through his 4-year-old’s brainstem, a structure about the size of an adult thumb that connects the brain and the spinal cord.
These dying nerves were losing their ability to regulate Natan’s walking and fine motor movements, his breathing, swallowing and sleep rhythms.
“At least you now have a diagnosis that explains everything,” the doctor said. “It can take some families much longer to arrive at this point.”
“I WANT THIS TUMOR OUT”
Like many people facing a crisis, we called on every resource we had at our disposal. We were fortunate to have access to excellent doctors and world-renowned hospitals close to home. The health insurance provided through my employer covered nearly all our expenses.
Two weeks after we received the diagnosis, Natan endured a six-hour operation at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. Dr Mark Souweidane, director of pediatric neurological surgery at Weill Cornell and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, removed about 20 percent of the tumor, most of it in the cervical spine. Venturing farther into the brainstem, where the tumor was harder to distinguish from healthy tissue, would have been too dangerous.
Within days, pathology tests confirmed the tumor type: a slow-growing ganglioglioma, a mix of cells that include components of the central nervous system and supporting tissue.
The good news was that such low-grade gliomas are not malignant, meaning that unlike aggressive cancers, they do not grow rapidly and generally do not spread to other organs. In many cases, they stop growing completely when patients reach their 20s. But the large size and the location of the tumor had already significantly damaged Natan’s ability to swallow and breathe. That put him at risk of inhaling fluids and small pieces of food into his airways, leading to deadly pneumonias or choking.
It would take two more months to get sequencing results conducted separately by Weill Cornell and Sloan Kettering, where we sought a second confirmation of the genetic profile of the tumor.
In that time, we focused on Natan’s recovery from surgery, with weeks spent in hospital and an acute rehabilitation center.
Removing part of the tumor helped improve some symptoms. The rapid eye movements were nearly gone. In daily therapy sessions, Natan was learning to use his left hand again and walk without stumbling. But we were noticing or confirming new problems: hearing loss, severe sleep apnea, long bouts of hiccups that are a hallmark of brainstem tumors.
I tried to cling to the idea that somehow the surgery would be enough for a few months, or years, before the tumor progressed further. I even hoped that it would just stop growing on its own, as a few doctors had suggested, and feared the new surprises he would face in treatment. Even without major complications after surgery, he was fragile, physically and emotionally.
My husband was uneasy about waiting to see if the tumor grew further before starting some kind of therapy.
“It feels like we’re just sitting around waiting for a miracle to happen,” he said. “I want this tumor out.”
The sequencing confirmed that a mutation known as BRAF V600E, most often seen in adults with the deadly skin cancer melanoma, was driving Natan’s tumor.
“I have something for you,” Dr Matthias Karajannis, Sloan Kettering’s chief of pediatric neuro-oncology, told us when we met to review the test results. That “something” was a drug called dabrafenib, sold by  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) under the brand name Tafinlar. It has helped keep a significant percentage of melanoma patients alive after five years when used with a second drug, Mekinist, a great improvement on older therapies.
Karajannis recommended that we use Tafinlar to treat Natan. While chemotherapy is the standard first treatment for low-grade gliomas that cannot be removed surgically, early evidence showed the new therapy could be much more effective.
In some cases, he said, “the tumors just melted away.”
MOVING TARGETS
Roche’s Herceptin, or trastuzumab, introduced in 1998, was the first so-called “targeted” cancer therapy, interfering with a growth-promoting protein found in about 20 percent of breast cancer patients. The drug has improved overall survival rates, particularly among women with earlier-stage cancers.
The next big breakthrough came in 2001, with the approval of Novartis’s Gleevec, or imatinib. Gleevec turned the deadly blood cancer known as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) into a long-term, manageable illness. For nearly all CML patients, the diseased blood cells feature a fusion of two genes that are normally separate. Gleevec blocks the activity of the fused genes and leaves healthy cells untouched — a huge advance on potentially lethal chemotherapy, which is toxic to both diseased and healthy cells.
With Gleevec’s success, the race was on to find other targeted therapies: For each potential new drug, that meant first identifying an aberrant gene that fueled a type of cancer and then devising a drug to counteract that aberration.
The reality is proving far more complex as researchers learn about the multiple influences at work in cancer cells. Many of the targeted therapies approved since Gleevec help only a small percentage of patients with any one type of cancer, and often only for a year or two before their tumor cells create new mutations to outrun the drug.
“There was this feeling we were going to conquer cancer with these approaches,” said Dr David Hyman, chief of early drug development at Sloan Kettering, who leads research into new targeted therapies. Now the medical community has recognized that cancer “is a series of rare diseases,” each with its unique biological mechanisms.
Yet these new drug discoveries can be life-changing for small groups of patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved more than 30 therapies that are prescribed based on genomic testing results. Most of these treatments have been introduced to the U.S. market since 2012.
“For many patients, unfortunately, we don’t find the ‘magic bullet,’ but it’s also an area that’s under a lot of development,” Karajannis said in an interview. “Just a few years ago, we had no treatment options.”
A study published in April in the journal JAMA Oncology estimated that 15 percent of the nearly 610,000 advanced cancer patients in the United States could be considered candidates for treatments informed by genomic sequencing, and that close to 7 percent would probably show some benefit.
Pfizer’s Xalkori and Roche’s Alecensa, for instance, target mutations that occur in about five percent of non-small cell lung cancer patients. In late November, newcomer Loxo Oncology received U.S. approval for Vitrakvi, a pill shown to shrink a wide variety of tumors driven by TRK fusion, a genetic anomaly found in fewer than one percent of all cancer patients.
Worldwide sales of such targeted treatments topped $28 billion last year, according to research firm GlobalData Plc.
Within the small community of children with low-grade gliomas, the potential for a targeted approach emerged nearly a decade ago, when two different BRAF abnormalities were identified in these tumors. The BRAF V600E mutation appears in about 10 percent of the 1,000 U.S. children diagnosed with low-grade gliomas each year. The research coincided with the development of Tafinlar, originally approved in 2013 for melanoma patients with the same BRAF mutation.
At a medical conference in Copenhagen in October 2016, just as we began to investigate Natan’s symptoms, Dr Mark Kieran, then director of the pediatric brain tumor program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children’s Hospital, presented data on 32 children treated with Tafinlar.
All the children’s tumors were positive for the BRAF V600E mutation, and nearly three-quarters of them saw their tumors shrink or stop growing on the drug. In two cases, the tumors disappeared, while 11 patients’ tumors shrank by more than half. The side effects were relatively minor – rash, fatigue, fever.
Less than a year later, we read about those results and wondered: Could that be enough proof to use on our child?
THE DECISION
My husband and I canvassed as many authoritative sources as possible. We specifically wanted to hear more about treating children with a diagnosis identical to Natan’s: a brainstem ganglioglioma with a BRAF V600E mutation. We reached out to several leading pediatric neuro-oncologists. Some had treated, or followed closely, a few dozen patients like Natan. Others had direct clinical experience with a handful, or none.
They told us that chemotherapy and the new drug were both viable options, but they differed in what they emphasized. Some seemed more supportive of chemotherapy. They cited data collected over decades showing that 25 percent to 40 percent of low-grade glioma patients saw their tumors stop growing after chemotherapy, which usually entailed a year or more of weekly infusions of carboplatin and vincristine. Even if the disease returned, a majority of the children survived into adulthood, the studies showed.
Chemotherapy’s potential side effects while a patient was in treatment were harsh, including neuropathy – nerve damage that can cause both debilitating pain and numbness – and the risk of bleeding or serious infection. But there was no cognitive or other long-term damage afterward.
The survival data lumped together many varieties of low-grade gliomas, including tumors cured by surgical removal. Brainstem gangliogliomas like Natan’s represented a very small subset. Newer research and clinical experience suggested that chemotherapy was far less effective in children with brainstem tumors, particularly those with a BRAF V600E mutation, leading to repeat treatments and worse survival rates.
“Do not trust this tumor!” said Dr Eric Bouffet, head of neuro-oncology at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto and a co-author on the Tafinlar study. Bouffet was familiar with many of the low-grade glioma patients in Canada. He and his colleagues continue to study their outcomes and track data from other medical centers around the world.
The BRAF mutation appears to make the tumors more aggressive, Bouffet told us during a consultation by phone. He told us about children, like Natan, whose brainstem tumors caused severe sleep apnea, a sudden stop in breathing. One little boy died in his sleep before he could receive therapy, Bouffet said.
Tafinlar’s side effects were much milder, the specialists said, and children using the medicine weren’t missing school like chemo patients. They could enjoy family vacations. But its long-term safety in children was — and still is — unknown and will take years to establish.
The medical literature was also scant. One of the earliest published case studies, from 2014, told the heartbreaking story of a 21-year-old whose brainstem ganglioglioma had returned after multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, leaving him in a wheelchair. His tumor shrank dramatically with Tafinlar, and he began to walk again, only to experience a fatal brain hemorrhage within weeks. His doctors questioned whether the rapid retreat of such a large tumor had contributed to the bleeding.
A second report showed a hopeful outcome for an infant with a massive low-grade glioma that shrank dramatically within two months of treatment, saving her life.
When we consulted with Kieran on Natan’s case, he recommended that we consider chemotherapy first, given its safety record, and if that failed, try Tafinlar. Prior treatment with chemotherapy had also been a requirement for enrolling children in Novartis’s clinical trial.
There was good reason for caution. Even when drugs are tested on hundreds of patients, safety problems can take years to identify. Now regulators are more willing to approve targeted therapies, particularly those treating advanced cancers, based on testing in smaller groups of patients. For someone with a few months to live and no other choices, the risk may be worth it. But was the trade-off appropriate with a slow-growing tumor?
We wanted to understand why Kieran, who led the clinical trial of Tafinlar, would not recommend using it from the start. In June, as soon as we thought Natan was up for the trip, we took him to Boston. After examining our son and nearly two hours of detailed discussion, Kieran gave a nod to the new therapy.
In a recent interview, he said that when we met, he had just begun discussing therapies like Novartis’s Tafinlar as a first-line treatment with other families, depending on the circumstances of the patient.
“The conversation I would have had with a family five years earlier would have been completely different,” he said. There is enough data now to consider a BRAF therapy appropriate right off the bat for patients like Natan, provided that families recognize that the picture could change as more data emerges, he said.
Not every patient has the luxury of waiting for that information: “You can’t always say, let’s just wait for three years and see how the data goes,” Kieran said. He recently left Dana-Farber to lead pediatric cancer therapy development at Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY).
Through all our research and our consultations with experts, one detail stood out: There was a chance that Tafinlar would actually shrink Natan’s tumor, an unlikely outcome with chemo. If it did, his symptoms could improve, assuming the nerves had not already been irreparably damaged. We needed to give him that chance.
THE TREATMENT
Two weeks later, a Sloan Kettering pharmacist showed me how to turn Tafinlar into a liquid for Natan to swallow safely. In our kitchen, I poured the capsule’s white powder into lemonade-flavored Kool-Aid, which Novartis says is the only drink that can dissolve this advanced medicine. I tried hard not to spill any. Our insurance covered nearly all of the cost, but I was still keenly aware of the expense of replacing just one pill, at nearly $100 retail.
In the first weeks, we kept a close watch for unusual reactions. One evening, Natan nearly passed out for no obvious reason. Another night, his temperature spiked to 105 degrees. It turned out to be a virus. For a few days, hives erupted all over his body. Again, a virus was suspected.
And we noticed something else. After little more than a week, Natan’s voice, nearly inaudible for months, was resonating loudly. At first we doubted that it was real. But Natan was so pleased that he could now hear himself, and talk over his brother, that he would yell and sing spontaneously.
Over the summer, testing confirmed that his hearing had returned. His gait grew steadier and stronger. With a twinkle in his eye, Natan would take an extra deep breath for the nurse and watch the monitor as his oxygen levels ticked up from 99 percent to 100. He was taken off the respiratory medications and the antibiotics that had been a mainstay for nearly a year.
Natan’s next MRI, in October 2017, showed a result far beyond what we had allowed ourselves to hope: Nearly all his detectable tumor was gone. “It looks almost like a normal brain,” Karajannis said.
My husband and I have asked ourselves whether we could have noticed the symptoms earlier, and whether treatment at that stage would have spared Natan from the worst of his illness. But given how quickly the science has developed, we now think the opposite is true in our case: Had we found the tumor earlier, Natan would have most likely endured chemotherapy infusions and their harsh effects every week for more than a year, with little real benefit.
The success of Natan’s treatment provides no guarantees. No one can say how long the medicine will work, whether he should take the drug indefinitely or stop, or whether doing either poses any risk.
The science is also moving on. Novartis is beginning to test Tafinlar plus Mekinist – the combination used to treat melanoma patients – versus chemotherapy in children whose low-grade gliomas exhibit BRAF V600E mutations to see if the combination works better, and longer. The drugmaker has also dropped the requirement that patients have prior treatment with chemotherapy to enroll. A new generation of BRAF therapies from companies including Array BioPharma and AstraZeneca are in clinical trials. Our hope is that if Tafinlar stops working for Natan at some point, a new therapy will be there to take its place.
It’s been more than a year since Natan started treatment. He began to run again, and jump, and swim, and climb. He’s now in first grade, excited to get to school each day and see his friends.
Natan now swallows his capsule with a sip of water, flashing a thumbs-up each time. He has traveled on vacation, even overseas, without mishap. On our last trip, he picked out a new T-shirt for himself. On the front, it says: “Never give up.”

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 01:28PM ET</span>","Rejecting suggestions of delay, UK PM May's team says Brexit vote will go ahead","By Kylie MacLellan and Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - Parliament's vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal will go ahead on Dec. 11, her office said on Thursday, rejecting suggestions from lawmakers that she should seek ways to avoid a defeat so big it might bring down the government.
May has been trying to win over critics of an agreement that would keep close economic ties with the European Union when Britain leaves in March, but her warnings that it's her deal, no deal or no Brexit have fallen flat so far.
With parliament mid-way through a five-day debate on the Brexit deal before the vote on Tuesday which will define Britain's departure from the EU and could determine May's future as leader, she looks set to lose the vote.
A defeat could open up a series of different outcomes to Britain's departure from the EU, the country's biggest shift in trade and foreign policy for more than 40 years, ranging from leaving without the deal to holding a second referendum on membership.
The Times newspaper reported that senior ministers were urging May to delay the vote for fear of a rout and several lawmakers said they suspected the government may try something to postpone what would be a game-changing defeat.
""The vote will take place on Tuesday as planned,"" May's spokeswoman said. The House of Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, also told parliament the vote would go ahead on Dec. 11.
Graham Brady, chair of the so-called 1922 committee which represents Conservative lawmakers, said he would welcome a delay to the vote to help May provide clarity over one of the most contentious parts of her plan - the Northern Irish backstop.
But any such delay would anger lawmakers. Both opponents and allies alike have spent days criticizing the agreement, especially the backstop, intended to ensure there is no return to a hard border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.
Brexit supporters and May's nominal allies in Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party say it could leave Britain forced to accept EU regulations indefinitely, or Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the United Kingdom.
EU supporters say Britain would become little more than a rule-taker, offering the worst of all worlds. 
Many want to see the government lose on Tuesday.
CHANGE THE DEAL
Some lawmakers have called on May to change the deal, and have suggested she could use an EU summit next week to try to win some concessions from officials to try to ease some of their concerns.
But EU negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday the deal was the best Britain will get, while British finance minister Philip Hammond said it was ""simply a delusion"" to think the agreement could be renegotiated if parliament rejects it.
May has toured the country and television studios to try to sell her deal, and on Thursday she used an interview on BBC radio to press on with her bid to persuade lawmakers to back her deal. 
""There are three options: one is to leave the European Union with a deal ... the other two are that we leave without a deal or that we have no Brexit at all,"" she said.
In one potential concession, May said that she recognized there were concerns among lawmakers about the Northern Irish backstop and that she was looking at whether parliament could be given a greater role in deciding whether to trigger it.
""I am talking to colleagues about how we can look at parliament having a role in going into that and, if you like, coming out of that,"" she said.
But some of her allies say she needs more time, with Brady telling Sky News: ""I don't think there's any point in ploughing ahead and losing the vote heavily.""
""If the prime minister asked for a few days I'm sure the House of Commons would be happy to give the prime minister a few more days. Most members of parliament are keen to make progress on this and to do so in a sensible way.""
But experts say delaying the vote may not be so easy.
""It is difficult for the government to avoid a vote without the agreement of the House (of Commons) now that the debate is up and running,"" said Hannah White, deputy director of the Institute for Government.

""But the whips (party enforcers) may be hunting in the procedural toolbox for ways to do this.""

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 01:04PM ET</span>",Farewell 'Gampy' - former U.S. president George H.W. Bush mourned by family,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush's family took center stage at his funeral in Houston on Thursday, with personal tributes, grandsons who knew him better as ""Gampy"" serving as honorary pallbearers and granddaughters reading from the Bible.
Bush, the 41st U.S. president, died last week in Texas at age 94. His remains were flown to Texas on Wednesday evening after a state funeral at Washington's National Cathedral attended by U.S. President Donald Trump, the four living former U.S. presidents and foreign leaders.
Thursday's service took place at St. Martin's Episcopal Church, where Bush worshipped for more than 50 years, with more than 1,000 mourners singing ""America the Beautiful."" 
George W. Bush, who followed his father to the White House, making just the second father-son pair of presidents in U.S. history, sat in the front pew near the flag-draped casket.
George P. Bush, son of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and one of the former president's 17 grandchildren, reminisced about fly fishing and sharing Blue Bell Creameries ice cream, a well-known Texas brand, as a child with the man he called ""Gampy.""
James Baker, who served as Bush's secretary of state and was a longtime friend, eulogized the former president as a peacemaker and ""a truly beautiful human being.""
""He was not considered a skilled speaker, but his deeds were quite eloquent and he demonstrated their eloquence by carving them into the hard granite of history,"" Baker said, summarizing Bush's accomplishments in foreign policy. 
Mourners laughed as Baker recalled how Bush would let him know a conversation was over: ""'Baker, if you're so smart, why am I president and you're not?'"" His voice cracking at moments, Baker said he was at his friend's deathbed last week.
Raised in an Episcopalian family in Massachusetts, Bush fused his preppy New England background with the more free-wheeling traits of his adoptive state of Texas, where he moved as a young man to work in the oil industry. 
This mix was reflected in some of Bush's musical choices for his funeral: the St. Martin's Parish Choir sang ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic,"" country music star Reba McEntire sang ""The Lord's Prayer,"" and the casket was carried out of the church at the end of the service to the thunderous rhythm of ""Onward Christian Soldiers.""
LOCOMOTIVE 4141
Following the service, Bush's remains were being taken by car and train about 80 miles (130 km) northwest to his presidential library in College Station, Texas. He will be interred there alongside the graves of his wife, Barbara Bush, who died in April, and their daughter Robin, who died of leukemia at the age of 3 in 1953. 
The train is a  Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP) locomotive, numbered 4141 and bearing the name ""George Bush 41"" on the side.
Bush, who narrowly escaped death as a naval aviator who was shot down by Japanese forces over the Pacific Ocean in World War Two, will be buried with military honors, including a flyover by 21 aircraft from the U.S. Navy.
Bush was president from 1989 to 1993, navigating the collapse of the Soviet Union and expelling former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's forces from oil-rich Kuwait.
He supported the passage of the American with Disabilities Act, a major civil rights law protecting disabled people from discrimination.
A patrician figure, Bush was voted out of office in part for failing to connect with ordinary Americans during an economic recession. He has also been criticized for supporting tough drug laws that led to the disproportionate incarceration of black people, as well as what activists call an insufficient response to the AIDS epidemic when he was in power during some of its deadliest years. 

But many tributes in recent days have focused on the former Republican president as a man of integrity and kindness who represented an earlier era of civility in American politics.

MILAN (Reuters) - Ukraine urged a gathering of dozens of foreign ministers on Thursday to increase sanctions against Russia, accusing Moscow of ramping up aggression against Kiev and sowing ""instability and insecurity"" across the West.
Speaking at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the foreign minister of Ukraine denounced the recent seizure of three Ukrainian naval vessels and their crew by Russian forces off Crimea, saying it represented another assault on international law.
""It is a matter of urgency to provide a prompt and consolidated international response to this act of aggression. Declarations are not enough. There must be action,"" Pavlo Klimkin told the annual gathering of OSCE ministers.
""We must raise the cost for Russia with comprehensive and tailored sanctions ... There can be no business as usual.""
The 57-nation OSCE, a security and human rights watchdog, has been rattled by the military and diplomatic stand-off between Russia and Ukraine, both of whom are member states.
But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov appeared untouched by the wall of criticism that faced him in Milan, thanking hosts Italy for creating a ""warm atmosphere"" at the meeting and pinning the blame for years of escalating tensions with Kiev on Ukraine and its allies.
""Striving for dominance, a small group of countries uses blackmail, pressure and threats,"" Lavrov told the gathering in a cavernous conference center in Italy's financial capital.
""Kiev (is) free from any punishment, shielded by its Western sponsors, who justify all its outrageous actions,"" he said.
FIGHTING
The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea, previously Ukrainian territory, after a pro-Russian leader was toppled in Kiev.
Fighting between Ukraine and Moscow-backed separatists in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine has killed more than 10,000 people. Most of the fighting ended with a 2015 ceasefire, but deadly exchanges of fire are still frequent.
The unresolved crisis returned to the fore last month when Russian patrol boats fired on and seized three Ukrainian vessels in the Black Sea and captured 23 sailors.
Moscow has accused Kiev of orchestrating the clash, saying the Ukrainian boats had entered Russian waters -- something Ukraine denies. Lavrov said on Thursday the move was a ""provocation"" and charged that Ukraine was seeking to sabotage any efforts to restore peace in the region.
But U.S., Canadian and European ministers dismissed his version of events and pledged their full support for Kiev, demanding the immediate release of the detained sailors.
""The Russian aggression was a miscalculation,"" said Wess Mitchell, the U.S. assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs.
""It has strengthened Western resolve to maintain sanctions against Russia and has galvanized the international community's efforts to ensure the respect of international law... It is time for Russia to rethink this approach,"" he said.
Canada's foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, who has family roots in Ukraine, voiced her support for the country in Ukrainian in one session.

""Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, its direct involvement in the conflict in the Donbass and now its illegal actions targeting Ukrainian sailors and vessels ... cannot and must not be accepted by the international community,"" she said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Ali Mohammad Rezaie does not celebrate his birthday because his Afghan parents never noted the date he was born. Yet he knows exactly when he arrived in Berlin to seek asylum: Oct 15, 2015.
That day changed his life.
""It wasn't a special day. I was tired and had been on the road for two months,"" he told Reuters of his overland journey through the Balkans.
Since then he's sung in a choir and done internships and temporary work at a nursing home, a bakery, hotels and restaurants. It is a far cry from the village of his birth 26 years ago.
More than 1 million people have come to Germany as migrants since 2015 under Chancellor Angela Merkel's open door policy. Since then, migration has divided Europe and helped propel a rise of far right parties. https://reut.rs/2QKaYwd 
Rezaie is among those doing their best to make Germany home, but integration is a journey with many highs and lows and it requires more than simply finding a job and learning German.
One woman who helped him is Chris Wachholz. They met at the choir and she later invited him to cook and practice German at the home she shares with her husband. A common interest in motorbikes deepened their friendship.
""Meeting this family was like being given an opportunity for my birthday. They are like my ... mother and father,"" he said.
But his immigration status prevents him taking further steps. His asylum application was rejected and he can only stay on as a 'tolerated person', which means he will not be deported but lacks secure status.
As a result, it is unlikely the temporary job he has found preparing food and cleaning at the Lufthansa lounge at Berlin's Tegel airport will be made permanent.
""I have an apartment here. I know many nice people. If they deport me I'll lose everything,"" he said. His fear is exacerbated because his Afghan ethnic group, the Hazaras, have faced attacks from militants in Afghanistan.
NEW FREEDOM
Many migrants say they are welcomed by Germans but others say they have experienced hostility. At the same time, a handful of militant attacks by migrants have enabled some politicians to argue they represent a threat to German society.
For some, though, the move to Germany has meant new freedom.
    Haidar Darwish was dancing in Schwuz, one of Berlin's oldest gay clubs, last year when Israeli student and drag queen Judy La Divana approached him and asked him to perform in her show. 
    He had never danced on stage in his homeland Syria, but La Divana convinced him to try.
    ""Now, many people ask me when and where my performances take place so they can come. Not to brag about it,"" he said.
    To supplement this income, he works at Brunos, a fashion and erotic shop that targets gay men.
    ""I found out that the store manager ... had come to my shows many times and we'd even danced together once,"" he said.
Sexual freedom was not the main reason he left Syria in 2016 - the country is at war, after all - but it represents a discovery he would not trade.
 
    CHURCH RESTORER
For others, the quest for freedom has been fraught.
Joseph Saliba was nine when his father sent him to work for a friend in Damascus who restored wood and mosaics. He slowly fell in love with the craft and later become a wood restorer. His business was booming when war broke out in 2011.
Scared of being drafted into the Syrian army, he decided to flee to Europe three years ago.
    His German language class went on a field trip to Berlin Cathedral and immediately he felt a connection. He offered to volunteer in restoration work at the church using tools he had made himself. A year later, the church offered him a paid job.
The church became a home but not Germany. Authorities refused to give him a refugee travel document and referred him to the Syrian embassy in Berlin. 
    Saliba said he did not want to enter the embassy of the government from which he had fled and he is suing the German government to get a refugee passport.

    ""I fled the lack of freedom to get freedom here,"" he said. ""I didn't find this freedom here.""

PARIS (Reuters) - The French government hinted at more concessions to 'yellow vest' protesters on Thursday in a bid to head off another wave of violence in the capital over living costs and regain the initiative after weeks of civil unrest.
With protesters calling on social media for ""Act IV"" - a fourth weekend of protest - Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said 65,000 police would be drafted in to stop a repeat of last Saturday's mayhem in Paris when rioters torched cars and looted shops off the famed Champs Elysees boulevard.
Philippe told the Senate he was open to new measures to help the lowest-paid workers. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he was prepared to accelerate tax cuts for households and that he wanted workers' bonuses to be tax-free.
""I am ready to look at all measures that will help raise the pay of those on the minimum wage without doing excessive damage to our competitiveness and businesses,"" Philippe told the parliament's upper house.
The rush of sweeteners to soothe public anger began with Philippe's climb-down on fuel tax hikes, the first major U-turn of Emmanuel Macron's presidency. 
Yet, five days after the worst rioting central Paris has seen since 1968, all signs are that the government has failed to quell the revolt.
A repeat of last Saturday's violence in Paris's city center -- which saw rioters deface the Arc de Triomphe with anti-Macron graffiti -- would deal a blow to the economy and raise doubts over the government's survival.
Philippe said the state would do all it could to maintain order. At least four first division football matches have been canceled and several museums including Paris' Grand Palais said they would close. 
ACT IV
An official in Macron's office said intelligence suggested some protesters would come to the capital with the aim to ""vandalize and kill"". There is concern about far-right, anarchist and anti-capitalist groups like the Black Bloc, which have piggybacked off the 'yellow vest' movement.
The Paris prefecture on Thursday told restaurants and luxury boutiques along the Champs Elysees boulevard to close on Saturday and asked local Paris authorities to prepare their districts for violence.
On Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and across social media, protesters are calling for ""Act IV"".
""France is fed up!! We will be there in bigger numbers, stronger, standing up for French people. Meet in Paris on Dec. 8,"" read one group's banner. 
Security sources said the government was considering using troops currently deployed on anti-terrorism patrols to protect public buildings.
The protests, named after the fluorescent safety jackets French motorists have to keep in their cars, erupted in November over the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes. Demonstrations swiftly grew into a broad, sometimes-violent rebellion against Macron, with no formal leader.
Their demands are diverse and include lower taxes, higher salaries, cheaper energy costs, better retirement provisions and even Macron's resignation.
STREET POLITICS
Reversing course on next year's fuel-tax hikes have left a gaping 4 billion euro hole in the government's 2019 budget which it is now searching for ways to plug. 
Citing unnamed sources, Les Echos business daily said the government as considering delaying corporate tax easing planned next year or putting off an increase in the minimum wage.
The unrest has exposed the deep-seated resentment among non-city dwellers that Macron is out-of-touch with the hard-pressed middle class and blue-collar workers. They see the 40-year-old former investment banker as closer to big business.
An Elabe poll on Thursday showed that only 23 percent of people trusted Macron, now lower than his predecessor Francois Hollande at the same period in his presidency. 
Trouble is also brewing elsewhere for Macron. Teenage students on Thursday blocked access to more than 200 high schools across the country, burnt garbage bins and setting alight a car in the western city of Nantes. Hundreds of students were arrested after clashes with riot police.
Meanwhile, farmers who have long complained that retailers are squeezing their margins and are furious over a delay to the planned rise in minimum food prices, and truckers are threatening to strike from Sunday.
Le Maire said France was no longer spared from the wave of populism that has swept across Europe.

""It's only that in France, it's not manifesting itself at the ballot box, but in the streets.""

Assange has claimed that Ecuador is seeking to end his asylum and hand him over to the United States, where prosecutors are preparing to pursue a criminal case against him. Wikileaks has released thousands of classified U.S. military documents, among other disclosures.
""There is a path for Mr. Assange to take the decision to exit into near freedom,"" Moreno said in a local radio interview.
He noted that Assange still faces jail time in the United Kingdom for violating bail terms when he sought asylum to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where authorities wanted to question him as part of a sexual assault investigation. 
The investigation was later dropped, but Great Britain says he will be arrested if leaves the embassy. 
Moreno said the sentence for skipping bail would be ""not long."" The UK has told Ecuador that his jail time would not exceed six months and that he would not face extradition if he left the embassy.
Assange insists British authorities will hand him over to the United States.

""I do not like the presence of Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorean embassy, but we have been respectful of his human rights and with that respect in mind we think that six years is too long for someone to remain nearly incarcerated in an embassy,"" Moreno said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's toxic air claimed 1.24 million lives in 2017, or 12.5 percent of total deaths recorded that year, according to a study published in Lancet Planetary Health on Thursday.
More than 51 percent of the people who died because of air pollution were younger than 70, said the study conducted by academics and scientists from various institutions in India and around the world.
It was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Indian government and the Indian Council of Medical Research.
Of the total, about 670,000 died from air pollution in the wider environment and 480,000 from household pollution related to the use of solid cooking fuels.
The Indian capital, New Delhi, was most exposed to the tiny particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, that can reach deep into the lungs and cause major health problems, the study concluded. Some northern states closer to Delhi were almost as bad.
Average life expectancy in India in 2017 would have been higher by 1.7 years if air quality was at healthy levels, the report said. 
That isn't as gloomy as some other recent studies. For example the University of Chicago's report released last month said prolonged exposure to pollution reduces the life expectancy of an Indian citizen by over 4 years. (https:// Still, the new study shows India has a higher proportion of global health loss due to air pollution - at 26.2 percent of the world's total when measured in deaths and disability - than its 18.1 percent share of the world's population. ""The findings of this study suggest that the impact of air pollution on deaths and life expectancy in India might be lower than previously estimated but this impact is still quite substantial,"" the study said. Delhi's air was ""very poor"" on Thursday, according to a federal pollution agency. The city's quality of air has swung between ""severe"" to ""hazardous"" levels multiple times in the past two months. The city residents' apparent lack of concern about the toxic air - whether through ignorance, apathy or the impact of poverty - gives federal and local politicians the cover they need for failing to vigorously address the problem, pollution activists, social scientists and political experts have said.  
Earlier this year, the World Health Organization said India was home to the world's 14 most polluted cities.  SOURCE: https:// The Lancet Planetary Health, online December 5, 2018.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 11:57AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Clues in Marriott hack implicate China - sources,"By Christopher Bing
(Reuters) - Hackers behind a massive breach at hotel group Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) left clues suggesting they were working for a Chinese government intelligence gathering operation, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Marriott said last week that a hack that began four years ago had exposed the records of up to 500 million customers in its Starwood hotels reservation system.
Private investigators looking into the breach have found hacking tools, techniques and procedures previously used in attacks attributed to Chinese hackers, said three sources who were not authorized to discuss the company's private probe into the attack. 
That suggests that Chinese hackers may have been behind a campaign designed to collect information for use in Beijing's espionage efforts and not for financial gain, two of the sources said. 
While China has emerged as the lead suspect in the case, the sources cautioned it was possible somebody else was behind the hack because other parties had access to the same hacking tools, some of which have previously been posted online. 
Identifying the culprit is further complicated by the fact that investigators suspect multiple hacking groups may have simultaneously been inside Starwood's computer networks since 2014, said one of the sources. 
If investigators confirm that China was behind the attack, that could complicate already tense relations between Washington and Beijing, amid an ongoing tariff dispute and U.S. accusations of Chinese espionage and the theft of trade secrets.
""China firmly opposes all forms of cyber attack and cracks down on them in accordance with law,"" Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang told Reuters.""If offered evidence, the relevant Chinese departments will carry out investigations according to law."" 
Marriott spokeswoman Connie Kim declined to comment, saying ""We've got nothing to share,"" when asked about involvement of Chinese hackers.
Marriott disclosed the hack on Friday, prompting U.S. and UK regulators to quickly launch probes into the case. 
Compromised customer data included names, passport numbers, addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and email addresses. A small percentage of accounts included scrambled payment card data, said Kim.
Marriott acquired Starwood in 2016 for $13.6 billion, including the Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels, St. Regis, Aloft, Le Meridien, Tribute, Four Points and Luxury Collection hotel brands, forming the world's largest hotel operator.
The hack began in 2014, shortly after an attack on the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compromised sensitive data on tens of millions of employees, including application forms for security clearances.
White House National Security advisor John Bolton recently told reporters he believed Beijing was behind the OPM hack, a claim first made by the United States in 2015. 
Beijing has strongly denied those charges and also refuted charges that it was behind other hacks.
Former senior FBI official Robert Anderson told Reuters that the Marriott case looked similar to hacks that the Chinese government was conducting in 2014 as part of its intelligence operations. 
""Think of the depth of knowledge they could now have about travel habits or who happened to be in a certain city at the same time as another person,"" said Anderson, who served as FBI executive assistant director until 2015. 
""It fits with how the Chinese intelligence services think about things. It's all very long range,"" said Anderson, who was not involved in investigating the Marriott case and is now a principal with Chertoff Group. 
Michael Sussmann, a former senior Department of Justice official for its computer crimes section, said that the long duration of the campaign was an indicator that the hackers were seeking data for intelligence and not information to use in cyber crime schemes. 
""One clue pointing to a government attacker is the amount of time the intruders were working quietly inside the network,"" he said. ""Patience is a virtue for spies, but not for criminals trying to steal credit card numbers.""

FBI representatives could not immediately be reached for comment on the evidence linking the attack to China. A spokesperson said on Friday that the agency was looking into the attack, but declined to elaborate.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 11:55AM ET</span>",Deposed aide to Saudi crown prince accused of role in female activists' torture,"LONDON (Reuters) - A top aide to Saudi Arabia's crown prince, fired for his role in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, personally oversaw the torture of at least one detained female activist earlier this year, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Saud al-Qahtani was a royal adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman until October, when he was sacked and then sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury over the Washington Post columnist's murder.
Now three sources, briefed on the activists' treatment, say a group of men subjected this woman and at least three others to sexual harassment, electrocution and flogging between May and August at an unofficial holding facility in Jeddah.
They described the group of about six men as distinct from the regular interrogators the women saw and said they belonged to the Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity, Programming and Drones, which Qahtani headed at the time, or to state security.
Qahtani was present when at least one of the women was tortured, two of the sources said.
Reuters has been unable to reach Qahtani since he was sacked in October.
A Saudi official said the allegations of mistreatment and torture of the female detainees were ""false ... and have no connection to the truth.""
""The detainees were detained based on accusations related to harming the security and stability of the kingdom,"" the official said in response to questions from Reuters. 
Their legal rights were being respected and they were receiving medical and social care, family visits and had the right to an attorney, the official said.
The women are among more than a dozen prominent activists arrested since May amid a broader crackdown targeting clerics and intellectuals. Eleven women are still being held, activists say, including the four alleged to have been tortured.
The allegations come as Riyadh tries to get past the Oct. 2 killing of Khashoggi, a long-time royal insider who became a critic of Prince Mohammed and went into self-exile in the United States last year.
Khashoggi was killed inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate, damaging the crown prince's reputation and opening Riyadh up to the threat of sanctions.
IN THE ROOM
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said last month at least three of the activists -- most of whom had agitated for the right to drive and an end to a male guardianship system -- were tortured. They did not report Qahtani's involvement.
The sources, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals, told Reuters that Qahtani was in the room on several occasions when one of the four detained activists was subjected to kissing, groping and electrocution. He made threats of rape and murder to the woman, the sources said.
At least two other detainees endured sexual insults, flogging and electric shocks that turned one of the women's fingers blue, the sources said. Captors also made another woman kiss a male detainee while they watched, one of the sources said.
Reuters could not determine whether Qahtani was in the room during the episodes with those three other detainees, but the sources said all of the women's tormentors were from ""Saud's group"".
A third source said Qahtani addressed several of these women in May when they were initially transferred to Jeddah from Riyadh, telling them the penalty for treason was 20 years in prison or the death penalty.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer said on Thursday his government will leave a primary budget deficit of less than 130 billion reais ($33.3 billion) when he hands over the reins to President-elect Jair Bolsonaro on Jan. 1.
Temer told reporters that Brazil could take up to 10 years to balance its federal budget. He urged Congress to pass his proposal for a minimum retirement age to advance the pension reform that his successor will inevitably have to tackle.
Due to an increase in the population’s age and the number of retirees, Brazil’s generous pension system is becoming a bigger chunk of the country’s budget deficit. Investors and credit rating agencies are watching how the matter is dealt with because it is adding to a mounting public debt.
The deficit could end this year some 20 billion to 25 billion reais below target, according to Temer's estimates.
Temer said he expects Bolsonaro's incoming government to follow its fiscal austerity policies and maintain a spending ceiling, which was his main achievement toward putting Brazil's accounts in order during his two-and-a-half years in office.
""I think the Bolsonaro government will succeed,"" he said, noting that the president-elect, who was elected in October without the backing of Brazil's traditional parties, has begun to reach out to congressional caucuses to back his agenda.
Temer took issue with Bolsonaro's anti-globalist foreign policy views, such as his threat to follow U.S. President Donald Trump's example and pull Brazil out of the Paris Climate Agreement.
That move, along with a plan to switch the embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, has met with resistance from Brazil's powerful agribusiness sector that is concerned with losing markets in Europe and in Arab nations.
""I believe the Paris Agreement is very important. I think the elected government is gradually coming around to understanding that,"" Temer said.
At age 78, Temer plans to retire from politics and return to his law practice. He will also likely need to defend himself from accusations in several graft cases once he loses his presidential immunity.
""I am not in the least worried about the accusations. Any bright legal mind can see that they are groundless,"" he said.
The former vice president, Temer took over in 2016 from Workers Party President Dilma Rousseff when she was removed from office in a controversial impeachment. He set about restoring political stability and pulling Latin America's largest economy out of its worst recession.

""I have no regrets. I did what I had to do. I did what I thought was best for the country,"" Temer said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The traditional nativity scene in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) won't be so traditional this year. For the first time, it is made of sand - 720 tons of it.
For the past two weeks, Rich Varano, a professional sand artist, has been guiding three sculptors from the Netherlands, Russia and the Czech Republic, to craft the work, which measures about 5.5 meters high by 16 meters wide (18 feet high by 52 feet wide).
Varano, 60, the artistic director of the massive work, doesn't mind if you call him ""Mr Sandman"". Sand is his life and love. The American from Florida divides his time between the United States and Italy.
""It's very special to be making one here in a place with so much history, so much culture, so much art and in the shadow of such masters,"" he told Reuters on Thursday as his team worked quietly to finish ahead of Friday's unveiling to the public.
""It is an incredibly humbling experience to be here,"" he said.
Heavy trucks brought the sand, of a type particularly suited for sculpting, from the northern Italian seaside city of Jesolo, near Venice, in mid-November.
It was compacted into a large rectangle and the artists started sculpting away from the top down with tools including sticks, trowels, and even dental utensils for the finer parts.
""What separates us professionals and the average person playing on the beach is that we understand how to make sand stick together well,"" the white-bearded Varano said, wearing a yellow hard hat.
The scene consists of Joseph, Mary, the infant Jesus, angels, shepherds, animals and the three wise men, kings the Bible says followed a star in the east that led them to Bethlehem.
Varano said beach sand is not suitable, partly because it is not very compactable. The sand is taken from more inland areas and is similar to river sand. 
A large overhead canopy will protect the scene from any heavy rain and plastic curtains will be lowered in case of storms or strong winds before it is dismantled in January.
""It's an ephemeral art in the sense that it is not intended to last forever,"" he said, ""even though we could make it last indefinitely if we wanted to"".
Varano said he expected some criticism from conservatives who think nativity scenes should be made up of traditional statues.
""I would not be surprised if there were some people who had concerns, but there are so many more who will enjoy it and that makes me happy,"" he said.

Once the Christmas season is over, it will be returned there and used for other sand sculptures.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union governments that refuse to host refugees could instead pay to be excused from the bloc's system of sharing out migrants, France and Germany proposed on Thursday as they sought to end a long-running EU feud over migration.
According to a document circulated to EU interior ministers in Brussels and seen by Reuters, the plan would still make hosting migrants an obligation for the bloc's governments, but exceptions could be made if countries made ""alternative measures of solidarity"".
That EU language is code for paying into the EU budget or paying towards development projects in Africa, diplomats said, and seeks to end divisions between EU states such as Germany, which are willing to take in refugees, and eastern countries such as Hungary, who reject granting asylum.
Mediterranean arrivals of migrants and refugees are below 100,000 people so far this year, according to U.N. data, but the 2015 influx that caught the bloc unprepared has hardened southern and eastern EU governments against migration.
The document said the European Union would need a proper mechanism to avoid a situation in which all EU governments opted to pay their way out of any hosting responsibilities and would set an eight-year period for any arrangements.
European Parliament President Antonio Tajani said in October more development money for Africa could be an acceptable compromise for eastern, formerly communist EU states that are refusing entry to refugees, mainly from Muslim countries.
Germany, France and the Netherlands had previously demanded solidarity from all EU states, but now appear more open to others buying out of the refugee distribution scheme, which was first set out by the European Commission in a series of proposals 2015.

Any political agreement is likely to take time, diplomats said, not least because Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and the eurosceptic Italian government have built their political image on anti-immigration policies.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's electoral commission has asked the government for $28.7 million, saying that without funding to boost its ""zero"" budget it cannot make plans to prepare for a vote on a new constitution and later elections. 
Western powers and the United Nations hope Libya will hold a national election by June after a referendum on a constitutional framework to chart a way out of a conflict stemming from the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
A French plan, backed by the United Nations, had initially called for a presidential and parliamentary vote on Dec 10. 
But weeks of fighting in the capital Tripoli between competing groups and almost no progress between the North African country's two rival parliaments made that impossible. 
Now Emad al-Sayah, chairman of the High National Elections Commission (HNEC), said on Thursday his group was unable to even plan for the constitutional vote due to a lack of funding.
""The budget of the commission is zero, it's red,"" he told reporters. ""We have financial commitments of half a million (dinars).""
He said the commission had asked the Tripoli-based government to get 40 million dinars ($28.7 million) to start the process for a constitutional vote.
It was not immediately possible to reach the internationally backed government, based in Tripoli, for comment. 
Sayah said that from a technical point of view, such a constitutional referendum could have been held as early as February, if a budget had been allocated, but said technical equipment and ballot materials still needed to be imported.
So far there is no sign when any vote will be scheduled and details remain opaque.
A draft constitution has been drawn up to be put to a referendum, but it is not clear how that would work ahead of a national conference planned for early 2019 to discuss possible election protocol.
The internationally recognized parliament, the House of Representatives, last week passed a law billed as first step for the constitutional vote and elections, but the details remain unclear. The United Nations had previously accused the assembly of obstructing the vote.
Libya has two governments, the U.N.-backed one in Tripoli and a rival version in the east allied to Khalifa Haftar, whose forces control the east.
Sayah also said better security was needed to conduct polls.
In May, Islamic state suicide attackers stormed the commission's Tripoli headquarters, killing at least 12 of its staff, and setting the building on fire.

An investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found that Johnson failed to register nine payments, totaling 52,722.80 pounds, within the 28-day deadline.
In her report, the commissioner, Kathryn Stone, concluded that Johnson was in breach of the rules of the House of Commons, parliament's lower chamber, for a failure to fulfil his responsibilities, saying it was neither ""inadvertent"" nor ""minor"". 
Since resigning as foreign secretary in July over Theresa May's Brexit plans, Johnson has been writing a weekly column for Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper, on a yearly salary of 275,000 pounds. 
Most of the payments that were declared late came from royalties from books he has written. 
Johnson, regularly touted as a possible contender to replace May as Conservative Party leader should she fall over Brexit, told lawmakers on Thursday he was very sorry and was grateful it had been accepted that he had not intended to mislead parliament.
""I fully accept that the delay was a breach of the House's rules,"" he said. ""I therefore offer the House a full and unreserved apology."" 

In his response to the commissioner's investigation, he said he had now employed a dedicated member of staff to handle his declarations, saying the late payments were due to delays in processing his financial statements. He confirmed the nine payments had now been declared.

The incident occurred around 2 a.m. local time in Japan (1700 GMT Wednesday) about 320 km (200 miles) off the Japanese coast.
The incident adds to a growing list of U.S. military aviation accidents around the world in recent years, prompting hearings in Congress to address the rise.
U.S. military accidents are a sensitive topic in Japan, particularly for residents of the southern prefecture of Okinawa, home to the bulk of the U.S. presence in the country. A series of emergency landings and parts falling from U.S. military aircraft have highlighted safety concerns.
People in a Tokyo hospital waiting room fell silent as news of the crash came on television, with one woman whispering to another, ""This is so scary.""
""The incident is regrettable, but our focus at the moment is on search and rescue,"" Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya told a news conference. ""Japan will respond appropriately once the details of the incident are uncovered.""

A U.S. Navy P-8A patrol and surveillance aircraft was helping in search and rescue efforts along with Japanese authorities, the Marine Corps said, adding that the incident was under investigation.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Francis to become first pope to visit Arabian peninsula,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The first visit by a pope to the Arabian peninsula will take place in February when Francis travels to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, the Vatican said on Thursday.
The Feb. 3-5 trip, Francis' latest to a predominantly Muslim nation, will be centered around the theme of inter-religious peace.
The Vatican said the pope had accepted an invitation from Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and the tiny Catholic community there. He will attend an inter-faith meeting.
In a statement, Bishop Paul Hinder, head of the Roman Catholic Arabian Vicariate of Southern (NYSE:SO) Arabia, thanked the UAE government for having given permission for the pope ""to celebrate a Mass at a public venue in Abu Dhabi"".
The freedom to practice Christianity — or any religion other than Islam — is not always a given in the Gulf and varies from country to country. 
In the UAE and Kuwait, Christians may worship in churches and other places with special licenses. Saudi Arabia, home to Islam’s holiest sites, bans the practice of other religions. 
Hinder, whose jurisdiction includes the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Yemen, said the Mass would be held on Feb. 5.
Francis has visited Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Bangladesh, Azerbaijan and the Palestinian territories and used those trips to call for inter-religious dialogue and to condemn the notion of violence in the name of God.
""The theme of the visit is 'Make Me a Channel of Your Peace' – and that's the pope’s intention in going to the United Arab Emirates. How all people of goodwill can work for peace will be a major topic on this trip,"" Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said.
The theme is taken from the opening words of the Prayer of Peace of Francis of Assisi, the saint whose name the pope took when he was elected in 2013.
""This visit, like the one to Egypt, (2017) shows the fundamental importance the Holy Father gives to inter-religious dialogue. Pope Francis visiting the Arab world is a perfect example of the culture of encounter,"" Burke said.

Crown Prince Mohammed said in a tweet that the pope ""is a symbol of peace, tolerance and the promotion of brotherhood. We look forward to a historic visit, through which we will seek dialogue on the peaceful coexistence among peoples.""

Protesters chanted ""Hands off youth!"" and ""No fascists in schools!"" as they marched to parliament in a tribute to 15-year old Alexandros Grigoropoulos who was shot dead in 2008.
A group of hooded youths earlier broke away from the march and hurled stones at police who used teargas to disperse them. Two protesters were temporarily detained, a police official said. One of them was injured during the brief unrest.
Another march was planned in the evening. 
Police deployed more than 2,000 officers in central Athens. Some in full riot gear formed protective cordons outside parliament and hotels in the city, while a helicopter hovered over the central Syntagma Square (NYSE:SQ). 
On the night of Dec. 6, 2008, hours after Grigoropoulos was shot, thousands took to the streets of Athens, torching cars and smashing window shops and looting.

The riots, which were also fueled by anger over unemployment and economic hardship in a prelude to Greece's debt crisis, lasted for weeks.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>","No leader, lots of anger: can France's 'yellow vests' become a political force?","By Michel Rose and Luke Baker
PARIS (Reuters) - It began as a home-spun Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) campaign against French fuel tax increases. But in a few weeks it has spiraled into a movement powerful enough to force Emmanuel Macron into the biggest U-turn of his presidency. 
Yet the ""yellow-vest"" movement -- named for the fluorescent jackets carried by French motorists -- remains an amorphous, hard-to-define group with a rapidly shifting agenda.
It has no leader. It named eight spokespeople, some of whom disagreed with each other and one of whom was promptly sacked. Members are broadly opposed to decision-making authority.
One of its originators, a 51-year-old accordionist from Brittany called Jacline Mouraud who also works in hypnotherapy and makes YouTube videos, received death threats after suggesting the movement should talk to the government. 
Anyone who has a ""gilet jaune"" -- and most people in France suddenly seem to -- can put it on and become part of the movement, meaning it brings together people of hugely different ages, social classes, occupations and views. 
This is its strength but also its weakness. 
The government does not know who to engage with, even though the movement has drawn hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets, closing roads and fuel depots, and spurring riots and violence in the capital Paris on successive weekends.
Since Macron gave in to the movement's main demand on Wednesday by scrapping a fuel-tax increase set for January, the ""yellow vests"" have also been trying to agree on other issues to fight for -- from boosting household incomes to reinstating a wealth tax or ousting Macron.
""He betrayed us. He was elected promising to blow out political parties, no left, no right, to reconnect political power with the people,"" Christophe Chalençon, a blacksmith from Provence in southern France who has become one of the more recognizable faces of the movement, told Reuters. 
""He's done the opposite. We're only the mirror of what he had proposed, what he sold to us. We need a new representative body,"" said Chalencon, who has been criticized for postings on social media that some have seen as anti-Muslim.
WE ARE YELLOW
In an age of a populist backlash against globalization in the Western world, the ""yellow vest"" movement shares many features with other populist forces, such as the Occupy movement in the United States and Italy's Five-Star, which now governs.
An opinion poll published by the Elabe Institute on Wednesday showed that in the presidential election in May 2017, many in the movement voted for candidates on the far-left or far-right, although many also didn't vote.
They mostly have a high-school diploma or a lower level of education and live in tight financial circumstances, often in rural or outer-urban areas, where depending on a car to get to work or go to the shops is essential, and increasingly costly.
There is a high level of solidarity among volunteers who mount roadblocks, share food and post pictures together online. Polls show they still have the backing of about 70 percent of the population, despite the violence in Paris which the government blamed on ""extremist"" groups"".
Some government officials play down the prospects of such a diverse movement uniting as a political force.
""For the time being, no, they're having trouble just structuring themselves,"" a government source said.
But, with elections to the European parliament coming up next May, others warn against complacency, especially as Macron was taken off guard by the protest. Some members of Macron's team say privately they did not expect the planned rise in fuel prices to be more politically explosive than other reforms.
Macron himself rose to power barely a year after creating his own movement, En Marche, in 2016 on a promise to be ""neither of the left nor the right"" and to introduce a new style of politics. His campaign book was called ""Revolution"". 
The ""yellow vests"" do not have the same education or work background as Macron -- he had experience in government as a former economy minister. Yet ironically, they are using some of the same techniques as he used on social media and echoing some of the anti-establishment rhetoric.
""The yellow vests are a political movement, we need to stop feeling sorry for them,"" Bruno Bonnell, a lawmaker in En Marche (On The Move) and an early follower of Macron, said.
""In three weeks, it's transformed itself into the fiery core of a strong populist movement,"" he said. ""It reminds me of the start of En Marche. They're our future opposition."" 
TO THE VOTE!
Macron enjoyed high ratings at the start of his presidency and managed to ram through changes to France's labour code.
But his brash style alienated some voters and changes to a tax to reduce the burden on the wealthy earned him the label ""president of the rich"". His ratings now hover in the low-20s and he is battling to keep his reform agenda on track.
His biggest threat now is from a popular national uprising that, while not associated with a political party, has elements that sympathize with the far-right and far-left and want a radical shake-up -- the sort of new politics U.S. President Donald Trump and his former strategist Steve Bannon advocate.
""We can already see they (""yellow vests"") have huge appeal but this is because they are apolitical and can genuinely say they have nothing to do with political parties,"" said Charles Lichfield, Europe analyst at Eurasia Group risk consultancy.
""For the 'gilets jaunes' to become a political force, they need to accept the notion of leadership and get over the fact that their chosen leaders will need to balance between various contradictory demands.""
France, a nation built on revolution, is not new to populist uprisings. In the 1950s, a shopkeeper called Pierre Poujade spurred anti-tax, anti-elite protests which eventually secured 52 seats in the French parliament in the 1956 election.
Although Poujadism, as it became known, eventually faded from view when war-hero Charles de Gaulle returned to power, it left a lasting legacy. The youngest member of its deputies was Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the far-right National Front.
One of the ""yellow vests"", Andre Lannee, has launched Facebook pages for protesters to elect two representatives per region. Another, Jean-Francois Bernaba, has said he is working on a list of candidates for the European Parliament elections, in which French voters traditionally back more populist parties. 
Asked to assess the ""yellow vests'"" chances of contesting the European Parliament elections, which are based on a system of proportional representation, Lichfield said they would first have to organize quickly and find a charismatic leader.

""They will understand that a proportional ballot gives them their best chance of making a splash,"" he said.

1677,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 09:35AM ET</span>",Indian court expected to reopen Vedanta copper smelter but appeal likely: sources,"By Sudarshan Varadhan
THOOTHUKUDI, India (Reuters) - An Indian court is expected on Friday to follow an experts' panel recommendation and order the reopening of a copper smelter closed after 13 people died when police fired on environmental protesters in May, two sources familiar with the matter said.
However, the Vedanta Ltd plant in southern India is unlikely to resume production anytime soon because the Tamil Nadu state government will likely appeal to India's Supreme Court, the sources said.
State authorities permanently shut down the smelter after police fired on protesters calling for the closure of the plant in the southern town of Thoothukudi in May.
But a panel of experts set up by the National Green Tribunal, the environmental court, said last week authorities in Tamil Nadu state had failed to comply with procedures before shutting down the smelter.
The panel also said the grounds for a permanent closure were not sufficiently grievous. Authorities had said the plant was polluting the environment. 
""The court is likely to give a verdict based on the recommendations of the committee. The state will, however, definitely appeal if the verdict is in favor of the company,"" one source said. 
Vedanta said it could not comment on the case because the matter is sub judice. 
The office of the chief minister for Tamil Nadu did not respond to an email seeking comment.
NO WARNING
Multiple witnesses told Reuters that police gave no warning before firing with live ammunition on the protesters on May 22.
The protesters threw stones and set vehicles on fire as they marched to the district government offices in Thoothukudi, formerly known as Tuticorin, to press for the plant's closure.
The protesters said the smelter had polluted ground water and the air around the plant.
Ten people were killed on the day of the protest and another three later died of their wounds, making it one of India's deadliest environmental protests.
It was not clear if a court order to reopen the smelter would trigger more protests.
Vedanta Ltd is part of the oil-to-metals conglomerateVedanta Resources controlled by Indian businessman Anil Agarwal.
The smelter is one of the two largest in India and resuming production is crucial to the group as it faces rising costs and the impact of a slowing economy on demand for metals and energy.

Vedanta said on Thursday its copper business accounted for five percent of the company's overall profit before the smelter was shutdown. The company expected a loss of $100 million if the copper smelter remained closed for a year, Chairman Anil Agarwal told television channel ET Now in July.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's army on Thursday threw its support behind the latest U.S. efforts for a political settlement with the Afghan Taliban to end a 17-year-old war, urging Washington to leave Kabul as a friend of the region rather than a ""failure"". 
The comments by Pakistan's army spokesman, Major-General Asif Ghafoor, came just after the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, concluded a visit to the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. 
""As much as we can, we will facilitate,"" Ghafoor told a news conference in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, replying to a query about what Pakistan could do to help the United States negotiate a political settlement with the Taliban.
""What the U.S. is expecting from us, and the foreign office is cooperating with, is that somehow they could have these negotiations with them (Taliban).""
Ghafoor added, ""We wish that (the) U.S. leaves Afghanistan as friend of the region, not as a failure."" He did not elaborate.
Khalilzad, an Afghan-born veteran U.S. diplomat who served as George W. Bush's ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the United Nations, was named by the Trump administration three months ago as a special envoy to negotiate peace.
His visit to Pakistan followed a request from U.S. President Donald Trump to Prime Minister Imran Khan seeking assistance in moving forward peace talks. The overture to Khan came after an exchange of barbed tweets between the leaders last month.
Washington has long been pushing Islamabad to lean on Taliban leaders, who it says are based in Pakistan, to bring them to the negotiating table.
It often accuses the south Asian nation of covertly sheltering Taliban leaders, an accusation Islamabad vehemently denies.
Khan, who enjoys the support of Pakistan's powerful army, which dominates foreign policy, met Khalilzad earlier in the week and also pledged to support a peace process with the Taliban.
The United States, which had more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan at its peak during the first term of former President Barack Obama, withdrew most of them in 2014 but still keeps around 14,000 there.

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>",Yemen warring sides agree at start of talks to free thousands of prisoners,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Yemen's warring sides agreed to free thousands of prisoners on Thursday, in what a U.N. mediator called a hopeful start to the first peace talks in years to end a war that has pushed millions of people on the verge of starvation.
U.N. mediator Martin Griffiths told a news conference in a renovated castle outside Stockholm that just getting the warring sides to the table was an important milestone.
The war has killed tens of thousands of people and spawned what the United Nations calls the world's direst humanitarian crisis, since a Saudi-led Arab coalition intervened in 2015 to restore a government ousted by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement.
No talks have been held since 2016, and the last attempt in Geneva in September failed when the Houthis did not attend.
Griffiths said the prisoner swap agreed at the start of the talks would reunite thousands of families. The International Committee of the Red Cross said at least 5,000 would be freed. 
The war, widely seen across the region as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been stalemated for years, threatening supply lines to feed nearly 30 million inhabitants.
The Houthis control the capital Sanaa and most populated areas, while the ousted government based in the southern city of Aden has struggled to advance despite the aid of Arab states.
Humanitarian suffering in one of the world's poorest countries has added to pressure on the parties to end the conflict, with faith in the Saudi-led war effort flagging among Western allies that arm and support the coalition.
Outrage over the Oct. 2 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate has also undermined Western support for Riyadh's regional activities.
Diplomats are expected to shuttle between the warring parties to discuss other confidence-building steps and the formation of a transitional governing body, a U.N. source said.
The Swedish hosts called for constructive talks to end what Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom called a ""catastrophe"". Griffiths, flanked by the two delegations, told them not to waiver.
HODEIDAH ""COMPLEX""
Griffiths wants a deal on reopening Sanaa airport, shoring up the central bank and securing a truce in Hodeidah, the country's main port, held by the Houthis and a focus of the war after the coalition launched a campaign to capture it this year.
This could lead to a wider ceasefire to halt coalition air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians, and Houthi missile attacks on Saudi cities.
A U.N. source said that the two sides were still far from agreement on the three issues, especially on who should manage Hodeidah port and whether the Houthis should entirely quit the city. ""Hodeidah is very complex,"" the source said.
The United Nations is trying to avert a full-scale assault on Hodeidah, the entry point for most of Yemen's commercial goods and aid. Both sides have reinforced positions in the Red Sea city in sporadic battles after a de-escalation last month.
The other main route in and out of Houthi territory is the Sanaa airport, but access is restricted by the Saudi-led coalition which controls the air space.
The head of the Houthis' Supreme Revolutionary Committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, said in a Twitter post that if no deal is reached to re-open the airport, the movement could close it on the ground to all traffic including U.N. flights.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has exempted a mammoth pro-government media group from scrutiny by the national competition watchdog, according to a decree published late on Wednesday.
Critics say the rightwing nationalist leader is presiding over a gradual disappearance of independent media in the ex-Communist satellite. Dozens of newspapers and broadcasters critical of Orban have changed hands in recent years, resulting in less public dissent.
The Central European Press and Media Foundation conglomerate, created this year by Orban loyalists, runs an immense media portfolio received from several pro-government businessmen as charitable donations.
It has more than 400 outlets, from Echo TV and Hir TV to national daily Magyar Idok and all regional newspapers.
The decree, published in the Official Gazette and signed by Orban, said exempting the group from regulatory scrutiny was in the public interest. But the Association of Hungarian Journalists reacted on Thursday by vowing to appeal against the holding's creation at the Constitutional Court.
Gabor Polyak, analyst at Hungarian media think tank Mertek, said competition was being distorted by the conglomerate.
""The fact the government opted for this political solution is an open admission this would not have passed the provisions of either the media law or the competition law,"" he said.
""This will create a scale of media concentration unthinkable in the Western world.""
Hungary's government has denied undermining press freedom.
Its communications office KTK justified the decree as enabling the group to help ensure the survival of print media. 
The group's head Gabor Liszkay, a close Orban confidante, said he could not comment on the transactions to create the group, but dismissed accusations of bias.
""Our critics have already been calling us mouthpieces,"" he told Reuters. ""There is no change in that now.""
A 2017 survey by U.S. government-funded Freedom House ranked Hungary's press as ""partly free"", while a European Union parliamentary report this year said media was concentrated in the hands of pro-Orban oligarchs.
Although the new Central European Press and Media Foundation does not target profit generation, its portfolio is in fact a big money-maker. Last year, members of the group had revenue of 60 billion forints ($210 million), much of it from state adverts, and made a profit of 8 billion forints, according to independent news web site 24.hu.
Orban, 55, who projects himself as a savior of Hungary's Christian culture against Muslim migration into Europe, won a third straight term in power earlier this year.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's travel industry is starting to suffer the fallout of a political crisis in the middle of its peak tourist season, as uncertainty prompts cancellations by both business and leisure visitors.
Tourism makes up about 5 percent of the Indian Ocean island's $87-billion economy, but the president's sacking of the prime minister late in October triggered a crisis that credit rating agencies say has already hit economic prospects.
""We have cancellations in the region of about 20 percent,"" said Chandra Mohotti, a manager at the luxury Galle Face Hotel in the capital, Colombo, which has about 200 rooms.
""Normally our hotel would be full. We are offering discounts because of the fear that allocations will not be utilized."" 
Peak season for holidaymakers from Europe, a major source of tourists, along with India and China, typically runs from December to March.
But numerous flight bookings have been canceled, especially from Europe, a source at national carrier SriLankan Airlines told Reuters. 
""The crisis started just when tourists take a decision where to go,"" said the source, who declined to be named. ""(It) has discouraged many of them.""
Mahinda Rajapaksa, who replaced Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister, lacks a parliamentary majority and has been prevented by a court from holding office, delaying the 2019 budget and leading to violent scenes in parliament.
It may be a while before the cancellations show up in arrivals figures, however. Tourist numbers were up 16.8 percent in November on the year, official data showed on Thursday, with visitors from Europe up 37 percent, although numbers from China, Japan, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia all fell. 
Last year, more than 2.1 million people visited Sri Lanka, tourism authorities say. 
Business travel has also been hit by the crisis, with firms moving meetings to elsewhere in Southeast Asia.  
""There have been some cancellations and some have shifted to Singapore and Indonesia,"" said Sanath Ukwatte, president of the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka, adding that conference and exhibition bookings were the worst hit.
Harith Perera, president of the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators, said he had also seen cancellations in the corporate sector. 

""At the moment bookings have slowed down and that is a concern,"" he said. ""If the current crisis drags on, then the impact will be significant. Cancellations are not only from European tourists, but from everywhere.""

Colonel Muhammad Aidi said efforts to retrieve more bodies from the weekend attack on a Papua construction site were halted after soldiers clashed with fighters from the separatist Free Papua Movement (OPM). 
""We still haven't been able to recover another seven because there was a shootout between the military and the separatist group,"" Aidi said, adding that the bodies of 16 of the 19 workers killed in the attack had been located.
The nine bodies retrieved so far were flown to the town of Timika, he said. Most had gunshot wounds to the chest and head. 
On Monday, members of the same separatist group attacked a military post near the construction site, killing one soldier. 
A separatist conflict has simmered for decades since Papua was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969.
In June, three bystanders were killed and a child wounded when Papua separatists fired at a plane transporting security personnel for regional polls.
""We will give the separatist group the chance to surrender and join Indonesia and we will make sure they are safe. If they resist, they will face our force,"" Aidi said. 
The OPM separatists said this week they viewed the construction workers as members of the military and casualties of a war against the Indonesian government. 
Indonesia officials say the workers were civilians employed by state construction firm, PT Istaka Karya, which is building bridges for the Trans Papua highway, part of President Joko Widodo's pledge to open up access to the resource-rich province.
On Thursday, Widodo said on his official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page ""this incident emboldened us to continue the great task of building the land of Papua"".
OPM spokesman Sebby Sambon said on Wednesday government efforts to develop the province had marginalized Papuans. 

""We don't need road construction from Indonesia. When we become independent we can make our own roads that are as good as the ones in developed countries,"" he told Reuters by telephone.

1684,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: In Malta, a private accountant’s government job sparks controversy","By Stephen Grey
LONDON (Reuters) - A private accountant who set up offshore companies for two senior political figures in Malta was given a government consultancy in recent years worth nearly 60,000 euros per year, documents obtained by Reuters show.
Brian Tonna, who created companies in Panama for a Maltese government minister and the prime minister's chief of staff, held the consultancy full-time from August 2014 to August 2016, and part-time from then until August 31, 2017, contracts obtained from a Freedom of Information request show. His pay - about 55,000 euros annually plus expenses - was almost as high as that of the prime minister.
Simon Busuttil, a former leader of the opposition Nationalist Party in Malta, told Reuters that Tonna's work as a personal accountant for government figures and his government contracts created a conflict of interest. ""The bar for ethical standards has now been lowered so far by this government, it has been crushed into the ground,"" he said.
Tonna declined to comment. A spokesman for Joseph Muscat, Malta's prime minister, said the prime minister was not involved in granting Tonna's government contract.
Tonna was hired as an adviser to Owen Bonnici, minister for justice. The work was in addition to previously disclosed business contracts, worth more than 800,000 euros, awarded by other government ministries to NexiaBT, an accountancy firm that Tonna owns.
In a statement, a spokesman for Bonnici said that Tonna and NexiaBT ""offered advice and technical guidance on purely financial matters relating to infrastructural projects in the field of culture."" Asked if Tonna's employment involved any conflicts of interest and how this was managed, the spokesman did not respond.
Tonna set up companies in Panama that in 2015 he transferred to Keith Schembri, the prime minister's chief of staff, and Konrad Mizzi, then energy minister and now tourism minister. Tonna has known Schembri as a personal friend and client for 20 years, according to a written declaration made by Tonna and seen by Reuters. Mizzi engaged NexiaBT as a personal accountant in 2015, according to his own statements. Schembri and Mizzi did not respond to questions about the contracts given to Tonna.
Tonna's role in creating companies for Schembri and Mizzi was first disclosed by Daphne Caruana Galizia, a journalist who was murdered in October 2017. No evidence has emerged that connects her death to any of her journalism. Details of Tonna's personal government consultancy contract emerged from Freedom of Information requests for details of any payments made to either Tonna or Nexia BT since the current administration took power in 2013. The requests were filed by the Times of Malta and the results shared with Reuters.
They showed that his full-time contract was worth 54,684 euros annually, plus 7,474 euros in allowances for his expenses, including for his car and mobile phone. The part-time contract was worth 38,241 euros plus 3,736 euros in expenses. The prime minister earns 55,978 euros plus 6,769 euros in allowances, his spokesman told Reuters.
In May 2017, Maltese authorities launched a judicial investigation into payments totalling 100,000 euros made by Tonna to Schembri at a private bank. As Reuters reported in April https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-malta-daphne-pilatus-insight/malta-had-concerns-about-bank-with-azeri-clients-kept-it-open-idUKKBN1HX1JE, the probe was launched after Malta's anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Intelligence and Analysis Unit (FIAU), said in a report that the payments gave rise to ""reasonable suspicion of money laundering."" Both men have denied any wrongdoing and said the 100,000 euros were repayment of a personal loan. The FIAU declined to comment on the investigation, which continues.
In November, Prime Minister Muscat came under political pressure from opposition lawmakers to sack or suspend Mizzi and Schembri after Reuters reported new details https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-malta-daphne-offshore-exclusive/exclusive-mystery-company-named-by-murdered-maltese-journalist-is-linked-to-power-station-developer-idUKKCN1NE196 about 17 Black, an obscure company based in Dubai. That company, according to an email from NexiaBT, planned to pay up to 2 million euros to Panama companies owned by Mizzi and Schembri.
According to government statements following the Reuters report, 17 Black's activities are now the subject of both a criminal probe by police and a judicial investigation. Muscat told reporters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malta-muscat/maltese-pm-says-ready-to-quit-if-implicated-in-probe-into-mystery-firm-idUSKCN1NL29Z in Malta that if he were implicated in any wrongdoing by the probes, he would resign.

DUBAI (Reuters) - At least three people died and 24 others were injured in a suicide car bomb attack on the police headquarters in Iran's southeast on Thursday, state media reported, adding that the perpetrator was killed. 
Television also reported shooting in the area, located in the region of Sistan-Baluchestan, which is home to a Sunni Muslim minority in the largely Shi'ite country and has long been plagued by violence from both drug smugglers and separatists.
""Three people were killed and some others were injured,"" Chabahar's acting governor Rahmdel Bameri told state television. 
An official told TV that ""the terrorist who carried out the attack was killed"". He did not elaborate.
Mohammad Hadi Marashi, deputy governor for security affairs, told state television two police officers had been killed.
The state news agency IRNA said some 24 people had been wounded. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
Videos posted on Twitter, purportedly from Chabahar, showed thick smoke rising from the area. Reuters could not verify their authenticity.
""Police stopped the explosive-laden car and started firing at the driver ... who then set off the explosion near the police headquarters in Chabahar,"" said Bameri.
Suicide bombings are rare in Iran, but Sunni militant groups have carried out several attacks on Iranian security forces in the Sistan-Baluchestan province in recent years. 
Iran has stepped up security in border areas after gunmen in September opened fire on a military parade in Iran's southwestern city of Ahvaz, killing 25 people, almost half of them members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards corps. 
An Iranian ethnic Arab separatist Sunni militant group and Islamic State both claimed responsibility for that attack. 
Last year, in the first deadly assault claimed by Islamic State in Tehran, 18 people were killed at the parliament and mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Republic. 
Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), a Sunni militant group that has carried out several attacks on Iranian security forces, mainly in Sistan-Baluchestan, claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 10 border guards near Pakistan in 2017.
In 2010, two suicide bombers killed at least 28 people, including some of the elite Revolutionary Guards, at a Shi'ite mosque in southeast Iran, an attack Iranian leaders said was backed by the United States.
The attack was claimed by a Sunni separatist group called Jundullah (Soldiers of God). 
Tehran accuses its Sunni-led regional rival Saudi Arabia and the United States of funding most of these groups, a charge that Riyadh and Washington deny. 
Iran also says that militant groups are sheltering across the border in Pakistan and has threatened to attack their bases if Islamabad does not confront them.

Chabahar is a free trade zone and the site of an Indian-backed port complex being developed as part of a new transportation corridor for landlocked Afghanistan.

Turkish Cypriot media said the victims' car was swept away during a deluge late Wednesday. Cyprus residents have reported virtually uninterrupted rain since early Tuesday, with some saying it was the heaviest in memory.
Flash flooding from an isolated downpour is not uncommon in Cyprus, but sustained floods are rare. Further bad weather was expected on Thursday.
""In minutes, it's gone from beautiful sunshine to freezing cold with rumbles of thunder in the distance. I'm not looking forward to this,"" one northern Cyprus resident said. 
People were sewing sandbags to prevent water seeping through window seals and under doors, she said.
Social media images showed cars swept away into the sea, submerged in flood water and water gushing through homes.  
Normally dry rivers burst their banks, causing damage in the Cypriot capital, Nicosia, and forcing the partial closure of a motorway linking the city to Kyrenia, a historic harbor town on the island’s northern coast. Many schools were shut.
""I have never seen anything like it,"" said Devin Reid, 25, a resident of northern Nicosia. ""Our front street looked like a river.""

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 05:43AM ET</span>",How a South Korean security law is becoming obsolete amid thaw with North Korea,"By Hyonhee Shin and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - In downtown Seoul, some 40 young South Koreans last month braved early winter chills to show their support for a planned visit to the South Korean capital by North Korea's leader, chanting ""Kim Jong Un! Kim Jong Un! Kim Jong Un is a great man!"" 
Kim Soo-geun, who founded a youth group called ""Welcome Committee for a Great Man"", has been drumming up donations from passers-by so they can run a subway advertisement to welcome Kim, who this year agreed to visit Seoul.
""I like the communist party. You'll like them soon as well,"" he shouted.
More than a dozen civic groups have sprung up to welcome Kim, visiting schools to collect welcome messages, imitating the dance moves of a North Korean art troupe and even naming their group after Mount Paektu, which Pyongyang says is the birthplace of Kim's sacred bloodline. 
Such activities have become possible as President Moon Jae-in's administration relaxes enforcement of South Korea's National Security Act amid efforts to improve relations with North Korea and halt its nuclear weapon and missile programs.
Thousands of students, citizens and defectors were prosecuted, jailed and even executed under the 1948 law, which bars ""praising, inciting or propagating the activities of an anti-government organization"". Most were accused of spying for Pyongyang or undertaking other pro-North activities.
Now, the rise of far-left, pro-Pyongyang activists exploiting the looser enforcement of the law has sparked a backlash from conservative groups and ordinary citizens that experts say could erode public support for Moon and his peace drive. Economic and jobs woes have already pushed Moon's approval ratings to the lowest levels since his 2017 election.
Security officials and some defectors also say any abolition of the law could allow an influx of the North's propaganda glorifying the Kim regime.
""Most South Koreans would support peace-building efforts with the North, but they're not ready to praise Kim who has yet to show his credentials as a trustworthy leader,"" said Cho Han-bum, a senior fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.
""To them, Kim is still a dictator.""
'DEAD LETTER' 
Between January and October this year, only 15 people were charged with violating the law, the lowest level in 10 years, according to a Reuters review of Justice Ministry data submitted to Joo Kwang-deok, a lawmaker. Five years ago, 129 people were charged.
""The act is virtually not being enforced,"" Kim Jong-kwi, a lawyer who worked on six relevant legal cases. ""Some say it's now almost a dead letter.""
The law was enacted by the South in the wake of a revolt by some 2,000 troops following Korea's liberation from Japanese occupation in 1945. 
Amid decades of sometimes violent confrontations with the North, the law became primarily aimed at suspected North Korean spies and sympathizers.
Critics say opaque definitions like 'praise' and 'incitement' in the law allowed for arbitrary interpretations that led to abuses by past military dictatorships and governments to silence dissenters and political enemies.
Between 2007 and 2016, the South Korean government paid more than 212 billion won ($190 million) in compensation to 1,311 South Koreans who were falsely charged for violating the law in cases dating back to the 1960s, according to Kim Dang, who compiled the data from the Justice Ministry and the National Intelligence Service.
Now the political pendulum has swung to the left, the same opacity is allowing the law to fade in practice, experts say. 
Moon, who as a presidential candidate said the law should be amended to prevent abuse by authorities, has cut staff at agencies tasked with enforcing it.
The National Police Agency said its security investigation bureau has been cut to 479 this year from 580 last year. The administration has also reduced a military intelligence agency's workforce by more than 30 percent to 2,900. 
In an October survey of 1,013 South Koreans, more than half of them said they supported the National Security Act, while about a third said it should be scrapped or replaced, according a poll by R & Search.
Pyongyang's state media on Tuesday urged repeal of the ""unprecedented fascist, anti-reunification"" legislation. 
""There is no reason for (the law) to exist now that a new phase of reconciliation and unity has arrived at the north-south relations,"" KCNA said in a commentary.
DEEPENING CONFLICT
The division in South Korea is coming to a head as Moon pushes to host Kim to Seoul as soon as this month.
On Monday, a coalition of eight defector, human rights and lawyers' organizations said they were opposed to any more inter-Korean summits that fail to address human rights in the North. 
U.N. investigators have reported the use of political prisons, starvation and executions in North Korea, saying security chiefs and possibly even Kim Jong Un should be held accountable.
""The National Security Act is an anachronism from the Cold War era that really now should be repealed,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. ""But human rights must be on the agenda for all the various dialogues and discussions between North Korea and the outside world.""
After the 40 young students staged their pro-Kim campaign, a conservative civic group filed a complaint to the prosecution against them for breaching the National Security Act. The Supreme Prosecutors' Office told Reuters that police are investigating the complaint.
""Peace is all well and good but those organizations extolling Kim Jong Un are going way too far,"" said Kim Jong-hoon, a 27-year-old IT worker. ""I don't think that's the way to lasting peace."" 
When asked about a potential souring of public sentiment over Kim's visit, Moon said there can't be a ""split in public opinion"" and he believes all South Koreans would welcome Kim ""with open arms"".

""Isn't it every citizen's wish if it helps realize denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and achieve peace between the South and the North?"" Moon said.

The ruling must be upheld by the Independent Election Commission, the body with overall authority over the ballot, which was marred by allegations of voter fraud, technical problems with biometric voter verification equipment and inaccurate voter lists.
""There were serious outstanding problems in Kabul that could hurt the fairness, transparency and inclusiveness of the election,"" said Ali Reza Rohani, spokesman for the Electoral Complaints Commission.
More than a million votes were recorded in Kabul, accounting for about a quarter of the roughly 4 million votes cast nationwide. If confirmed by the IEC, the decision would call into question the validity of an election heavily pushed by Afghanistan's international partners.
The recommendation to cancel the vote in Kabul also adds to uncertainty over the April 20 presidential election. Election authorities have said they are considering postponing the vote until July due to organizational difficulties.
Any delay to the presidential election could affect hoped-for peace talks with the Taliban, which have opened contacts with the United States but so far refused to talk to the government of President Ashraf Ghani.
Authorities have still not released complete results from the Oct. 20 parliamentary ballot, which saw chaotic delays that forced voting to continue into the following day.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine law enforcement agents have arrested a 77-year-old American Catholic priest on a warrant for sex crimes issued by a court in the United States, a spokeswoman for immigration authorities said on Thursday.
Kenneth Bernard Hendricks is to be deported after Wednesday's arrest at his home in Naval on the remote central island of Biliran, where he has been a priest for 37 years, following complaints from dozens of children, she added.
""We will not allow sexual predators to prey on our children,"" the spokeswoman, Dana Krizia Sandoval, said in a statement.
Hendricks was flown back to Manila, the capital, where the U.S. embassy is taking steps to enable his deportation to face charges in the U.S. state of Ohio, she added.
""I am sad leaving this town,"" a handcuffed Hendricks told television after the arrest, but he made no mention of the case.
The church suspended Hendricks from his priestly duties after opening a formal inquiry more than a month ago, said Father John Estina of the Catholic diocese in Biliran, adding that it had cooperated with civil authorities. 
""We will not tolerate those kind of activities,"" Estina told Reuters by telephone, saying the investigation began after religious authorities were told of the accusations.
The priest, a native of Cincinnati, faces criminal complaints in the Philippines, he added.
The move followed a request by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security after Hendricks was indicted for engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places, said Bobby Raquepo, who heads the immigration bureau's fugitive search unit.
A 12-year-old was among the roughly 50 children from Biliran who provided statements to an Ohio court, he added.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2018 01:51AM ET</span>","As Japan considers allowing more foreigners, tiny rural town wants to go further","By Linda Sieg and Ami Miyazaki
AKITAKATA, Japan (Reuters) - Brazilian Luan Dartora Taniuti settled in the remote municipality of Akitakata in southwest Japan when he was nine. Leonel Maia of East Timor has been there nearly seven years. Filipina Gladys Gayeta is a newly arrived trainee factory worker, but must leave in less than three years.
Japan's strict immigration laws mean Taniuti, who has Japanese ancestry, and Maia, who is married to a Japanese, are among the relatively few foreigners the country allows to stay for the long term. 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hopes to pass a law this week that would allow in more foreign blue-collar workers such as Gayeta for limited periods. But Akitakata's mayor, Kazuyoshi Hamada, says his shrinking community, like others in Japan, needs foreigners of all backgrounds to stay.
The rural city has more than 600 non-Japanese, roughly 2 percent of its population, which has shrunk more than 10 percent since its incorporation in 2004.
""Given the low birth rate and aging population, when you consider who can support the elderly and the factories ... we need foreigners,"" said Hamada, 74, who in March unveiled a plan that explicitly seeks them as long-term residents. ""I want them to expand the immigration law and create a system where anyone can come to the country."" 
Japan's population decline is well-known, but the problem is especially acute in remote, rural locales such as Akitakata.
Hamada's proposal to attract foreigners as ""teijusha,"" or long-term residents, is the first of its kind in immigration-shy Japan. Abe is pitching his plan as a way to address Japan's acute labor shortage but denies it's an ""immigration policy.""
""Hamada openly mentioned Japanese immigration policy and that is very courageous,"" said Toshihiro Menju, managing director of the Japan Center for International Exchange in Tokyo, a think tank. ""Akitakata is kind of a forerunner.""
A STRUGGLING CITY
The population of Akitakata, formed from the merger of six small townships, dropped to 28,910 in November from 30,983 in 2014. About 40 percent of residents are 65 or older.
Car parts factories and farms are crying out for workers, many houses stand empty, darkened streets are deserted by early evening and the aisles of a discount supermarket are mostly empty by 8 p.m.
Hamada says long-term resident foreigners are the solution. But integrating them will be crucial; many cities were unprepared for earlier influxes of foreign workers, experts said.
Blue-collar foreign workers have typically arrived under three legal avenues: long-term visas begun in the 1990s for the mostly Latin American descendents of ethnic Japanese; a ""technical trainees program"" often criticized as an exploitative backdoor to unskilled labor; and foreign students allowed to work up to 28 hours a week. 
The country had 2.5 million foreign residents as of January 2018, up 7.5 percent from a year earlier and about 2 percent of the total population. The number of native Japanese dropped 0.3 percent to 125.2 million in the same period, the ninth straight annual decline.
Akitakata's foreign population is about two-thirds trainees from places such as China, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. Most are only allowed to stay up to three years.
The rest are long-term residents, such as Maia, and Brazilians like Taniuti who stayed even after the global financial crisis prompted the central government to offer one-way tickets to his native country.
""When I feared having no job, I thought 'It's enough if I can eat,'"" said Taniuti, who five years later set up his own company, where his two brothers and father now work.
DIVIDED VIEWS 
Akitakata residents are divided on whether to attract more foreigners, though less wary than in the past. 
A 2017 survey showed 48 percent of Akitakata residents thought it was ""good"" to have foreigners live in the city, up from 30.8 percent in 2010.
That was similar to the 45 percent nationally who backed Abe's planned reforms in a November Asahi newspaper poll.
""I think our lives would be enriched with different cultures. But Japanese are not skilled at communication and language is the biggest barrier,"" said Yuko Okita, 64, who works at her husband's local taxi service. 
Maia, 33, said that he got along well with locals - he is a member of a volunteer firefighter brigade - but that his half-Japanese daughter had been bullied at school.
A media report that Hamada set a numerical target for an increase in foreign residents, which the mayor called ""misleading,"" sparked a protest by a right-wing group from nearby Hiroshima. 
Akitakata also may have a hard time attracting new residents of any nationality simply because it is remote and small.
""Akitakata is slow-paced. It's not attractive for young people. But it's a great place to raise kids,"" said Taniuti, a father of two.
Gayeta, 22, a trainee at a car parts factory, said there was little to do in Akitakata after work.
""There is no place to go, just yama (mountains),"" she said, mixing English and Japanese.
NEXT STEPS
To be sure, little has changed in Akitakata since Hamada announced his plan.
The city has an office where a Brazilian resident offers advice in Portuguese.
Proponents want to improve Japanese-language teaching for foreigners and are considering how to use abandoned homes to house them.
Abe's proposed legislation, which he wants enacted this month to take effect in April, would allow 345,150 blue-collar workers to enter Japan over five years in sectors like construction that are suffering from serious labor shortages.
Opponents say his proposal is hasty and ill-conceived.
The law would create two new categories of visas for blue-collar workers: one for those who could stay up to five years but could not bring family members; and another for more highly skilled foreigners who could bring families and might eventually be eligible for residency. Details are not spelled out in the law.
But the path to permanent residence is steep: one standard requirement is to live in Japan for 10 consecutive years, with exceptions for the highly skilled professionals Japan is eager to attract.

""The truth of the matter is the central government is not basing acceptance of foreign workers on the premise of long-term residence,"" said Meiji University professor Keizo Yamawaki, who helped Akitakata draft its plan.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and non-GCC member Egypt have imposed a diplomatic and economic boycott on Qatar since June 2017 over allegations Doha supports terrorism. Qatar denies the charges and says the boycott aims to curtail its sovereignty.
""The main success of the council is in its economic aspects and the creation of a Gulf common market,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted. 
""The political crisis will end when the cause behind it ends and that is Qatar's support of extremism and its interference in the stability of the region.""
The dispute has undermined the regional role of the six-nation GCC, set up in 1980 as a bulwark against larger neighbors Iran and Iraq.
Last week, Qatar abruptly announced it was quitting OPEC after 57 years to focus on gas in an apparent swipe at the oil-exporter bloc's de facto leader Saudi Arabia.
The move has deepened the sense among diplomats and analysts that any prospect for a near-term resolution to the dispute was unlikely to come at the GCC summit in Riyadh.
Saudi Arabia's king has invited Qatar's emir to attend the Dec. 9 gathering of heads of state, but Doha has not yet said what level of representation it would send.
Bahrain's foreign minister said in remarks published on Thursday that the level of Qatari representation at the one-day summit was irrelevant.
""It is the same whether they attend or not,"" Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa told the pan Arab daily Asharq Al-Awsat.
""The crisis with Qatar has reached unprecedented levels and I don't know how they will come back from that, as Qatar has joined itself with the region's enemies such as Iran and distanced itself from the GCC.""
Qatar's ruler last month said the dispute ""exposed the failure"" of the GCC and harmed regional security by weakening the block which groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

At last year's summit, held in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain sent ministers or deputy prime ministers.

Judge Roy Ellis ruled in favor of an appeal by Philip Wilson, the former archbishop of Adelaide and a former president of the Catholic Church's top body in Australia, against his conviction in May, court documents show.
""The appeal is upheld,"" read a summary of the decision emailed to Reuters by a court spokeswoman. ""The conviction and the orders of the local court are quashed."" 
Ellis delivered the decision at Newcastle District Court in New South Wales, freeing Wilson, 68, from detention for a year at his sister's home, as an alternative to prison, after his conviction for failing to disclose to police abuse by a priest.
The Adelaide archdiocese said it welcomed the conclusion of a process that had been long and painful for all concerned.
""We now need to consider the ramifications of this outcome,"" its administrator delegate, Father Philip Marshall, said in a statement that gave no further details, but added the survivors of child sexual abuse ""are in our thoughts and prayers"".
Wilson had been accused of covering up the abuse, by Father James Fletcher, after being told about it in 1976 by two victims, one of them an altar boy who allegedly told him in the confessional.
Lawyers for Wilson had maintained he did not know Fletcher had abused a boy. Fletcher was found guilty in 2004 of nine counts of child sexual abuse and died in jail in 2006, following a stroke.

Duterte, whose controversial war on drugs has killed nearly 5,000 suspected drug dealers and users since 2016, said on Monday he used marijuana to stay awake - and then said he was just joking.
Marijuana is illegal in the Philippines and critics said Duterte's attempt at humor could upset the relatives of those who died in the anti-drugs campaign.

Populist arguments that migrants pose a health risk and a burden to health systems are myths used to drive anti-immigrant sentiment, the report published by University College London and the Lancet medical journal concluded. https:// The two-year study found that migrants, in general, have a greater life expectancy than residents of host countries and were less likely to die of illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. They were, however, more prone to diseases such as hepatitis, HIV and tuberculosis, but tended to spread those infections among immigrant communities rather than the general population, the study found. ""Our analysis suggests that migrants are healthier, migrants contribute positively to the economies of host countries, and in wealthy countries like the United Kingdom and United States, migrants constitute a large portion of the health workforce,"" said Ibrahim Abubakar, chair of the UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health that carried out the study.  The report, which looked at 96 studies and 5,464 mortality estimates for more than 15 million migrants, found inconsistencies between migrant groups.  Mortality was lower, for instance, among migrants from east Asia and Latin America than the general population of six European host countries studied. However, it was higher among migrants from north Africa and eastern Europe. ""In too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda,"" Lancet Editor Richard Horton said in a statement. ""Migrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost."" 
The results were based mainly on studies of migrant health in wealthier countries, due to a lack of data on low-income and middle-income countries. As a result, the study may not reflect the health of immigrants in those poorer countries that are the most popular destinations globally for migrants, the report cautioned.

KABUL (Reuters) - The death last week of the Taliban's senior leader in southern Afghanistan in a U.S. air strike highlights a surge in operations amid pressure to coax the increasingly confident insurgents to accept talks to end the 17-year war.
As U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad makes a fresh round of visits to Afghanistan and neighboring countries this week and resumes meetings with Taliban representatives, military operations have spiked sharply across the country.
The aim, say Afghan and U.S. officials, is to build as strong a position as possible for the hoped-for start of peace talks with the Taliban.
Khalilzad told U.S. broadcaster PBS last week that he was ""in a hurry"" to secure an agreement with the Taliban, ideally ahead of presidential elections scheduled for April 20.
While U.S. officials have avoided talk of deadlines, the new urgency has raised fears among many in the Afghan government that the United States seeks a quick way out of its longest war.
""The United States basically wants a dignified withdrawal,"" said one senior Afghan government official who is in near-daily contact with U.S. diplomats working on the peace process.
""Progress towards peace remains elusive,"" the Pentagon Lead Inspector General told Congress in the latest report last month, as civilian and military casualties grow and just 65 percent of the population lives under government control.
Large Taliban forces have this year overrun the western city of Farah and the central city of Ghazni, fuelling perceptions that the insurgents, estimated to number 60,000 fighters, are winning.
To regain the initiative, Gen. Scott Miller, who arrived as commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan in September, has pushed Afghan forces to go on the offensive, backed by U.S. Special Forces and air strikes. 
One such strike killed Abdul Manan, the Taliban's shadow governor for Helmand province, on Saturday.
Defence ministry spokesman Ghafoor Ahmad Javed said 161 air strikes in the past two weeks by Afghanistan's own fledgling air force were part of operations which he estimated had killed hundreds of Taliban fighters.
""They've lost many commanders and suffered lots of casualties, they've lost training centers and economic support centers including narcotics,"" he said.
""When they're under pressure, they know they can't get anywhere without the peace process.""
The death of two U.S. Special Forces soldiers and an airman in a roadside bomb blast near Ghazni last week also highlighted the Americans' increasingly active role.
""There is more fighting now than a few weeks ago,"" said Samilhullah, a resident of Ghazni, overrun this year by thousands of Taliban fighters in one of their biggest operations in years.
""I see many American and Afghan forces in my village and everyday there are sounds of explosions, gunfire and helicopters flying around.""
DANGERS
The approach was designed to complement the diplomatic push toward opening negotiations with the Taliban, said Colonel Dave Butler, the spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
""We're near a political settlement,"" he added. ""If the Taliban want to keep fighting, we will fight and ensure that they feel the pressure.""
The U.S. military has dropped more munitions in air strikes this year than any other full year since the height of the U.S. presence in 2011, seeking to bolster Afghan forces reeling from what officials say are unsustainable losses.
Afghan and Western officials have warned that a hasty withdrawal of the 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan would lead to a collapse in understrength Afghan forces, which have been suffering 600 deaths on average every month since 2015.
The Taliban, who have refused to deal with the Afghan government, calling it an illegitimate ""puppet"" regime, have struck an increasingly confident tone in official statements, declaring this week that the U.S. was ""on the brink of defeat"".
However Taliban representatives have also acknowledged some progress in talks with Khalilzad, focusing on the withdrawal of international forces, the release of prisoners and lifting curbs on international travel by Taliban officials.
""There are certain secrets of our meeting with him which we don't want to disclose, as the United States is trying to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible,"" one Taliban official who has been involved in the Qatar talks told Reuters last month.
Trump's recent letter to Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, urging him to help the process, underlines the importance the issue has garnered in Washington.
But both Western and Afghan officials are keenly aware that U.S. President Donald Trump has long been skeptical of the Afghanistan mission, and had to be persuaded to beef up U.S. forces there as part of the South Asia strategy announced last year.
While the discussions continue, diplomats in Kabul joke about the ""Tweet of Damocles"" hanging over the engagement, a reference to Trump's penchant for surprise announcements on social media.

""There is a real sense that the diplomatic and military effort has to be seen to be producing results quite soon, otherwise the White House may simply lose patience,"" said one Western diplomat in Kabul.
