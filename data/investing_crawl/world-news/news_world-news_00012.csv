In 2017, Princes William and Harry said they had commissioned a statue in honour of their mother, who died in a Paris car crash more than 20 years ago, to be erected outside the older brother's official London home, Kensington Palace.
Later that year, they chose sculptor Ian Rank-Broadley, who produced the image of Queen Elizabeth used on Britain's coins, to create the statue to commemorate 20 years since Diana's death.
Diana, the first wife of the heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, was killed when the limousine carrying her and her lover Dodi al-Fayed crashed in a Paris tunnel in August 1997.
William was 15 and Harry 12 at the time.

The first permanent memorial to her, a 210-metre (689-foot) long fountain, was launched in Hyde Park in 2004 after years of bureaucratic wrangling and squabbling over the design. The new statue will be unveiled on July 1.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Wealthier countries that join the World Health Organization's COVID-19 vaccine plan are being offered a new option to pick and choose which shots they get while reserving a right to receive their ""full share"" of doses, documents seen by Reuters show.
The change appears aimed at convincing governments which have negotiated their own bilateral deals securing experimental vaccines to also sign up for the global COVAX facility by Monday's deadline for submitting expressions of interest.
""They are trying to be more flexible for self-financing countries to make it more interesting... There are some advantages to incentivise you to pay upfront,"" said a Western diplomat familiar with the terms.
The United States, Japan, Britain and the European Union have struck their own deals to secure millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses for their citizens, ignoring the WHO's warnings that ""vaccine nationalism"" will squeeze supplies.
The WHO did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not determine if the documents were the final offer. The document with the new terms and conditions was dated Aug. 5.
The offer is the latest sign of concern in the U.N. agency about its effort to unite the world behind its vaccine as it struggles to get wealthier countries on board beyond pledges of funding and warm words about donating surplus vaccines. 
It's not clear if the new terms will be enough to win back the European Union, which has told member states they can help fund the programme but can't seek to buy vaccines via both schemes. 
The latest WHO plan, circulated to its 194 member states in the last days, promises to ""negotiate the best possible pricing from manufacturers"" and to establish a ""marketplace"" for trading or selling doses.
The deadline for confirming commitment is Sept. 18, with upfront payment due by Oct. 9.
'OPTIONAL PURCHASE'
The COVAX facility, launched in late April, is designed to serve as an ""invaluable insurance policy to secure access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines"" through a portfolio of experimental vaccines using a broad range of technologies, the WHO said. For now it relies on nine experimental vaccines.
It aims to deliver at least 2 billion doses of approved vaccines by the end of 2021 and to ensure ""equitable access"".
Through the WHO's standard ""Committed Purchase"" arrangement already on offer, self-financing states are to make a lower upfront payment of an estimated $1.60 per dose, plus a $8.95 financial guarantee per unit, but have to make firm guarantees to buy doses, it said. 
If the final price exceeds double that total of $10.55 per dose, or $21.10, countries are allowed to drop out, it said.
Under the new ""Optional Purchase"" arrangement, their higher upfront payment is $3.10 per dose. This covers their full pro-rata share of the investments required by the COVAX facility to enter into agreements with manufacturers and accelerate scale of production and access, it said, adding that the estimated all-inclusive cost per dose might still be $10.55.
""These participants have the possibility to opt out of vaccine allocations while still reserving their 'options' to receive doses of a subsequent vaccine being provided through the Facility,"" the WHO said. 
""This option may be more attractive for countries that already have bilateral deals in place and may not be interested in acquiring more of those vaccines.""
While a country exercising this option retains an ability to receive its full share of doses, it should recognise that opting out of a particular vaccine ""may delay the time until a country receives doses, particularly in the initial phase where there may only be one or two vaccines and the quantities will be limited"".
The optional scheme would cost an estimated $262.8 million based on a country with a 60-million population electing to cover 20% of that and a 2-dose regimen, the WHO document said. The standard one would cost $253.2 million.
So far some 172 countries have registered expressions of interest, including 92 low- and middle-income countries eligible to secure doses through the GAVI vaccine alliance which covers much of their cost.
Some 80 potentially self-financing countries have submitted expressions of interest.
""No self-financing participant will receive doses of vaccine to cover greater than 20% of its population until all self-financing participants have either also been offered doses in an amount to achieve 20% coverage or hit their elected quantity (if lower than 20%),"" the WHO said.

Police said the demonstrations exceeded the maximum of 50 people allowed to gather under rules aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus - but could not say how many people had gathered in total.
Daily Aftonbladet said that around 80 demonstrators had gathered on each of the bridges.
A third demonstration took place outside an office building in the west of the city.
""Overall, in all these three places, there has been no violence at all,"" a police spokesman said, adding that some demonstrators had been physically removed from the two bridges. 
Representatives from Extinction Rebellion said they were protesting against politicians' failure to deal with global warming and called on the government to declare a climate emergency.
""We have had enough of broken promises and fine words,"" the group said in a statement published in Aftonbladet.
""We demand that the government speak clearly, declare a climate emergency and together with other actors communicate the urgency with which we need change. We have to cut emissions, it is as simple as that.""

The government has a target of being the first fossil free developed economy with zero net emissions by 2045 at the latest.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday will hear arguments over whether two Massachusetts men can be extradited to Japan to face charges that they helped former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn flee the country to avoid facing financial charges.
U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, have been held without bail since their arrests May after being accused of smuggling Ghosn out of Japan in December in a box on a private jet.
U.S. prosecutors say the Taylors facilitated ""one of the most brazen and well-orchestrated escape acts in recent history,"" allowing Ghosn to flee to Lebanon, his childhood home, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Ghosn fled on Dec. 29, 2019, while awaiting trial on charges that he engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.
Prosecutors said both the elder Taylor, a private security specialist, and his son received more than $1.3 million from Ghosn and his family members for their services.
The Taylors have argued they cannot be extradited because the charges against them are fatally flawed, as Japanese penal code does not make it a criminal offense to help someone ""bail jump"" or escape unless that person is in custody.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell, who will consider whether they can be extradited, has expressed doubts about that argument.
In considering whether the Taylors deserved bail, Cabell last month said their argument ignored other ""unambiguous"" language in the penal code that allows people to face charges if they enable someone's escape.
The Taylors' lawyers say that conclusion was based on an incomplete record. Should the court agree they can be extradited, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would have the final say on whether to surrender them to Japan.

MINSK/KYIV (Reuters) - Wielding a bunch of flowers and surrounded by clapping supporters, Belarus's most celebrated writer has lent a powerful voice to the opposition against President Alexander Lukashenko, even if she has so far balked at taking a leadership role.
Svetlana Alexievich, who won the 2015 Nobel Prize for Literature, has mostly kept a low profile and spent years in exile under Lukashenko's long rule. But she has become more outspoken since turmoil erupted following an Aug. 9 election.
After security forces beat protesters and arrested thousands to quell mass demonstrations and strikes, the 72-year-old Alexievich said she was tempted to enter the fray. 
""If I were younger and not sick, then probably. Even now I will help with all my might, but in order to lead the movement, I no longer have physical and moral strength,"" she told Radio Liberty on Aug. 12. 
Nevertheless Alexievich agreed to support a Coordination Council created in opposition to Lukashenko after the election that he is accused of rigging to extend his 26-year rule. 
Lukashenko denies electoral fraud and calls the council an illegal attempt to seize power. Two leading council members were jailed this week and on Wednesday, Alexievich was called as a witness to a criminal case against the body.
She seized the occasion to call on the world, especially Russia, to intervene to bring Lukashenko to the negotiating table and criticised police violence against protesters ""when they turned people into meat"".
The flowers she brought with her had symbolic importance: protesters had formed human chains and carried flowers, sometimes placing them at the feet of security forces. 
""Her participation in the council is certainly unusual. This is real politics, and she has always avoided politics,"" said political analyst Valery Karbalevich.
'THE SCALES ARE SWINGING'
""She has always been of the opinion that creative intelligentsia should not be on the barricades. But now that has changed. There is a revolution in the country, the scales are swinging, and even a small change in weight can tip the balance in one direction or another."" 
Alexievich's emergence into the opposition limelight comes with most of Lukashenko's opponents in jail or exile, notably Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who took her jailed husband's place in the election campaign but has since fled to Lithuania. 
Opposition figures in exile include Valery Tsepkalo, a former ambassador to Washington, and Andrei Sannikov who was imprisoned after trying to run against Lukashenko in 2010. 
Nikolai Statkevich, jailed for five years after standing against Lukashenko in 2010, has been re-arrested. 
Alexievich achieved renown with writings chronicling the harshness of life in the Soviet Union and its aftermath, through interviews with people who lived through tumultuous events. 
Her documentary style of writing became popular in the 1980s but her humanistic, emotional tales of peoples' fates entangled in major historic developments made her an uncomfortable voice for the authorities.
Publication of one of her best-known works, ""War's Unwomanly Face"", was censored as Soviet authorities regarded it as subversive and undermining the army's World War Two victory. 
Alexievich lived in exile in Italy, France, Germany and Sweden because of her criticism of the Belarusian government. Returning home in 2011, she tended to stay out of politics.
Protests were brewing even before the election amid frustration at Lukashenko's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which he called a ""psychosis"" that could be remedied by drinking vodka and driving tractors.
Alexievich compared the authorities' behaviour to the secrecy and denial surrounding the Soviet government's handling of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, an event that was the subject of one of her books. 
When Viktor Babariko, a former banker who was considered the most powerful opposition candidate to stand against Lukashenko, was arrested in June, she acted as surety for him. 
And when protests erupted, she openly called on Lukashenko to step aside. 
""Leave before it's too late, before you plunge the people into a terrible abyss, into the abyss of civil war! Go away! Nobody wants Maidan, nobody wants blood. Only you want power."" 

Maidan refers to the street protests in Ukraine in 2014 that ousted a Russian-backed president and put the country on course towards closer links with the European Union.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>",Acting leader of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood arrested in Cairo,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian authorities said on Friday they had arrested the acting leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mahmoud Ezzat, during a raid on an apartment in Cairo.
The arrest is the latest blow to Egypt's oldest and most organised Islamist movement, which has been crushed in a sweeping crackdown since it was forced from power seven years ago.
Ezzat was an influential former deputy to Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie, and was seen as a hardliner within the group. He became acting leader after Badie's arrest in August 2013. 
An interior ministry statement said Ezzat had been arrested from an apartment used as a hide-out in Cairo's Fifth Settlement district, and was accused of joining and leading a terrorist group and receiving illicit funds.
Egyptian authorities accuse the Brotherhood of promoting militancy and subversion, accusations it strongly denies.
The interior ministry said encrypted communications equipment had been seized during the arrest, and said Ezzat was suspected of overseeing several assassinations or attempted assassinations as well as a bombing since 2013.
Ezzat had previously been sentenced to death and to life in prison in absentia. According to Egyptian law, he will face retrials in the cases following his arrest. 
A picture distributed by the interior ministry and published by Egyptian newspaper Al-Youm al-Sabaa showed a gaunt and frail looking Ezzat wearing a striped T-shirt. 
After then-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the 2013 overthrow of former President Mohamed Mursi, a Brotherhood figure who was Egypt's first democratically elected leader, the group has been outlawed and much of its leadership jailed.
Other senior members of the group have left the country, with many now living in Turkey, and media reports had previously placed Ezzat abroad. 

Badie remains in prison in Cairo, where he has received several life sentences. Mursi died after collapsing in a prison courtroom in June 2019.

The man, a foreign national, was attacked at a camping site in the pre-dawn hours. No further details about his identity were immediately available. 
""The bear was shot at by people on site and walked towards the airport, which is nearby,"" Svalbard Deputy Governor Soelvi Elvedahl said in a statement. ""(The bear) was shortly afterwards found dead in the airport's parking lot.""
Halfway between the northern tip of Europe and the North Pole, the Svalbard archipelago of snow-capped mountains and glaciers is home to 2,939 people and 975 polar bears, according to Norway's statistics office and the Norwegian Polar Institute.
Polar bears are a protected species and shooting them is allowed only for self-defence and as a last resort. 
Outside Svalbard's main settlements, people are obliged by law to carry the means to scare the animals away or defend themselves, with authorities recommending they take a gun. 

The islands are seeing increased activity, mainly from tourism and scientific research, and encounters between humans and animals are increasing. In addition, the Arctic ice sheet is shrinking, reducing the amount of space polar bear can roam on.

The direct flight between Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport and the UAE's political capital of Abu Dhabi is expected to carry an Israeli delegation and accompanying officials from the United States, which brokered the Aug. 13 accord. [nL8N2FR6C6]
El Al and smaller Israeli rival Israir had submitted bids for the flight, an aviation source said. An El Al spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The flight number is listed as ""LY971"" on the online timetable, perhaps alluding to the UAE's country code, which is 971. 
There are no official air links between Israel and the UAE, and it was unclear whether an Israeli airliner would be able to fly over Saudi Arabia, which has no official ties with Israel, to cut down on flight time.
A U.S. government official confirmed that officials including Jared Kushner, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, would be on the El Al flight departing from Tel Aviv on Aug. 31 at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT).
The exact flight route and landing time were still being worked on, the U.S. official said.
In May, an Etihad Airways plane flew from the UAE to Tel Aviv to deliver coronavirus supplies to the Palestinians, marking the first known flight by a UAE carrier to Israel.

The Israel-UAE deal awaits negotiations on details such as opening embassies, trade and travel links before it is officially signed.

The country's federal government is looking into how the destruction of a historically significant, 46,000 year old rockshelter was legally allowed to occur, to figure out how to avoid incidents in the future.
Aboriginal groups said that a key change would be to no longer give the government the final decision on applications to impact ancient sites because it was also reliant on income from mining companies through royalties. 
Instead, they suggested that an ombudsman or independent regulator should make the decision and have wider oversight of agreements between the parties. 
""If the minister has total discretion. ..and considers the royalty payments to the state more important than the cultural heritage, he can simply ignore new evidence against the wishes of the traditional owners,"" said Marcia Langton, a professor of Indigenous studies at the University of Melbourne who is also an Aboriginal.
Large iron ore miners such as BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and Fortescue have said in written submissions that the state should be the final decision maker. 
The Western Australian state government is overhauling its cultural heritage laws with a draft of new regulation due to be released in coming weeks.
""State Government Ministers regularly act to manage competing interests and to determine outcomes that are in the best interests of the State,"" a government spokeswoman said.
A body representing Australia's pension funds whose members hold around 11% of Rio's Australian shares said that the miner had not gone far enough by trimming the bonuses of three senior executives. 
""We would expect the board to demonstrate the seriousness of what has occurred by taking accountability further than just a financial penalty,"" said Louise Davidson of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors at the inquiry.
Glynn Cochrane, a former senior advisor to Rio, told the inquiry that he was concerned Rio did not account for a 2016 decision by Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques to 
shift Indigenous community relations to corporate relations, from mine operations.
Rio did not immediately commment on the 2016 change.

Lebanon's fractious sectarian parties have so far failed to agree on who should lead the next government. President Michel Aoun is required to designate the candidate with the greatest level of support among MPs. 
The post of prime minister must go to a Sunni Muslim in the Lebanese sectarian system. It was not immediately clear who would emerge with the biggest support among MPs.
Saad al-Hariri is so far the only serious name floated for the post to replace Hassan Diab, who continues in a caretaker capacity until a new government is agreed. But Hariri said earlier this week he was not a candidate after several major parties said they did not support his return to the job.
The consultations will take place a day before French President Emmanuel Macron visits Beirut as Paris presses Lebanese leaders to take action to save the country from a destabilising financial crisis.
The Iran-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah and its Shi'ite ally the Amal Movement want Hariri to be prime minister again. But Hezbollah's main Christian ally, the Free Patriotic Movement founded by Aoun, opposes his candidacy.

Groups at the other end of the spectrum, notably the Christian Lebanese Forces Party and Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, also do not support Hariri's return to the job.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine has frozen contact with Belarus and joined the European Union in condemning the recent elections in its northerly neighbour as not free or fair, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Friday.
Kuleba said there was no reason to break off diplomatic relations entirely, but added Ukraine would take a decision on imposing sanctions on Belarus after seeing what the EU would do. 
""We put all contacts on pause until the situation in Belarus stabilises,"" he told a briefing. 
Ukraine has so far been guarded when commenting on the political turmoil engulfing Belarus, a fellow former Soviet republic, since an Aug. 9 presidential election sparked mass protests against veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko.
While Belarus is traditionally a close Moscow ally, Lukashenko made common cause with Ukraine in refusing to recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and has hosted talks on the conflict in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine.
His opponents accuse Lukashenko of rigging the vote to extend his 26-year rule. He denies electoral fraud. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for new elections but said it was up to Belarusians to choose their leader.
Belarus responded saying it did not need Ukraine's advice, the Belarusian news outlet tut.by reported. 
Ukraine has temporarily banned the entry of foreigners into the country to contain the spread of COVID-19, but Kuleba said Belarusians wanting to escape their political crisis might be exempted and given entry permits. 
Ukraine was angered when Minsk decided not to extradite a group of Russians detained in Belarus in July despite initially being receptive to the idea. Belarus had accused the men of seeking to destabilise the country, marking an unusual diplomatic row with Russia that was later patched up. 
At the time, Russia had said the men were private security workers on their way to a third country. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday the men had been lured to Belarus by a Ukrainian-U.S. intelligence operation.

Ukraine denied such an intelligence operation existed but wanted to extradite 28 of the group, suspecting the men of fighting alongside Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass. Belarus initially agreed to cooperate in the case with Ukraine, but instead handed the men to Russia this month.

The Pacific nation of 5 million people had seemed to stop community transmission of COVID-19 due to tough lockdown measures but reintroduced restrictions in its largest city, Auckland, this month following a fresh outbreak.
With restrictions to scale back on Sunday, Ardern said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post she was taking matters into her own hands before masks become compulsory on public transport across the country the following day.
At a meeting with local community health leader Dave Letele, ""one of the things we talked about was face coverings, and how to make your own at home,"" Ardern, who faces a general election in October, wrote in the post.
""I had a go at making one,"" she added, alongside a photo of a patch of fabric, scissors and two elastic hair ties.
A follow-up video showed her crafting a simple red mask, the colour of her Labour Party.
""That's my first time crafting,"" she said. ""I'm going to pull out my glitter gun later.""
About 150 people have been diagnosed as part of the cluster that originated in Auckland, which is home to 1.7 million people, but daily new case numbers have slowed to single digits this week.

Relations between Warsaw and Minsk have become tense in recent days following Lukashenko's suggestions quoted by state news agency Belta that Poland planned to take over the Grodno region bordering Poland and Lithuania if Belarus falls apart.
On Thursday, Poland summoned the Belarus ambassador to protest the ""unfounded accusations"".
""These comments are unacceptable. No one has such intentions in Poland and this is propaganda,"" Szczerski told public radio, adding the situation in Belarus is evolving in a negative direction.
Belarus has been in turmoil since a presidential election on Aug. 9 that the opposition said was rigged to extend Lukashenko's 26-year rule. Security forces have beaten and arrested protesters to stamp out mass demonstrations and strikes.
Szczerski also said that following Russia's latest signals that it is prepared to use force if needed in Belarus, the key question now is how Western Europe reacts.
The West has so far acted cautiously, wary of provoking a Russian military response as took place in Ukraine in 2014.
""If the West does not have a 'we win, they lose' approach to Russia, then Putin will be step by step expanding the Brezhnev Doctrine,"" Szczerski said, referring to Soviet foreign policy under which Moscow intervened in the domestic affairs of its East Bloc satellites when developments displeased it.
Warsaw is watching events in neighbouring Belarus closely, concerned over perceived resurgent aggressiveness by Russia in the region. It also sees itself as a key party in the West's attempts to support the Belarusian people.

News agency Belta reported on Thursday evening that the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Polish Charge d'Affaires to protest against Poland's attempts to interfere in Belarus' domestic affairs.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - From the high balcony of a Singapore public housing block, an environment official steadies his mosquito launcher, the latest contraption authorities have devised to combat a record outbreak of the tropical disease dengue.
With the click of a button and a whirr of a fan, a hatch opens and 150 lab-reared male mosquitoes are sent flying, off in search of a female companion with whom they can mate but not reproduce.
The dengue virus, which in rare cases can be fatal, is carried and spread to humans by infected mosquitoes.
But Singapore's specially bred mosquitoes carry a bacteria that prevents eggs from hatching, and ""compete with the wild type,"" leading to ""a gradual reduction of the mosquito population,"" said Ng Lee Ching, the official heading the Wolbachia project, named after the bacteria.
Some areas with high mosquito populations have seen up to 90% declines using this technique, she added.
Singapore - a tiny Southeast Asian island nation of 5.7 million people - has recorded more than 26,000 dengue cases this year, surpassing the previous annual record of around 22,000 in 2013 with four months still remaining.
Twenty people have died of the disease this year, which can cause extreme fever that leads to internal bleeding and shock. By comparison, only 27 people have died of the coronavirus in the city-state out of more than 56,000 infections.
A new strain of the disease, combined with unseasonably wet weather and coronavirus lockdowns that left construction sites and other mosquito breeding grounds undisturbed, are all seen as factors behind the dengue outbreak.
That has put the onus on traditional deterrents like fogging, fining people for flouting anti-mosquito regulations like leaving plant pots full of stagnant water, and deploying novel techniques such as the Wolbachia project.
In government laboratories, scientists breed the bacteria-carrying mosquitoes in rows of pallets - separating the male pupae for release in high-risk dengue areas. 
For every person living in those areas, up to six Wolbachia mosquitoes are released each week, the environment agency said.
Wolbachia mosquitoes can't transmit diseases such as dengue, and only female mosquitoes bite humans. 
When male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with females that don't carry the bacteria, none of the resultant eggs will hatch. 
The strategy has been successful in Australia but some experts say it might have its limits in dense urban areas such as Singapore. 
""You've got to flood the island with these mosquitoes, and people get annoyed,"" said Paul Tambyah, senior consultant at Singapore's National University Hospital.

""They're not going to grab the mosquito and examine and see whether it's a male or female. They're going to swipe them away, and that kind of defeats the purpose,"" he said.

22,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:18AM ET</span>","German New Virus Cases Rise, Infection Rate Falls for Fifth Day","(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s daily coronavirus infections rose and stayed close to a four-month high, while the infection rate declined for a fifth day.
There were 1,561 new cases in the 24 hours through Friday morning, taking the total to 240,571, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That’s close to Saturday’s increase of 1,737, the highest since late April, but still far below daily gains of almost 7,000 at the peak of the pandemic in the spring.
The reproduction number -- the average number of people infected by one person with the virus -- fell to 0.83 on Thursday from 0.85 the previous day, according to the latest report from the RKI public health institute.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday that further easing steps isn’t justified given the recent uptick in daily cases, and urged Germans to refrain from non-essential travel to countries designated as risk areas.
After a video conference, Merkel and regional premiers decided to step up enforcement of hygiene and distancing regulations and agreed to impose fines of at least 50 euros ($59) on people who flout rules on wearing face masks. They also extended a ban on major public events until at least the end of this year.
The RKI said that the increase in infections is “mainly due to people returning home from vacations abroad, but also to transmission at family and other private events.”
Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany has been able to cope so far with the rise in new cases, and that the number of patients in intensive care and deaths from the disease are stable at low levels.
“What’s worrying is the dynamic,” Spahn said in an interview with Friday’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. “If the numbers surge exponentially again, there could be a tipping point,” he added. “Unfortunately, we will only know what this critical point is in retrospect, when it’s too late.”

TAICHUNG, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen vowed on Friday to defend the island with a ""solid"" air force as she launched a U.S.-backed maintenance centre for the island's fleet of upgraded F-16 fighters amid rising tensions between Taipei and Beijing.
Frequent Chinese and U.S. military exercises in the region are raising fears of conflict touched off by a crisis over Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory.
""It takes solid defence capability, not bowing and cringing, to defend the sovereignty of the Republic of China and maintain regional peace and stability,"" Tsai told a ceremony unveiling the island's first maintenance hub in the central city of Taichung for its most advanced F-16s.
The Republic of China is Taiwan's formal name. 
Tsai said the hub marks a milestone in her years-long drive to build up Taiwan's defence industry.
""The time needed for jet maintenance will be greatly shortened and availability will be boosted significantly, ensuring the Air Force's combat power at the front line,"" she said.
Tsai has complained of increased Chinese military drills and on Thursday warned of the risk of accidental conflict. 
The hub, led by U.S. weapons maker  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Taiwan's Aerospace Industrial Development Corp (AIDC), is latest example of military cooperation between Washington and Taipei. 
The United States last year approved an $8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a deal that would take the island's F-16 fleet to more than 200 jets, the largest in Asia.
AIDC's president, Ma Wan-june, said that the hub would service jets for Taiwan's air force and that the company plans to expand it as a maintenance hub for F-16s in the region. He declined to elaborate. 
The United States has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is the island's main international backer and arms supplier.

China said last month it would sanction Lockheed Martin for involvement in arms sales to Taiwan.

“We don’t want to see anyone politicizing the Nobel Peace Prize,” Wang said during a press briefing attended by his Norwegian counterpart, Ine Eriksen Soreide, in response to a question about Hong Kong’s pro-democracy demonstrations. “In the past, and today, in the future, China will firmly reject any attempt by anyone to use the Nobel Peace Prize to interfere in China’s internal affairs. The position of the Chinese side is rock firm on this principle.”
Relations between Oslo and Beijing have been turbulent following a 2010 decision to award the Peace Prize to then-jailed -- and now deceased -- Chinese democracy advocate Liu Xiaobo. Though the Norwegian government doesn’t have any say in who is awarded the prize, China responded by suspending ties and freezing free-trade talks. It took six years before the two countries agreed to normalize relations in 2016.

Wang said his visit was the first to the Scandinavian country by a Chinese foreign minister in 15 years. He also met with Prime Minister Erna Solberg on Thursday, part of a week-long trip to Europe that includes stops in Italy, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The visit comes as China aims to stabilize key relationships around the world amid rising tensions with the U.S. -- particularly as Washington seeks to keep Huawei Technologies Co. out of 5G networks, rewire global supply chains and prevent Chinese apps like TikTok and WeChat from accessing American data.China’s international relations have also been damaged by scrutiny of its early handling of Covid-19, as well as its actions on human rights and political freedoms, including its controversial national security law for Hong Kong. The legislation, enacted by China in June, is raising concerns about autonomy and basic freedoms in the financial hub.
Hong Kong’s historic 2019 protest movement was sparked by opposition to a since-scrapped bill allowing extraditions to mainland China, before growing into a broader call for more democracy.What Are the New Laws China Has Passed for Hong Kong?: QuickTake
Wang told Soreide in a meeting that China and Norway should “deal with sensitive issues appropriately, to avoid the hard-won warming ties being strained again,” according to a statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
Wang said that two sides should accelerate negotiations for a bilateral free trade deal, and that China “attaches high importance” to Norwegian seafood imports and is willing to establish a channel for communication to facilitate purchases.
“If we can continue to respect each other and treat each other as equals, earnestly accommodate each others’ core interests and major concerns, our bilateral relationship can continue to develop in a sustained and sound manner, and the political foundation of the bilateral relationship will be further consolidated,” Wang said in the briefing.

Scott Morrison told broadcaster Channel Seven he had not received a formal request from New Zealand for such a transfer, although New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters suggested it after Tarrant was sentenced on Thursday.
""We'll have an open discussion and look at the issues around this,"" Morrison said, adding that the views of the affected families would need to be considered first.
""I know all Australians and all New Zealanders would want to see this character locked up forever and never see the light of day again. And I agree with that. Whether he's held in New Zealand or Australia.""
Tarrant, who grew up in a rural town north of Sydney, admitted to 51 charges of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist act for the 2019 shooting rampage at two mosques in Christchurch.
While Australia and New Zealand have close visa arrangements, they do not have a prisoner transfer deal, creating a hurdle to any near-term change in Tarrant's imprisonment.
Special security measures for Tarrant are expected to cost taxpayers NZ$3.6 million ($2.4 million) over two years or nearly NZ$5,000 a day, according to New Zealand government estimates.
The issue of Tarrant's nationality was raised several times during this week's sentencing hearings in Christchurch. 
High Court Judge Cameron Mander said he believed Tarrant came to New Zealand to carry out the attacks to cause fear in what is otherwise one of the safest countries in the world.
John Milne, who lost a son in the attack, told the court on Wednesday that Tarrant had to be sent ""back to Australia where he came from"".

28,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 09:51PM ET</span>",Law firm for teenager accused of Kenosha killings has represented Trump lawyer Giuliani,"By David Thomas
(Reuters) - The 17-year-old accused of killing two people during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has hired a law firm whose clients have included President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and former Trump adviser Carter Page.
John Pierce told Reuters on Thursday that he and colleagues at Pierce Bainbridge would obtain justice for Kyle Rittenhouse, of Illinois, arrested and charged with shooting three people on Tuesday night, two of whom died.
A civil litigator, Pierce tweeted on Thursday that he would soon be joined by ""a SEAL Team"" of former assistant U.S. attorneys who are now criminal defense attorneys. Pierce will appear with Rittenhouse at an extradition hearing in Lake County Circuit Court in Illinois on Friday. 
Kenosha has been rocked by protests following the shooting by a white police officer that left a Black man, Jacob Blake, paralyzed.
The Pierce Bainbridge firm bills itself as a ""state-of-the-art litigation law firm dedicated to the lost art of combat by trial,"" according to its website. 
Pierce told Reuters he is hoping to raise funds for Rittenhouse's defense through his #FightBack Foundation, Inc., a Texas non-profit he formed with L. Lin Wood, an Atlanta attorney who is representing high school student Nicholas Sandmann. 
Sandmann in January settled a lawsuit against CNN in which he claimed the network falsely conveyed to its viewers that he was “the face of an unruly mob” facing an American Indian activist in Washington.
Pierce launched Pierce Bainbridge in 2017 after working at some of the largest U.S. law firms including Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Latham & Watkins.
His firm previously represented Giuliani in connection with a probe by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office into whether the former New York mayor broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine. Giuliani has not been charged with wrongdoing.
Pierce Bainbridge also represented Tulsi Gabbard, a U.S. congresswoman from Hawaii and former Democratic presidential hopeful, who sued Hillary Clinton in January after Clinton described the Hawaii congresswoman as being ""groomed to run as a third-party candidate"" by Russia in a 2019 interview.
Gabbard dropped the defamation lawsuit in May. 
Pierce personally represents former Trump adviser Carter Page in his lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee for a dossier it commissioned in 2016 that alleged Page and others colluded with Russia to help Trump get elected.
In recent months, Pierce Bainbridge has been hit by a string of departures and mired in litigation. It is facing at least three lawsuits from litigation funders who say they are owed millions of dollars. 
In one of the lawsuits filed in New York Supreme Court, Pierce admitted that he owes $3.75 million plus legal fees and interest to the funder. 
He did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the litigation.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A family held hostage by drug traffickers. A violent police shootout on a busy street. A mother killed while shielding her three-year-old daughter from gunfire.
Even for residents accustomed to violence, the last 24 hours have been grim in Rio de Janeiro, as a series of shootouts broke out across the city among warring criminal gangs and police.
It started late Wednesday, when heavily armed members of one of Brazil's largest criminal organizations, Comando Vermelho or Red Command, were driving though the wealthy neighborhood of Lagoa and their car broke down, according to local media.
They exited the car armed and were spotted by passing police officers. Over 40 shots were exchanged, resulting in two arrests and multiple injuries.
But the gang, which was trying to wrest control of the Sao Carlos neighborhood in central Rio from an enemy organization, was undeterred. By evening, an intense shootout ensued there with images of the fighting aired widely by local broadcasters.
One local resident, 25-year-old Ana Cristina da Silva, was walking to a bar where she worked with her three-year-old daughter when they were caught in the crossfire, police said. 
Da Silva wrapped herself around her daughter and was hit by a stray bullet. By the time firefighters brought da Silva to a local hospital, she was dead, according to police.
On Thursday afternoon, after a related shootout with police, one suspect fled into a nearby condominium, taking a family hostage, police said. Later, the suspect freed the family and turned himself in. 
The state of Rio, which includes Rio city and its metropolitan area, registered 3,025 murders in 2019. Rio's notoriously violent police force killed 1,814 people during that period, according to public data.
In May, after a 14-year-old boy at a pool party was killed in a botched raid, provoking widespread protest, Brazil's Supreme Court put in place restrictions on police operations in the state.
Police and local officials complain their hands are unduly tied. Organizations that have denounced police violence say both violent crime and police killings have remained relatively low in the months since that order was put into place.

""Rio has over 1,400 'comunidades,'"" said police spokesman Mauro Fliess, referring to often-poor, crime plagued neighborhoods. ""And four criminal gangs are fighting for control of the area, fist to fist, with weapons of war.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Typhoon Bavi had caused only minimal damage to the country after making landfall early on Thursday, state news media KCNA reported on Friday.
Kim, who visited South Hwanghae province southwest of Pyongyang, had issued an alert to prevent crop damage and casualties from the typhoon, which made landfall near the capital, dumping heavy rains and uprooting trees.
North Korea, which has also been stepping up efforts to combat the novel coronavirus, had referred to Typhoon Bavi as the No. 8 storm.
""He said that the scale of damage from Typhoon No. 8 is smaller than expected, adding that he had worried a lot and he feels it is fortunate to have that amount of damage,"" said KCNA, referring to Kim's remarks.
Kim's visit came after the KCTV state television showed scenes of damage from the storm. Heavy rains earlier this month that caused flooding and damaged crops have raised concerns about food supplies in the isolated country.
Kim praised party officials for taking measures to reduce casualties and minimize damage from the storm. The state news agency did not give further details on the scale of the damage.
South Korea reported no casualties from the storm, while some public facilities were damaged and some experienced power outage.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A 21-year-old man told Reuters he was beaten and humiliated by guards in a Hong Kong prison during his sentence for possessing a Molotov cocktail at an anti-government protest in October.
Roy Cheung said guards routinely slapped him, hit him with rulers and elbowed his spine at the Pik Uk Correctional Institution in Hong Kong’s New Territories.
In one instance, on Feb. 7, he said he was targeted for beating because he was one of six prisoners who sang the pro-democracy protest anthem “Glory to Hong Kong.”
“We sang in the cell,” said Cheung. “We were punished the next day.” Cheung said a guard told him to say thank you as he slapped him once.  
Cheung, who served his eight-month sentence from Nov. 2 to June 30, told Reuters he filed an official complaint about the beatings to the Complaints Investigation Unit of Hong Kong’s Correctional Services Department, which runs the city’s prisons, in May. Reuters did not see a copy of the complaint, which was made while Cheung was in prison, and which Cheung said he was not given a copy of. 
The commissioner replied in a letter dated July 10, seen by Reuters, that the Complaints Investigation Unit was investigating his complaint. 
A representative of the Correctional Services Department declined comment on Cheung’s complaint, saying the department does not comment on individual cases. The person said the department’s Complaints Investigation Unit would conduct a fair, just and detailed investigation of every complaint.
Cheung told Reuters he wanted to make his complaint public in an effort to prevent mistreatment of other protesters who are still detained at Pik Uk. 
Four other 18 and 19-year-old pro-democracy protesters, who asked to be identified only by their first names Tom, Ivan, Jackson and Henry, described similar abuse as they were held at Pik Uk after courts refused to grant them bail when they were charged with protest-related offences. The four have since been released from Pik Uk and are awaiting trial. 
The men said the prison guards hit them in ways to avoid bruising and scars and in places in the prison where there was no CCTV, such as near staircases outside the activity room or inside bathrooms. 
The Correctional Services Department told Reuters it was investigating the allegations made by the men. 
None of the men has filed an official complaint with the Correctional Services Department, saying they feared retaliation by guards if they have to return to Pik Uk. 
Cheung told Reuters his cell was inspected by guards every day after he filed a complaint and that he was put in solitary confinement for some periods.
HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLAINT
In June, pro-democracy organization Demosisto filed a complaint on behalf of Tom, Ivan and Jackson about alleged abuse at the prison with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The United Nations declined to comment.
According to Demosisto’s complaint, which was made public in June, guards at Pik Uk targeted protest prisoners by slapping them, elbowing them in the spine, and hitting their hands and feet with sticks, rulers and police batons. The Correctional Services Department declined comment on the complaint. 
Joshua Wong, former secretary-general of pro-democracy group Demosisto who was imprisoned in 2017 for his role in Hong Kong's 2014 'Umbrella' protests, told Reuters he was subjected to demeaning treatment in prison, such as being made to squat naked while being questioned by guards in an area of the prison with no CCTV. 
He made an official complaint to the Correctional Services Department, but an internal investigation by the department concluded last year that his complaint was unfounded on the grounds that there was no evidence. The Correctional Services Department declined to comment on the decision, saying it could not comment on individual cases. 
Demosisto, which called for a referendum to determine Hong Kong’s sovereignty, was disbanded on June 30 as China passed a national security law which makes anything Beijing regards as subversion or promoting independence punishable by life in prison.
Lam Tsz-wai, senior information officer in the office of Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam, referred Reuters back to the prisons department for comment on the complaints made by Cheung and the other men.
China's foreign ministry declined comment. The State Council Information Office and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing also did not reply to a faxed request for comment.
The 385-person capacity Pik Uk Correctional Institution is used to incarcerate males between the ages of 16 and 21 who are awaiting trial or have been convicted of crimes.
According to Hong Kong lawmaker Shiu Ka Chun, who has visited Pik Uk regularly over the past year and gathered information from prisoners there, at least 55 male protesters have been held in custody at the prison since June 2019. Of those, he said 22 are still there. The prisons department said it does not have data on the number of people in detention related to the demonstrations. 
Hong Kong police said they have arrested 9,672 people and charged 2,093 people since pro-democracy protests turned violent in June last year.

In May, the first protester to plead guilty to the charge of rioting during last year's protests was sentenced to four years in prison. More than 1,600 await trial on charges related to the protests, according to government data.

Hoping to win a second term in November and trailing Biden in opinion polls, President Donald Trump has used this week's Republican National Convention to promise a ""law and order"" response to protests against racial injustice.
In Kenosha, Wisconsin, relative calm returned after multiple nights of looting and two violent deaths in response to an officer who on Sunday fired seven shots at the back of 29-year-old Jacob Blake, paralyzing him.
Harris, a U.S. senator who previously served as California's attorney general, said she supported peaceful protesters.
""We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including the shooter who was arrested for murder. And make no mistake, we will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice,"" Harris said in a speech from a university auditorium in Washington streamed online.
Protests drew an array of rifle-toting civilians, among them 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, who was arrested on Wednesday on homicide charges in connection with Tuesday night's shootings in which the two people were killed. 
Trump said on Wednesday he was sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha. He planned to attack Biden at Thursday's final night of the convention.
Biden countered by saying Trump was to blame for the way the coronavirus pandemic and racial strife had spread across the United States.

""These guys are rooting for violence. That's what it's all about,"" Biden said on CNN. ""To prove the issue 'be scared of Joe Biden,' they're pointing to what's happening in Donald Trump's America.""

The report added that Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is worried about further job losses, as well as the financial cost of running near-empty trains and buses.
""Clearly people should be going back to work because it is safe to do so. There are already problems with workers' mental health. It's not just about hard-nosed economics,"" the report said, citing a Cabinet minister. 
""There will be some economic consequences of shutdown. Companies will realise some people weren’t working as hard as they thought … There is going to be a review of how productive people are.""

The NZ$204 billion ($135 billion) market, which is nearing a record high, has been the target of distributed-denial-of-service attacks that have overwhelmed its website and forced trading halts since Tuesday. Exchange operator NZX said earlier it had been working with cyber-security experts to address the issue and was confident the market would “open as normal today.”
“We are currently experiencing connectivity issues which appear similar to those caused by severe DDoS attacks from offshore this week,” NZX said after the market failed to open at 10 a.m. in Wellington. It said it has extended the pre-open for the NZX main board and Fonterra shareholders market, while the debt market has been placed into a halt. The NZX derivatives market remains open.
A criminal gang has recently launched DDoS attacks against some of the world’s biggest financial service providers and demanded Bitcoin payments as extortion fees to stop their attacks, according to a report on the ZDNet website. It referenced an Aug. 24 statement by security intelligence company Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), which said it had been tracking attacks from the so-called Armada Collective and Fancy Bear actors who are sending ransom letters to companies in finance, travel and e-commerce.
NZX has declined to comment on the source of the attacks or whether any demands have been made. The disruptions are frustrating investors who were unable to trade amid a busy company earnings season.
The outages are “hugely disruptive for everyone,” said Michael Midgley, Chief Executive Officer of the New Zealand Shareholders’ Association. “Our main concern, aside from any attempted incursion, is that it is potentially damaging to information flows. In the Covid world the audience is keenly watching to see how reported data relates to forecasts.”

The Lebanese army said on its Twitter account that it had deployed units to Khaldeh town to ""control the situation"" and restore calm. 
The Lebanese army and the security source said gunfire was exchanged. Local media showed footage of heavy gunfire and fires blazing in buildings in the area. 
The confrontation erupted after a row a few days ago over a banner marking the Shi'ite Muslim Ashoura religious ritual in an area where both Shi'ites and Sunnis reside, the security source, a second official and a senior official said. The Lebanese army also cited a dispute over the banner in their tweeted statement. 
Several hours following the initial clashes, the senior official said tensions had calmed down. The Lebanese army said it had arrested four people in connection with the clashes.
Several political parties voiced concern over the incident as it continued to unfold, reflecting a country on edge amid fears it could escalate and compound Lebanon's multiple crises amid a political vacuum. 
Major General Abbas Ibrahim, a top Lebanese security official, called Shi'ite parties Hezbollah and Amal and Sunni politician Saad al-Hariri to calm the situation, the senior official said. 
Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, who has followers and influence in the Khaldeh area, said the highway to the south and the security of citizens in the area were paramount.
""It is forbidden for any party political or sectarian side to mess with the road and the region that is for everyone,"" he wrote on Twitter.

When it comes to measuring China’s compliance with promises to buy more American farm goods as part of a landmark trade pact between the world’s two biggest nations, the U.S. top agriculture negotiator seems to have mellowed out.
In a speech at a U.S. Soybean Export Council webinar, Gregg Doud steered clear of comments on the binding nature of the phase-one trade deal, its enforcement mechanisms and the ability to re-impose tariffs. When asked about the sanctions for non-compliance, he stressed: “This is a two-year commitment,” referring to the duration of the agreement between the two countries, which was signed in mid-January and kicked off a month later.
Thursday’s speech was in sharp contrast with previous appearances by the U.S. Trade Representative’s chief agricultural negotiator. At the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s annual forum in February, he said both nations would meet monthly to discuss progress and that a lack of compliance could allow each of the nations to impose tariffs equivalent to the size of the damage.
“There’s going to continue to be a dialogue and discussion, and keep in mind this is a two-year commitment, so you are going to have to look at this over time,” he said. “Everyone wants to measure month to month to month, how we are doing there. At least from my perspective, we have to give this some time.”
American farm exports to China have been running behind the pace need to reach the $36.5 billion pledged for 2020. Shipments of agricultural and related products to the Asian nation totaled $7.63 billion from January to July, Census Bureau data showed Tuesday. That’s about 23% of the target. The USDA’s forecast also cast doubt over whether the targets will be reached for in the two-year deal.
Doud was positive about meat sales to China, with pork exports in the first half of the year climbing to a record, he said. He also added that China has bought a lot of corn and recently ramped up purchases of soybeans, which are now back to levels prior to the trade war, he said.
Beyond purchases, China also completed 50 of the 57 structural changes it agreed to make under the phase-one deal to facilitate agricultural trade, he said, highlighting the opening of beef and poultry markets as well as changes that allowed dairy exports to rise more than 20%. The U.S. now has 3,500 facilities approved to export agricultural products to China, up from 1,500.
“There’s a lot of discussion and dialogue that continues between the U.S. and China, not only in this area of agriculture but overall,” he said, adding that the Asian nation is following through with its plans.
“It isn’t just rhetoric, they are making purchases and hopefully now the pace that we have going here we are able to sustain.”

39,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>","Trudeau Minister Stays Hopeful on Detainees, Plays Down China Vaccine Woes","(Bloomberg) -- Justin Trudeau’s top diplomat downplayed any political link to the potential collapse of a partnership between Canada and a Chinese company on a coronavirus vaccine.
Chinese customs hasn’t approved shipments of a drug developed by Tianjin-based CanSino Biologics Inc. for testing in Canada, according to the National Research Council, and the government agency will turn its focus to other partners as a result.
That failure wasn’t “necessarily” tied to the bitter feud with Beijing that erupted with Canada’s arrest of a top Chinese executive on a U.S. extradition request in 2018, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said Thursday.
China detained two Canadians and halted billions of dollars of agricultural imports in the weeks that followed, souring the Trudeau government’s ties with the nation’s second-largest trading partner.
“We are going through a difficult time,” Champagne told reporters on a teleconference from Beirut, detailing his efforts to press for the release of the Canadians as the extradition case against Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer proceeds in Vancouver. “I would not necessarily make a link between that discussion and the Canadian or the Chinese position when it comes to working on global health.”
While CanSino issued a statement Thursday saying its partnership with Canada “has not been terminated,” the National Research Council appears fed up with bureaucratic delays.
In an email Wednesday, the agency said the Chinese government introduced changes regarding the export of vaccines after the partnership agreement was reviewed and signed. “The process is not clear to the NRC,” it said. “We have no indication of when or if this will occur.”
Champagne also said he was hopeful of progress on the detained Canadians after what he described as a “robust discussion” with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi this week in Rome. The 90-minute meeting Tuesday evening, which was not previously scheduled, came together with the help of the Italian government.
“I’m cautiously optimistic that our voice has been heard, and I’m looking forward to improvement on the consular side,” Champagne said.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 04:41PM ET</span>",Russian prosecutors say no need for criminal investigation in Navalny affair,"By Anton Zverev, Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber and Polina Ivanova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian prosecutors said on Thursday they saw no need for a criminal investigation into the sudden illness of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who his supporters suspect was poisoned, as they had found no sign that any crime had been committed.
The Interior Ministry said it had started a preliminary investigation into the case, but this was routine.
Navalny, 44, was airlifted to Germany on Saturday after collapsing during a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow. He is in a medically-induced coma in a Berlin hospital and his supporters said on Thursday his condition remained serious, with no major reason for optimism. 
The hospital said its initial medical examination pointed to poisoning, though Russian doctors who had treated Navalny in a Siberian hospital have contradicted that diagnosis.
The Kremlin has so far defied calls from Germany, the United States and other powers to investigate the circumstances around Navalny's illness, saying there is no reason to do so until poisoning is definitively confirmed. 
While a statement by the Russian Prosecutor General's office said it did not see the need for an investigation, it said German authorities have agreed to cooperate with Russia on the case. The office said it had asked Germany to share information about Navalny's treatment and promised to give some back in exchange. 
The Siberian branch of the Interior Ministry's transportation unit said it was carrying out a preliminary investigation after Navalny's flight made an emergency landing in the city of Omsk. 
It had inspected the hotel room where Navalny had stayed in Tomsk and the routes he had taken in the city, as well as analysing video surveillance footage from the area, it said. The ministry did not find any drugs or other potent substances.
Navalny's supporters have repeatedly said they believe Navalny was poisoned, pointing to his symptoms as well as the German clinic's initial diagnosis.
""What more does the Prosecutor's Office need ... for them to have a reason to open an investigation?"" asked Lyubov Sobol, a close Navalny ally.
Navalny has long been a thorn in the Kremlin's side, exposing what he says is high-level graft and mobilising crowds of young protesters. He has been repeatedly detained, sued over his investigations into corruption and barred from running in the 2018 presidential election.
""I want to say straight off, there should be no super optimistic expectations right now ... The assassination attempt was very serious, it was almost successful,"" Leonid Volkov, the chief of staff for Navalny's campaign, said in a live YouTube briefing.
""It was very lucky, his system was strong and it didn't kill him ... We must understand that we will not get our Alexei back soon the way that he was,"" Volkov added.
The Kremlin has dismissed as ""hot air"" allegations by Navalny's supporters that it was somehow involved in his illness.
European Union ministers are set to discuss Navalny's condition this week.

Russia is already under Western sanctions after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine six years ago, and another stand-off with European nations or the United States may hurt its economy further.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several voting rights' group have asked a federal judge to force Ohio to expand the number of ballot drop boxes in the upcoming presidential election, the latest legal clash in the partisan war over mail ballots. 
The lawsuit, filed Wednesday night in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, challenges an Aug. 12 directive issued by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, that permits only one secure ballot drop box in each of the state’s 88 counties.
Drop boxes, which allow voters to submit mail ballots and bypass the U.S. Postal Service, have become the latest partisan battleground in the election wars. Democrats are seeking to expand the number of drop boxes, particularly in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, while Republicans are seeking to limit or exclude them altogether.
The Nov. 3 election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden promises to be the nation’s largest test of voting by mail and the two major parties are locked in numerous lawsuits that will shape how millions of Americans vote this autumn.
“It is time for Ohio’s highest election official to stop using voter suppression tactics, and focus his efforts on making sure all Ohio voters can safely cast their ballot during this unprecedented pandemic,” said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which is helping represent the plaintiffs that include the League of Women Voters of Ohio and the Ohio State Conference of the NAACP.  
Maggie Sheehan, a spokeswoman for LaRose, said the secretary supports additional options for voters but also must abide by laws that restrict the use of ballot boxes. 

""His focus at this time remains on getting the Ohio Controlling Board to permit him to pay postage on absentee ballots, effectively making every blue mail box an absentee drop box,"" Sheehan said.

(Reuters) - The United States and China traded jibes as military tensions grow between the world's two largest economies, with the U.S. defence chief vowing not to ""cede an inch"" in the Pacific and China saying Washington was risking soldiers' lives.
Both are at loggerheads over issues from technology and human rights to Chinese military activities in the disputed South China Sea, with each accusing the other of deliberately provocative behaviour.
In the latest U.S. move against China ahead of November's presidential election, Washington on Wednesday blacklisted 24 Chinese companies and targeted individuals over construction and military actions in the busy South China Sea waterway.
In Hawaii, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Beijing is using an aggressive military modernisation programme in a bid to project power globally.
""To advance the CCP's agenda, the People's Liberation Army continues to pursue an aggressive modernisation plan to achieve a world class military by the middle of the century,"" Esper said, referring to the ruling Chinese Communist Party.
""This will undoubtedly involve the PLA's provocative behaviour in the South and East China Seas, and anywhere else the Chinese government has deemed critical to its interests.""
However, the United States also wants to ""hopefully continue to work with the People's Republic of China to get them back on a trajectory that is more aligned with the international rules based order,"" Esper added.
Speaking before a regional tour, Esper described the Indo-Pacific as the epicentre of a ""great power competition with China"".
He added, ""We're not going to cede this region, an inch of ground if you will, to another country, any other country that thinks their form of government, their views on human rights, their views on sovereignty, their views on freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, all those things, that somehow that's better than what many of us share.""
In Beijing, China's Defence Ministry shot back at ""certain U.S. politicians"" it said were damaging Sino-U.S. military ties in the run-up to the November election for their own selfish gain, even seeking to create military clashes.
""This kind of behaviour puts the lives of frontline officers and soldiers on both sides at risk,"" spokesman Wu Qian told reporters at a monthly briefing on Thursday. 
China is not scared of ""provocation and pressure"" from the United States, and will resolutely defend itself and not allow the United States to cause trouble, he added.
""We hope the U.S. side will truly adopt a strategic vision, view China's development with an open and rational attitude, and leave behind the quagmire of anxiety and entanglement.""
The tension, including China's drills this week along its coast, have sparked fears of accidental conflict, against which Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen warned on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a U.S. defense official told Reuters that China had launched four medium-range ballistic missiles that hit the South China Sea between Hainan Island and the Paracel Islands.
On Thursday, the Pentagon said it was concerned about China's recent military exercises, including the firing of ballistic missiles.
""Conducting military exercises over disputed territory in the South China Sea is counterproductive to easing tensions and maintaining stability,"" the Pentagon said in a statement.

It added that the U.S. military had told Chinese authorities in July that it would continue to monitor the situation with ""the expectation that the PRC (People’s Republic of China) will reduce its militarization and coercion of its neighbors in the South China Sea.""

The move follows targeted measures to reintroduce restrictions on public life in the worst affected parts of the country, as the government tries to tackle the spread of the virus without resorting to a complete lockdown.
""Due to the threat of spreading SARS CoV-2 virus infections, it is necessary to exercise the right to introduce air traffic bans... in order to minimize the threat to public health,"" the regulation said.
Poland closed its borders and suspended flights in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus. However, it progressively loosened restrictions on public life, with shopping centres, hotels and restaurants all reopening in May.
Polish national airline PLL LOT resumed international flights on July 1 almost four months after suspending them.
Other countries affected by the ban are popular tourist destinations Montenegro and Croatia, as well as Romania, the United States, Israel, Mexico and Brazil.

Poland has reported 64,689 cases of the novel coronavirus and 2,010 deaths.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",Who else but Navalny? Kremlin critic's illness a blow for campaign to break Putin's grip,"By Tom Balmforth and Anton Zverev
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's sudden illness has upended his strategy to challenge Vladimir Putin's grip on power at upcoming regional elections. But it also exposes a longer-term issue - the leadership vacuum within Russia's opposition.
Navalny, 44, now lying in a Berlin hospital after a suspected poisoning, had been urging supporters to vote tactically for candidates running against the ruling United Russia party in mid-September.
Russians will elect 18 governors, as well as local parliaments and city councillors in country-wide voting which is effectively a dry run for parliamentary elections in September 2021.
Though Putin - in his fourth term of office - looks unassailable as Russian leader, the elections take place amid frustration over years of falling wages and a coronavirus lockdown that pushed his approval rating to two-decade lows.
Before Navalny fell ill on Aug. 20 on a flight from Siberia to Moscow, he had cast his campaign as a long-term strategy to short-circuit a political system which often bars his allies from contesting elections, while allowing less outspoken opponents from other parties to run.
Political analyst Abbas Gallyamov, a former Kremlin speechwriter, questioned whether anyone else had the political weight to take the helm of the campaign.
""To force voters to vote en masse, you need someone extremely authoritative,"" he said.
Under Navalny's smart voting plan, supporters receive emails on the eve of regional or local elections telling them to vote for a specific candidate running against United Russia.
The strategy spooked United Russia in 2019, when it lost a third of its seats in Moscow city elections..
But while the campaign largely failed outside Moscow, it has won momentum of late from mass anti-Kremlin protests in the Far East, triggered by the arrest of a governor who had scored a rare election win against United Russia in 2018. 
Navalny's team will press ahead with the strategic voting campaign, his ally Leonid Volkov said. 
""Clearly it is extremely unpleasant for us that Navalny has temporarily been taken out of action,"" he told Reuters, vowing to do everything possible ""to compensate for his temporary absence so that smart voting wins"".
German doctors say Navalny may have been poisoned with a cholinesterase inhibitor, a substance also used in nerve toxins such as one used in the 2018 poisoning of an ex-Russian spy in England. 
The Kremlin says the poisoning diagnosis is inconclusive. 
WHO'S THE LEADER? 
So who within the fragmented opposition could step up if Navalny is incapacitated for months, or even permanently?
Rising to prominence during the demonstrations of 2011, Navalny is the undisputed leader of the opposition outside official structures.
His YouTube videos detailing corruption allegations against officials reach millions of Russians, making him a thorn in the side of the Kremlin.
""Of course what happened was aimed at decapitating the opposition,"" Andrei Kolesnikov, an analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center think-tank. 
But a source close to the Kremlin said smart voting had annoyed the government but was not really a huge threat. The opposition faced a bigger problem, the person said, adding: 
""He is bright, young, handsome, famous, has found his own style...when will the same appear? Not soon.""
But Volkov said the voting strategy was not tied to Navalny the person. Aside from Volkov, another Navalny ally is Lyubov Sobol, a 32-year old lawyer who was prominent in last year's protests in Moscow. Other allies include activists Ivan Zhdanov and Georgy Alburov.
Sobol declined to be interviewed for this article.
Leading Russia's opposition is an unappealing proposition.
Navalny has been targeted multiple times by pro-Kremlin activists, being attacked in 2016 during a trip to southern Russia and twice in 2017 when a green dye thrown at him, temporarily lost him the vision in one eye. 
The 2014 jailing of his brother for fraud was also seen by many as politically motivated.

""This challenges the opposition to seek a new leader. But some new one will appear. A sacred place never stays empty for long,"" the Kremlin-linked source said.

47,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>","Greece ratifies deal with Egypt, Turkey to hold military drills in east Mediterranean","ISTANBUL/ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece ratified an accord on maritime boundaries with Egypt on Thursday, hours after Turkey extended the operation of a seismic survey vessel in the Eastern Mediterranean and said it will hold firing exercises in the region next month.
NATO allies Greece and Turkey are at odds over the rights to potential hydrocarbon resources in the area, based on conflicting claims over the extent of their continental shelves.
Tensions escalated this month after Ankara dispatched the Oruc Reis seismic survey vessel in a disputed area following the pact between Athens and Cairo. 
Turkey has said the pact infringes its own continental shelf. The agreement also overlaps with maritime zones Turkey agreed with Libya last year, decried as illegal by Greece.
The Aug 6 maritime deal has already been ratified by Egypt's parliament and was approved by a majority of Greek lawmakers on Thursday evening.
Earlier, the Turkish navy issued the latest advisory, known as a Navtex, saying it will hold the shooting exercises in the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Iskenderun, northeast of Cyprus on Sept 1-2. It also extended the seismic work of the Oruc Reis vessel southwest of Cyprus, until Sept 1.
Greece says the Turkish advisories are illegal. 
Maritime zones give a state rights over natural resources. Largely unexplored, the east Mediterranean is thought to be rich in natural gas.
As the dispute widened, France said on Wednesday it was joining military exercises with Italy, Greece and Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean.
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said the deployment of French military aircraft in Cyprus violated treaties regarding the control and administration of the island after independence from Britain in 1960.
Aksoy said that France's stance was dangerously encouraging Greece and Cyprus to further escalate tensions in the region.
Cyprus was divided in 1974 following a Turkish invasion triggered by a Greek-inspired coup. Turkey recognises the Turkish-populated north of Cyprus as a separate state, which is not recognised by other countries.
Greece said on Wednesday it plans to extend its territorial waters in the Ionian Sea to 12 nautical miles from its coast, from six nautical miles, after the ratification of a maritime deal with Italy. 

To the east of Greece, Turkey has warned that a similar move by Athens in waters east of Greece would be a cause for war.

MOSCOW/MINSK (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday the Kremlin had set up a police force to support Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko at his request, although it would not be deployed unless unrest there spun out of control.
The remarks were the strongest signal yet that Russia is prepared to use force if needed in Belarus, where mass demonstrations have taken place since an Aug. 9 election that the opposition says was rigged to prolong Lukashenko's 26-year rule.
""We have of course certain obligations towards Belarus, and the question Lukashenko raised was whether we would provide the necessary help,"" Putin told state television. 
""I told him Russia would fulfil all its obligations. Alexander Grigorivich (Lukashenko) asked me to create a reserve police force and I have done that. But we agreed this would not be used unless the situation got out of control.""
The Belarusian opposition Coordination Council said Moscow's move to set up such force violated international law.
Poland, a NATO member and neighbour, also demanded Russia jettison any plans to intervene. Poland ""urges Russia to immediately withdraw from plans of a military intervention in Belarus, under (the) false excuse of 'restoring control' – a hostile act, in breach of international law and human rights of Belarusian people, who should be free to decide their own fate,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in a tweet.
Belarus plunged into turmoil following the election. Security forces have beaten protesters and arrested thousands in a bid to stamp out mass demonstrations and strikes.
After the police appeared to take a less aggressive posture last week, arrests of protesters have again increased.
""The last two days we see a strengthening of repression,"" Valentin Stefanovich, an activist at the civil rights group Spring, told Reuters. ""The authorities waited for the activity on the streets to taper off and then started their push. I hope that at least the abuse and torture has stopped.""
On Thursday, police detained about 20 journalists preparing to cover a protest in central Minsk, including a Reuters cameraman. Their telephones and identity documents were confiscated. Scores of protesters were also arrested. 
The Interior Ministry said the journalists had been driven to a police station to check they had valid accreditaton. Those with proper documents would be released.
Around 1,000 people gathered on the main square, some forming a chain and praying, while police and soldiers massed.
RUSSA'S BUFFER AGAINST NATO
Belarus is Russia's closest ally among ex-Soviet states, and its fortified frontiers with NATO members are crucial to Moscow's defence strategy. Moscow and Minsk have even proclaimed a ""union state"", complete with a Soviet-style red flag.
Lukashenko has had a difficult personal relationship with Putin. Nevertheless, Russia has taken steps to shore him up, such as sending journalists to staff state TV after employees resigned to protest against what they called propaganda.
Lukashenko said he had agreed with Putin to refinance a maturing $1 billion loan, though Russia's finance ministry said it had not received any such request.
The West has so far acted cautiously, wary of provoking a Russian military response as took place in Ukraine in 2014.
In Berlin, EU foreign ministers discussed possible sanctions against a short list of up to 20 Belarusians blamed for electoral fraud or the abuse of protesters.
Lukashenko has accused the West of massing troops on Belarus's frontiers. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg denied this.

""We respect the sovereignty and there is no military build-up by NATO close to Belarus,"" he told Reuters. ""We call on Russia to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of an independent country, Belarus.""

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Flood waters in Sudan have reached the highest levels on record, killing dozens of people, destroying thousands of homes and encroaching on some neighbourhoods of the capital Khartoum.
The flooding comes despite Ethiopia starting to fill the reservoir behind a giant new dam upstream on the Blue Nile in July. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is expected to help Sudan control future floods. 
Flooding regularly hits Sudan in summer, but this year's unprecedented water levels have left larger tracts of farmland submerged and residents around Khartoum are looking anxiously outside their homes for fear of the rising waters.
Flood waters have spilled over into major roads in Khartoum for the first time in living memory. 
""The waters of the Nile flooded our house at midnight yesterday,"" said Ahmed Bastawy, a resident of Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman, who stayed up all night trying to protect his house only to see some of its mud brick walls collapse.
""We have never seen flooding like this. Authorities provided us with soil and sacks, but we failed to block the waters and the houses were destroyed."" 
The average level of the Blue Nile has reached 17.43 metres, the highest since the country started measuring in 1912, Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas said on Thursday.
Blue Nile waters would continue to rise in the coming days, said Abdelrahman Sughairun, head of the ministry's flood committee.
As of Tuesday the floods had left 86 people dead, destroyed more than 18,000 homes and damaged a further 32,000, according to the interior ministry.
The reservoir behind the GERD is expected to be gradually filled over the next few years as the dam begins to operate, though Ethiopia is yet to agree on its operating terms with downstream countries Sudan and Egypt.

""After the filling of the Renaissance Dam it's expected that floods won't happen,"" Abbas said.

PARIS (Reuters) - France has suspended the glue-trapping of songbirds this year but stopped short of abolishing the controversial practice which is criticised as barbaric by bird lovers and banned under European Union regulations. 
President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement on Thursday that, following a meeting with environment minister Barbara Pompili and hunting federation president Willy Schraen, the quota for hunting thrushes and blackbirds with glue traps will be set to zero this year. 
France is the only country to still allow the catching of birds with glue traps - and other ""traditional"" methods such as snares and nets - despite a 1979 European Union ban.
Under a 1989 decree allowing glue trapping as long as it is ""selective, controlled and in limited quantity"", France has allowed the practice every year despite protests by bird protection organisations, who say that glue traps cause severe stress and that protected species are also caught in them. 
""This is a good result, because until now every year an exception was made allowing the hunt. But they are not banning the practice, only suspending it,"" France Bird Protection Association president Yves Verilhac told Reuters. 
The association says glue trapping is a ""cruel and odious"" practice from a bygone era and that France should join other EU nations in outlawing it completely. 
Verilhac said Macron was merely responding to a July 4 European Union injunction and the threat of EU legal action against France.
The Elysee palace statement said France was awaiting a response from the European Court of Justice about legal issues involving glue trapping.
Hunting federation chief Schraen said on BFM televison that there was no reason to ban glue trapping and that his association would fight the decision in court. 
""There are just a few thousand hunters in the south of France and they have been doing this for decades. It has no impact on bird numbers"" he said.
He said that no protected species were being caught this way and that the suspension was a purely political decision.

""I defend these rural values, which must continue,"" he said.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",Wisconsin police officer who shot Jacob Blake is 31-year-old with 7 years on the force,"By Jan Wolfe and Nathan Layne
(Reuters) - The white police officer who shot Jacob Blake, paralyzing the Black man and setting off civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has served on the city's police force for seven years and once told a local newspaper he had always wanted to be a policeman.
Wisconsin officials have identified Rusten Sheskey, 31, of the Kenosha Police Department as the man who shot Blake, 29, multiple times in the back on Sunday as Blake was opening the door of his car where three of his children were sitting. 
The officer's records show that he was suspended for one day in 2017 for a driving-related infraction.
The shooting, captured on video by a bystander, sparked four nights of protests that at times erupted into arson and widespread vandalism. On Tuesday night, a white, 17-year-old self-styled militia member shot three people, killing two, authorities said. The teenager, Kyle Rittenhouse, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with homicide.
Blake's shooting was the most recent in a long series of often-deadly incidents involving Black men, women or children and police or self-styled vigilantes. The May 25 killing of George Floyd, in which a Minneapolis police officer knelt on Floyd's neck touched off a summer of nationwide protests.
The Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating the Blake shooting with help from the FBI and plans to provide a report on the incident within 30 days to a prosecutor, who will determine whether to criminally charge Sheskey. The U.S. Department of Justice has also launched a civil rights investigation into the shooting.
Sheskey - who is now on administrative leave, routine in police-involved shootings in Kenosha - did not respond to emails seeking comment. He joined the city's police department in 2013 and has been part of a unit that patrols by bicycle. Before that, he was a University of Wisconsin-Parkside police officer for about three years.
The Kenosha News in a 2019 article quoted Sheskey as saying ""for the most part"" he had always wanted to be a police officer. Sheskey's grandfather also worked in the Kenosha Police Department.
""What I like most is that you’re dealing with people on perhaps the worst day of their lives and you can try and help them as much as you can and make that day a little bit better,"" Sheskey told the newspaper's series spotlighting local residents. ""We may not be able to make a situation right, or better, but we can maybe make it a little easier for them to handle during that time.""
Public records link Sheskey to a home in Kenosha, a city of about 100,000 people near Lake Michigan and about 35 miles (56 km) south of Milwaukee.

Caruana Galizia, who wrote extensively about corruption on Malta, was killed by a car bomb in October 2017. Wealthy entrepreneur Yorgen Fenech was arrested last November and accused of complicity in the murder. He has denied the accusation.
Police inspector Kurt Zahra, one of the officers who interrogated Fenech, told a court that the businessman had said Keith Schembri, the chief of staff of the then prime minister, had wanted Caruana Galizia killed. 
Zahra said Fenech had quoted Schembri as saying ""proceed, proceed, proceed,"" in 2016 after discussing a murder plan.
Fenech also said Schembri had paid middleman Melvin Theuma 85,000 euros ($100,500) for the murder. Theuma has been granted a presidential pardon to reveal all about the killing.
Schembri was a friend of Fenech and resigned from his post last year after the businessman was arrested. He made no immediate comment on Thursday about Zahra's testimony. He has previously denied having any knowledge of the murder.
Zahra told the court that Fenech had also alleged that then Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had later known of his involvement in the plot, and had told him, after the murder, to ""control"" Theuma. 
Muscat, who resigned in January, issued a statement on Thursday denying having known of the murder beforehand, or of having discussed it with Fenech. 
Fenech is in jail as the court continues to hear evidence in the case ahead of his trial. He made no comment on Thursday.
Caruana Galizia was one of Malta's best-known investigative journalists. She wrote extensively about allegations of corruption in the political and business worlds. Her killing has raised questions about the rule of law in the tiny country.

Accepting a petition by Palestinian plaintiffs, Israel's top court overturned a 2018 District Court ruling which had broken judicial ground by recognising the Mitzpe Kramim settlers' claim to the land, despite it being owned by Palestinians. 
The District Court had declared the settlers the legal owners, finding that Israeli authorities were unaware the land was privately owned when they originally mapped out the area.
That ruling was based on an Israeli law which states that transactions with legal faults could be valid if they were conducted in ""good faith."" 
Established 20 years ago on a hilltop overlooking the Jordan Valley, Mitzpe Kramim is home to about 40 families, most of whom live on Palestinian-owned plots and say they received Israeli authorities' approval to set up there. 
But the Supreme Court said that the Israeli authorities had not acted in good faith by ""turning a blind eye to the many warning signs given over many years"" which showed the plots were actually owned by Palestinians. 
Placing most of the responsibility for what it called ""the painful outcome for Mitzpe Kramim's residents"" on the state, the court gave authorities 36 months to find alternative housing for them. 
Most countries consider the settlements built on land Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war as illegal. Israel and the United States dispute this. The Palestinians want the West Bank as part of a future state.

About 450,000 Israeli settlers live in the territory among some three million Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to annex parts of the West Bank was shelved this month in a diplomatic deal with the United Arab Emirates

The charging of Williams, 67, in a document called a criminal information follows the guilty plea in June of Williams' successor Gary Jones. A criminal information is a court document typically used when the government has reached a plea deal with a defendant to plead guilty.
Williams, of Corona, California, was charged with conspiring with Jones and others to embezzle money between 2010 and September 2019, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit. Williams was the head of the union from June 2014 to June 2018.
""The charges today are further steps forward in our relentless effort to ensure that the over 400,000 men and women of the UAW have honest and ethical leadership,"" U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider said in a statement. 
Schneider has said the union still needs to reform and a federal takeover remains an option.
Based on the charges, Williams faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, prosecutors said.
Attorneys for Williams could not immediately be reached to comment.
Williams is the 15th defendant to be charged in connection with an ongoing criminal investigation into corruption within the UAW or relating to illegal payoffs to UAW officials by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) executives.
Williams accepted housing for himself and friends at private villas in Palm Springs, California, golf clothing and other merchandise, rounds of golf, meals, high-end liquor and cigars provided by co-conspirators, all paid for with union funds, prosecutors said.
The union said anyone who violates their responsibility to oversee members' dues money should face criminal penalty.
""Today's development is a sad day for UAW members,"" the union said in a statement. ""Let us begin to turn the page to a better union -- but let us never forget the painful lessons of the past.""

An arraignment date for Williams has not been set.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia has given the green light for a U.S. Army unit to restart an advisory mission in the country after senators found its activities did not constitute deployment of foreign troops, the defense minister said on Thursday. 
A court ordered the government to suspend training conducted by the 53-person U.S. specialist unit at the start of July after a group of opposition legislators filed legal action, saying movement of foreign troops in the country should be authorized by the Senate.
After President Ivan Duque submitted information demonstrating his ""political control"" of the unit's activities, 69 lawmakers from seven parties signed a letter saying the unit's presence did not constitute deployment of foreign troops, but is cooperation in the fight against drugs.
""The president, in exercising his constitutional powers, has allowed training and assessment by U.S. military personnel to continue,"" Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo told journalists. 
Colombia faces constant pressure from the United States, a top destination for cocaine, to reduce the size of crops of coca, the drug's chief ingredient. 
Duque has set a target to destroy 130,000 hectares of coca crops this year, up from 100,000 last year, and has signaled aerial spraying of the herbicide glyphosate could restart. 
Last year cocaine production capacity in Colombia rose 1.5% to 1,137 metric tons according to the United Nations, even though the size of coca crops fell to their lowest level in six years. 
This month the United States said it would help Colombia harness billions of dollars in investments to drive economic and social development and improve security in rural zones affected by drug trafficking.

LISBON (Reuters) - Stricter measures to curb the coronavirus outbreak will be introduced across Portugal from mid-September as students return to schools and many workers go back to the office, the government said on Thursday. 
Cabinet Affairs Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva told a news conference the new measures would only be announced in early September but said the whole country would be put under the so-called state of contingency. 
""The measures will be worked out over the next few days and presented after a meeting between experts and policy makers,"" said Vieira da Silva. 
At the moment the only area in Portugal under the contingency category is Greater Lisbon, where gatherings are limited 10 people, compared to 20 for the rest of the country. 
The announcement came with the number of coronavirus cases in Portugal increasing, from 145 on Monday this week to nearly 400 on Thursday, with most of the infections reported in and around the capital. 
""We do not yet know whether yesterday's and today's increase means there is a growing trend,"" Vieira da Silva said. ""It is too early to draw that conclusion.""
The southern European nation, which has reported 56,673 cases so far, initially won praise for its quick response to the pandemic, but a wave of localised outbreaks in Lisbon worried authorities and forced them to re-impose some restrictions.
Concerns are now surfacing as the around 2 million students in Portugal, a nation of just over 10 million people, prepare to return to in-person classes from September 14. 

In July, Education Minister Tiago Brandao Rodrigues said face masks would be compulsory for teachers and students, who have been learning from home since March, and social distancing measures would be adopted inside classrooms.

SAN JOAQUIN, Venezuela (Reuters) - When Juan Meza could no longer bear to hear his daughter crying from hunger, the Adventist pastor sold his family's few belongings, gifted his prized fantasy novels and history books to a neighbor and left Venezuela in 2017 for a job at a shoe factory in Colombia. 
For years, Meza felt relief that he could afford to feed his daughters and send them to school, until the coronavirus pandemic erupted and he was dismissed.
Back in Venezuela, instead of teaching theology as he used to do, the 42-year-old wanders the streets of the small town of San Joaquin in northwest Venezuela looking to sell chicken to people willing to pay in dollars or barter for flour and rice.
Like 100,000 other emigres who have returned home amid the pandemic, Meza has been pushed back into the hand-to-mouth existence he fled to escape the hyperinflation, shortages and unemployment created by President Nicolas Maduro's government. 
At 3:45 a.m. on a recent morning, Meza was outside his tin-and-concrete home trying to get cell signal on a 2010-era flip phone to find his chicken supplier. The day's profit goal was $5 but if he could not pick up the chickens, he would get nothing.
""This is apocalyptic but it is just to get us through until we can leave for Brazil,"" said Meza, standing on his pitch-black, pock-marked street in a threadbare blue soccer jersey. As on most days, the power was out.
While the harsh conditions for returning migrants in military-run quarantine centers have drawn criticism, their experience after leaving them is equally difficult: a daily struggle to obtain food to the backdrop of blackouts, water shortages and constant risk of exposure to coronavirus.
At the start of the pandemic, Maduro said returning Venezuelans would be welcomed ""with love and open arms."" He railed against the xenophobia many endured abroad. 
But as the virus threatened to overwhelm Venezuela's crumbling health system, Maduro began blaming those returning for a case count the government says has reached almost 42,000.  
Some officials called returning migrants ""biological weapons"" sent by neighboring Colombian to infect the population.  
Such suspicion greeted Alejandra, a nurse in the city of Barquisimeto, when she returned from Colombia in March before Maduro's government closed the border.
When she got home, her neighbors said she was ""infected,"" and called the police. Though authorities only told her to stay at home for two weeks, she felt treated like a criminal.
Alejandra, who asked not to use her real name, could not find work for four months and, with her savings spent, began feeding her son and aging mother rice and beans once a day. 
Now she worries she could catch the disease at her new job in a deteriorating hospital poorly-equipped to handle coronavirus. 
""We don't have enough masks, protective equipment, nothing,"" she said. ""But it's what I have to do until we leave again.""
Colombia, which estimates around 1.8 million Venezuelans live there, expects a renewed wave of migration once the border reopens and the economy re-starts. 
Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
    
CHICKENS FOR RICE
Meza, his wife Norelis and their two teenage daughters spent seven days camped out on a bridge on the Colombian border in June waiting to get across. 
They slept on the street, bathed in the river and watched as people ahead sold spots in line. They even sold their daughter's hair for cash to be able to eat.
""My mother told me Maduro had said on state TV they would take care of us,"" said Norelis, 45, her lips parting into a sarcastic gap-toothed smile. ""That’s not what happened.""
Upon arrival, the local community council told the family they did not qualify for that month's government-subsidized food box, which provides goods such as rice, flour and spaghetti.
""I don't want to rely on them for food,"" said Norelis, a seamstress who was preparing to set up a small shop when she decided to emigrate. ""I'm angry and tired of having to reinvent myself to survive.""
Meza sold bananas on the street or traded them for bags of rice, but the fruit got too expensive due to gasoline shortages caused by years of government mismanagement, exacerbated by U.S. sanctions. 
He and a nephew started trading small chickens for government-subsidized food, a business that has gotten more difficult due to delays and stoppages in the arrival of the boxes.
Meza is usually out on the streets by 4 a.m. trying to stuff himself into one of the few crowded buses operating, with little time to worry about contracting COVID-19.

By 10:35 a.m., his shirt was soaked in sweat, but he had emptied his bucket. He made $4 and got two bags of flour and six bags of rice. When he got home, the power was still out.

60,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>","Judge rules U.S. government's lethal injections break law, halts execution","By Jonathan Allen and Peter Szekely
(Reuters) - A U.S. District Court judge in Washington ruled on Thursday that the Justice Department's new lethal injection protocol violated drug safety laws and ordered a planned execution for Friday to be halted.
Since resuming federal executions after a 17-year hiatus in July, the Department of Justice has been injecting condemned inmates with lethal doses of pentobarbital, a highly regulated barbiturate. The department executed three murderers in July and a fourth on Thursday and had planned to execute Keith Nelson on Friday.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled that the department was breaking the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) by administering the pentobarbital without a medical practitioner's prescription, agreeing with death row inmates who sued the government.
""Where the government argues that a lethal injection drug is legally and constitutionally permissible because it will ensure a 'humane' death, it cannot then disclaim a responsibility to comply with federal statutes enacted to ensure that the drugs operate humanely,"" Chutkan wrote in a 13-page opinion.
Because pharmaceutical companies refuse to sell pentobarbital for use in executions, the Justice Department has said it is instead paying a pharmacist in secret to mix up small batches of the drug. 
Chutkan ruled that this also violated the FDCA, which forbids pharmacists from making copies of drugs already available on the market after having received safety approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
Justice Department lawyers immediately asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to overturn Chutkan's ruling. 
That court has previously ruled that execution drugs are at least partly governed by drug safety laws. In 2013, it upheld an order, which continues to bind the FDA, that stopped imports of sodium thiopental that were headed to state execution chambers. 
Prior to July, there had been only three federal executions since 1963, all between 2001 and 2003, all using sodium thiopental. As supplies of that drug vanished, Texas, Missouri and other states that use capital punishment switched to using pentobarbital, and the Justice Department announced last year it would follow suit.
Chutkan ruled that Nelson's execution by lethal injection could proceed if the Justice Department avoided copying FDA-approved drugs and had a physician-issued prescription in the condemned prisoner's name. The American Medical Association and other clinicians' groups have said enabling an execution is against medical ethics.
The Justice Department has said it is necessary to promise secrecy to its pentobarbital suppliers. Soon after President Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017, the department spent two years building a small network of companies to make and test the drug, a Reuters investigation found.
Nelson, convicted of raping and murdering 10-year-old Pamela Butler in Kansas in 1999, is one of 16 inmates on federal death row who sued the Justice Department over its lethal injection protocol.
Chutkan issued orders blocking the inmates' executions while the litigation continued, which were swiftly overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year, and three of the plaintiffs have since been executed by the defendants.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Around 3 a.m. each morning this week, Khurshid Alam woke up in his Pakistan home to watch survivors give testimony against the man who shot dead 51 worshippers in New Zealand mosques, including his brother, Naeem, and nephew, Talha.
Divided by thousands of miles, a seven-hour time difference and the coronavirus pandemic shutting borders, Naeem's widow, Ambreen, was among those who faced the shooter in Christchurch High Court and on Thursday heard his sentence.
White supremacist Brenton Tarrant, a 29-year-old Australian, was jailed for life without parole for the March 2019 attacks he launched on two Christchurch mosques while livestreaming.
""It was a very traumatic time, the last few days,"" Alam said from his home in Lahore in eastern Pakistan. ""What we have lost cannot come back, but at least we know that justice has been given.""
Alam had earlier watched the address by his sister-in-law, admiring her bravery. Alam's wife also travelled for days amid the pandemic and spent two weeks in quarantine to provide support for Ambreen, who lives in Christchurch, in court.
Many victims' families have watched from secure video links overseas and more than 50 received support to enter New Zealand, which has largely closed its borders to non-residents.
Ambreen described how her life had capsized since the moment last year, standing in a hospital in the early hours of the morning after the shooting, she realised her missing husband and 21-year old-son were not among the names hospital staff read out as injured.
'ACT OF BRAVERY'
""Since my husband and son passed away, I have never had a proper normal sleep,"" she told the court, and the gunman, on Tuesday. ""I don’t think I ever will.""
She also spoke of her pride in her husband, who was posthumously awarded for courage in Pakistan for charging at the gunman, buying precious time for worshippers to escape.
""Naeem died trying to save others and his act of bravery is something his sons will always feel proud for. His death was a reflection of his life,"" she said.
Ambreen said she felt distressed watching survivor after survivor stand up to address the shooter, but that once she had delivered her speech, she felt a surge of victory.
""It was quite a relief to express my opinion in front of him,"" she said. ""I looked him in the eyes.""
Since losing her eldest son, who had just graduated as an engineer, and her husband and ""best friend"", Ambreen has cared for her two surviving sons, is learning to drive, has taken her family on the Haj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia and endured New Zealand's strict weeks-long lockdown.
Throughout, she said, her anxiety grew over what would happen to the shooter.
When the sentence was finally delivered on Thursday, her family from New Zealand to Pakistan felt some solace.

""I miss them. It's a lifelong struggle for me,” she said. ""But I felt like Naeem and Talha were there with me. I thought: they are waiting for justice to be done.""

BE'ERI, Israel (Reuters) - In a burnt and blackened wheat field along the Gaza border, Israeli firefighters brave the dry summer heat to extinguish blazes caused by fire balloons launched from the Palestinian enclave. 
Palestinians have sent dozens of helium balloons laden with incendiary material across the frontier in recent weeks to push Israel to ease its blockade of the Islamist Hamas-run strip, home to two million people. 
Winds blowing inland from the Mediterranean Sea carry the balloons towards southern Israeli towns and farmland, dripping chemicals as they fly and igniting brush fires when they land. 
""To see the fields near your home burning, it's indescribable, because it's not happening naturally,"" said Haim Yalin, a former member of Israel's parliament who lives in Be'eri, a tiny kibbutz four km (2.5 miles) from the Gaza border.
Local residents and Israeli troops have joined firefighters to fight the blazes. A spokesman for Israel's National Fire and Rescue Authority said some 460 fires so far have ravished mostly open areas, but have also damaged nature reserves. 
Regular party balloons, condoms and large plastic bags are filled with helium and used to make the fire balloons by attaching an incendiary device, some times as simple as a burning string or even a cigarette.
Occasionally the balloons are strapped with explosives. 
In one ashy field, a soldier beat down smoke with a fire broom as another sprayed it with a hose. Nearby, a hollowed out fox skull sat on a bed of charred leaves.
With tensions high, Israel closed its main commercial crossing with the impoverished strip earlier this month and halted fuel imports, causing Gaza's only power plant to shut down. Gaza authorities announced a lockdown on Monday after a coronavirus outbreak in the enclave. 
Israel has struck Hamas facilities almost nightly for the past two weeks, and on Friday the militant group fired a dozen rockets towards Israeli towns. Mediators from the United Nations, Egypt and Qatar have been working for calm. 
Some of the Palestinians who launch the balloons -- they describe themselves as the ""Balloon Units"" -- say they narrowly escaped the Israeli air strikes. 
But potential retaliation wouldn't stop them, they said. 

""We know it is a simple tool - but it causes fires, it causes panic and it shows we will not keep silent as long as our people continue to suffer,"" a Palestinian source close to the Balloon Units said.

A group of military officers, who call themselves the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP), has controlled the West African since Aug. 18, when the mutineers detained Keita at gunpoint and forced him to resign.
Keita's release is one of the demands of Mali's international partners, including France and West Africa's regional bloc, which sent a delegation to Bamako over the weekend to negotiate with coup leaders.
Keita ""was freed this morning, (and) he has returned to his home"", a spokesman for the junta Djibrilla Maiga said, without giving further details.
Keita's whereabouts could not immediately be confirmed. His residence in Bamako appeared deserted at midday with no sign of the usual security presence outside, a local resident said, asking not to be named.
The junta leaders say they mutinied because the country was sinking into chaos and insecurity which they said was largely the fault of poor government. They have promised to oversee a transition to elections within a ""reasonable"" amount of time.
Earlier on Thursday, France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told RTL radio the coup would not stop French military operations against Islamist militants active in central and northern regions, but urged a swift transition of power.
The CNSP told a delegation of West African mediators that they want to stay in power for a three-year transition period, Nigeria said on Wednesday.
In contrast, the regional bloc is seeking for a transitional government of no more than one year.

MADRID (Reuters) - Barcelona's city council on Thursday voted to strip former Spanish King Juan Carlos of all official awards he received from the city, including its highest honour, over allegations of corruption.
The former monarch abruptly left Spain for the United Arab Emirates this month, under the cloud of preliminary investigations into his business dealings in Spain and Switzerland that followed a Swiss newspaper report linking him to an alleged illegal money transfer.
His sudden exit, and a subsequent two-week official silence on his whereabouts, reignited a debate about the role of the monarchy in Spain, where opinion about the institution is sharply divided.
The ex-king, against whom no formal investigation has been opened, has repeatedly declined to comment on the allegations. His lawyer has said he remains at the Spanish prosecutor's disposal.
Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, where a powerful separatist movement has been campaigning for years to establish a republic independent of Spain, and the vote to strip the former king of the awards was carried by separatist parties on the council. Catalans are split over independence.
The honours Juan Carlos received included the prestigious gold medal awarded to people who have distinguished themselves through personal merit or by rendering exceptional services to Barcelona.
City Mayor Ada Colau, whose party abstained in the vote, criticized the royal palace for allowing Juan Carlos to leave the country without facing the allegations surrounding him.
""These are serious events that have generated real alarm... Like all democrats we want transparency and many more answers than the palace has provided so far,"" she said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Looking back on his childhood in the newly declared state of Lebanon nearly a century ago, Salah Tizani says the country was set on course for calamity from the start by colonial powers and sectarian overlords.
Tizani, better known in Lebanon as Abou Salim, was one of Lebanon's first TV celebrities. He shot to fame in the 1960s with a weekly comedy show that offered a political and social critique of the nascent state.
Now aged 92, he lucidly traces the crises that have beset Lebanon - wars, invasions, assassinations and, most recently, a devastating chemicals explosion - back to the days when France carved its borders out of the Ottoman Empire in 1920 and sectarian politicians known as ""the zuama"" emerged as its masters.
""The mistake that nobody was aware of is that people went to bed one day thinking they were Syrians or Ottomans, let's say, and the next day they woke up to find themselves in the Lebanese state,"" Tizani said. ""Lebanon was just thrown together.""
Lebanon's latest ordeal, the Aug. 4 Beirut port explosion that killed some 180 people, injured 6,000 and devastated a swathe of the city, has triggered new reflection on its troubled history and deepened worry for the future.
For many, the catastrophe is a continuation of the past, caused in one way or another by the same sectarian elite that has led the country from crisis to crisis since its inception, putting factions and self-interest ahead of state and nation.
And it comes amid economic upheaval. An unprecedented financial meltdown has devastated the economy, fuelling poverty and a new wave of emigration from a country whose heyday in the 1960s is a distant memory.
The blast also presages a historic milestone: Sept. 1 is the centenary of the establishment of the State of Greater Lebanon, proclaimed by France in an imperial carve-up with Britain after World War One.
For Lebanon's biggest Christian community, the Maronites, the proclamation of Greater Lebanon by French General Henri Gouraud was a welcome step towards independence.
But many Muslims who found themselves cut off from Syria and Palestine were dismayed by the new borders. Growing up in the northern city of Tripoli, Tizani saw the divisions first hand.
As a young boy, he remembers being ordered home by the police to be registered in a census in 1932, the last Lebanon conducted. His neighbours refused to take part.
""They told them 'we don't want to be Lebanese',"" he said.
Tizani can still recite the Turkish oath of allegiance to the Sultan, as taught to his father under Ottoman rule. He can sing La Marseillaise, taught to him by the French, from start to finish. But he freely admits to not knowing all of Lebanon's national anthem. Nobody spoke about patriotism.
""The country moved ahead on the basis we were a unified nation but without internal foundations. Lebanon was made superficially, and it continued superficially.""
From the earliest days, people were forced into the arms of politicians of one sectarian stripe or another if they needed a job, to get their children into school, or if they ran into trouble with the law.
""Our curse is our zuama,"" Tizani said.
    
POINTING TO CATASTROPHE
When Lebanon declared independence in 1943, the French tried to thwart the move by incarcerating its new government, provoking an uprising that proved to be a rare moment of national unity.
Under Lebanon's National Pact, it was agreed the president must be a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shi'ite Muslim.
The post-independence years brought signs of promise.
Women gained suffrage in 1952. Salim Haidar, a minister at the time, took pride in the fact that Lebanon was only a few years behind France in granting women the right to vote, his son, Hayyan, recalls.
Salim Haidar, with a doctorate from the Sorbonne, drafted Lebanon's first anti-corruption law in 1953.
""This was the mentality ... that Lebanon is really leading the way, even in the legal and constitutional matters. But then he didn't know that all of these laws that he worked on would not be properly applied, or would not be applied at all, like the anti-corruption law,"" Hayyan Haidar said.
The 1960s are widely seen as a golden age. Tourism boomed, much of it from the Arab world. A cultural scene of theatre, poetry, cinema and music flourished. Famous visitors included Brigitte Bardot. The Baalbeck International Festival, set amid ancient ruins in the Bekaa Valley, was in its heyday.
Casino du Liban hosted the Miss Europe beauty pageant in 1964. Water skiers showed off their skills in the bay by Beirut's Saint George Hotel.
Visitors left with ""a misleadingly idyllic picture of the city, deaf to the antagonisms that now rumbled beneath the surface and blind to the dangers that were beginning to gather on the horizon,"" Samir Kassir, the late historian and journalist, wrote in his book ""Beirut"".
Kassir was assassinated in a car bomb in Beirut in 2005.
For all the glitz and glamour, sectarian politics left many parts of Lebanon marginalised and impoverished, providing fertile ground for the 1975-90 civil war, said Nadya Sbaiti, assistant professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the American University of Beirut.
""The other side of the 1960s is not just Hollywood actors and Baalbeck festivals, but includes guerrilla training in rural parts of the country,"" she said.
Lebanon was also buffeted by the aftershocks of Israel's creation in 1948, which sent some 100,000 Palestinian refugees fleeing over the border.
In 1968, Israeli commandos destroyed a dozen passenger planes at Beirut airport, a response to an attack on an Israeli airliner by a Lebanon-based Palestinian group.
The attack ""showed us we are not a state. We are an international playground,"" Salim Haidar, serving as an MP, said in an address to parliament at the time. Lebanon had not moved on in a quarter of a century, he said.
""We gathered, Christians and Muslims, around the table of independent Lebanon, distributed by sect. We are still Christians and Muslims ... distributed by sect.""
To build a state, necessary steps included the ""abolition of political sectarianism, the mother of all problems,"" said Haidar, who died in 1980.
TICKING TIME BOMB
Lebanon's brewing troubles were reflected in its art.
A 1970 play, ""Carte Blanche"", portrayed the country as a brothel run by government ministers and ended with the lights off and the sound of a ticking bomb.
Nidal Al Achkar, the co-director, recalls the Beirut of her youth as a vibrant melting pot that never slept.
A pioneer of Lebanese theatre, Achkar graduated in the 1950s from one of a handful of Lebanese schools founded on a secular rather than religious basis, Ahliah, in the city's former Jewish quarter. Beirut was in the 1960s a city of ""little secrets ... full of cinemas, full of theatres,"" she said.
""Beside people coming from the West, you had people coming from all over the Arab world, from Iraq, from Jordan, from Syria, from Palestine meeting in these cafes, living here, feeling free,"" she recalled. ""But in our activity as artists ... all our plays were pointing to a catastrophe.""
It came in 1975 with the eruption of the civil war that began as a conflict between Christian militias and Palestinian groups allied with Lebanese Muslim factions.
Known as the ""two year war"", it was followed by many other conflicts. Some of those were fought among Christian groups and among Muslim groups.
The United States, Russia and Syria were drawn in. Israel invaded twice and occupied Beirut in 1982. Lebanon was splintered. Hundreds of thousands of people were uprooted.
The guns fell silent in 1990 with some 150,000 dead and more than 17,000 people missing.
The Taif peace agreement diluted Maronite power in government. Militia leaders turned in their weapons and took seats in government. Hayyan Haidar, a civil engineer and close aide to Selim Hoss, prime minister at the end of the war, expressed his concern.
""My comment was they are going to become the state and we are on our way out,"" he said.
In the post-war period, Rafik al-Hariri took the lead in rebuilding Beirut's devastated city centre, though many feel its old character was lost in the process, including its traditional souks.
A Saudi-backed billionaire, Hariri was one of the only Lebanese post-war leaders who had not fought in the conflict.
A general amnesty covered all political crimes perpetrated before 1991.
""What happened is they imposed amnesia on us,"" said Nayla Hamadeh, president of the Lebanese Association for History. ""They meant it. Prime Minister Hariri was one of those who advanced this idea ... 'Let's forget and move (on)'.""
'I LOST HOPE'
The Taif agreement called for ""national belonging"" to be strengthened through new education curricula, including a unified history textbook. Issued in the 1940s, the existing syllabus ends in 1943 with independence.
Attempts to agree a new one failed. The last effort, a decade ago, provoked rows in parliament and street protests.
""They think that they should use history to brainwash students,"" Hamadeh said. For the most part, history continues to be learnt at home, on the street and through hearsay.
""This is (promoting) conflict in our society,"" she added.
Old faultlines persisted and new ones emerged.
Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims fell out following the 2005 assassination of Hariri. A U.N.-backed tribunal recently convicted a member of the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah of conspiring to kill Hariri.
Hezbollah denies any role, but the trial was another reminder of Lebanon's violent past - the last 15 years have been punctuated by political slayings, a war between Hezbollah and Israel and a brush with civil conflict in 2008.
To some, the civil war never really ended.
Political conflict persists in government even at a time when people are desperate for solutions to the financial crisis and support in the aftermath of the port explosion.
Many feel the victims have not been mourned properly on a national level, reflecting divisions. Some refuse to lose faith in a better Lebanon. For others, the blast was the final straw. Some are leaving or planning to.

""You live between a war and another, and you rebuild and then everything is destroyed and then you rebuild again,"" said theatre director Achkar. ""That's why I lost hope.""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - The risk of accidental conflict is rising because of tension in the South China Sea and around Taiwan and communication must be maintained to reduce the risk of miscalculation, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Thursday.
Democratic Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as ""sacred"" Chinese territory, has complained of Chinese military activities near the island, in what it says in an attempt to force Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty. 
The United States and China have also been conducting military exercises near Taiwan and in the disputed South China Sea.
""The risk of conflict requires careful management by all the parties concerned. We expect and hope that Beijing will continue to exercise restraint consistent with their obligations as a major regional power,"" Tsai told a forum organised by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
Relations between China and the United States are widely seen to be at their worst point in decades, with deepening mistrust and friction over the novel coronavirus, U.S. accusations of unfair trade practices, and disputes over Hong Kong, the South China Sea and Taiwan.
Tsai said the international community had closely followed the situation in Hong Kong as well as China's militarization of the South China Sea. 
""As a result there is now greater scrutiny over the situation in the Taiwan Strait,"" she said. 
""There continue to be significant concerns over the potential for accidents, given increased military activity in the region. Therefore we believe it would be important for all parties to maintain open lines and communication to prevent misinterpretations or miscalculations.""
Tsai said Taiwan needed to strengthen its defence capabilities, which she has made a priority.
""We do this because we know that in terms of our current situation, strength can be co-related with deterrence. It also reduces the risk of military adventurism,"" said Tsai, who was re-elected for a second term in a landslide in January. 
Tsai reiterated her commitment to peace and desire to talk.
""We are open to discussions with China, as long as they contribute to a beneficial relationship.""
But Beijing must accept that as a democracy, only Taiwan's people can decide its future, she said.
China has refused to talk to Tsai, believing she is a separatist bent on declaring a Republic of Taiwan. 
Tsai says Taiwan is a country called the Republic of China, its formal name.

KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban fighters killed four civilians on Thursday during clashes with Afghan forces in the central province of Parwan, amid rescue work after flash floods claimed more than 150 lives, officials said.
It was the latest violence amid peace talks between the warring sides that have been delayed over the issue of prisoner releases, as part of efforts to end the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, which has spanned nearly two decades.
""Taliban fighters opened fire on civilians fleeing areas worst hit by the flash floods,"" said Abdul Shukoor Qudoosi, a district official in Bagram, home to the country's biggest U.S. military base and the site of the clashes. 
""Taliban were clashing with Afghan forces and they killed civilians who were in an autorickshaw near an army checkpoint,"" Qudoosi said, adding that it appeared as if the Islamist militants mistook the passengers for Afghan soldiers.
One Afghan soldier was killed and two were injured.
A Taliban spokesmen was not immediately available to comment.
The death toll from the floods rose to 150, with at least 250 people injured, as survivors and rescue workers sifted the debris of more than 1,500 homes destroyed to the north of the capital, Kabul.
Authorities moved more than 900 families out of parts of the mountainous province that had been devastated by the floods, which were triggered by exceptionally heavy rain this week.
""The search is still on, as many people, we fear, are still buried under the rocks and rubble,"" said Tamim Azimi, a spokesman for the ministry of disaster management.
""The situation is very grim, the scale of loss is intense."" 
Security forces, officials and survivors have trudged through deep mud in the search for survivors while the effort to clear the disaster area has stretched more than 28 hours, hampered by blocked and damaged roads.
The dead included many children, survivors said. The death toll was expected to rise as families prepared for mass burials, while mounds of rubble remain to be cleared.

Afghanistan regularly suffers from drought but can be lashed by very heavy rain during the south Asian monsoon season.

BERLIN (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers on Thursday sought sanctions against Belarus to pressure President Alexander Lukashenko to hold new elections as the country's opposition appealed to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for help.
Eager to support mass protests against Lukashenko's 26-year iron rule, EU ministers are considering travel bans and asset freezes on up to 20 people responsible for a crackdown on demonstrators two weeks after an election they say was rigged.
""The announcement of sanctions has not led to any change in behaviour in Belarus,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters, referring to the threat of sanctions made by EU governments after the disputed Aug. 9 election.
The EU, which has an arms embargo on Belarus, eased in 2015 economic sanctions on Belarus that were first imposed in 2004, seeking better relations with Lukashenko, but now hopes to move quickly to reintroduce so-called restrictive measures.
Romanian Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu said they should be imposed on officials who helped rig the election, those who ordered the crackdown and those accused of violence against demonstrators. Minsk authorities deny that the election outcome, which handed Lukashenko 80% of the vote, was rigged.
Lukashenko himself is not expected to be sanctioned at this stage.
""The discussion will be important because the level of sanctions, whom to sanction, has to be something that is fully considered,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is chairing the Berlin meeting, said, referring to concerns that sanctions can be challenged in court if not properly prepared.
Belarus is the ally closest to Russia of all former Sovietrepublics, and Lukashenko's fate lies in the handsof the Kremlin, which must decide whether to stick with him ashis authority has ebbed.
Opposition presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, 37, who fled to Lithuania after the election her supporters say she won, appealed to Germany's chancellor to mediate a solution.

Merkel could ""contact Lukashenko directly or explain the situation from her point of view to the Russian president"", she told the German newspaper Die Welt.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar closed schools nationwide on Thursday as novel coronavirus infections increased, a decision broadly welcomed by parents worried about a rapid spread of the contagious virus.
Myanmar has reported more than 200 cases of the coronavirus since early last week after a month without any reports of domestic transmission.
Most recent infections have been outside the biggest city, Yangon, and authorities believe they were more contagious than previously seen.
""The students have many years ahead for studying. Taking precautions against the virus is much more important for all of us,"" said Thin Thin, a Yangon parent.
Khin Zaw Haling, a government official, said health measures must be followed to keep the threat at bay, after 70 new infections on Tuesday, Myanmar's biggest daily rise.
""Now we have to again take more individual precautions,"" he said.
With just six deaths and 586 infections since late March, the impact of the coronavirus has been relatively light in Myanmar, compared with Indonesia and the Philippines, which are reporting daily cases in the thousands.
Parent Swe Sin Hlaing said people in Myanmar had been careless and there was no room for complacency. 
""We all have to be careful,"" she said. ""If we don't take precautions, the situation would be uncontrollable.""
The new outbreak epicentre is Rakhine State, about 500 km (311 miles) from Yangon, with most cases tracked to the state capital of Sittwe, where a lockdown and curfew are in place.
Sittwe is also home to crowded camps where 100,000 Rohingya Muslims have been confined since violence erupted in 2012, with limited access to healthcare.
One new case in Yangon on Thursday was linked to Sittwe.
Not all parents are happy about schools closing again, however, and worry about disruptions. 

""I'm afraid the students won't pay attention to their studies if the schools keeps closing,"" said Aye Aye Htwe, 53.

Democratic lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting was charged alongside six others in relation to some of the most violent scenes of last year's protests, when a white-shirted mob attacked pro-democracy protesters, journalists and bystanders at a train station in the Yuen Long district, near the border with mainland China.
They were all granted bail by the court on Thursday. Their case was adjourned to Oct. 12.
Lam had livestreamed the July 21, 2019 attack on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and was hospitalised after the attack. He was arrested on Wednesday along with lawmaker Ted Hui. 
Hui was charged with criminal damage along with three others for their roles in a protest on July 6 in the Tuen Mun district. Their case was adjourned to Nov. 6.
That protest had come amid rising anti-Beijing sentiment when protesters marched against the ""noise pollution"" caused by middle-aged women singing and dancing to pop songs in Mandarin, the language spoken in mainland China. Hong Kong people speak mainly Cantonese.
Police said Hui forcefully took a phone from someone filming protesters.
Dozens of Hong Kong pro-democracy politicians and activists gathered outside the court and chanted ""Shame on political prosecution,"" and ""it's absurd that the victim becomes the defendant.""
Police Commissioner Chris Tang rejected the accusation, telling reporters: ""We do not intend to rewrite history.""
Often violent demonstrations last year were fuelled by perceptions that Beijing was tightening its grip on freedoms promised to Hong Kong after it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement with former colonial ruler Britain, the special administrative region was promised wide ranging freedoms unavailable on the Communist Party-ruled mainland.

Beijing imposed a new national security law on Hong Kong on June 30. Critics say the legislation has pushed the city onto a more authoritarian path, while supporters say it will bring stability after a year of unrest.

The photographs, taken at Wahidin Sudirohusodo hospital in Makassar, South Sulawesi, on Thursday morning, and shared with Reuters by Indonesia's Medical Association (IDI), have been widely shared on social media.
They show a woman, whose face is barely visible, dressed in a pink hazmat suit, gloves, and turquoise mask, alone as she rests her head on a white coffin.
The Indonesian medical association said the woman's husband, Dr Titus Taba, who was head of the IDI in West Papua, was the 94th Indonesian doctor to die from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
Halik Malik, spokesman for the association, said that the limited amount of protective equipment, isolation rooms and low screening of patients, had led to a high fatality rate among doctors.
""The number of doctors dying in Indonesia is still relatively high, even increasing in the past two months,"" he said.
Indonesia is grappling with one of the worst outbreaks of the virus in the region. In India, a country with more than three times the population and more than 3 million cases, almost 200 doctors have died from COVID-19, the Indian Medical Association told local media in early August.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand is to ease its novel coronavirus procedures to allow more patients from abroad to get treatment from next month, a top health official said on Thursday, after appeals from hospitals eager to treat their overseas patients.
Thailand is a major hub for medical tourism, drawing patients from Asia, the Middle East and beyond. In 2019, it recorded 632,000 overseas patients who spent 122 billion baht ($3.9 billion), according to government data.
But restrictions to fight the coronavirus have seen most foreign patients, along with most foreigners in general, kept out since April.
While there is no formal ban on foreign patients - except on anyone seeking treatment for COVID-19 and ailments that would draw on resources to manage the outbreak - they need approval for travel, which can be slow and difficult to get.
Only 172 foreign patients have been allowed in since a first easing of requirements in July, senior health official Tares Krassanairawiwong told Reuters, adding that 740 people had made official requests for entry.
But now more health facilities would be allowed to accept foreigners again, and more are expected to come.
""In phase two, another 100 hospitals and clinics will be approved to receive patients, from 120 today,” Tares said.
But hospital operators say the process has been slow and they have hundreds of overseas patients needing their treatment, some urgently.
""Four of our patients have died because they couldn’t get in,"" the chairman of hospital operator Thonburi Healthcare Group Pcl, Boon Vasin, told Reuters.
""It’s a humanitarian issue because some countries don’t have the capacity for advanced procedures,” he said, citing patients needing treatment for heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
Boon said approvals were inconsistent and he urged authorities to clarify and relax the process.
Thailand has had 3,404 confirmed coronavirus infections and 58 deaths and has gone more than three months without a case of domestic transmission.
Tares, who heads the Department of Health Services Support, said the procedures had to ensure safety but he expected the approval process to be faster.
He said he also expected people would be allowed to cross land borders from neighbouring Myanmar and Cambodia, major sources of patients.

Hong Kong media, citing unidentified sources, said 12 people from the former British colony were arrested while sailing to Taiwan where they planned to apply for political asylum.
It was not clear what law they would be charged with violating but, if confirmed, it would be a rare instance of Chinese authorities arresting people from Hong Kong trying to leave the city.
The Guangdong Coast Guard said on its social media platform late on Wednesday the people on the boat were arrested on Aug. 23.
Two of the detained were surnamed Li and Tang, it said. It did not provide further details and could not be reached for comment. 
Hong Kong media identified one of those on the vessel as Andy Li, who media said was recently arrested under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing on its freest city on June 30.
Chris Tang, the Chinese-ruled city's police chief, said at a press conference he had not received any information from mainland authorities regarding the arrests. 
In Taipei, the China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council did not confirm the media report, but said those who come to Taiwan via illegal means will face criminal charges, and reiterated the government's pledges to give ""humanitarian assistance"" to Hong Kong protesters.

Results from an autopsy conducted on the 17 dolphins found on Wednesday are expected on Thursday.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun initially promised a swift investigation into why highly explosive material stored unsafely for years detonated on Aug. 4, killing at least 180 people and injuring some 6,000, but later said the process would take time.
Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said after meeting Aoun that Ottawa was ready to assist ""under conditions"" that would be defined. He did not elaborate.
""The Lebanese people expect that if Canada participates in this investigation it is because it is going to be credible, transparent and get to the bottom of things to get justice,"" he said in televised remarks.
Beirut has said that France and the United States' FBI are helping investigate the explosion that wrecked the port and swathes of the city, compounding an economic meltdown.
Champagne, like other Western officials, said Lebanon must form a government that can implement long-demanded reforms and fight corruption to unlock foreign financial assistance.
""Everyone understands that the international aid must be accompanied by serious reforms,"" Champagne said. ""I think that the biggest of the reforms is that impunity must end.""
The outgoing government that took office in January with the support of the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and its allies resigned over the blast. No progress has been made in forming a new administration amid political rivalries and factional interests under the sectarian power-sharing system. 
France's foreign minister said on Thursday that Lebanon risked disappearing due to inaction of its political elite, who had been the target of protests even before the blast as the financial crisis pummelled the currency and spread poverty.

The $103.8 million fund was granted under the REDD+ programme, a U.N.-backed forestry conservation scheme to tackle climate change, based on progress Indonesia made in 2014-2016, Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar said.
""Controlling forest fires is an important part in reducing deforestation,"" she told a virtual briefing on Thursday without specifying how the money would be spent.
In June, an environment ministry official said there had been a 50% budget cut for the team that finds fires and helps put them out. 
Fires, often set to clear land for palm oil plantations in the world’s top producer of the commodity, were the most damaging in years in 2019. 
Between January and July this year around 64,000 hectares (158,000 acres) have been burned, compared with 137,000 hectares over the same period last year, according to ministry data. 
Though analysis of satellite data showed the forest land thought to have been cleared in the first 24 weeks of 2020 was even higher than the same period last year.
Southeast Asia's biggest economy aims to slash carbon emissions by 29% by 2030 on its own or by 41% with international assistance.
Finance Ministry data showed Indonesia would require $19 billion financing per year to reach its 2030 target. 
In the past five years, the government has allocated on average nearly 90 trillion rupiah ($6.14 billion) per year from the state budget for climate change spending, although 2020 spending has dropped to around 80 trillion rupiah.

""There is a decline in 2020 because of COVID-19 priorities, but looking forward, we are hoping we can keep this commitment,"" Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told the same virtual briefing. ($1 = 14,660 rupiah)

Ruling party officials have said Abe's health is fine, but the visits, one of which ran nearly eight hours, have fanned speculation whether he will be able to continue in the job until the end of his term in September 2021. 
On Monday Abe surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier that had been set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago.
Sources have told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Abe would consult doctors prior to Friday's event, whether by telephone or another hospital visit.
He is expected to offer an explanation of his health and discuss the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, domestic media have said.
Abe's Friday schedule provided by the prime minister's office shows he is to attend a meeting of the government's coronavirus response headquarters before the news conference.

Abe, who has battled the chronic condition ulcerative colitis since his teens, has not detailed the reason for his hospital visits, but said he wanted to take care of his health and do his utmost at his job.

In a meeting with Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, Pompeo said on Twitter he discussed ""the importance of building regional peace, stability, and prosperity through a united Gulf Cooperation Council"". 
Sultan Haitham took power in January after Sultan Qaboos bin Said died after a half century at the helm of the Gulf country. 
In a turbulent region, Oman has maintained its neutrality. It has kept friendly relations with a range of regional actors, including arch-foes the United States and Iran - for whom Oman has acted as a go-between.
Last week Oman's foreign affairs portfolio was given to Badr al-Busaidi. Previously the title of foreign minister had been held by the Sultan, and Yousuf bin Alawi had been the longstanding minister responsible for foreign affairs.
Israel's intelligence minister said a few days after the UAE-Israel accord was announced on Aug. 13 that Bahrain and Oman could be the next Gulf Arab countries to formalise ties with the country.
In 2018 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Oman and discussed peace initiatives in the Middle East with then-Omani leader Sultan Qaboos.
Oman praised the U.S.-sponsored accord between UAE and Israel, but has not commented on its own prospects for normalised relations.
""Aspects of the existing bilateral cooperation between the Sultanate and the United States were reviewed within the framework of the strong relations binding them and matters of mutual interest,"" the state news agency ONA said in a report of the sultan's meeting with Pompeo. 

Before arriving in Oman, Pompeo visited Jerusalem, Sudan, Bahrain and the UAE.

Aaron McNicholas, who covered the city's sometimes-violent anti-government protests last year for Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP), waited almost six months before being told his visa had been denied, the outlet said.
""It seems we have been targeted under the climate of the new security law and because of our impartial and fact-based coverage,"" HKFP editor-in-chief Tom Grundy said in a statement.
The news website would press the government to offer reasons for the denial and would consider an appeal and legal challenge, he added. 
The Hong Kong government and immigration department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Media groups said the move reflected an acceleration in the decline of press freedoms under the security law which punishes what Beijing defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. 
""Denial of a work visa to a thriving local news operation bashes the most basic promise of press freedom given repeatedly by the Hong Kong government,"" said Steven Butler, Asia Programme Coordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists.
""It also severely undermines Hong Kong's status as an international city and financial centre, which cannot flourish
unless journalists are free to do their work.""
Journalists in the former British colony have told Reuters they fear the legislation could be used to silence media and crack down on freedom of expression, concerns the Hong Kong government has rejected. 
The semi-autonomous city is guaranteed freedom of speech and the press under Article 27 of the Basic Law, the mini-constitution agreed by China when it took back control of the global financial hub in 1997.
The news comes more than a month after The New York Times said it would shift part of its Hong Kong office to Seoul as it faced challenges securing work permits. 
The Hong Kong government said at the time the city remained a regional media hub.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Growing up in the coastal capital of Dakar, Khadjou Sambe never saw a Black woman surfing the Atlantic swells. As Senegal's first female professional surfer, Sambe is now inspiring the next generation to defy cultural norms and take to the waves.
Undeterred by the postponement of the Olympic Games, Sambe trains whenever conditions allow in the powerful surf break near her home in the hardscrabble district of Ngor - the westernmost point of the African continent.
""When I am in the water I feel something extraordinary, something special in my heart,"" Sambe said, wearing a t-shirt of the ""Black Girls Surf"" project (BGS), which helps Black girls and women around the world break into professional surfing.
Sambe is a proud Lebou, an ethnic group that traditionally lives by the sea, but as a teenager, her parents refused to allow her to surf for two and a half years, saying it brought shame on the family.
""My determination was strong enough to make them change their minds,"" she said.
Sambe now also coaches local girls, encouraging them to develop the physical and mental strength to ride waves and break the mould in a society that generally expects them to stay at home, cook, clean, and marry young.
""I always advise them not to listen to other people, to block their ears,"" she said.
Residents of Ngor have become used to seeing Sambe carrying her board through the alleyways leading to the shore. In recent months, she has used a house overlooking the ocean as a base during a visit by mentor and BGS founder American Rhonda Harper.

""I would always see people surfing and I'd say to myself: but where are the girls who surf?"" Sambe said. ""I thought: why don't I go surfing, represent my country, represent Africa, represent Senegal as a Black girl?""

Thuranira Kaugiria, Nairobi County secretary general of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union, said in a WhatsApp message the doctors had returned to work after signing an agreement with county officials on Wednesday. 
In the agreement, the government promised to pay doctors on the fifth day of every month, failing to which the doctors were free to stop work without notice.
The agreement, seen by Reuters, also provides doctors with two isolation facilities in the event that they contract COVID-19.
The county government also committed to providing the doctors with adequate supplies of high quality personal protective equipment, the agreement said. 
The 320 striking doctors walked out last week, citing poor quality protective gear, too few isolation wards, and inadequate health insurance.
The strike only affected hospitals run by the county government, and not those run by the national government or those that are privately run.
Kenya has 33,016 confirmed coronavirus cases, 564 deaths and 19,296 recoveries out of 429,513 tests conducted, according to the Ministry of Health.
The majority of confirmed cases have been in the capital, although the government says the numbers have started rising faster in rural areas.

The serviceman, from Russia's Strategic Missile Forces, was detained in the Siberian city of Barnaul, some 2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles) east of Moscow, as he was walking out of a grocery store, FSB footage carried by Russian news agencies showed.
In a statement carried by Russian agencies, the FSB said the serviceman had allegedly passed state secrets to the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine's defence ministry. 
It did not provide further detail on the nature of the information that had allegedly been passed.
It said a criminal case had been opened for state treason. If convicted, the serviceman could face up to 20 years in jail.
Relations between Russia and Ukraine have soured since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014 and pro-Kremlin separatists seized a swath of eastern Ukraine.
Russia has spent heavily to integrate Crimea into its territory, and it has been the focus of espionage and military tensions since its annexation.

DUBAI/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A thaw in relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates has raised expectations of an influx of funding in 'Silicon Wadi', Israel's answer to Silicon Valley.
""The UAE has excess amounts of money, but not enough places to invest it in the Middle East,"" said Eldad Tamir, founder and CEO of the Tamir Fishman investment house, one of Israel's top investment funds.
""The high tech sector here is thirsty for money and having new investors from the UAE will help us diversify a bit from our usual Chinese and American investor.""
But deep-seated animosity towards Israel among some investors could cap inflows, according to investment bankers and fund managers in the UAE, the Middle East's financial hub.
""The emotional part is definitely a roller-coaster ride and will take a substantial time to overcome,"" according to one UAE-based capital markets investor, who declined to be named.
Currently, UAE investors typically remove Israel when investing in global or regional share indexes, but that should change given this month's agreement to normalise diplomatic ties, according to Citi Israel head Neil Corney.
""If asset managers were following some kind of global index, Israel would get its relevant or relative weight for those investments,"" Corney told Reuters.
Regional investment funds, many of which are headquartered in the UAE, however, may not get the green light to invest in Israel if their investors come from Arab countries that don't recognise the country, according to two fund managers.
The accord, which makes the UAE only the third Arab state after Egypt and Jordan to have official relations with Israel, has stirred dismay in parts of the Middle East although it prompted a cautious welcome from some of the UAE's Gulf allies.
A GOOD FIT
With the UAE economy and real estate sector in the doldrums due to the coronavirus, Israel, with its strong tech focus, is an appealing investment alternative for the oil-rich conglomeration of city-states.
""It's more likely you are going to see UAE money investing in Israeli technology more than anything else,"" said Corney.
""I'm sure that some Israeli companies would look to try to attract investment as well from the UAE, particularly in the energy sector,"" he said. ""UAE-Israeli joint ventures would be a good fit.""
The healthcare and information technology sectors, which have thrived during the global pandemic, make up about 36% of the Israeli stock market, with the Tel Aviv Technology index (TATECH) up 32% and the TA-Biomed index (BIOMED) up 27% so far in 2020, versus a 16% decline in the bluechip index (TA35). Dubai's benchmark index (DFMGI) is down nearly 18% year-to-date and Abu Dhabi's (ADI) is 11% weaker.
TECH SECTOR
The Israeli tech sector, comprising thousands of startups, has been a magnet for investors even during the pandemic with venture capital funding rising by more than a third to $5.25 billion in the first half of 2020 from a year ago, data from the Israel Venture Capital Research Center and ZAG law firm showed.
Israeli software firm Jfrog on Monday filed for a share offering on the U.S. tech-heavy Nasdaq of up to $100 million, while medical imaging company Nanox (O:NNOX) last week raised $165 million on Nasdaq.
Abu Dhabi's state investor Mubadala, which manages around $230 billion in assets, is a big tech investor and Ibrahim Ajami, head of ventures at Mubadala, tweeted ""Big day for humanity and for all us in technology!"" after the deal with Israel was announced.
Mubadala already has indirect exposure to firms backed by Israeli investors such as online insurer Lemonade (N:LMND) via its investments in Softbank (OTC:SFTBY)'s $100 billion Vision Fund. Mubadala declined to comment and Ajami was not available to comment on any future Israeli investments.
Abu Dhabi's biggest state fund, the nearly $700 billion Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, also invests in the technology sector across asset classes and targets startups through its Private Equity team. It declined to comment.
Before any money can flow between the two countries, the UAE needs to scrap rules which require UAE banks to monitor and block transactions if the beneficiary is based in Israel.
The government has not yet issued guidance to financial institutions allowing them to communicate and trade with Israeli counterparts, bankers said.

The UAE and Israeli finance ministries declined to comment while their central banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, progress has been slow with some diplomats increasingly frustrated over the situation.
Macron will return to Beirut on Sept. 1.

""It's for the Lebanese authorities to assume their responsibilities. They are trained and competent, but they have made a consensus among themselves for inaction and that's no longer possible.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A proposed Australian law that would give the federal government powers to cancel any agreements local authorities and public institutions make or have made with foreign governments is not aimed at China, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday.
The new legislation comes as Canberra seeks to curtail Beijing's influence in Australia amid concerns over issues including trade and security, but Morrison denied the new law was designed with China specifically in mind. 
""These laws are about Australia's national sovereign interests,"" Morrison said.
Under the new law, the country's foreign minister would be able to cancel any agreements made by state and territory governments, local councils or public universities with foreign administrations if they ""adversely affect Australia's foreign relations"" or are ""inconsistent with Australian foreign policy"".
The legislation will also be retrospective, and Morrison said Australia is aware of 130 agreements that government entities have struck with 30 different countries.
Recent controversial deals include lease by the Northern Territories' government of Port of Darwin to Chinese-owned Landbridge Group in 2015 and a spate of large agricultural land purchases.
Australia's Victoria state also signed up to China's Belt and Road Initiative in 2018, a decision Morrison criticised at the time. Details of any projects under consideration have not been made public. 
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews, grappling with an outbreak of COVID-19, hit back at Morrison over the proposed legislation.
""If the prime minister has got time to do these things, then that’s fine for him... I don’t, I’m exclusively focused on fighting this virus,"" Andrews told reporters in Melbourne.
TESTY RELATIONS
Nearly all Australian states have in recent years also signed cooperation deals with Chinese provinces, covering industries such as mining, education and tourism.
Australian universities have also sought to foster closer ties with China. Foreign students are worth about A$35 billion ($25 billion) a year to the Australian economy, with Chinese students accounting for about a third of that figure.
Relations between Australia and its largest trading partner have become increasingly strained, with Australia angering China by calling for an international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, barring Huawei Technologies from participating in its 5G network rollout and blocking a recent agricultural deal. 
China has targeted Australian exports of wine, barley and beef, and told its students and tourists to avoid travelling to Australia, citing racial discrimination. 
On Wednesday, one of China's most senior diplomats in Australia said there was a ""shadow"" over the bilateral relationship. 
The new legislation excludes commercial corporations and state-owned enterprises, although Australia has already given regulators and the treasurer additional powers to reject foreign takeovers of private companies.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A New Zealand judge sentenced white supremacist Brenton Tarrant to life in prison without parole on Thursday for killing 51 Muslim worshippers in the country's deadliest shooting, saying the sentence was not enough punishment for the ""wicked"" crimes.
It was the first time a court in New Zealand had sentenced a person to prison for the rest of their life.
Tarrant, a 29-year-old Australian, admitted to 51 charges of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist act during the 2019 shooting rampage at two Christchurch mosques which he livestreamed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
High Court Judge Cameron Mander said in Christchurch on Thursday that a finite term would not be sufficient.
""Your crimes, however, are so wicked that even if you are detained until you die it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment and denunciation,"" said Mander in handing down the sentence.
""As far as I am able to gauge, you are empty of any empathy for your victims,"" he said.
The judge asked Tarrant before handing down the sentence if he had any comment. Dressed in grey prison clothes and surrounded by guards, Tarrant nodded when asked if he was aware he had the right to make submissons, but he did not speak.
NZ MUSLIMS WELCOME JUSTICE
Prosecutors told the court earlier that Tarrant wanted to instill fear in those he described as invaders and that he carefully planned the attacks to cause maximum carnage.
""Today the legal procedures for this heinous crime have been done. No punishment will bring our loved ones back,"" said Gamal Fouda, the imam of Al Noor mosque which was targeted.
""Extremists are all the same. Whether they use religion, nationalism or any other ideology. All extremists, they represent hate. But we are here today. We respect love, compassion, Muslim and non-Muslim people of faith and of no faith.""
Tarrant, who represented himself during the hearings but did not make submissions, said through a lawyer in court on Thursday that he did not oppose the prosecution's application for a life without parole sentence.
""The hatred that lies at the heart of your hostility to particular members of the community that you came to this country to murder has no place here - it has no place anywhere,"" Mander said.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she was relieved that ""that person will never see the light of day"".
""The trauma of March 15 is not easily healed but today I hope is the last where we have any cause to hear or utter the name of the terrorist behind it. His deserves to be a lifetime of complete and utter silence,"" she said.
Ardern praised survivors and families of the victims who gave emotionally charged statements in court this week, calling for Tarrant to be sentenced to life without parole.
""I want to acknowledge the strength of our Muslim community who shared their words in court over the past few days,"" she said. ""You relived the horrific events of March 15 to chronicle what happened that day and the pain it has left behind.""
""Nothing will take the pain away but I hope you felt the arms of New Zealand around you through this whole process, and I hope you continue to feel that through all the days that follow.""
DESIRE TO CREATE TERROR
Tarrant had asserted in a pre-sentence report that he was not racist or xenophobic, the judge said. Rather, Tarrant said he felt ostracised and had wanted to damage society, and had acted on delusional beliefs.
However, state prosecutor Mark Zarifeh had told the court: ""The offending was motivated by an entrenched racist and xenophobic ideology and a desire to create terror within the Muslim community and beyond.""
New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters called for Tarrant to be deported to Australia to serve out his sentence.
""Justice today was delivered to the terrorist and murderer for his cowardly and horrific crimes in Christchurch. It is right that we will never see or hear from him ever again,"" said Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
Morrison said no request had been made to transfer Tarrant to Australia and he expected he would serve his sentence in New Zealand where he was convicted.
Before Tarrant, triple-murderer William Bell was serving the longest sentence in New Zealand with a minimum non-parole prison term of 30 years for his 2001 crimes.

PETCHABURI, Thailand (Reuters) - As the pandemic batters Thailand's tourist-reliant economy, animal attractions from petting zoos to elephant camps and tiger farms are feeling the pain and may even have to give animals away, warned the founder of an animal refuge. 
The Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand aims to rescue animals that are dumped or exploited in Thailand, but the organisation is suffering amid coronavirus restrictions. 
""For the last six months we have got zero visitors and lost about 75 percent of our income,"" said Edwin Wiek, founder of the sanctuary, about 170 km (106 miles) southwest of Bangkok on land donated by a nearby temple.
Wiek recently spent fours days and nights in a cage that was once home to chimpanzees to raise $25,000 to help feed animals and assist those awaiting the foundation's care.
""A much bigger problem that I see upcoming now is the animal attractions around Thailand... they have zero income and they are starting to think about giving away their animals,"" Wiek said.
Thailand received a record 39.8 million tourists in 2019, but with borders closed, the country expects only 8 million this year. The economy could post the biggest contraction since 1998. 
The sanctuary, which has more than 800 animals and expenses of $4,000 per month, usually relies on volunteers but now has only one.
Rhi Menmuir, 22, has been at the sanctuary for seven months and helps prepare animal food twice a day. 
""I have noticed a difference that the food quality has gone down a bit,"" said Menmuir, who is from Scotland. 
Wiek that said that pressure to take in more animals has strained standards of care, and that the sanctuary only had funds to last six to eight weeks.
""Quantity of animals against the quality of care is a dilemma I seriously worry about,"" Wiek said.

Caceres, a veteran land rights defender who led a battle against a major dam on the ancestral lands of her Lenca tribe, was shot to death at her home in 2016 at age 43. 
""We did it!! One step more to try a criminal who was part of the crime against my mom,"" Bertha Zuniga wrote on Twitter, posting a photo of the judge's ruling. 
Daniel Castillo, a former executive at Desarrollos Energeticos, or DESA, which pushed for construction of the Agua Zarca dam that Caceres protested against, is accused of organizing the plot and was arrested in March 2018. 
Both Castillo and DESA have previously rejected accusations of being responsible for Caceres' murder.
Seven men have already been convicted and sentenced for playing a role in her killing.
An indigenous rights groups founded by Caceres, COPINH, had accused Castillo's defense of stalling tactics to prevent the trial from beginning until the end of his two-and-a-half year period for pre-trial detention.
On Wednesday, the group called for proceedings against Castillo to move quickly.
""The judge has all the necessary proof to do so,"" it said in a statement.
Honduras is one of the world's most dangerous countries for activists, with 14 land and environmental defenders killed last year, up from four people in 2018, according to advocacy group Global Witness.

Registration was delayed until Sept. 4 due to several requests from political parties, National Electoral Council President Indira Alfonzo said on state television on Wednesday.
Opposition leader and National Assembly head Juan Guaido decided to boycott the Dec. 6 elections, claiming they lack the guarantees to be fair and transparent.
Yet other segments within the opposition haven’t fully rejected the idea and are considering their options. Last week, former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles said an election was a “mobilizing event” that merited a “real discussion.”

The Kayapó stopped trucks carrying corn to protest the lack of federal government assistance to protect the tribe from the coronavirus outbreak, and demand overdue reparation money that they have been receiving since paving of the BR-163 highway began a decade ago.
The Kayapó, who had camped out this week on the side of the road without blocking it, returned to their villages hoping a federal judge would decide in their favor in 10 days.
""If the government wants to stop the payments, it can. We are going to wait for the court decision,"" their chief Bepronti Kayapó said in a video posted on social media after a meeting with representatives of the federal indigenous affairs agency Funai that ended abruptly after 10 minutes.
According to the Kabu Institute that represents the Kayapó living on two reservations adjacent to the highway, the tribe has received 32 million reais ($5.71 million) over a decade to fund sustainability projects and the collection and marketing of Brazil nuts.
As a result of the roadblock last week that caused truck lines of up to 30 kilometers (18.64 miles), Funai paid out money owed for the first six months of this year, but has delayed settling future payments, the institute said.
Among their grievances, the tribe said it was not consulted on government plans to build the so-called Ferrogrão railway, set to cross part of the Amazon to connect the Mato Grosso grain-producing state to river ports for soy and corn exports. 

The railway will run parallel to the BR-163 highway.

(Reuters) - At least 90% of condors on the central California coast survived a wildfire that tore through their forest range and destroyed a sanctuary for the endangered birds, a wildlife group said on Wednesday.
Word that 90 of the 100 condors in California's Big Sur had been accounted for came as home losses mounted from much larger blazes burning to the north in the San Francisco Bay Area.
A siege of dry-lightning strikes during a record heat wave sparked blazes that have raced through coastal redwood forests, destroying hundreds of homes and burning California's oldest state park in the Santa Cruz mountains.
Cooler temperatures for a second straight day helped firefighters battle the largest blazes, as state wildfire authority Cal Fire reported 1,700 houses and other structures burned in fires that have killed seven people.
There were no condors inside pens at the sanctuary when it was destroyed last week, but 10 free-flying birds are missing and four nesting chicks are unaccounted for, said biologist Kelly Sorenson, who is hopeful they may be alive. 
""They often nest in redwood trees high off the ground and redwood trees are quite fire resistant,"" said Sorenson, executive director of the Ventana Wildlife Society, which ran the sanctuary and is raising funds to rebuild it. 
As biologists hunted for signals from the condors' radio transmitters, fire authorities began going through burned communities to quantify the number of homes destroyed. 
""We anticipate that number to grow substantially in the coming days and weeks,"" Governor Gavin Newsom told a news briefing. ""Once the fires are suppressed and we get back in and start seeing repopulation we're likely to discover additional fatalities.""
Over 120,000 people remained under evacuation orders and some like Bryan Miller learned their homes had been lost.
""I have one remaining picture of my parents,"" said Miller, 31, who stuffed the photograph in a backpack as he fled the fire that burned his studio in Brookdale (NYSE:BKD), one of 538 homes and structures destroyed in the Santa Cruz mountains fire.
Across Northern and Central California over 15,000 firefighters from around a dozen states battled dozens of fires sparked by the barrage of over 14,000 dry-lightning strikes that have scorched an area larger than the state of Delaware. 
Newsom pointed to the CZU fire, the largest in recorded history in the area's coastal rainforests, as a consequence of rising temperatures.
""This is again another testament, a demonstrable example of the reality, not just the assertion, the reality of climate change in this state,"" he said.
In the north Bay Area, nearly 1,000 homes and structures, many in farms and vineyards, were incinerated in the wine country of Napa, Sonoma and Solano counties.
The so-called LNU Lightning complex fire, the third-largest in California history, jumped to 33% containment.

In the south Bay Area evacuation orders were lifted for communities across four counties where the state's second largest fire in history was 25% contained after burning an area larger than Los Angeles

(Reuters) - The United States executed the only Native American on federal death row on Wednesday over opposition from the Navajo Nation, which accuses the government of violating tribal sovereignty.
Lezmond Mitchell, a 38-year-old Navajo and convicted murderer, was pronounced dead at 6:29 p.m. EDT (2229 GMT) after being administered lethal injections of pentobarbital in the Department of Justice's execution chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana, according to a media witness.
He was the fourth man to be executed by the U.S. government this summer after the administration of President Donald Trump ended an informal 17-year hiatus, which had been caused in part by legal challenges to lethal injection protocols and difficulties obtaining deadly drugs. Prior to July, there had only been three federal executions since 1963, all between 2001 and 2003.
Mitchell's lawyers and Jonathan Nez, the Navajo Nation president, had asked Trump, a long-time advocate of capital punishment for serious crimes, for clemency. 
On Tuesday night, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his bid for a stay based on his lawyers' argument that racial bias may have tainted the jury at his trial. 
Mitchell and an accomplice, Johnny Oslinger, were convicted of murdering a 9-year-old Navajo girl, Tiffany Lee, and her grandmother Alyce Slim in 2001 on the tribe's territory, which spans four states in the U.S. Southwest. 
According to prosecutors, the men had been hitchhiking before they stabbed Slim more than 30 times after she gave them a ride. They put the body in the backseat of her truck alongside the granddaughter as they drove elsewhere before killing the girl later and decapitating both bodies.
Mitchell was sentenced to death in an Arizona federal court over the objection of Navajo officials, who said the tribe's cultural values prohibited taking human life ""for vengeance."" At least 13 other tribes joined the Navajo Nation in urging Trump this month to commute Mitchell's sentence to life in prison.
Oslinger was a teenager at the time and ineligible for the death sentence.
Under the Major Crimes Act, the federal government has jurisdiction over certain major crimes occurring on Indian territory, including murder but usually cannot pursue capital punishment for a Native American for a crime on tribal land without the tribe's consent.
Navajo officials, along with leaders of other tribes, have opposed the death penalty, including in Mitchell's case. But John Ashcroft, attorney general under then-President George W. Bush, overrode federal prosecutors in Arizona who said they would defer to the tribe's position against pursuing a capital case.

In what Mitchell's lawyers deride as a legal loophole, federal prosecutors successfully pursued a capital case against Mitchell for carjacking, a crime that is not among those listed in the Major Crimes Act.

Two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several U.S. troops suffered concussive symptoms following the incident. 
While interactions between American and Russian forces are not rare, the incident highlights the risks of troops from both countries operating in close proximity in northern Syria and the potential for a rapid escalation in tensions. 
White House National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said the incident took place on Aug. 25 near Dayrick, in northeast Syria. 
""To de-escalate the situation, the coalition patrol departed the area,"" he said. ""The coalition and the United States do not seek escalation with any national military forces, but U.S. forces always retain the inherent right and obligation to defend themselves from hostile acts,"" he added.
Videos on social media showed Russian military vehicles, backed by a pair of helicopters, driving dangerously close to U.S. armored vehicles. The origin of the videos was unclear.
The U.S. military does not generally comment on injuries. However, last month a paratrooper was killed during a vehicle rollover accident in eastern Syria. 
The U.S. military said the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, spoke with his Russian counterpart on Wednesday, but provided no details on what was discussed.
About 500 U.S forces remain in northern Syria after a sharp reduction in troops that were initially there to drive out Islamic State militants from all their strongholds in the country. 
Some of the areas also have oil resources, something President Donald Trump has cited as a justification for keeping U.S. troops partnered with Kurdish allies in the region. 
The injuries were first reported by Politico.

The footage, published by newspaper El Universal last week, appears to have been taken by a camera fixed atop the helmet of a soldier who opens fire from an army truck. It shows soldiers encircling an apparent survivor of the shootout as an unidentified man yells, ""Kill him!""
El Universal said the video, filmed last month in the violent northern city of Nuevo Laredo on the U.S. border, shows the aftermath of incident in which state security officials reported 12 alleged drug cartel members were killed. 
Reuters has not been able to verify the contents of the video. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has called for a full investigation, saying his government would ""not allow this practice"" of what appeared to be the killing a suspect.
Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said about two dozen army personnel would be investigated in the probe that the military attorney general's office opened the day of the incident, working with its federal counterparts. 
The investigation will focus on the video as part of the effort to ""fully identify what the situation was, and if (the people involved) committed excesses,"" Cresencio said at the president's daily news conference.
The United Nations, which has previously criticized Mexico over issues concerning the military, called earlier this week for an investigation into the possible misuse of deadly force.

The men left Egypt between July 27 and July 29 after claims against them started to circulate on the internet, the prosecution said in a statement. It did not say where the men had travelled to, but said it was taking international measures to pursue them. 
Prosecutors are seeking the arrest in Egypt of two other suspects at large in the case. 
Anger at inaction over the 2014 incident at Cairo's Fairmont Hotel helped fuel a campaign against harassment and assault in which hundreds of women have shared testimonies online.
Prosecutors said they launched an investigation into the Fairmont Hotel case after legal complaints were lodged in early August. They said the suspects had been able to flee because the complaints had not been submitted earlier, and they urged victims to file complaints rather than post accusations online.
The Fairmont Hotel case was publicised on an Instagram account that had earlier exposed accusations against a university student from a wealthy background of raping and blackmailing multiple women.
Activists hope the campaigns will lead to wider prosecution of sex crimes, though they say social attitudes and the legal framework still require deep change.
Last week, Egypt's parliament gave final approval to a law aimed at protecting the identity of sexual harassment and assault victims.

Separate attacks over the last two weeks in regions contested by groups involved with drug trafficking have sparked anger among Colombians and criticism from human rights organizations.
Two attacks in Narino province left a total of 14 dead, while others in Cauca, Arauca and other areas registered death tolls of six, five or lower.
The areas where the killings have taken place have drug trafficking and illegal mining in common, Rafael Guarin, presidential adviser for security, told journalists in a video event. They also share a weak state presence going back decades, he said.
""Of course we need efficient armed forces who give results, who protect the population, who confront and destroy organized armed groups, but it's clear the answer isn't just troops and more troops and police and more police, but a focus on holistic intervention,"" Guarin said. ""That means we need a strong presence of state institutions and social services and a focus on substituting illicit economies with licit ones.""
Accelerating development plans in high-violence areas is already part of government policy, Guarin added.
""The social element is a central element within the security strategy,"" he said. ""These are critical security areas.""
Drug trafficking has long fueled Colombia's decades-long internal conflict, which has killed more than 260,000 and displaced millions. 
Fighting over lucrative drug and illegal mining territory has accelerated in some parts of the country since the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels demobilized under a 2016 peace deal, leaving areas uncontrolled.
The leftist guerrilla group the National Liberation Army, former members of the FARC who reject the peace accord, criminal groups composed of former right-wing paramilitaries and drugs gangs are all involved in trafficking and illegal mining.

MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus's most celebrated writer called on Russia on Wednesday to help persuade President Alexander Lukashenko to negotiate, as she arrived for questioning in a criminal case accusing an opposition body of an illegal attempt to seize power.
""Now Lukashenko speaks only to Putin. We need him to speak to the people,"" Svetlana Alexievich, winner of the 2015 Nobel Prize for Literature, told reporters outside the Investigative Committee, where she appeared for questioning.
""Maybe the world can help us, so that Lukashenko will negotiate with somebody,"" she said. ""We need the world to help, and maybe Russia.""
She emerged after a short time and said she had invoked her right not to testify against herself. She said there was no basis for the investigation, adding: ""The more we stay together, the stronger we will be, and the greater chance we will have of making the authorities talk to us.""
Alexievich is one of dozens of public figures who formed the opposition Coordination Council last week, with the stated aim of negotiating a peaceful transition of power after an election the opposition says was rigged.
Lukashenko called it an attempt to seize power illegally. Two of its leaders were jailed on Tuesday.
At least 20 people were detained as police cleared Minsk's Independence Square of hundreds of protesters on Wednesday evening, a Reuters witness said. Local media also reported detentions elsewhere in Minsk and the city of Brest. 
At the suggestion of the Coordination Council, residents had also formed long queues in several parts of the capital to sign a petition demanding the resignation of lawmakers in a parliament that remains outwardly loyal to Lukashenko. 
Rights groups said Belarusian police had rounded up dozens of protesters heading home from peaceful demonstrations on Tuesday after days in which the authorities exercised comparative restraint towards anti-government rallies.
Lukashenko has faced more than two weeks of mass demonstrations against his 26-year-old rule since the election, which official results say he won with 80 percent of the vote. He denies electoral fraud and says the protests are funded from abroad.
Although Lukashenko has called the protesters ""rats"" and said he has given the order to clear them from the streets, police had been comparatively restrained in recent days, apparently wary of a crackdown that would add to public anger.
BEATINGS
In the early days of the protests, police beat demonstrators and many of those who were arrested emerged with heavy bruises and said they had been abused in detention. In her comments before questioning, Alexievich deplored that violence. 
""For God's sake let there not be blood spilled,"" she said. ""What we saw the first three days, when they turned people into meat, that is from last century."" 
Rights group Spring listed more than 30 people it said had been arrested on Tuesday. In one typical account, a man wearing a red-and-white opposition flag on his shoulder was walking with his wife and young son, when an unmarked car pulled up, the group said. Two men in plain clothes jumped out, pushed the woman and child away, shoved the man into the car and drove off.
The Interior Ministry said police had detained 51 people for administrative violations after unsanctioned rallies on Tuesday. It typically reports dozens of such arrests per day.
Belarus has the closest cultural, economic and political ties to Russia of any former Soviet state. Russia has signalled its support for Lukashenko, including sending journalists to staff state television after workers quit in protest against what they described as orders to broadcast propaganda.
But it remains to be seen how long the Kremlin will stick by Lukashenko if his authority continues to ebb away. He has long had a difficult personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A Russian government plane which is used to carry senior government officials, including the head of the FSB security service, landed in Minsk on Wednesday, flight tracking data showed.

This was its second such flight in just over a week. Reuters could not determine who was aboard.

DUBAI/VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran said on Wednesday it was ending a months-long standoff with the U.N. nuclear watchdog by granting it access to two sites suspected of once hosting secret activities, easing diplomatic pressure on Tehran as Washington seeks to reimpose sanctions.
Wednesday's breakthrough in the dispute over the sites was announced in a joint statement by Tehran and the International Atomic Energy Agency during IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi's first visit to the Islamic Republic since he took over the role in December.
""Iran is voluntarily providing the IAEA with access to the two locations specified by the IAEA,"" Grossi and Iran's nuclear agency chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, said in the joint statement, confirming an earlier report by Reuters.
It said dates for IAEA inspectors to visit the sites - one near Karaj west of Tehran, the other near Isfahan in central Iran - had been agreed, without naming them, as well as the parameters of ""verification activities"" there.
Asked upon his return to Vienna when those dates were, Grossi declined to say exactly because such details are confidential. But he told reporters, ""It is very, very soon."" 
In March Grossi informed his agency that Iran had denied IAEA inspectors access to the two sites, where uranium conversion and explosives testing are suspected of having been carried out in the early 2000s. Demolition and other work that might have removed traces of the past - ""sanitization"" in inspectors' parlance - appear to have since occurred there. 
The IAEA had demanded access to the sites since January because they are suspected of having hosted nuclear material, which the agency must fully account for in order to verify that a country's nuclear activities are entirely peaceful. 
Under a 2015 deal with major powers, Iran is implementing the so-called Additional Protocol, an agreement with individual member states that grants the IAEA the power to carry out snap inspections, even of places not declared to be nuclear sites.
While the Vienna-based agency says it has the right to go to the sites without permission, Iran objected because at least some of the information pointing to the sites came from a trove of documents on its past activities that Tehran's main Middle East adversary Israel says it seized in Iran.
U.S. intelligence services and the IAEA believe Iran had a clandestine nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. The Islamic Republic has long denied seeking to develop atomic bombs.
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW
Wednesday's statement said that, at least for now, the IAEA does not want access to more undeclared sites. 
It is still, however, seeking answers on the origin and whereabouts of a uranium metal disc that may have been at a third site that it sees no point in going to because of ""extensive sanitization and levelling"" there in 2003 and 2004. 
""In this present context, based on analysis of available information to the IAEA, the IAEA does not have any further questions to Iran and further requests for access to locations other than those declared by Tehran,"" the statement said.
While Wednesday's deal must still be followed through on and will begin a process of taking samples and checking the origin of any nuclear particles that are found, it marks an initial victory for Grossi and his agency, whose 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution in June raising pressure on Iran.
It also comes as the United States, despite having pulled out of world powers' deal with Iran in 2018, is seeking to use a mechanism available to parties to the deal to trigger the reimposition of global U.N. sanctions against Tehran that were lifted under the 2015 accord.

Wednesday's agreement ""will end the case (of the two sites)"", Salehi told Iranian state TV, while reiterating that Iran will not accept any demands beyond its commitments under the 2015 accord.

DUBLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Phil Hogan quit as the EU's Trade Commissioner on Wednesday after days of pressure over allegations he breached COVID-19 guidelines during a trip to his native Ireland, saying it had become clear the controversy was a distraction from his work.
The forced exit of a heavyweight from the bloc's executive will be a credibility blow for the team led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for less than a year.
The Commission will play a key role in pushing across the line a 750 billion-euro recovery fund for EU economies hammered by the coronavirus crisis, and Hogan himself had been making headway in fraught trade talks with the United States.
""It was becoming increasingly clear that the controversy concerning my recent visit to Ireland was becoming a distraction from my work as an EU Commissioner and would undermine my work in the key months ahead,"" Hogan said in a statement.
""I deeply regret that my trip to Ireland – the country that I have been so proud to represent as a public servant for most of my adult life - caused such concern, unease and upset.""
Hogan attended a golf dinner last week that outraged the Irish public and led to the resignation of an Irish minister and the disciplining of several lawmakers. He had insisted on Tuesday that he adhered to all rules during the trip.
Hogan's political fortunes have faded fast. Only weeks ago, he had considered a bid to become the next director-general of the World Trade Organization. Hogan told RTE TV that ""this could be the end of my political chapter.""
The commissioner, who oversees trade policy for the world's biggest trading bloc, apologised three times for attending the event with some 80 others. But he came under pressure when it became clear he had not completed 14 days of self-isolation in line with the rules for incoming travellers to Ireland.
Hogan was asked by von der Leyen to provide a detailed account of his 20-day trip, which included three visits to the county of Kildare, two made, he said, to collect essential trade documents and his passport even though it was in a local lockdown.
Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin and his deputy Leo Varadkar, leader of the Fine Gael party for whom Hogan served as a minister, said on Tuesday there were clear breaches of COVID-19 public health guidelines during Hogan's trip.
Martin and Varadkar said they believed Hogan had taken the correct course of action on Wednesday given the circumstances of the past week and that they would consider his replacement in due course.
Hogan's resignation, less than a year into his term in trade and six years after he was appointed Agriculture Commissioner, means Ireland will have to nominate a new representative to the commission. It may not retain the same brief if von der Leyen opts to reshuffle her team.
Potential nominees include Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, Mairead McGuinness, a vice president of the European Parliament, and Richard Bruton, an experienced former minister who missed out on a cabinet post in June, Irish newspapers have reported.

All three are member of Hogan and Varadkar's Fine Gael party.

""I am not a candidate for re-election as president of the Chamber,"" Maia told reporters, ending months of speculation over his plans.
Maia, 50, played a crucial role in getting the government's pension reform through an unenthusiastic Congress last year and has backed other reforms planned by Guedes, such as the need to modernize and simplify Brazil's complex tax system.
By law, Maia could not seek a new two-year term as head of the lower chamber in the same session of Congress, an issue that the Supreme Court is expected to rule on.

Maia, a congressman from Rio de Janeiro, was investigated for bribes he allegedly received from Brazilian engineering conglomerate Odebrecht, according to a federal police report sent last year to the prosecutor general, who has yet to decide whether to indict Maia.

(Reuters) - Chicago and three other cities on Wednesday sued the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), demanding it correct how it interprets what is a firearm and halt the sale of untraceable ""ghost gun"" kits increasingly used in crimes.
The lawsuit is the first of its kind filed against the ATF, according to lawyers for the cities of Chicago, San Jose, Columbia, South Carolina, and Syracuse, New York. It was filed in the Southern District of New York. 
So-called ""ghost gun"" or ""80% gun"" kits are self-assembled from parts purchased online or at gun shows. The parts that are assembled are not classified as a firearm by the ATF. For that reason they can be legally sold with no background checks and without serial numbers to identify the finished product. 
The lawsuit argues the ATF and the Department of Justice ""refuse to apply the clear terms of the Gun Control Act,"" which the suit says defines regulated firearms as not only working weapons ""but also their core building blocks - frames for pistols, and receivers for long guns."" 
The ATF says on its website that receivers in which the fire-control cavities are solid ""have not reached the 'stage of manufacture' which would result in the classification of a firearm."" 
The ATF said in an emailed statement that it would not comment on pending litigation. It said that its ""regulatory and enforcement functions are focused and clearly defined by laws."" The bureau emphasized that it investigates criminal possession and other criminal use of privately made firearms.
Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group that is a plaintiff in the lawsuit along with the cities, argues that until about 2006, the ATF did require unfinished components that clearly were going to be used to make guns to carry a serial number and anyone buying them undergo a background check. 
""The ATF used to interpret the Gun Control Act the right way - they would look at how quickly a frame or receiver could be converted into an operable weapon,"" said Eric Tirschwell, managing director for the litigation arm of Everytown. ""If it was pretty quickly, they would say 'yeah, that's a firearm.'""
TECHNOLOGY TROUBLES
How many ghost guns are in circulation is unknown, but law enforcement agencies are unanimous in saying numbers are growing. Police in Washington, D.C. last year recovered more than 100 ghost guns - a 342% increase over 2018. They are already on pace this year to double the number found.
The ATF has said upward of 30% of the illegal weapons it has confiscated in some areas of California are ghost guns. 
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, whose city has been beset by gun violence, demanded the ATF close the ghost gun loophole and regulate the sale of gun parts that are marketed to easily be used to build guns. 
""Individuals with dangerous histories shouldn't be able to order lethal weapons on the internet with a few quick clicks,"" Lightfoot said. 
But Rick Vasquez, a Virginia-based firearms consultant and former ATF technical expert who evaluated guns and gun products to help the bureau determine if they were legal, said anyone wanting to address the proliferation of kit guns should pass new laws in Congress. 
The continued rapid advancement of tools and technology widely available to the public meant it was getting to the point where even rudimentary ""chunks of metal"" can be turned into firearms, Vasquez said. 

""How do you regulate that? The ATF can't do it. This situation is uncontrollable because of technology, and I'm not sure what anyone can do about it.""

EU officials now believe the UK government is prepared to risk a no-deal exit when the transition period comes to an end on Dec. 31, and will try to pin the blame on Brussels if talks fail, the report added. 
The German government, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU council, had intended to discuss Brexit during the meeting on Sept. 2, but has dropped the issue because there has not been ""any tangible progress"" in the talks, the report said, citing an EU diplomat.
Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, on Wednesday repeated his call for a deal with Britain on future ties by the end of October, after negotiations made little progress last week.
Barnier told Reuters on the sidelines of an employers' conference in Paris that he had no plans to meet his British counterpart David Frost this week, before adding: ""But perhaps next week, if conditions allow.""
Disagreements over state aid rules and fishing quotas have so far thwarted a deal, which the EU says must be in the making in time to be approved at an Oct. 15-16 summit of the bloc's 27 national leaders to enable ratification this year.
Beyond the biggest stumbling blocks, differences also linger in discussions on migration, security, dispute-settling mechanisms, human rights guarantees and other areas.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 03:05PM ET</span>","After port blast, rudderless Lebanon drifts towards the rocks","By Tom Perry and Laila Bassam
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Three weeks after the catastrophic explosion at Beirut port, Lebanon is drifting towards even more trouble as its politicians fail to agree a new government that can arrest a financial meltdown.
As Lebanon grapples with the aftermath of the blast that killed 180 people, its politicians have been locked in fruitless talks to agree on a new prime minister who might be able to restart International Monetary Fund talks and enact reforms.
Even before the Aug. 4 port explosion, caused by unsafely stored chemicals, the financial collapse had devastated lives across Lebanon, fuelling hyperinflation and poverty and demolishing the value of savings in a now zombie banking system.
An intervention by French President Emmanuel Macron, who is due to visit again Lebanon on Sept. 1, has been unable to break the impasse among the sectarian leaders responsible for steering Lebanon into crisis.
All-too-familiar personal rivalries and factional interests are getting in the way.
Now, barring a course correction, Lebanon is at risk of even deeper chaos, in the assessment of three senior sources from different parties. 
The central bank has warned it can only subsidise imports of basic goods for three more months, an official source said, raising concern that prices of fuel, wheat and medicine will spiral later this year.
""It is very dangerous now. We were at a crossroads: either the right path or continuing going down the road to no IMF, no international aid, no money. This is pushing Lebanon towards chaos, complete collapse,"" said one senior political source.
A senior European diplomat said: ""The speed of politics does not reflect the urgency of the situation. Does August 4 not show things need to change?""
France's foreign minister said on Tuesday Lebanon's leaders should not use the explosion as an excuse to hide the reality that the country was on the edge of a precipice.
""We hope that this moment will be the moment which allows the Lebanese authorities, the Lebanese officials, to take the necessary leap for a government with a mission to initiate the essential reforms that everyone knows (are needed),"" Jean-Yves Le Drian said.
The financial collapse is the biggest threat to Lebanon’s stability since the 1975-90 civil war.
Donor states want to see reforms to curb waste and corruption that are the root causes of the collapse. But three cabinets have failed to make progress on reform since donors pledged more than $11 billion to Lebanon in 2018.
The currency has sunk by as much as 80% since October.
""WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS IN CHARGE"" 
Prime Minister Hassan Diab quit on Aug. 10 over the port blast. Nominated by the Iran-backed Shi’ite group Hezbollah and its allies in January using their parliamentary majority, Diab stays on as caretaker until a new government is formed.
The prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim in Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system.
Hezbollah and its Shi'ite ally Amal are pressing for the return of Saad al-Hariri, seeing him as well placed to galvanise foreign support. 
But this has hit resistance from several parties, each for their own reasons.
The opponents include Hezbollah’s ally the Maronite Christian President Michel Aoun and his son-in-law, Free Patriotic Movement leader Gebran Bassil, who have been at loggerheads with Hariri since last year.
At the other end of the spectrum, neither the Christian Lebanese Forces Party, seen as close to Saudi Arabia, nor Druze leader Walid Jumblatt want him back in the job for now.
""If it isn't Saad al-Hariri, we will remain with a caretaker government"" until the end of Aoun's term in 2022, said a senior politician familiar with the thinking of Hezbollah and Amal. 
""We are currently in a state of chaos,"" the politician said. Without a deal on a new government, ""we will go to even more chaos in the street"". 
Hariri announced on Tuesday he was not a candidate for the job. He has insisted he will only become prime minister of a cabinet of non-aligned experts with public sector experience able to drive through reform. 
The Saudi ambassador to Lebanon, Waleed Bukhari, told Reuters reforming Lebanon was more important than the identity of the next prime minister. 
""What matters to the international community is the next government's programme and its ... policies to meet the expectations of the Lebanese people and restore trust,"" he said.
Unless a compromise can be reached on Hariri, the choice now for Hezbollah, Aoun and Lebanon's powerful parliament speaker and head of the Shi'ite Amal movement Nabih Berri is whether to seek out another Sunni or leave Diab in a caretaker capacity. 
Hezbollah and Amal do not want anyone but Hariri, the politician familiar with their thinking said.
""Now, after three weeks, there has been nothing; we don't know who is in charge,"" said a former government minister. 
""Not one of the current elite has moved one inch"" in addressing demands for a government that implements political and economic reforms. ""No one is asking 'what is it that we have to do?' No one is proposing anything.""
The ruling majority in the political establishment could lean on the central bank to access the gold reserves to finance subsidies for a while longer to stave off chaos, said a senior opposition official familiar with the Lebanese Forces' position, referring to reserves valued at $18 billion as of Aug. 15.
But he added: ""I can't see any compromise government being able to conduct any reforms and I can't see them agreeing on an independent government. This is pushing the country into further chaos either way.""

128,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",EU Trade Chief Hogan to Resign Over Coronavirus Backlash,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Union’s trade chief, Phil Hogan, will resign on Wednesday, according to an official familiar with his plans who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.
Hogan was under pressure over his attendance at a golf dinner last week in his native Ireland that violated coronavirus regulations.
The move came a day after Ireland’s government said that Hogan’s “delayed and hesitant” response undermined public confidence. Green coalition partner Eamon Ryan added later that Hogan’s public comments could also undermine the country’s health regulations.
Hogan’s planned resignation comes at a sensitive time in trade negotiations. The EU will have to fill a key post that has become even more high profile as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” challenge to the global commercial order and a pandemic-induced shock to supply chains.
Point Person
With Hogan as its point person, the EU has been pushing the Trump administration to scrap controversial tariffs on steel and aluminum, ward off threats of more U.S. duties on European goods including cars and negotiate a settlement to a longstanding transatlantic fight over aircraft subsidies.
The 27-nation bloc is also seeking to prop up the World Trade Organization after its ability to adjudicate disputes was hobbled by Washington, expand a free-trade push by reaching tariff-cutting deals with Australia and New Zealand and achieve a breakthrough in negotiations to open the Chinese market more to foreign investors.
On Aug. 21, Hogan and his U.S. counterpart Robert Lighthizer announced a limited tariff-cutting accord and signaled the deal could pave the way for a broader improvement in transatlantic trade relations.
That $200 million deal, which includes an EU pledge to eliminate tariffs on American lobster, came hours after the European Commission led by President Ursula von der Leyen expressed support for Hogan in the controversy over the golf dinner.
The Brussels-based commission, the EU’s executive arm, stressed that Hogan had respected Ireland’s self-isolation requirement upon returning to the country in late July. The commission also said that he attended the dinner “in good faith” and on the “clear understanding” the organizers had been assured the proposed arrangements would comply with the Irish government’s guidelines.
But the political fallout in Ireland grew on Aug. 22 when Prime Minister Micheal Martin and Deputy Premier Leo Varadkar spoke with Hogan and “asked him to consider his position,” according to a government spokesperson.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 02:38PM ET</span>","Survivors, grieving families reject NZ mosque shooter's 'white supremacist' world view","By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The father of slain three-year-old Mucaad Ibrahim, the youngest victim in the New Zealand mosque shootings, told the white supremacist who gunned down his son that ""true justice"" awaited him in the next life and it would be more severe than prison.
""You have killed my son and to me it is as if you have killed the whole of New Zealand,"" Aden Ibrahim Diriye said in a statement read by a family member during a sentencing hearing for Brenton Tarrant on Wednesday.
""Know that true justice is waiting for you in the next life and that will be far more severe. I will never forgive you for what you have done.""
Gunman Brenton Tarrant, a 29-year-old Australian, is scheduled to be sentenced this week after pleading guilty to 51 murders, 40 attempted murders and one charge of committing a terrorist act during the 2019 shooting rampage in the city of Christchurch which he livestreamed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
A murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison. The judge can impose a life term without parole, a sentence that has never been used in New Zealand.
Survivors and families of victims have addressed the court this week and many have urged the judge to sentence Tarrant to the most severe sentence.
Diriye, a refugee from Somalia who moved to New Zealand 25 years ago, told the court his son had been robbed of a future.
""He used to engage and play with the police; at home he would run around the house pretending to be a cop and wear police uniform. We thought one day he might become a police officer,"" he said in his statement.
SURVIVORS, FAMILIES DEFIANT
While most of Tarrant's victims were at Al Noor mosque, including Mucaad Ibrahim, he killed seven people at the Linwood mosque.
The casualty list would likely have been higher if it weren't for Abdul Aziz Wahabzadah, who was commended for his courage on Wednesday by High Court Judge Cameron Mander after confronting Tarrant at the Linwood mosque.
After shots rang out in the mosque, Aziz engaged Tarrant outside, throwing a bank card machine at him and drawing fire when the gunman returned to his car, loaded with high-powered weapons, ammunition and incendiary devices.
""I didn't want him to go inside the mosque because we had 80-100 people praying at that time,"" Aziz said on Wednesday.
Aziz took cover, and weaved through parked cars, to stop Tarrant getting a clear shot. Tarrant's plan frustrated, he left quickly in his car and was detained en route to a third mosque. 
Ahad Nabi, who lost his 71-year-old father in the attack, stared at Tarrant before delivering a passionate statement, demanding that Tarrant should ""never walk free"" for his cowardly actions on March 15, 2019.
""You are weak, a sheep with a wolf's jacket on for only 10 minutes of your whole life,"" said Nabi, referring to the shooting rampage.
""This world was created with colour, a peasant like you will never change the human race.""
Sara Qasem, daughter of victim Abdelfattah Qasem, said she would miss smelling her father's garden sauce cooking and wanted to hear his stories about the ""olive trees in Palestine"".
""You made a choice here - a conscious, stupid, irresponsible, cold-blooded, selfish, disgusting, heinous, evil choice,"" Qasem said, looking at Tarrant, seated and surrounded by guards.
Tarrant, who is representing himself, will not speak ahead of his sentencing, court officials said on Wednesday. He has directed a lawyer assisting the court to make a brief statement on his behalf. The judge has previously said sentencing would not occur before Thursday.
Prosecutors have told the court that Tarrant wanted to instil fear in those he described as invaders and that he carefully planned the attacks to cause maximum carnage.
Live reporting from the courtroom was banned, and other restrictions were put in place on what the media could report.
The hearings were adjourned until Thursday morning.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Kremlin says does not want Navalny illness to damage ties with West,"By Gleb Stolyarov and Anton Zverev
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday it hoped opposition politician Alexei Navalny's illness would not damage Russia's ties with the West and that it was keen to find out why he fell ill despite declining to open an investigation into the incident. 
Navalny is in a medically induced coma in a Berlin hospital where he was airlifted on Saturday after collapsing during a flight. The German clinic said its initial medical examination pointed to poisoning, though Russian doctors who had treated Navalny in a Siberian hospital have contradicted that diagnosis.
Germany, the United States and other countries have called on Russia to investigate the circumstances that led to Navalny's illness but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the diagnosis so far was inconclusive.
Replying to a question on the possible worsening of relations between Moscow and the West, Peskov said: ""Of course we would not like this (to happen), that's the first thing.
""Secondly, there is no reason for that."" 
President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte later on Wednesday in which they discussed Navalny's health.
""The Russian side stressed the inadmissibility of hasty and unfounded accusations in this regard,"" the Kremlin said in a statement about the call. It said Moscow wanted the circumstances surrounding Navalny's condition to come to light.
Peskov's comments and Putin's phone call come a day after the speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament said a committee would launch an inquiry to determine whether foreign forces had played a hand in Navalny's illness in order to fuel tensions in Russia.
Asked about the parliamentary speaker's theory about foreign forces, Peskov said if poisoning was confirmed and the substance definitively identified, ""then there would be reason to consider whom it benefits"". 
""We are no less interested than anyone else to know what led to the coma,"" he added. 
Earlier, a senior ally of Navalny said he believed only Putin could have authorised the suspected poisoning of the outspoken Kremlin critic. Ivan Zhdanov, the director of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), did not provide any evidence for the claim.
""He (Putin) hates what the FBK does too much, exposing him and his entourage,"" Zhdanov said. 
The Kremlin has dismissed as ""hot air"" and untrue any suggestion Putin was somehow involved in Navalny falling ill. 
Cholinesterase inhibitors, named by German doctors as a possible cause of Navalny's illness, are chemical compounds used in certain medicines. Nerve gases and ""Novichok"" - the substance used in 2018 to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in England - are also cholinesterase inhibitors. 
Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level graft. 
However, he has said he believes his death would not help Putin. Reuters reported he had told supporters just before his illness that his death would ""turn him into a hero"".

The pressure on Russia following Navalny's illness has hit Russian markets, with the rouble tumbling on Wednesday to four-year lows against the euro.

The visit followed a U.S. brokered-accord this month, which saw the UAE become just the third Arab state to agree to establish full diplomatic ties with Israel.
Pompeo, who this week also visited Jerusalem, Sudan and Bahrain, sought to build on the momentum of the agreement for regional peace, he said in a tweet after arriving in the UAE.
Pompeo and UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan spoke about support for ""de-escalation and a lasting ceasefire in Libya, Gulf unity and countering Iran's malign influence in the region,"" the state department said.
The United States, UAE and Israel see Iran as the main threat to the Middle East, though the UAE has said forging diplomatic ties with Israel was not directed at Tehran.
Top UAE and Israeli defence officials pledged defence cooperation this week, but this came amid Israeli dissent at the prospect that the deal could grant the Gulf power access to advanced weaponry previously denied to it, such as F-35 stealth fighter jets.
A senior U.S. State Department official said on Wednesday talks between Israel and the UAE were continuing and there was no backtracking.
UAE's state news agency WAM on Wednesday cited Morgan Ortagus, spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, saying there were ""incredibly positive conversations going on"" between the United States, Israel and UAE with regard to selling F-35 warplanes to the Gulf country.
The UAE, along with Russia and Egypt, supports the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar, which is fighting Libya's internationally recognised government for control of the war-torn North African state.
The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties with fellow U.S. ally Qatar in mid-2017, over accusations Doha supports Islamic militant groups. Qatar denies the charges and says the bloc is attempting to infringe its sovereignty.
Washington, which wants a united Gulf Arab front against Iran, has tried to mediate an end to the dispute.

UAE National Security Advisor Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed al-Nahyan also attended the meeting in Abu Dhabi, the State Department said.

Nigerian lawmakers this year launched an investigation into alleged financial mismanagement at the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) over the last 20 years.
An audit of the body was ordered by President Muhammadu Buhari in October.
Godswill Akpabio, the minister for Niger Delta Affairs, said the appointment of a team of auditors was approved at a meeting of the ministerial cabinet on Wednesday. He said the auditors would examine projects approved by NDDC over the last 19 years. 
""Through this exercise, we will know the amount of monies that have gone into the region in the last 19 years and whether the value we have received so far are commensurate with the monies that have entered into NDDC,"" he told reporters after the meeting. 
Asked about the cost of the audit, Akpabio said Buhari last year approved around 2.5 billion naira ($6.57 million) to cover the cost of the exercise. 
A spokesman for NDDC did not immediately respond to a phone call and text messages requesting a comment. 
The Niger Delta remains impoverished despite providing most of the oil, the mainstay of the economy, produced in Africa's biggest crude exporter. Locals have for decades complained of poverty, with anger at times spilling over into attacks on energy facilities.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has detained another relative of a former senior intelligence official living in exile who recently filed a lawsuit in a U.S. court alleging the kingdom's crown prince had tried to have him killed, his family said on Wednesday.
Saudi authorities had already detained Saad al-Jabri's two adult children and brother in March to try to force his return to the kingdom from exile in Canada, the family and sources with knowledge of the situation had told Reuters earlier this year.
Jabri was an aide to Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was ousted and replaced as heir to the throne by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) in a 2017 palace coup. The sources had said that Jabri has access to sensitive information that MbS fears could be compromising.
Jabri's family said in a statement tweeted by his son Khalid that Jabri's son-in-law, Salem Almuzaini, was summoned on Monday to a Saudi state security offices where he was arrested.
""His arrest and disappearance are the latest acts of reprisal and intimidation by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince ... against Dr. Jabri for his filing of a Torture Victim Prevention Act claim in U.S. federal court,"" the statement said.
The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Almuzaini's arrest.
Jabri, who has lived in Canada since late 2017, earlier this month alleged in a lawsuit filed in U.S. federal court in the District of Columbia that Crown Prince Mohammmed sent a team to kill him in 2018 but that the effort was foiled by Canadian authorities.
The alleged incident took place less than two weeks after Saudi agents murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate, sparking a global furore. MbS has denied ordering Khashoggi's killing but said he ultimately bore ""full responsibility"" as the kingdom's de facto leader.
Riyadh has not publicly commented on Jabri's lawsuit.
The family statement said Almuzaini had in 2017 been renditioned by Saudi authorities from Dubai emirate in the United Arab Emirates, but was released in January 2018 after reaching a ""settlement"" and placed under a travel ban. 
Since then, the statement said, he had been ""used by Saudi state security as a means to communicate and exert the Kingdom's influence on Dr. Jabri's family"".
Bin Nayef himself was detained on March 6 along with two other senior royals in what sources have said was the latest in a series of extraordinary measures by MbS to sideline rivals and remove perceived threats to his eventual succession as king.
A source close to bin Nayef said his family had not had any details on his health and detention conditions for several months. The government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on bin Nayef's status.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will give up to C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) in additional funding to provinces and territories to help reopen schools safely as students return to classrooms amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday.
""Students and staff are anxious about what the school year may hold. As a dad and as a former teacher, I get that,"" Trudeau said at a public school in Toronto where he announced the federal funding.
""We've made this funding flexible so provinces and ultimately schools can use it for what they need most from hand sanitizer to remote learning,"" he added.
Schools across much of the country have been closed since mid-March, with most students moved to online learning until schools paused for their traditional summer break.
The Canadian school year typically starts in early September, but many districts have said they will either delay or stagger the return this year as they get plans in place to try to limit the spread of the virus among children.
Tensions between teachers, unions, parents, and provincial governments have been mounting ahead of the fall term, with many worried current restart plans do not go far enough to protect students from the coronavirus.

Many want class sizes capped to ensure physical distancing, while critics say some school districts lack the necessary resources, staff and ventilation systems needed to ensure a safe return to school.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The man who cut short the life and music of rock superstar John Lennon with a burst of bullets nearly 40 years ago lost his 11th bid to be freed from a sentence that could keep him behind bars for the rest of his life, a New York prison system spokesperson said on Wednesday. 
A parole board denied a request for release from Mark David Chapman, who must wait two more years before he becomes eligible again, the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision spokesperson said.
The rationale behind the decision of the Board of Parole panel members who interviewed Chapman on Aug. 19 at the Wende Correctional Facility near Buffalo, was not immediately disclosed. 
Chapman, 65, who has previously said that he long ago stopped being the troubled young man who shot one of the most famous people in the world to gain notoriety, is serving 20 years to life after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. 
The assassination-style murder of Lennon, a founder of the Beatles who also had solo hits such as ""Imagine"" and ""(Just Like) Starting Over"", stunned the music world, the British-born musician's adopted home of New York City and a generation that grew up with ""Beatlemania."" 
At 40, Lennon had just emerged from a musical hiatus with the release of his ""Double Fantasy"" album when he went to a nighttime recording session on Dec. 8, 1980. When he returned to his home on Manhattan's Upper West Side, Chapman was waiting for him and shot him four times in front of his wife Yoko Ono.
Since 2000, the first year Chapman was eligible for parole, Ono, 87, has steadfastly opposed his release. Her attorney, Jonas Herbsman, said she submitted comments to the parole board, which he would only say are ""consistent with the prior letters.""
At his previous parole interview in August 2018 Chapman said he was a changed man and a religious Christian who would welcome freedom even though he said he did not deserve it.

A remorseful Chapman, whose 2018 prison photo shows a leaner man than the pudgy 25-year-old who pulled the trigger, remembered being in a “tug of war” with himself over what he was about to do before yielding to the idea of killing for fame.
“I was too far in,” he said in a transcript of the hearing.
Chapman has worked as a porter and wheelchair repairman at the prison hospital and has occasionally been visited by his wife whom he married about 18 months before the murder.

The 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was formally certified on Aug. 26, 1920, after decades of struggle by suffragettes. It states, ""the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.""
The date is marked in the United States each year as Women's Equality Day.
For the women's suffrage movement, the amendment's ratification was a realization of the Constitution's first phrase, ""We the People"" - although it would take until 1965 for the rights of Black women and men to vote to be protected. 
In New York's Central Park, a statue of three 19th century pioneers of women's suffrage, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was unveiled, all of whom had died by the time women could vote.
""While the passage of the 19th Amendment was a critical, important, historic victory, it was also an incomplete one,"" said former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at the unveiling. 
""It would take decades longer to guarantee the franchise for women of color, especially Black and Native American women. And a century later, the struggle to enforce the right to vote continues. We're still fighting so that every eligible American can cast their ballot and know their vote will be counted regardless of race, age or geography,"" she added. 
Last week, President Donald Trump issued a pardon to Anthony, who was fined for voting illegally in 1872.
""There is nothing more important... to honor the women portrayed in this statue than to vote. That is the best way to lead America forward; as the suffragists used to say, 'forward through the darkness, forward into light,'"" said Clinton.
U.S. Senator and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris wrote in a tweet, ""We cannot mark Women's Equality Day without remembering the voters of color who weren't included in the 19th Amendment victory a century ago - women who faced poll taxes and literacy tests.""
""To honor their sacrifices, let's vote in record numbers this fall.""
Later on Wednesday, national landmarks will be lit up in purple and gold, the symbolic colors of the suffrage movement.

""Women's suffrage is a long story of hard work and heartache crowned by victory,"" Carrie Chapman Catt, the founder of the U.S. League of Women Voters, said in 1920.

The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on a 2-1 vote that Gavin Grimm, now a college student, is protected under federal law that bars sex discrimination in education and the U.S. Constitution's requirement that people be treated equally under the law.
Grimm's lawsuit dates back to 2015. Grimm sued the Gloucester County School Board after officials at a local public high school refused to allow him to use the boys' restrooms. Born a girl, Grimm identifies as male. 
Judge Henry Floyd, writing for the 4th Circuit, said the school board's actions constituted ""a special kind of discrimination against a child that he will no doubt carry with him for life.""
The appeals court upheld a federal judge's 2019 ruling in Grimm's favor.
Bathroom access has become a major issue in the battle over transgender rights, and Grimm's suit has been the most prominent legal case on the subject.
Grimm's case was previously set to be argued in 2017 before the U.S. Supreme Court but was taken off the schedule after President Donald Trump's administration rescinded guidance previously issued by the administration of President Barack Obama regarding bathroom access for transgender students.
Wednesday's decision cited the Supreme Court's landmark June ruling that gay and transgender people are protected under a federal law that bars sex discrimination in employment.
Floyd wrote that in light of that ruling, ""we have little difficulty in holding that a bathroom policy precluding Grimm from using the boys restrooms discriminated against him.""
The 4th Circuit ruling potentially could be appealed to the Supreme Court.

The Trump administration has taken a series of steps to limit the rights of transgender Americans. A federal judge on Aug. 17 blocked a Trump administration rule that would strip protections for transgender people facing healthcare discrimination.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Meltwater could undermine the walls of ice holding back Antarctica's glaciers, scientists reported on Wednesday, a finding that underscores concern about the potential for a significant sea level rise. 
The ice shelves, formed over thousands of years, serve as dams to prevent much of the continent's snow and ice from flowing toward the ocean. 
Scientists found that about 60% of the ice shelf area is vulnerable to a process call hydrofracturing, in which meltwater seeps into the shelves' crevasses, some of which are hundreds of meters deep, and triggers collapse. 
""This meltwater is heavier than ice, so it can penetrate through the entire ice thickness, just like a knife,"" said climate scientist Ching-Yao Lai at Colombia University.   
It's unclear how long such a process might take. Antarctic weather is highly variable, making it difficult for scientists to determine how much of a role is being played by human-caused climate change. 
Lai said, however, that previous research suggested meltwater could cover the ice shelves in about a century. 
The new study, published in the journal Nature, used AI to identify ice-fracture features in nearly 260 satellite images of 50 ice shelves across the continent. Those ice shelves surround about 75% of the Antarctic coastline. 
Finding vulnerabilities in the ice shelves buttressing the glaciers above was a surprise, Lai said. 
""Previously, we thought there are going to be places vulnerable to hydrofracture, but that those places might not matter at all for the ice sheet,"" Lai said. 
Scientists fear that losing ice shelves to hydrofracturing will leave Antarctica's ice sheets, which are as big as the United States and Mexico combined, a more direct pathway to the ocean. That could accelerate ice loss and contribute to sea level rise. 
The latest reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change project that future sea levels will rise by more than a meter by 2100. However, scientists worry that a sudden collapse of these steep ice shelves could raise future sea levels dramatically. More than half of the world's fresh water is locked into Antarctica's ice.
Meanwhile, warming temperatures driven by climate change are also eating into glaciers and the ice sheet in the Arctic. Last month, Canada's last intact ice shelf collapsed. 
And Greenland's ice sheet lost a record amount of mass last year, raising concerns the icy bulk is melting more quickly than anticipated. Greenland's ancient ice sheet holds enough water to raise sea levels by at least 20 feet (6 meters) if it were to melt entirely.
In Antarctica, if ""we start seeing the collapse of some of this ice that is there like a wall holding back everything behind it, it's just going to accelerate the pace of sea level rise beyond what we're probably predicting right now,"" said Alexandra Isern, head of Antarctic studies for the U.S. National Science Foundation who was not involved in the study. 
Once gone, the ice shelves wouldn't be able to form again ""in any time we'll ever see,"" Isern said. ""It took a long time to make them, and it maybe isn't going to take as long to get rid of them."" 
Scientists say that, while governments should prepare for higher seas, there is still time to curb climate-warming emissions in order to slow the rate of sea level rise and avoid coastal catastrophes. 
""There's no ice on the planet that gets along well with warming air and warming ocean temperatures,"" said glaciologist Twila Moon at the National Snow and Ice Data Center who was not involved in the study. 

""These kinds of details and tools are helping us to narrow our range of being able to say what will happen in the future, given that humans follow any particular path.""

The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the extradition of Britons Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, who are accused of the killing and torture of Western hostages in Syria. 
U.S. Attorney General William Barr said last week that U.S. prosecutors would not seek the death penalty against the men or carry out executions if they were imposed, an issue which had been a stumbling block for Britain handing over captured militants.
In March, Britain's Supreme Court had ruled that data protection laws meant Britain could not provide material to the United States or other foreign countries in cases which could lead to a death penalty. That decision followed legal action brought by Elsheikh’s mother, Maha El Gizouli.
The British courts imposed a block on the transfer of evidence while her case was ongoing. But the Supreme Court said it had released an order on Wednesday which formally ended El Gizouli's action and thus ended the legal prohibition. 
""The order concludes the proceedings in the Supreme Court, which means that the stay or the stop on providing material to the U.S. government is removed,"" a court spokeswoman said.
There was no immediate response from Britain's Home Office (interior ministry).
Kotey and Elsheikh are being held by the U.S. military in an unidentified overseas location after they were captured in 2019 but Barr said it was becoming untenable to continue to hold them.
The pair were members of a four-strong Islamic State unit that was known as the Beatles because they were English speakers. 
They are alleged to have detained or killed Western hostages, including U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig.
One member, Mohammed Emwazi, known as ""Jihadi John"", was believed to have been killed in a 2015 U.S.-British missile strike.
The U.S. Justice Department wants Britain to turn over evidence it has on Kotey and Elsheikh to allow them to be tried in the United States.

Barr had said if Britain did not turn over the material by Oct. 15, the United States would turn over the men for prosecution in the Iraqi justice system.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - In one of the areas worst affected by the Beirut blast, volunteers loaded boxes containing food and sanitary items into cars ready to distribute to those in need. 
Near the port where the catastrophic blast had originated, other volunteers took measurements to replace windows shattered by the explosion.
None of the groups organizing these volunteers is backed by the government. In fact, they say they are filling a void in reconstruction efforts that's been left by Lebanese authorities.
""The government should do the work we are doing but we are doing it because we have to,"" said Hussein Kazoun, originally a vegetable farmer. He and several friends took over an abandoned petrol station that they named ""Nation Station"", and turned it into a hub for distributing donations. 
""You can't see that aid is required and people need help and just do nothing"".
The needs are colossal. The blast killed around 180 people, injured thousands more and displaced 300,000. Survivors now face the mammoth task of rebuilding damaged homes and businesses amid an economic crisis that has left them unable to access their savings.
Other volunteer groups, like those at the so-called ""Basecamp"" in Mar Mikhael neighbourhood, have their roots in a wave of popular protests that began in October 2019 against state corruption and mishandling of the economy. 
Many residents blame years of government corruption and ineptitude for the blast and the months of economic decline that preceded it. They say their efforts send a message locally and abroad that they have no one to support them but themselves.      
""The government didn't ask about us, but the young people all came running to us, all of them,"" said Alexi Khoushdelian, a senior resident who was seeking aid from Nation Station. ""We come here to get food, to get clothes, what they get they give to us, whatever we need they give to us.""
Kazoun said that while the government had approached his group, they offered no concrete assistance but asked for data on who was being helped. The group declined to hand this over on concerns the information could be used to bribe residents in future elections. 
Despite the good intentions, the need in Lebanon is likely far greater than what the volunteers alone can offer. 
Basecamp volunteers walking down the streets with their boxes were accosted by half a dozen other residents seeking assistance. The volunteers urged them to call the Basecamp hotline but some residents were so impoverished that they didn't have money to charge their phones.    
""It's shocking because ... you think that there's a certain number of people or families that need help, and then wherever you go, you find that there's more and more and more and more,"" said Sarya Sarkis, a volunteer with Basecamp. 
""And it's just sad. It's really sad.""

The two powers are arguing over issues from trade to what the United States sees as aggressive moves by China's armed forces, especially in the disputed South China Sea and around Chinese-claimed Taiwan.
""We have a balance of power situation,"" Foreign Minister Teodoro Locsin said in an interview with ANC News Channel. ""We need the U.S. presence in Asia"".
The United States has long opposed China's territorial claims on the South China Sea, regularly sending warships to demonstrate freedom of navigation there. 
It hardened its position last month by rejecting Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea, a move which China condemned. 
Locsin said it would be in the Philippine's interest for the the United States to maintain its military presence in the region and he reiterated the country ""never stopped cooperation"" with its long-time security ally. 
In June, President Rodrigo Duterte suspended his decision to scrap a two-decade-old troop deployment agreement with the United States that has given the Philippines access to scores of annual training exercises, including expertise in tackling Islamist militants and maritime threats.
The U.S. military also formerly had two huge military bases in the Philippines - Subic Bay and Clark - but was evicted from them in 1992.
The two countries revived close ties from 2000 with war games, frequent visits and by helping against communist and Muslim insurgents.
​ The Philippines has lodged several diplomatic protests against what it sees as provocative Chinese activities in disputed sea, the latest filed against what it said was China's illegal confiscation of equipment from Filipino fisherman in a disputed lagoon.
""I was very firm about protecting what was ours. I was very firm about never bending a knee to China,"" Locsin said. 
China claims historic ownership of most of the South China Sea using old maps that it says are proof of sovereignty. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have claims.
Vietnam on Wednesday accused China of violating its sovereignty by conducting military drills in a disputed part of the South China Sea.
But while affirming the need for American military presence in the region, Philippines' Locsin said he would welcome economic opportunities offered by China.

Thousands of people traditionally attend the weekly Wednesday gatherings, but the Vatican shut out the public in March, following the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, with the pope instead making his address via a video link.
The Vatican said that from next week he would hold the audience in the San Damaso Courtyard of the Apostolic Palace, adding that anyone could attend. 
In the summer months the audiences are normally held in the much larger St. Peter's Square, in front of the main basilica. However, with far few foreigners travelling to Rome because of the coronavirus, smaller crowds are expected.
In his video address on Wednesday, the pope said the pandemic had aggravated social inequalities, with some children seeing their education interrupted and poorer nations lacking the resources to help them deal with the crisis.

""It is a virus that comes from a sick economy,"" Pope Francis said. ""In today's world, a few rich people possess more than all the rest of humanity ... This is an injustice that cries out to heaven.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison will announce on Thursday legislation giving the federal government new powers to review and cancel any agreements that local authorities and public institutions make or have made with foreign governments.
If approved by parliament, the law will give the federal government a veto over any deals made between state and territory governments, local councils, and public universities and foreign administrations.
While Morrison will not name China specifically, the new law is likely to further sour bilateral ties, and comes amid growing concerns over links between Australian institutions and Beijing.
""It is vital that when it comes to Australia's dealings with the rest of the world, we speak with one voice and work to one plan,"" Morrison will say on Thursday, according to extracts of a speech seen by Reuters.
The new legislation excludes commercial corporations and state-owned enterprises.
Under the new law, the country's foreign minister would be able to cancel any agreements made by local institutions if they ""adversely affect Australia's foreign relations"" or are ""inconsistent with Australian foreign policy"", a source familiar with the details of the plan told Reuters.
The legislation will also be retrospective, the source said.
Local authorities and public universities will have to inform the federal government of all deals with foreign nations within six months of the legislation becoming law. 
If Australia's foreign minister thinks the deals contravene the law, lawmakers will have the power to cancel them, the source said.
The changes threaten a suite of deals signed by Australian institutions in industries ranging from education to health and tourism, the source said.
China, Australia's largest trading partner, buys more than one-third of Australia's total exports, and sends more than a million tourists and students there each year.
It comes after Australia in 2017 introduced sweeping powers aimed at preventing external interference in domestic politics, which then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said was driven by Chinese meddling. 

That was widely seen as a turning point in the Australian-China relationship, which has reached its lowest point in decades during the coronavirus pandemic, straining two-way trade.

BRUSSELS/BAMAKO (Reuters) - The European Union has suspended its training missions in Mali after the military coup this month that removed President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita from power, EU officials said on Wednesday.
The two missions training Mali's army and police as part of international efforts to stabilise Mali and extend the state's authority are frozen because they were designed to support ""the legitimate national authorities,"" one EU official said.
Officials said the suspension was temporary.
The 88-member International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF) suspended Mali on Tuesday. In a statement the group's secretary general Louise Mushikiwabo called for the release of Keita and other officials detained by the junta since August 18.
West African mediators and Mali's coup leaders are discussing the possibility of a transitional government, which could allow the EU to eventually resume training in partnership with the United Nations. 
The coup has raised the prospects of further political turmoil in Mali which, like other countries in the region, is facing an expanding threat from Islamist militants.
EU defence ministers meeting in Berlin on Wednesday will discuss the situation in Mali, the officials said.
Drawn up in late 2012 to help Mali's army regain control of the country after France drove out Islamists in the north, the EU military mission (EUTM Mali) has more than 600 soldiers from 28 European countries including EU and non-member states.
Its headquarters in Mali's capital Bamako was targeted by militants in 2016, although no personnel were hurt.
The EU agreed in 2014 an additional civilian mission (EUCAP Sahel Mali), sending experts to give advice and training to the internal security forces in Mali, the police, Gendarmerie and National Guard.

EU training will continue in neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso, officials said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan wants to avert another state of emergency and needs to consider more stimulus to revive the economy, the government's top spokesman said, signalling Tokyo's resolve to focus on re-opening businesses hammered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga also dismissed speculation that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may step down for health reasons, saying Abe's comments on Monday that he would continue to do his best in his job ""explains it all"".
Suga - widely seen as one of the main contenders to succeed Abe - said he had no intention of pursuing the post, even if urged to do so by associates. He said he ""never thought about"" taking on the position.
Japan has seen a resurgence of COVID-19 infection numbers after ending nationwide state of emergency measures in late May, posing a dilemma for the government as it struggles to contain the virus without deepening the economic downturn.
""We want to avoid another state of emergency that could have a big negative impact on the economy,"" Suga told Reuters on Wednesday, sending a clear message the emphasis was on spurring economic growth over tightening restrictions to contain the virus.
Promoting tourism would be among measures to help revive the economy, Suga said. ""Japan will do whatever it takes to host the Tokyo Olympic Games next year,"" he added.
The Games had been scheduled to take place in late July and early August this year, but were postponed to 2021 due to the pandemic.
In his position since Abe became premier more than seven years ago, Suga is now Japan's longest serving chief cabinet secretary. He spoke to Reuters at his parliamentary office, where a large photograph of him with U.S. President Donald Trump was on display. 
BOLDER ACTION
The world's third-largest economy suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the pandemic hit consumption and exports, keeping policymakers under pressure to take bolder action even after deploying massive monetary and fiscal support this year.
""We need to consider what we can do to prevent the economy from falling off a cliff,"" he said, when asked whether Japan may deploy another spending package to cushion the blow from the pandemic.
Suga also said it was ""very important"" for the Bank of Japan to work closely with the government preemptively, when asked whether any fresh spending measures should be accompanied by additional monetary easing.
He also emphasised the need for Japan's many regional banks to consolidate, something investors have long hoped for.
A loyal lieutenant of Abe, Suga is considered a key decision-maker on economic policy. He has been seen as a leading candidates to take over from Abe, whose term as head of the ruling party, and therefore prime minister, ends next September.
Abe has been to hospital twice in the last two weeks, sparking concern about his ability to stay on as leader and heightening speculation about the possible transition of power.

""I meet the prime minister twice a day, but I don't see any change in his health,"" Suga said.

""You can see straightaway that there aren't any suspicious people lurking in the toilets, so I appreciate that I feel safer about letting my children use the toilets,"" said Chieri Kurokawa, 36, who lives nearby and had brought her two young sons to play in the park.

""If we want to overcome each other politically, the nation will collapse,"" Prayuth told reporters. 
""If that happens, just wait, everybody will be on fiery land, engulfed in flames."" 
His comments come after a month of near-daily rallies led by students calling for his ouster, a new constitution and fresh election, with some drawing over 10,000 protesters.
Some of those demonstrators have openly called for reforms of the country's monarchy, a taboo topic in a country with a strict law that punishes perceived royal insults with up to 15 years in prison. 
""I am at my wits end,"" Prayuth added. 
Police on Wednesday expanded a crackdown on protest leaders with the arrest of Tattep Ruangprapaikitseree of the Free Youth Group and his partner Panumas Singprom. 
Tattep was seen flashing a three-finger ""Hunger Games"" salute, a symbol of the movement, when he arrived at police station.
Other protesters have vowed to move ahead with a planned demonstration on Sept. 19, the anniversary of an earlier military coup in 2006. 
Tattep and Panumas were released on bail and deny the charges, according to their lawyer. 
The two were among 15 people charged over a July 18 rally for breaching internal security laws and defying an emergency decree, which banned public gatherings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. 
Police on Tuesday arrested human rights lawyer Anon Nampa for the third time over his participation in anti-government protest on similar charges. 
Student leaders, rappers and activists have been arrested in recent weeks for participating in demonstrations, some of which have included calls for changes in the king's role, though none have been charged under the lese majeste law.
Prayuth has said the king had requested no prosecutions under the lese majeste laws for now.

Those arrested so far have all been released on bail.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Political pressure is growing in Brazil to disband a high-profile team of anti-corruption prosecutors that has put dozens of former executives and politicians behind bars, despite its strong popular support and hundreds of cases still pending. 
Prosecutor General Augusto Aras will decide on Sept. 10 whether to renew for another year the mandate of the team, which has repeatedly made headlines over the last six years with its sprawling 'Car Wash' corruption probe.
Aras, who has not spoken about his intentions, declined to comment for this story.
But the country's top public prosecutor is facing pressure from influential politicians for the task force to be disbanded, as skepticism grows about President Jair Bolsonaro's commitment to a campaign promise to tackle corruption. 
The 65-year-old former army captain took office at the start of last year amid popular anger at corruption under the former governments of the leftist Workers Party, but has since railed at investigations of alleged graft involving members of his own family.
Senator Major Olimpio, Bolsonaro's former right-hand man in Congress, said there was a broad political movement afoot to stop the task force's investigations and annul ongoing trials.
""Today there is a campaign to demonize Car Wash,"" said Olimpio. The right-wing senator cited pressure from politicians under investigation to shut it down, by opening a parliamentary inquiry that has questioned its work and appeals to the Supreme Court to terminate its probes.
Leftist Senator Randolfe Rodrigues has joined Olimpio in advocating for keeping Car Wash going.
""The conditions are there for Aras not to extend the work of the task force,"" he said.
With a raft of investigations opening in Brazil into alleged corruption in the purchase of medical equipment to combat COVID-19, there are abundant signs that graft is thriving despite the years of prosecutions.
The Car Wash investigation shocked many Brazilians by revealing the widespread use of political kickbacks on major state contracts, particularly at the massive state-run oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras).
A senior member of the task force, requesting anonymity, said there were still 400 ongoing probes by federal prosecutors and police stemming from the Car Wash investigation. A second source, directly familiar with their investigations, confirmed the figure. 
""You just cannot stop all the relevant work that is still being done,"" the task force member said.
Among the cases still open are investigations into contracts signed by Petrobras in the past with several multinational firms, as well as deals by financial institutions and new probes into leasing of ships, the first source said.
Still in the pipeline are investigations of money laundering through art galleries and of politicians who are no longer in office and have lost their legal prerogatives, the source said.
If the Car Wash team were dismantled and its 14 prosecutors dispersed, corruption investigations would likely return to the pre-Car Wash days, where just one prosecutor would remain in Curitiba handling the ongoing probes, the sources said.
CRITICIZED BUT POPULAR
The Car Wash operation has attracted criticism from legal experts for what they say is an excessive use of plea bargains, as well as the temporary arrest of suspects and potential witnesses to obtain information.
But more than six years after it began with an investigation into a gas station in Brasilia that had a car wash, the task force headed by 40-year-old lawyer Deltan Dallagnol still enjoys the support of most Brazilians.
A recent poll by Instituto Paraná Pesquisas found that 78% of those surveyed favor the task force continuing its work.
But the political climate in Congress has changed. To avoid the danger of impeachment over the corruption scandals involving his family, and to advance his legislative agenda, Bolsonaro has sought to build alliances with politicians he once pilloried for graft and who are the main proponents for ending Car Wash.
The president, who praised Car Wash during his successful presidential campaign in 2018, has said nothing about whether he thinks the task force's mandate should be extended by his appointee Aras.
On the left, many in the Workers Party also want the demise of a team of prosecutors that put former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in jail for receiving bribes, which the party has denounced as a politically-motivated prosecution.
Meanwhile, the task force's key ally in government has gone.
Sergio Moro, the former lead federal judge on Car Wash, resigned as Bolsonaro's justice minister in April, after accusing the president of trying to meddle with police operations that could have culminated in the prosecution of his eldest son.
In comments emailed to Reuters, Moro said the Car Wash investigation had ended a long tradition of impunity for corruption in Brazil.

""It was so wide-ranging that it created enemies among some politically powerful people,"" he said.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Prosecutors on Wednesday called on U.N. judges to uphold former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic's life sentence for war crimes, including genocide, while his lawyers are calling for an acquittal or a retrial. 
Mladic, 77, was the commander of Bosnian Serb forces during the 1992-95 Bosnian War and trial judges found he was responsible for overseeing the murder of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, Bosnia in 1995.
""Srebrenica was Mladic's operation, and the trial chamber was right to conclude that he was criminally responsible for these crimes,"" prosecutor Laurel Baig said on the second and final day of appeal hearings.
Mladic shook his head in disagreement at times as Baig spoke.
Trial judges found Mladic was responsible for ""ethnic cleansing"" campaigns against Bosnian Muslims and Croats, and murdering and terrorising civilians in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo during a 43-month siege, as part of a plan to forge a ""Greater Serbia"" out of parts of the former Yugoslavia. 
Mladic will have the opportunity to speak for 10 minutes at the end of Wednesday's hearing.
""Any illegal killings in Srebrenica that were outside of combat are reprehensible, but they are not tied to Mr. Mladic,"" said defence lawyer Branko Lukic during arguments on Tuesday.
The appeal is being held at a U.N. court in The Hague set up to hear appeals and the remaining cases from the former Yugoslav Tribunal, which closed in 2017. The proceedings are being broadcast by video because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Appeals judges have yet to set a date for a decision, likely to be in 2021.

The floods swept through Parwan province, which borders Kabul, in the early hours of the morning, washing away men, women and children and destroying 300 homes, according to Ministry of Disaster Management spokesman Tamim Azimi.
Rescuers searched through mud throughout the day for bodies, with the confirmed death toll at 72, and at least 90 injured, Azimi added.
Floods had also swept through eight other northern provinces, killing two in Maidan Wardak and two in Nangahar, according to the Ministry of Disaster Management spokesman, who added that climate change was exacerbating the amount of flooding hitting the country. 
A spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani said on Twitter that his office had instructed authorities to provide emergency disaster relief to survivors, adding the floods were causing severe financial losses. 
The disaster comes as the war-torn nation already faces a sinking economy due to the coronavirus pandemic and as violence continues despite the United States attempting to usher peace talks between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday hit back at a U.N. women's rights panel that said some U.S. states limited access to abortions during the COVID-19 pandemic, rejecting its interference and the notion of ""an assumed right to abortion"".
""The United States is disappointed by and categorically rejects this transparent attempt to take advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to assert the existence of such a right,"" the U.S. mission in Geneva said in a release posted on Twitter. 
""This is a perversion of the human rights system and the founding principles of the United Nations,"" it said, citing an Aug. 11 letter it sent to the U.N. experts responding to the ""spurious allegations"".
The U.N. working group on discrimination against women and girls said on May 27 that some U.S. states ""appear to be ""manipulating the COVID-19 crisis to curb access to essential abortion care"".
The panel of five independent U.N. experts said that states including Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Iowa, Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee had issued COVID-19 emergency orders suspending procedures not deemed immediately medically necessary to restrict access to abortion.
""This situation is also the latest example illustrating a pattern of restrictions and retrogressions in access to legal abortion care across the country,” Elizabeth Broderick, panel vice-chair, said at the time.
The U.S. statement cited allegations of forced abortions and sterilisations in China's western region of Xinjiang and urged the panel to focus on ""actual human rights abuses"".
A lack of comment on such issues was ""one of the reasons that the United States and others increasingly see the U.N.’s human rights system as utterly broken"".
U.S. President Donald Trump, seeking re-election in November, works closely with evangelical Christians and puts their causes of restricting abortion and preserving gun ownership at the top of his policy agenda.

China this week began six days of exercises in waters near the Paracel Islands, where Vietnam has competing claims, according to the Maritime Safety Administration of Hainan, an island off China's southern coast. It was the second set of drills in the area by Beijing in two months. 
""China's repeated military exercises in (the Paracel Islands) violate Vietnam's sovereignty, complicating negotiations for a Code of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea between China and ASEAN,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement.
Vietnam is this year chairing the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has had long drawn-out negotiations with Beijing over a code of conduct in the South China Sea.
China's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
At a June 26 summit in Hanoi, Vietnam and the Philippines - China's most vocal challengers over the sea - warned of growing regional insecurity amid concern that Beijing was advancing territorial claims under the cover of the COVID-19 pandemic.
China claims historical jurisdiction over about 80% of the sea, using a U-shaped ""nine-dash line"" that includes swathes of Vietnam's exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, as well as the Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands. It also overlaps the EEZs of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.
Vietnam and the Philippines last month criticised China's holding of an earlier set of military drills in the area.
The United States in June also hardened its position on the South China Sea, where it has accused China of attempting to build a ""maritime empire"" in the potentially energy-rich waters.

Multiple bodies were found in some graves. Experts believe they were buried together due to deaths related to an epidemic disease, the association said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's digital minister vowed no relent on Wednesday in a crackdown on social media content deemed illegal and said it was unlikely Facebook would follow through on plans to challenge an order to block access to a group critical of the Thai monarchy. 
The ""Royalist Marketplace"" group, which had over 1 million members, was blocked within Thailand late on Monday after the digital ministry threatened legal action against Facebook under the country's Computer Crime Act.
Facebook (O:FB) said it was compelled to comply and would mount a legal challenge in court. 
The tension comes amid near daily youth-led protests against the government of a former junta chief, during which some demonstrators have made unprecedented calls for reforms of the monarchy, which is illegal to insult in Thailand.
Meanwhile, a new group with a similar name created by Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a self-exiled academic and prominent critic of the monarchy, has amassed over 700,000 members in just two days.
""If they start a new group or do anything illegal again, we'll need to act again. We'll keep doing this no matter how many times it takes,"" digital minister Puttipong Punnakanta said. 
He said he was encouraged by Facebook's compliance with a deadline to act on court orders, which were attached to government request to block content locally. He warned Facebook's Thailand office of possible cybercrime charges if the orders were not observed. 
""This time Facebook complied in blocking everything we flagged, which is why I don't think Facebook will pursue legal action,"" Puttipong said. 
""We're not bullies. We use Thai laws to protect Thai cyber sovereignty."" 
Facebook caving to Thai government pressure set a dangerous precedent for freedom of expression online, said Rasha Abdul-Rahim of rights group Amnesty International. 
""It's welcome that Facebook is now planning legal action to challenge the government's censorship demands, but the harm has already been done,"" she said. 

""The company should not have given in to the demands in the first place.""

TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Numerous Chinese and U.S. military exercises, Taiwan missiles tracking Chinese fighters and plummeting China-U.S. ties make for a heady cocktail of tension that is raising fears of conflict touched off by a crisis over Taiwan.
In the last three weeks, China has announced four separate exercises along its coast, from the Bohai Gulf in the north to the East and Yellow Seas and South China Sea, along with other exercises it said were aimed at ""the current security situation across the Taiwan Strait"".
Meanwhile Taiwan, claimed by China as its ""sacred"" territory, said its surface-to-air missiles had tracked approaching Chinese fighters - details Taiwan does not normally give - as U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar was visiting the island this month.
Addressing the Chinese exercises, Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday the closer Chinese jets get to the island the ""more actively"" Taipei would respond, though it would ""not escalate conflict"" nor ""trigger an incident"".
The United States sent another warship through the Taiwan Strait this month, a few days after a U.S. carrier group conducted an exercise in the disputed South China Sea, and this week China complained a U.S. spy plane had observed Chinese live-fire exercises.
Chinese military expert Ni Lexiong, a retired professor at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said it was very rare and possibly the first time multiple Chinese exercises were taking place at the same time.
""By simultaneously conducting drills in the three seas, it means China is testing its ability to fight enemies coming from three directions at the same time - for example from Taiwan, from Japan and from the U.S. from the south,"" he said.
""Historically, frequent drills are a clear predictor of war.""
'DISMAY AND CONCERN'
Taiwan-based security and diplomatic sources say the chances of ""firing off a shot while polishing the gun"" - a Chinese saying for an accidental encounter setting off a broader conflict - are rising mainly because of increased U.S. and Chinese military activity in the region.
""Neither side wants to start a conflict. The fundamentals have not changed much,"" said a Western diplomat looking into military activities across the Taiwan Strait. 
""But the frequent activities do increase the chances of an accidental conflict,"" the diplomat said.
China's defence and foreign ministries and its Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to requests for comment, and neither did the Pentagon nor U.S. State Department.
A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that China was becoming more assertive and more aggressive in the region and there was concern its military could miscalculate, leading to unexpected consequences. 
""This is an issue that is broader than Taiwan and broader than just the United States,"" the official said.
""I would argue that there are many like-minded countries in the region that are viewing with dismay and increasing concern the trend lines coming out of Beijing.""
'TO THE LAST SOLDIER'
The Trump administration has been taking an escalating array of measures against China in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, adding to the uncertainty.
A hypothetical scenario spelled out in a recent essay by James Winnefeld, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Michael Morrell, former acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has made the rounds in Taiwan security circles. 
In their suggested sequence of events, set out in the Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute, a disputed U.S. election gives China the opportunity to move on Taiwan while Washington and the world are distracted. 
In Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen has responded to the tension with pledges to defend the island.
She and her government have denounced as scaremongering and kowtowing to Beijing a campaign this month by former president Ma Ying-jeou, who held a landmark meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015, to warn that Taiwan is courting disaster by needling China and would not last long in a war.
Still, Taiwan has been keen to show its teeth. 
Its defence ministry this month issued two slickly produced videos showing missiles being fired and F-16s in the air to demonstrate their resolve to defend the island.

""Dare to fight, and fight to the last soldier,"" the ministry said in a caption for the latest video, released on Sunday.

At least 96 people had been rescued since the incident was first reported on Tuesday evening. The operation, 21 miles west of the small Aegean island of Halki, close to Turkey, was still in progress as witnesses reported that there were more people on board. 
Ten vessels, two helicopters and a frigate assisted the coast guard's efforts. Most of those rescued were taken to the island of Rhodes.
A Greek coast guard official said that the Turkish coast guard tried to intervene in the operation on Tuesday, while a navy official, who declined to be named, said some of the migrants had been collected by a Turkish vessel.
""We will continue searching until every possibility of rescuing someone is exhausted,"" one of the coast guard officials told Reuters.

But this month they closed its doors.
""Enough is enough now, we can't go on,"" said administrative worker Mansour, who financially supports his and his deceased brother's family. His salary, while he was still paid, was around $180 a month. 
Across Yemen health, sanitation and nutrition services that keep millions from starvation and disease are gradually closing amid an acute funding shortage for the world's largest humanitarian crisis. 
The United Nations said last week 12 of its 38 major programmes have shut or scaled down, and between August and September 20 programmes face further reductions or closure. 
In the Mahraba displacement camp in Hajjah province, resident Fatehia Jaber keeps going back to check if their local clinic, a tent printed with the logo of U.N. children agency UNICEF, has re-opened. 
""My son is sick, short of breath ... We live in an unstable situation and want a working hospital,"" Jaber said from her temporary home. 
Yemen's economy and health system has been devastated by five years of war. Many healthcare workers, and other public servants, have not been paid for up to three years.
Aid agencies try to keep critical services ticking over with small incentive payments to staff, but that leg of support is now crumbling as funds run dry. 
In a snapshot of what is happening across Yemen, four clinics supported by UNICEF and other partners with around 119 staff in displacement camps in Hajjah, one of the poorest parts of Yemen, have temporarily closed.
""Support from humanitarian agencies for critical services like health and nutrition has been gradually reducing due to lack of funding,"" UNICEF's Yemen representative Sherin Varkey said. 
UNICEF lacks 64% of its total humanitarian funding needs, Varkey said. 
Yemen's aid response is so poorly funded this year due to competing demands such as the coronavirus pandemic, and longstanding donor concerns about local authorities' interference in aid distribution. 
""Yemen is still among the worst contexts to work in: we have restrictions, interference, bombing and the global pandemic. But in Yemen the number one problem now is funding,"" Norwegian Refugee Council head Jan Egeland told Reuters. 
Five years of war have killed more than 100,000 people, and left 80% of the population reliant on aid and millions on the brink of famine.

""Children are sick. Pregnant women are sick ... What did we do to deserve this?"" said camp resident Yahya Shamsan.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A top Chinese diplomat in Australia warned against a ""shadow"" over the two nations' ties on Wednesday, saying that Beijing was disappointed by a Chinese firm's failure to win Australian regulatory approval for a takeover deal.
Tension between Australia and its main export market of China has risen in recent months, particularly after Canberra called for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.
Wang Xining, China's deputy head of mission in Canberra, dismissed concerns about China's attempts to influence Australian politics, saying its views were candidly presented and did not affect people's choice of a political system.
""I don't see any reason for whining about your constitutional fragility and intellectual vulnerability,"" Wang told the National Press Club in the Australian capital.
He added, ""We should not let a cold heart and a dark mind cast a shadow over our partnership."" 
This week, China Mengniu Dairy Co withdrew its bid for Australian firm Lion Dairy and Drinks Pty Ltd, a unit of Japan's Kirin Holding Co after domestic media said the Australian government would reject it. 
In the first comments by a Chinese offical since, Wang said he hoped Australia would provide a fair environment for Chinese investors, adding that it was no easy task to keep the partnership with Australia in good shape.
""A married couple know that...a rift between husband and wife hurts one family, a rift between two countries hurts millions.""
Wang denied accusations of ""economic coercion"" regarding China's measures targeting some Australian exports, and said Beijing believed that Australia's push for an inquiry on the origins of the virus was ""targeted against China alone"".
He added, ""The proposal helped Washington put more pressure on China.""
Australian ministers did not consider any virus source other than Wuhan, Wang said, referring to the central city where it surfaced last year.
While the virus was first identified in China, he added, it was up to scientists to pinpoint its origin.
Last week, Beijing announced an anti-dumping investigation of Australian wine imports that Canberra says is unfounded.
China has also placed tariffs on Australian barley, suspended some beef imports, and told its students and tourists to avoid travelling to Australia, citing racial discrimination.

The trade relationship with China was mutually beneficial, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday, adding ""Australia will always stand up for its own interests.""

Saba Sahar, 44, is one of Afghanistan's first female film directors who has used her training as a police officer to produce critically acclaimed documentaries and movies.
She has also been a vocal critic of the Taliban and the dominant role conservative men have over social and political institutions.

African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina is set to be voted in for another five years as the sole candidate at a two-day meeting that begins on Wednesday. The 60-year-old Nigerian is seeking to unite member countries around a support program that’s already seen the AfDB source $100 billion to stabilize economies in a continent of 1.2 billion people hobbled by the coronavirus pandemic.
“African states have confidence in him and will be very conscious to express that confidence,” Kalu Ojah, professor of finance and the deputy head of Wits Business School in Johannesburg, said by phone. “He needs support.”
The annual gathering comes after an internal investigation and external review found no evidence to back claims by unidentified whistleblowers that Adesina helped friends and relatives secure jobs and contracts from the Abidjan, Ivory Coast-based lender.

The U.S. and several non-African members in May rejected the findings of an ethics committee probe in a move that drew criticism from several African states and leaders. Former Irish President Mary Robinson headed the outside panel that last month cleared the way for Adesina’s re-election.
Amid the rift, Nigeria increased its contributions to become the largest shareholder with a 16.8% stake, followed by Germany with 7.4% and the U.S. with 5.5%. Nigeria was already the top shareholder as of April 30, but only had a 8.5% stake, according to bank documents.
Capital Increase
Updates on a capital increase that the board of governors approved in October 2019, nearly doubling its base to $208 billion, will also be discussed during the meeting, the AfDB said in a statement. The lender’s representatives from the AfDB’s 54 African member-countries and 27 non-African shareholders will be meeting online for the talks.
In March, the lender issued a $3 billion social bond to help African countries deal with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The bank also launched a crisis-response facility of up to $10 billion for African sovereign and non-sovereign operations.
“The pandemic has hit the region’s economies hard in the wake of falling commodity prices and containment measures by governments that have led to country lockdowns,” the bank said. “For several months, the bank has been extending support to regional member countries in cushioning their economies, health systems, and citizens’ livelihoods from parallel health and economic impacts from Covid-19.”

Police confirmed Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting and his colleague Ted Hui were among at least 10 people arrested, without giving further details.
Lam was arrested on suspicion of rioting on July 21, last year, when pro-democracy protests erupted across the Chinese-ruled city, his party's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page said. 
During the unrest that day, protesters in the city's downtown area threw black paint at the Hong Kong Liaison Office, China's top representative body, while in the Yuen Long district near the mainland border, a mob of over 100 men wielding sticks and poles attacked pro-democracy protesters and bystanders at the train station.
Lam was hospitalised after being wounded in the face as he livestreamed the attack on his Facebook page. 
So far, police have arrested 44 people believed to had taken part in the mob attack, seven of whom have been charged with rioting.
It was unclear what caused police to suspect Lam of rioting on that night.
Lam, along with Hui, was also accused of being involved in a protest on July 6 in the Tuen Mun district, where amid rising anti-Beijing sentiment protesters marched against the ""noise pollution"" caused by middle-aged women singing and dancing to pop songs in Mandarin, the language spoken in mainland China. Hong Kong people speak mainly Cantonese.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a one country, two systems agreement with its former colonial master Britain that promised it wide-ranging freedoms unavailable on the Communist Party-ruled mainland.
The protests last year were fuelled by perceptions that Beijing was tightening its grip on those freedoms, which authorities have denied. 
They began with peaceful marches against a since-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, but clashes between police and protesters became more violent over the following months.
Critics say a new national security law imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong on June 30 has pushed the city onto a more authoritarian path, while its supporters say it will bring stability after a year of unrest.
The law allows for anything China considers to be secessionist, subversive, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces to be punished with up to life in prison.
There have been more protests this year, though far less relentless than they were in the second half of last year.

Restrictions on crowd sizes because of the coronavirus health scare have also helped limit demonstrations.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - A former Salvadoran guerilla accused of shooting down a U.S. army helicopter carrying three soldiers during El Salvador's civil war in 1991 was arrested on Tuesday, authorities said.
Santos Guevara, known as ""Comandante Dominguez,"" was arrested at the airport after returning from Costa Rica, El Salvador's police said. 
""He will now face justice for his acts,"" the police said on Twitter, posting a photo of Guevara in black slacks and a cream-colored polo shirt standing in front of a van marked ""Interpol."" 
According to the U.N.-backed Truth Commission, Guevara and other members of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) guerilla group shot down the U.S. aircraft in the rural municipality of Lolotique amid El Salvador's 1980-1992 civil war.
The long conflict between a series of U.S.-backed governments and leftist rebels in El Salvador left 75,000 people dead and another 8,000 missing.
The pilot, Daniel F. Scott, died in the crash. Lieutenant Colonel David H. Pickett and Corporal Earnest G. Dawson survived but were later killed by Guevara's leader, Severiano Fuentes, and another FMLN member, Fernan Fernandez, violating international humanitarian law. 
The two turned themselves in a year after the incident, but were released under a 1993 amnesty law that aimed to absolve militants on both sides of the civil war who took part in war crimes. 
The supreme court overturned the law in 2016, calling it unconstitutional, paving the way for prosecutors to order the arrests of the three guerillas.
Fuentes and Fernandez are still at large.
Authorities are also investigating the 1981 El Mozote massacre, in which soldiers are thought to have killed 1,000 people, and the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero.

The typhoon comes after North Korea has been hit by flooding this month that wiped out farmland. Kim said at an enlarged meeting of the politburo of the Workers’ Party, that thorough state emergency measures were needed to prevent casualties and minimize crop damage, the official Korea Central News Agency reported Wednesday.
He called it “important work which can never be neglected even for a moment for our Party bearing the responsibility for the destiny of the people,” KCNA reported. Kim also reiterated his calls for cadres to step up their work to prevent a spread of the coronavirus into the country.
North Korea’s anemic economy has been hit by tough sanctions to punish it for nuclear and missile tests in 2017. Kim’s decision to shut borders in January due to the virus slammed the brakes on the little legal trade it had and combined with the flooding, the economy is set for its biggest contraction in more than two decades, according to Fitch Solutions.
Powerful Typhoon Bavi, packing torrential rains and maximum sustained winds of about 176 kilometers per hour (109 mph) as of Wednesday, is bearing down on the Korean Peninsula, It’s expected to make landfall in North Korea’s Hwanghae provinces on Thursday, South’s Korea Meteorological Administration said.
The typhoon will likely cause even more damage to North Korea’s fragile agricultural sector, increasing food insecurity in a country where the United Nations World Food Program says about 40% of the population is undernourished.
Kim told the meeting the typhoon could affect three provinces, which the WFP estimates accounts for more than 60% of the country’s rice production.
North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases for coronavirus, a claim doubted by U.S. and Japanese officials. But Pyongyang said last month Covid-19 “could have entered” his country via a defector who returned to North Korea after escaping to South Korea.

There were no reports of casualties in the strikes that Israel's military said targeted underground infrastructure belonging to Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza. 
Hamas has been trying to pressure Israel to ease restrictions on Gaza and allow more investment, in part by letting Palestinians launch helium balloons carrying incendiary material that have torched tracts of southern Israeli farmland in recent weeks.
Israel has struck Hamas facilities almost nightly for the past two weeks, saying it would not tolerate the balloons.
Anticipating Israeli attacks after balloon or rocket launchings, Hamas routinely evacuates personnel from its sites.
With tension high, Israel has closed its only commercial crossing with Gaza, banned sea access and halted fuel imports into the coastal strip, leading to its only power plant shutting down last week.
Health officials have voiced concern that the power plant shut down could aggravate a novel coronavirus outbreak in Gaza, which is home to 2 million Palestinians.
Mediators from the United Nations, Egypt and Qatar have been working to restore calm.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Fearing their work may violate a national security law recently imposed by Beijing, some Hong Kong artists are turning to self-censorship while others are moving their creations abroad or are planning to leave the city themselves.
The law, enacted in June, punishes subversion, secessionism, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, raising fears it effectively crushes wide-ranging freedoms promised to the city for 50 years after its 1997 handover by former colonial master Britain.
The city government, which has ambitions for Hong Kong to rival Paris or New York on the arts and culture scene, says the law does not curb rights and freedoms but will restore order and preserve prosperity after a year of anti-government unrest.
Nevertheless, the impact of the law is showing up in different spheres of daily life: pro-democracy books have been taken off shelves in libraries, shops have removed protest-themed decorations, a protest anthem and other activities have been banned in schools.
Nearly 2,000 Hong Kong and international artists and cultural workers said in a statement the security law created “a climate of fear and self-censorship”.
Illustrator Lau Kwong Shing's fine-line drawings will no longer touch on themes of the pro-democracy movement as he shifts his focus to relocating.
""I've chosen to leave. For the moment, I want to protect myself,"" Lau said, adding he would resume drawing once out of Hong Kong. He did not say where he hoped to move.
Him Lo, another artist now avoiding politics, moved his works, including a yellow banner that reads ""Recapture Hong Kong"" into storage at a European museum for safe-keeping. He declined to say where.
""I’m worried art works will be seized,"" he said. 
An artist using the pen name Childe Abaddon published ""Voices"", a collection of protest works, including cartoons, by mostly anonymous contributors just months before the new security law was imposed.
He's not planning a second edition.
""It was lucky that we put out the book before,"" he said. ""The book sold well, but we won't consider publishing any more.""
The artist did not want to be identified by his real name because of the sensitivity of the topic.
'MAKE AN IMPACT'
The city government said the new law upholds the ""principles of respecting and protecting human rights"".
""When exercising these rights, art practitioners need not worry as long as they do not contravene the offences as defined under the law,"" the government said in a statement.
""The legitimate rights of Hong Kong citizens to exercise their freedom of speech, such as making general remarks criticising government policies or officials, should not be compromised.""
The government's Hong Kong Arts Development Council said artists getting support should ensure their works ""conform with all legislations, rules, regulations and statutory requirements"".
A political illustrator who goes by the pen name Ah To, whose cartoon column was dropped by the Ming Pao Weekly newspaper last month, is defiant.
""You have to decide and judge what your values are, you can possibly be arrested at any time, or regret that you have not done enough to try to make an impact on society,"" said Ah To, who declined to be identified by his real name because of the sensitivity of the issue.
""I've decided at this stage to continue and persist.""

Ming Pao, which had featured Ah To drawings on topics censored on the mainland such as China's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, said the decision to stop running his work was part of a revamp and not related to the new law.

Joo Ho-young, the legislative floor leader for South Korea’s conservative United Future Party, said in an interview that Moon was being too deferential to China in his efforts to shore up ties. That policy could put Seoul on opposite sides with its key security ally as relations worsen between Washington and Beijing, Joo said.
“Moon cares about Beijing’s ire too much, and that resulted in Seoul being somewhat passive when it comes to taking part in the U.S.’s Indo-Pacific strategy,” Joo said Monday in Seoul, referring to the Trump administration’s effort to bolster its economic and security partnerships in Asia.
South Korea is caught between maintaining strong ties with China -- its biggest trading partner -- and the U.S., its main military ally and a key market for the exports that power its economy. The pressure has only picked up as the U.S. has sought help to block China’s push into regional waters and Moon’s progressives have been criticized for keeping silent about Beijing’s moves seen as suppressing democracy in Hong Kong.
“It is of course difficult for Seoul to fully take part in the U.S.’s China-containment policy,” Joo said. “But we must play a certain role in the U.S.’s regional security plan, if we want to maintain our alliance with Washington.”
Moon’s office referred a request for comment to the ruling Democratic Party on Tuesday. Party spokeswoman Choi Ji-eun said that the president’s “New Southern Policy” overlapped with the U.S. strategy, adding the government was “discussing and negotiating common interests” in the region with Washington.
As Moon spars with the Trump administration over its demands for as much as a five-fold increase in troop funding, he’s also courting Chinese President Xi Jinping for a possible visit. China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, traveled to Busan last week for talks, although meetings between the two leaders may be pushed back due to a recent resurgence in coronavirus infections in South Korea.
The United Future Party is attempting to appeal to more moderate voters ahead of the presidential election in 2022, when Moon is barred from seeking election due to a one-term cap on presidential terms. A poll earlier this month showed the conservatives exceeding the ruling party’s approval rating for the first time since 2017, when the last conservative president, Park Geun-hye, was removed from office and later jailed on corruption charges.
The conservatives face a difficult balancing act in crafting a response to Trump’s demands for more troop funding. While the bloc’s base traditionally supports the U.S. alliance as the country’s chief defense against North Korea, Washington’s demands are widely seen as exorbitant among South Koreans.
Joo said South Korea must find a balance between its security and financial contributions to the alliance. He declined to specify what he saw as an appropriate level of funding.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli delegation and top aides to U.S. President Donald Trump will fly together to the United Arab Emirates on Monday for talks on cementing the two Middle East countries' deal to normalise relations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. 
The high-level meeting would be the first between the three parties since Trump announced the U.S.-brokered accord on Aug. 13. 
The deal still awaits negotiations on details such as opening embassies, trade and travel links before it is officially signed. 
White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, national security adviser Robert O'Brien, U.S. Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz and other U.S. officials will travel together with an Israeli delegation led by national security adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat, Netanyahu said in a video statement.
A senior U.S. administration official confirmed the participation of Kushner, O'Brien and Berkowitz, and said U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook would also be on the flight. 
The U.S. and Israeli officials will fly aboard an Israeli airliner direct from Tel Aviv to Abu Dhabi, the first-ever commercial flight between the two countries, Israel's Kan broadcaster reported. 
Talks will focus on ways to promote Israeli-UAE cooperation in sectors such as aviation and tourism, trade, finance, health, energy and security, Netanyahu said. 
""This is a historic agreement. It will bring growth engines ... I hope other countries in our region will join the circle of peace."" 
The deal would make the UAE only the third Arab country to forge ties with Israel in more than 70 years, after Egypt and Jordan in 1979 and 1994 respectively. 
But the prospect that the agreement could grant the Gulf power access to advanced weaponry previously denied to it has upset Israel, and could emerge as a sticking point in negotiations. 
During a visit to the region to showcase U.S. support for Israeli-Arab ties, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assured Israel on Monday it would retain a military advantage in the region under any future arms deal with the UAE.

On Tuesday, top UAE and Israeli defence officials held their first publicly-acknowledged phone call, heralding possible security cooperation.

SANTA ROSA, Calif. (Reuters) - Over 14,000 firefighters from half a dozen states carved out containment lines around some of the largest wildfires in California history on Tuesday, helped by cooler temperatures.
Using bulldozers and hand tools, crews scraped fire breaks into the earth to block flames from around 24 major blazes sparked by dry lightning during a record heat wave. 
The worst fires, now the second and third largest in state history, burned in the greater San Francisco Bay Area and 136,000 people remained under evacuation orders.
Higher humidity and gentler winds helped firefighters get a grip on the fires, but temperatures and winds were expected to pick up in coming days. 
""The weather has really cooperated with us. We are steadily getting a trickle of new resources in,"" Cal Fire Operations Chief Mark Brunton said of a blaze north of Santa Cruz. 
Four people were still missing after the fire known as the CZU Lightning Complex destroyed 330 homes and other structures, Santa Cruz County Sheriff Chief Deputy Chris Clark told reporters.
Some authorities blamed climate change for the fire in an area of coastal rainforests that do not normally burn.
Since the dry-lightning siege began Aug. 15 over 650 fires have torched more than 1.25 million acres (505,860 hectares) in California, an area larger than the Grand Canyon.
At least seven people have died and over 1,400 homes and other structures have been destroyed, with losses possibly rising to over 3,000 structures, Cal Fire Assistant Deputy Director Daniel Berlant said in an online briefing.
Livestock owners evacuated animals to the county fairgrounds in Santa Rosa to protect them from a monster fire burning in hills 20 miles to the east. 
""If we get strong winds from an unexpected direction anything can happen,"" said Kathleen Haase, 45, a farmer from Guerneville who evacuated 200 goats after three of her neighbors lost their homes. 
Firefighters cut a containment line around a third of the fire dubbed the LNU Lightning Complex, which is the third largest in state history at over 350,000 acres.
To the south, containment ticked up to 15% on the state's largest fire, in hills 10 miles east of San Jose. 
Thousands returned to homes in Santa Clara County as some evacuation orders were lifted around the fire known as the SCU Lightning complex. 
Smoke from fires created unhealthy air quality for a large swath of Northern California, with many San Francisco residents staying indoors.
Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said California was facing ""a different climate"" after record temperatures siphoned off moisture from storms to create dry-lightning.
The state's five largest wildfires have burned in the last three years, the largest of which was the Mendocino Complex fire in 2018 which blackened 459,123 acres.

A two to three degree Fahrenheit rise in average temperatures, combined with insect infestations, have created more dead trees and parched brush that act as kindling to supercharge fires that have long burned in California, according to bioclimatologists.

180,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Who Takes Over If Japan’s Prime Minister Abe Decides to Go?,"(Bloomberg) -- If Shinzo Abe resigns over health problems, the next Japanese prime minister might tweak policy on everything from China ties to monetary policy, without making drastic changes.
Since taking power in 2012, Abe has touted unprecedented monetary easing and a flexible fiscal policy to revive the economy -- a package dubbed “Abenomics.” He has worked to build a personal bond with U.S. President Donald Trump, while at the same time seeking to smooth over ties with Japan’s biggest trading partner, China.
One of the reasons Abe has endured to become Japan’s longest-serving prime minister has been the lack of open dissent in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Some potential candidates may be holding fire while he’s in office, but a large degree of continuity is likely in managing the world’s third-largest economy.
“There is little choice but to continue with aggressive fiscal policy and monetary easing giving the state of the economy, especially after the pandemic,” said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities. “If a new leader wants to upend economic policies, that would cause yen gains and stock falls. No one wants that.”
Abe hasn’t said he’ll step down, but a chronic ailment forced him to abandon an earlier stint as premier in 2007. Here are some of his most likely successors:
Shigeru Ishiba, 63, former defense minister
No national election need be held until 2021, so a new LDP leader would succeed Abe as premier. Polls show Ishiba is the voters’ top choice to take over. He has backed economic policies seen as more populist than Abe’s and said in an interview in April that too much wealth was accumulating in the hands of stockholders and company owners. He has also cast doubt on the sustainability of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy.
On the international front, Ishiba has been aligned with Abe in trying to keep ties with China on a steady path. Ishiba last month urged an LDP group to think about the consequences of its call for the cancellation of a planned state visit to Tokyo by President Xi Jinping. Ishiba, however, has been far more hesitant than Abe about attempting to change the country’s pacifist constitution.
Taro Kono, 57, defense minister
Current Defense Minister Kono is a fluent English speaker and graduate of Georgetown University. He expressed interest in an interview with the Nikkei newspaper earlier this month in working closely with the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which brings together Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S. That could suggest he is willing to step up joint pressure on China.
In 2017, Kono urged the Bank of Japan to lay out a strategy for exiting its ultra-easy monetary policy. He is also known for favoring cost-cutting policies and this year canceled plans to deploy the Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense shield from U.S. firm  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT)., citing the cost of adapting it to meet Japan’s safety requirements. The move was popular with voters.
Fumio Kishida, 63, former foreign minister
Abe has touted Kishida as a potential leader, appointing him as foreign minister and then to a senior party post. But the mild-mannered former banker has so far failed to build a public profile.
Seen as more dovish than Abe, Kishida sealed an ill-fated deal with South Korea in 2015 that was meant to end a dispute over women trafficked in brothels run by Japan’s military during World War II. But that accord eventually ended in rancor.
In an interview with broadcaster TV Tokyo on Monday, Kishida said he expected interest rates to remain low, given the state of the economy. He called for plentiful spending to combat the economic crisis, but urged caution on the idea of cutting the sales tax. Kishida also mentioned the need to return to fiscal discipline later.
Yoshihide Suga, 71, chief cabinet secretary
Having served as chief cabinet secretary -- or Abe’s right-hand man -- since 2012, Suga is a continuity candidate, who could be tapped as a caretaker if the premier steps down suddenly. In 2007, Abe resigned from an abbreviated first term in office, saying a worsening of chronic ulcerative colitis made it impossible to carry out his duties.
Although Suga hasn’t laid out an alternative policy platform, he has pushed particular issues, including controversial government subsidies for domestic travel during the virus pandemic.
Taro Aso, 79, finance minister
Aso, like Suga, is part of Abe’s inner circle and is Japan’s long-serving finance minister and deputy prime minister. Given his age, he’s unlikely to serve as premier for more than a caretaker period. He served an unsuccessful year in the post in 2008-2009, at the end of which the Democratic Party scored a landslide election victory over the LDP.

ATHENS/ANKARA (Reuters) - Germany's top diplomat said after whirlwind meetings in Turkey and Greece on Tuesday the two were ready for dialogue to defuse an worsening dispute over energy resources in the Mediterranean, even as the NATO allies traded new barbs.
Turkey and Greece vehemently disagree over natural gas reserves off Cyprus and the extent of their continental shelves. They have drawn the European Union and nearby countries into the dispute, which earlier this month flared into a light collision between Turkish and Greek frigates.
On Tuesday, the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey both said they wanted to solve the issue through dialogue following talks with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, but each warned that they would continue to defend their rights in the region.
Tensions between Turkey and Greece escalated after Ankara sent its Oruc Reis survey vessel to disputed eastern Mediterranean waters this month, a move Athens called illegal.
After talks in Athens and Ankara, Maas urged Greece and Turkey to turn to dialogue, though added that Germany and the EU stood with fellow member state Greece.
""In both meetings in Athens as well as in Ankara I kept hearing that the only way to reach an understanding was to start a dialogue in which both differing standpoints were put on the table,"" Maas told a news conference in Ankara.
""No one wants to settle this conflict militarily, which would be absolute madness,"" he said, speaking alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Turkey and Greece meanwhile held rival military drills in the same theatre of the Mediterranean. Maas likened the dispute to ""playing with fire"" and warned that ""every little spark can lead to catastrophe"". 
Greece on Monday issued an advisory, known as a Navtex, that it will hold naval exercises in an area off the Greek island of Crete, after Turkey said on Sunday the Oruc Reis would operate in the same area until Aug. 27. 
Greece's advisory then prompted a rival Navtex from Turkey that it would also hold drills there on Tuesday. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused Greece on Monday of ""sowing chaos"" in the Mediterranean and warned Athens would find itself having to face the Turkish navy on its own.
WAR OF WORDS
Despite voicing readiness for dialogue, Cavusoglu said this could only happen if Greece abandoned its ""maximalist demands"", adding it was not realistic to expect Turkey to drop its rights with threats of sanctions.
""We are open to talks without pre-conditions. But, when one side starts imposing pre-conditions, then there are many things we will put forth too,"" he said.
""If you make statements like 'We will defend our rights. We carry out drills,' if you take wrong steps, we don't want to say we will make a mistake, but we will do what is necessary without hesitation.""
Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias said Greece wanted to talk with Turkey but would not do so ""under threats"". Athens stood ready to defend its rights, he said, adding the dispute was an issue for the entire EU and its security. 
Germany also intervened last month, prompting Ankara to pause operations for talks with Athens. After Greece and Egypt agreed a maritime demarcation deal, however, Turkey resumed operations.
EU foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in Berlin on Aug. 27-28 to discuss the issue. A senior EU official told reporters that the bloc's EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, would put ""all options"" on the table, including economic sanctions on Turkey and formally ending Turkey's status as an EU candidate.

Asked about the bloc's ties with Turkey, Maas said these were at a ""crossroads"" but Germany wanted to contribute to a positive dialogue. He said the course of EU-Turkey ties will ""largely be decided"" by the end of the year.

Saudi Arabia has been trying to implement the deal, first proposed in November, to end a conflict in the south between the separatists and the Saudi-backed Yemeni government.
The government and the separatist STC, which is backed by the United Arab Emirates, are the main Yemeni forces in a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi movement which drove the government from Sanaa, the capital, five years ago. 
The Yemeni allies have been in a standoff since last August when the STC took over Aden, the temporary headquarters of the government. 
The ""Riyadh agreement"" suffered many setbacks and was never implemented, but Saudi made a new push in July to invigorate the process. 
The STC gave seven reasons for withdrawing, including the collapse of public services in the south and military escalation by government forces in Abyan province. 
Yemen's war has driven millions of people to the verge of starvation, requiring the world's biggest humanitarian response.
The dispute within the anti-Houthi camp has been holding up U.N. efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in the wider conflict.

183,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 05:31PM ET</span>",Former U.S. VP Gore says Trump is putting 'knee on the neck of democracy',"By Joseph Ax
(Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday accused President Donald Trump of trying to ""put his knee on the neck of democracy"" by undermining mail-in voting and sowing doubts, without evidence, about the integrity of the Nov. 3 election.
""He seems to have no compunctions at all about trying to rip apart the social fabric and the political equilibrium of the American people, and he's strategically planting doubts in advance,"" Gore, a Democrat, said during a Reuters Newsmaker event with Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen Adler and Editor-at-Large Harold Evans.
Gore, who served as vice president from 1993 to 2001 during Bill Clinton's presidency and lost the 2000 presidential election to Republican George W. Bush, called Trump's actions a ""despicable strategy."" 
Trump has made unsubstantiated claims that voting by mail, a regular feature of U.S. elections that is expected to increase this year amid the coronavirus pandemic, will cause widespread fraud, while also refusing to say he would accept the election result should he lose to Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
Gore said Americans must be prepared for vote tallies that take days to complete after Election Day, and that the candidate who appears to be winning in initial results may end up losing once all ballots are counted.
In 2000, Gore and Bush were separated by only a few hundred votes in the battleground state of Florida, whose electoral votes would determine the election's outcome.
The result remained in limbo until more than a month after Election Day, when the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court resolved the contest in Bush's favor, prompting Gore - who had won the nationwide popular vote but lost in the complex state-by-state Electoral College - to concede.
""It turns out there's no intermediate step between a final Supreme Court decision and violent revolution,"" Gore said, smiling, of his decision to concede. ""It seemed to me that respect for the rule of law and respect for the needs of American democracy were the orders of the day.""
""You can always explore the option of dragging something out, tearing the country apart, mobilizing partisans against one another in the streets and all of that, but it was not a wise course for our country,"" Gore added.
'NOT REALLY UP TO HIM'
Gore said he believes the rule of law would hold fast this year, even if Trump does not accept the election results. 
""It's not really up to him,"" Gore said, noting that Trump's term would end on Jan. 20, 2021, if he loses, under parameters set by the U.S. Constitution. 
U.S. Secret Service and other military and security forces would answer to the new president as of that date, Gore added.
Trump's attacks on mail-in ballots, coupled with Postal Service cuts that already have caused delivery delays, have raised concerns among his critics that he is seeking to depress voter turnout.
""To try to deprive people who are scared of the pandemic from voting by mail by dismantling the Postal Service - he's attempting to put his knee on the neck of democracy,"" Gore said.
In response, Trump campaign spokeswoman Thea McDonald said Gore and other Democrats should ""quit pushing their conspiracy theories.""
""Al Gore is brazenly laying the groundwork for Joe Biden to dispute November's election results when President Trump wins - just as Gore himself did back in 2000,"" McDonald said.
Trump trails Biden in opinion polls as he seeks re-election amid a pandemic that has killed more than 177,000 Americans.
U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump ally and campaign donor, has told Congress he has made Postal Service changes to lower costs, not to disrupt mail-in voting.
'STILL TIME'
Gore, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning environmental advocate, said policymakers cannot afford to ignore global climate change even as they grapple with the pandemic.
The two crises ""are braided together,"" Gore said. In both cases, scientists with ""their hair on fire"" have warned of potentially deadly consequences - and both have exposed racial and economic inequities that undergird society, Gore added.
Unlike the pandemic, which triggered economic shutdowns intended to curb the pathogen's spread, climate change can be mitigated by investing in the economy's future, Gore said.
The two fastest-growing jobs in the United States are solar-energy panel installer and wind-turbine technician, Gore said, demonstrating the so-called green economy's potential.
Gore praised Biden for putting a major investment in environmental jobs in his economic plan and for promising if elected to rejoin the 2015 Paris agreement that set emissions goals for nearly 200 nations. Trump intends to withdraw from the accord on Nov. 4, the earliest possible date.

""There is still time,"" Gore added, ""to solve this crisis before it reaches its catastrophic stage. Damage has already been done, and more will be done. But we still can avoid the worst of the consequences.""

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A cosy Beirut bar, Tenno once hosted a dog's birthday party, vinyl record nights and stand-up comedians. 
Those days are gone. Its doors collapsed and glass shattered in the huge August port explosion that killed at least 180 people and turned one of Beirut's most popular pub streets into a disaster zone. 
""We plan to rebuild...We owe it to ourselves to not let things end this way,"" said Mohamed Soliman, 28, one of the owners of Tenno, which opened around two years ago. Money for repairs has poured in through online crowdfunding.
Many others will not rebuild, however, because it no longer makes sense to invest in a country where years of work can vanish in seconds.
""We've been saying we're all on the verge. I don't know how we made it this far. We're not going to last,"" said Maya Bekhazi of the union of nightclub, cafe and restaurant owners.
It is a tired cliché that the nightlife in Beirut - billed worldwide as a party destination - stands as proof of the capital's ability to endure one crisis after another.
So much so that Lebanese have made a joke of their fabled resilience which has portrayed them partying through wars and assassinations, when behind the glitz the reality is much grimmer. 
The past year, from Lebanon's financial meltdown to the COVID-19 pandemic, has battered the service industry, a pillar of an economy that produces little. 
The warehouse explosion left over 2,000 premises in tatters, with losses in the millions. It has put tens of thousands more jobs at risk in a country with soaring unemployment and poverty. 
Even before the blast, hundreds of venues had shuttered with mass layoffs in an industry that employs a big chunk of Lebanon's workforce.
In response to a question about what the state has done to help, Bekhazi laughs. ""Nobody cares."" 
With low-wage workers hit hardest, she said, the union will help provide meals for employees for a month.
EXTRAVAGANT SOIREES
Beirut's nightlife has long attracted investor money and performers from abroad, spawning images of extravagant soirees in ranking lists around the world.
Since last year, a currency crash has eroded the purchasing power of Lebanese, including among the middle class that most of these businesses cater to. Costs skyrocketed and suppliers demanded cash as dollars grew scarce.
Fuel shortages left city streets in pitch dark and each week brought news of another corner store closing.
Industry leaders have declared they will stop paying taxes to the state, furious at the political elite they accuse of letting the country sink in a mire of neglect and corruption.
The owners of Cafe Em Nazih, who also run a hostel and rooftop bar, do not plan on rebuilding now. 
""To start from scratch, without any trust in the state, will be a loss. We could invest again and get hit by another 20 explosions,"" said manager Nazih Dirani, who suffered a dislocated shoulder when the blast ripped through the cafe. 
""This place is my life. I know where every screw is.""
On social media, Lebanese posted videos of bloodied faces emerging from behind bar counters. Some spoke of a sense of loss in a city with few public spaces.
For Jade, a DJ and founder of the entertainment group Factory People, the focus now is on keeping his 170 employees. 
The blast reduced one of its clubs to a pile of twisted metal. It cost nearly $2.5 million to launch and will need millions more to reconstruct. 

""We kept investing despite it all,"" he said. ""But now it's like we're in the middle of the battlefield and we ran out of ammunition.""

Israel and the United States have said they are pushing more Arab countries to follow suit. Israel's intelligence minister has mentioned Bahrain as a possible candidate. 
""Glad to arrive in the Gulf today ... We need Gulf unity now more than ever to counter Iran and to build lasting peace and prosperity,"" Pompeo said on Twitter. 
He said it was vital to seize the momentum of the U.S.-brokered deal on normalising relations between Israel and the UAE which was announced on Aug. 13.

PARIS (Reuters) - Lebanon's leaders should not use the explosion that destroyed parts of Beirut earlier this month as an excuse to hide the reality that the country was on the edge of a precipice, France's foreign minister said on Tuesday. 
""The catastrophe should not be used as a pretext to obscure the reality that existed before ... that is, a country on the brink of collapse,"" Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters in the southern port city of Marseille before a ship with 2,500 tonnes of aid set sail for the Lebanese capital.
""We hope that this moment will be the moment which allows the Lebanese authorities, the Lebanese officials, to take the necessary leap for a government with a mission to initiate the essential reforms that everyone knows (are needed).""
France has been leading diplomatic efforts for almost two years to persuade Lebanon to push through reforms and secure foreign aid needed to offset a financial meltdown.
In the immediate aftermath of the Aug. 4 blast that destroyed whole neighbourhoods, killed more than 170 people and made 250,000 homeless, Macron rushed to Beirut hoping to use the leverage of international reconstruction aid to persuade Lebanon's factions to choose a new administration led by individuals untainted by corruption and backed by foreign donors.
However, progress has been slow with some diplomats increasingly frustrated over the situation. 
The outgoing government comprised mostly technocrat ministers but these were nominated by sectarian leaders who exerted influence on them and obstructed reforms. Politicians fear reforms would end their system of patronage.
When asked whether the process to form a new government was too slow, Le Drian said there had to be an awakening now. 
""That is what the president (Macron) indicated to the Lebanese politicians a few days ago and it's what he will tell them again when he returns soon,"" Le Drian said. 
Macron is expected in Beirut on Sept 1.
Diplomatic sources have said that Macron is pushing Lebanon's political leaders to install an interim technocratic government able to enact reforms, win back public confidence and persuade donors to release billions of dollars in aid.
""I think the awareness is happening and we are ready to help. But we are not going to take the place of the Lebanese officials,"" Le Drian said. 

A diplomatic source said much of the aid being sent to Lebanon this week was food, but also healthcare goods to help the country tackle a spike in COVID-19 cases. It would be distributed directly to humanitarian groups by the French embassy to ensure it did not fall into the wrong hands, one official said.

PORT-AU-PRINCE/HAVANA (Reuters) - Caribbean islands already reeling from the economic impact of coronavirus started recovering on Tuesday from the damage wrought by Tropical Storm Laura, which left at least 24 dead and damaged thousands of homes and electricity infrastructure.
Brigades of workers were out fixing toppled power poles, removing fallen trees blocking roads and repairing roofs after the storm blustered through the region's largest countries. - Laura has become a hurricane since exiting Cuba on its northwestern path towards the United States.
Laura caused the most damage in Haiti, where preparedness is weak while deforestation has left the country vulnerable to flooding and landslides when there are heavy rains.
Torrents of water carrying rocks down from the mountains barreled through a marketplace in a ravine of Port-au-Prince before dawn on Sunday, including the warehouses where many vendors were sleeping.
""I came here straight away only to find my mother dead,” said Lorius Joseph, 38, heaving and struggling to talk in front of her corpse. ""She used to sell pork bits on the market.""
After the rains subsided, vendors scoured the mud for merchandise like vegetables and eggs.
At least 21 people were killed in total, mainly from flash flooding that turned the capital's roads into raging rivers, and 198 families were left homeless, according to the Haitian Civil Protection Office.
Five people were still missing on Tuesday, including a woman whose baby was already found dead after their car got stuck in flooding.
Locals fear Laura is just a small preview of what is to come, with the hurricane season typically peaking in September.
The Caribbean has experienced four Category 5 hurricanes at the top of the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale in the last four years, including Hurricane Matthew which killed more than 500 in Haiti.
Some scientists say hurricane season is becoming more intense due to warming seas in the wake of climate change and forecasters have predicted a particularly active one this year.
The impact too is more severe due to stretched resources in a region particularly affected by the collapse of tourism in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with 50-90% of GDP and employment in some islands depending on the sector.
BATTERED BANANAS, TRAPPED COMMUNITIES
In the Dominican Republic, the Caribbean's top tourism market, Laura left at least three dead, while in Jamaica, landslides and swollen rivers left some roads impassable, washing out at least one bridge.
""We can’t get in and out of community,"" said Troy Cruickshank, 33, in the eastern parish of St. Thomas on Tuesday. 
In Cuba, there was no loss of life reported after more than 316,000 people were evacuated but a thousand homes were damaged, President Miguel Diaz-Canel said, and some farms were affected.
""Laura's winds of around 75 km (47 miles) per hour felled my banana plantations, while the rain destroyed my yucca,"" said Raul Mayol, 44, in the southern Isle of Youth. ""We still don't have electricity because lots of poles were toppled.""

Diaz-Canel noted however the rains had been positive for regions affected by drought, replenishing reservoirs and drenching parched fields.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The president of the U.N. Security Council, Indonesia, said on Tuesday it was ""not in the position to take further action"" on a U.S. bid to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran because there is no consensus in the 15-member body. 
Thirteen council members expressed their opposition on Friday, arguing that Washington's move is void given it is using a process agreed under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers that it quit two years ago.
Indonesia's U.N. Ambassador Dian Triansyah Djani, council president for August, was responding to a question from Russia and China on the issue during a meeting on the Middle East. 
U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft hit back after Djani spoke. 
""Let me just make it really, really clear: the Trump administration has no fear in standing in limited company on this matter,"" she told the council. ""I only regret that other members of this council have lost their way and now find themselves standing in the company of terrorists.""
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he triggered on Thursday a 30-day process to reimpose all international sanctions on Iran by lodging a complaint with the council accusing Iran of breaching the 2015 nuclear deal.
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he hoped the United States would now drop its bid to snapback Iran sanctions, ""which is not only illegal, but simply will not lead to achieving the result that was envisaged by the United States.""
On Twitter, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Pompeo's ""lawless bullying leaves U.S. isolated again.""
A spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations said it ""is on firm legal ground to initiate the restoration of sanctions"" and ""the fact that some council members expressed disagreement .... does not have any legal effect.""
The United States argues that it can trigger the process - known as snapback - because a 2015 Security Council resolution that enshrines the nuclear deal still names it as a participant.
The Security Council resoundingly rejected a U.S. attempt on Aug. 14 to extend an arms embargo on Iran beyond its expiration in October. Only the Dominican Republic joined Washington in voting yes.

The Dominican Republic and Niger, president of the council for September, are likely to face U.S. pressure to disregard Indonesia's assessment and proceed with the sanctions snapback process, diplomats said.

The State Department said the officials were Specially Designated Global Terrorists and the United States was seeking information about one for his involvement in multiple terrorist attacks, hijackings and kidnappings. 
A Turkish government statement on Saturday said Erdogan received Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas Political Bureau, and an accompanying delegation.
On Tuesday, Turkey's foreign ministry said Ankara ""fully rejects"" the U.S. criticism and called on Washington to use its influence for a ""balanced policy"" that will help solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, instead of ""serving Israel's interests.""
The State Department said the Saturday meeting was the second time this year Erdogan had welcomed leaders of the armed Islamist group that has controlled Gaza for over a decade, after a meeting on Feb. 1.
""President Erdogan's continued outreach to this terrorist organization only serves to isolate Turkey from the international community, harms the interests of the Palestinian people, and undercuts global efforts to prevent terrorist attacks launched from Gaza,"" it said in a statement.
""We continue to raise our concerns about the Turkish government's relationship with Hamas at the highest levels.""
In its statement, Turkey's foreign ministry said: ""Declaring the legitimate representative of Hamas, who came to power after winning democratic elections in Gaza and is an important reality of the region, as a terrorist will not be of any contribution to efforts for peace and stability in the region.""
U.S. ties with NATO ally Turkey have been strained over a variety of issues including Ankara's purchase of Russian S-400 defense systems, which prompted Washington to suspend Turkish involvement in its F-35 jet program and threaten sanctions.
Tuesday's exchange came just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump praised Erdogan for releasing American pastor Andrew Brunson last year after two years of detention.
""I have to say that, to me President Erdogan was very good,"" Trump told Brunson in a meeting with Americans freed from overseas captivity aired on the first night of the Republican National Convention on Monday. 

""And I know they had you scheduled for a long time, and you were a very innocent person, and he, ultimately, after we had a few conversations, he agreed. So we appreciate that, and we appreciate the people of Turkey,"" Trump said.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia is in discussions to join other phase three clinical trials for a vaccine, the health minister said on Tuesday, and will not reverse an end to its national quarantine.
The government said on Monday that Colombia, which has nearly 552,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and is finishing more than five months of lockdown at the end of August, would participate in trials with Johnson & Johnson.
""We are also talking with other companies about the possibility of holding clinical trials,"" Health Minister Fernando Ruiz told Reuters in a telephone interview. He could not name the companies because of confidentiality restrictions.
The price per vaccine dose is still uncertain, Ruiz said, but Colombia is estimating a cost of $20 and investment of some 1.5 trillion pesos ($390 million) to initially vaccinate health workers and other high-risk people. 
""Our strategy is to look for multilateral mechanisms where countries get together to buy and that ensures coverage for 20% of the population,"" Ruiz said. ""Colombia has to be a careful buyer because it's not a country with unlimited resources.""
Colombia has spent around $3 billion on its healthcare system amid the pandemic, Ruiz said, and will soon double its number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds from 5,600.
Many restrictions have been gradually loosened during the lockdown, but its end will mean open roads and increased national flights, though international transport and large events remain banned.
Ruiz said the quarantine had delayed the peak of the pandemic, which otherwise could have infected 250,000 people a day and collapsed the healthcare system.
""I don't think selective isolation measures will be reversed. We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, we're passing the hardest period,"" Ruiz said. 

""That doesn't mean there will not be new flare-ups but we have the capacity to trace them and do a focused containment.""

Images shared on social media showed people inspecting a large silver-coloured contraption fitted with solar panels and wires, which had landed in the tropical forest of Bas-Uele province in the northern Democratic Republic of Congo, trailing a large deflated balloon.
Locals alerted the security services after the object fell to earth around 1 p.m. local time on Monday, Bas-Uele Governor Valentin Senga told Reuters after visiting the site around 10 km (6 miles) south of the provincial capital Buta.
""I'm not able to say exactly what kind of device I observed,"" he said by phone on Tuesday. ""What intrigues us is that neither the intelligence services nor the local aviation authorities claim to have any information on the overflight of Congolese air space by this aircraft.""
He said police had detained two people, a Congolese and a Pakistani national, who had arrived in Buta with the purpose of searching for the device.
The mystery was solved on Tuesday afternoon when Loon, a subsidiary of Alphabet, claimed the object. ""I can confirm that Loon executed a controlled landing of one of our stratospheric balloons in this region,"" a Loon spokesman said in a statement.
Loon's balloons travel 20 km (12 miles) above the earth's surface on the edge of space, acting as floating cell towers, to deliver internet services to people in remote areas around the world.
Loon said the landing was coordinated with local air traffic control officials and approved by the civil aviation authority.
In July, Kenya's Telkom launched mobile internet services via Loon technology. Flight-tracking software showed the HBAL166 balloon circling central Africa in recent months, with its last known location in northern Congo.

DUBAI/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Top UAE and Israeli defence officials on Tuesday held their first publicly-acknowledged phone call since their countries' agreement to normalise ties, officials said, heralding possible security cooperation. 
The conversation between Minister of State for Defence Affairs Mohammed al-Bawardi and Defence Minister Benny Gantz came amid Israeli dissent at the prospect that the U.S.-brokered deal could grant the Gulf power access to advanced weaponry previously denied to it, such as F-35 stealth fighter jets.
In their 10-minute call, Bawardi and Gantz discussed boosting communication ""for the benefit of their countries in particular and the region as a whole"", a statement carried by UAE state news agency WAM said. 
Gantz's office quoted him as saying that they agreed to ""keep an open channel between them"". 
""We share important security interests, collaboration will strengthen regional stability,"" a statement from Gantz's office said. 
The normalisation accord, announced on Aug. 13, forges a new axis in confronting Shi'ite Muslim Iran and Sunni Islamist militants in the Middle East, and makes the UAE only the third Arab country to forge ties with Israel in more than 70 years.
But the UAE has argued that the agreement should remove ""any hurdle"" to advanced U.S. weapons sales, arguing that it eliminates any potential for belligerence between it and Israel.
A senior U.S. State Department official said that ""it makes perfect sense for us to be strengthening (the) UAE's defense capabilities at a time when they're under new threats for agreeing (to) peace with Israel,"" citing potential threats from Iran.
Seeking to allay Israeli security concerns, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reassured Israel on Monday that it would retain a military advantage in the region under any future arms deals with the UAE.
An Israeli defence official said that while Israel was firm in opposing any prospective U.S. sale of the F-35 to the UAE, the Netanyahu government was ""entirely immersed"" on the question of expanding criteria for Israeli defence exports to the Gulf power.
According to defence industry sources, Israel has sold the UAE security products in the cyber and surveillance realm. A study by the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab has linked spyware technologies produced by Israel's NSO Group to political surveillance in the UAE. 
In the early 2000s, Israel was in talks to sell the UAE drones, according to a U.S. official who was involved in the negotiations - but called off the deal after the 2010 death in Dubai of an arms dealer with the Islamist group Hamas, which Emirati authorities blamed on a Mossad hit team.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Tuesday it saw no need for now to investigate circumstances leading up to opposition politician Alexei Navalny's grave illness, and that a German clinic's initial diagnosis of poisoning was not yet conclusive.
Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday called for an investigation and for Russia to hold the perpetrators accountable after German doctors found indications of a toxic substance in his body.
Navalny, an outspoken opponent of President Vladimir Putin, was airlifted to Germany for treatment on Saturday after collapsing on a plane while flying back to Moscow from Siberia. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the German clinic had not conclusively identified the substance behind Navalny's illness and that it was unclear why German doctors were ""rushing"" to use the word poisoning.
""There must be a reason for an investigation. For the moment, all you and I see is that the patient is in a coma,"" Peskov told reporters. 
The foreign ministry said the alleged poisoning was not of benefit to the country's leadership, while Peskov added that any suggestions that Putin was somehow involved in Navalny's illness were untrue and ""hot air"" that the Kremlin would not take seriously.
Peskov said that if poisoning was definitively established as the cause, ""then of course, this will be a reason for an investigation.""
In response to the Kremlin's comments, Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said it was ""obvious the crime wouldn't be investigated properly and the criminal found."" 
The speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, a Putin ally, said one of its committees would launch a probe to determine whether foreign forces had played a hand in Navalny's illness in order to fuel tensions in Russia.
CHOLINESTERASE - OR NOT
Demands from abroad for an independent probe are intensifying.
On Monday, top European Union diplomat Josep Borrell asked Russia to investigate, a call echoed on Tuesday by U.S. ambassador to Russia John Sullivan and Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde (NYSE:LIN).
German doctors treating Navalny at a Berlin hospital said on Monday that medical examinations indicated poisoning with some kind of cholinesterase inhibitor, although the specific substance is not yet known.
Russian health officials contradicted that diagnosis, saying Navalny had tested negative for cholinesterase inhibitors when he was hospitalised in Omsk last week.
Peskov said doctors at the Omsk hospital had battled for three days to treat Navalny and had possibly saved his life. 
""We don't understand why our German colleagues are rushing with the word poisoning,"" he said. 
Navalny has been a tahorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level graft and mobilising protests. He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings and sued over corruption investigations, and was barred from running in the 2018 presidential election.
Germany said on Monday Navalny was being guarded due to concerns for his safety. Navalny's wife was filmed entering the hospital on Tuesday but declined to speak to journalists.
Reacting to developments related to Navalny and a political crisis in neighbouring Belarus, the Russian rouble fell to multi-month lows on Tuesday.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan urged the Taliban on Tuesday to start talks soon with the Afghan government to end decades of conflict, telling visiting officials of the group that an intra-Afghan dialogue could help ensure regional stability.
The meeting between Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and a Taliban team comes as Afghanistan's peace process has stalled over disagreements on a prisoner exchange. 
""Pakistan is eager to see an intra-Afghan dialogue start soon to ensure regional peace and stability,"" Qureshi said in a statement after meeting a delegation led by the head of the Taliban's political office Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.
Talks between the Taliban and an Afghan-government mandated committee were to be held in the Qatari capital Doha following the completion of the prisoner exchange between the two sides.
But the completion of the swap has been delayed by disagreements between the Taliban and the Afghan government.
There are also concerns over rising violence, which diplomats say is sapping trust needed for the talks. The insurgent group has so far rejected implementing a ceasefire before the talks start. 
""We deliberated on the complications, and what could be their solution,"" Qureshi said in a short media briefing, where no question was taken.
Though it was not immediately clear whether a reduction in violence was discussed, diplomats have said Pakistan – a leading regional player – has been pushing for a reduction in violence and smoothing the way for peace talks.
Tuesday's meeting was also attended by Pakistan's spy chief Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed, the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency. 
Analysts say the spy agency has had a close association with armed groups in Afghanistan dating back to the Soviet Union's invasion of the country in the late 1980s, and continues to exercise some influence over the Taliban. 

""Pakistan has a lot of leverage, short of military options, including allowing and restricting the Taliban's mobility,"" Barnett Rubin, a senior advisor on Afghanistan and Pakistan under the Obama administration told Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge rejected Ghislaine Maxwell's request to be moved into the general population at the Brooklyn jail where she is awaiting trial on charges she aided the late financier Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of girls.
Maxwell had objected to being treated worse than other pretrial inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center, citing ""onerous"" conditions including round-the-clock surveillance, numerous body scans, and being isolated in her cell most of the time.
But in an order on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan found no proof the surveillance measures were ""punitive"" or ""motivated by improper purposes."" Prosecutors said isolation would help ensure the British socialite's safety.
Nathan also said the Federal Bureau of Prisons had recently modified Maxwell's confinement conditions to allow her 13 hours a day to review materials and participate in her defense, and that this made further modifications ""unnecessary.""
Lawyers for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and later abuse three girls from 1994 to 1997, and committing perjury by denying her involvement under oath.
Nathan's order also rejected as ""premature"" Maxwell's bid to learn the names of the three alleged victims, and said she anticipated they would be disclosed ""substantially"" before trial, now scheduled for July 2021.

Epstein was found hanged at age 66 last August in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus jailed two opposition leaders for 10 days on Tuesday as the government pursued a crackdown on the few figures still at large, while schoolteachers led a new protest of thousands against President Alexander Lukashenko.
Despite most major opposition figures being in jail or exile, Lukashenko has so far failed to put down protests against his 26-year-old rule, more than two weeks after an election his opponents say was rigged.
Olga Kovalkova and Siarhei Dyleuski were brought to separate courts where they were each jailed for 10 days. Kovalkova is the main representative still in Belarus of opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, and Dyleuski has led strikes at Minsk's flagship tractor factory.
Both are senior figures in an opposition Coordination Council, set up last week with the self-described aim of negotiating with the authorities. They were arrested on Monday.
Lukashenko has accused the new council of attempting to seize power, and prosecutors have launched a criminal case.
In the latest protest, thousands gathered at the ministry of education to demonstrate against a threat by Lukashenko to fire schoolteachers who do not support his government. Rallies have typically attracted thousands during the week, swelling to tens of thousands on weekends.
""I have come so that teachers are not afraid, so that their voice can be heard, so that they can work even if they have a different view from the authorities,"" said a literature teacher who gave her name as Svetlana.
Lukashenko has denied election cheating. He has called the protesters ""rats"" and says they are funded from abroad.
His posturing has grown steadily more confrontational: in recent days he has been pictured on state television with a Kalashnikov rifle and tactical vest. Yet so far, a long-standing threat of a decisive police operation to clear the streets has yet to materialise.
Another opposition council member, Pavel Latushko, a former culture minister and head of the main state drama theatre, was questioned by investigators on Tuesday but not arrested. He emerged saying he would go back to work and the council's activities were not illegal.
The council includes dozens of figures representing broad swathes of society. Nobel Prize-winning author Svetlana Alexievich has been summoned for questioning on Wednesday.
""The intimidation will not work. We will not relent,"" candidate Tsikhanouskaya said in a video link with the European Parliament. ""We demand all political prisoners freed. We demand to stop the violence and intimidation by the authorities.""
The Belarus Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected Tsikhanouskaya's appeal to annul the election results. 
OPPOSITION
Tsikhanouskaya, 37, fled to Lithuania after the election her supporters say she won. A political novice, she emerged as the consensus opposition candidate after better-known figures were barred from standing, including her jailed activist husband.
Belarus is the closest ally to Russia of all former Soviet republics, and Lukashenko's fate is widely seen as in the hands of the Kremlin, which must decide whether to stick with him as his authority has ebbed.
Despite being seen in Moscow as a truculent and erratic ally, Lukashenko still seems to have the backing of Russia which sent journalists to staff Belarus state TV after employees quit in protest against what they described as orders to broadcast propaganda.
On Tuesday, Russia said that during talks between Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, it had stressed there should be no attempt by the United States and European Union to ""pressure"" Belarus, including via sanctions.
Biegun was in Moscow after meeting Tsikhanouskaya on Monday in Lithuania. 
The West has had to balance its sympathy for a nascent Belarusian pro-democracy movement with its concern that strong support would trigger a Russian-backed crackdown.

Meanwhile the crisis is threatening the finances of a country as foreign currency reserves shrink and the currency weakens. The Belarusian rouble is at a record low against the euro and is approaching an all-time trough versus the dollar as Belarusians queue at exchange points to buy hard currency.

It said in a statement that Taotao Zhang, a chemist and chemical supplier, had shipped illicit synthetic opioids to the United States. The Treasury also blacklisted Hong Kong-based Allyrise Technology Group Co, Limited, of which Zhang is director, accusing it of being a front company for his financial transactions.
Fentanyl is a cheap opioid painkiller 50 times more potent than heroin that has played a major role in an opioid crisis in the United States, where more than 28,000 synthetic opioid-related overdose deaths were recorded in 2017.
U.S. officials say China is the main source of illicit fentanyl. President Donald Trump has accused Chinese President Xi Jinping of failing to meet promises to help stop the flow of the drug into the United States, a charge Beijing rejects.

The storm strengthened to a hurricane as its center moved northwest over Cuba early Tuesday at 16 miles per hour (26 kph)with sustained winds of 70 miles per hour (110 kph), and it was due to intensify over the next two days, the National Hurricane Center said.
The Texas city of Galveston imposed a mandatory evacuation order on Tuesday after the storm's track veered westward overnight towards to the island community of some 50,000 people. The storm was 620 miles (1,000 km) southeast of Galveston on Tuesday morning.
""It’s imperative that you make plans this morning to secure your homes and move you and your family to safety off island,"" acting Mayor Craig Brown said in a statement on Tuesday.
More than 330,000 residents living in Jefferson and Orange Counties in eastern Texas were also placed under a mandatory evacuation order on Tuesday.
On Monday, the mayor of Port Arthur, Texas, an oil town of 54,000 people 85 miles (137 km) east of Houston, ordered a mandatory evacuation, giving residents until 6 a.m. on Tuesday to leave.
Laura is projected to make landfall in the Texas-Louisiana border region late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning as a major hurricane, possibly Category 3 on the 5-step Saffir-Simpson scale for measuring hurricane intensity, the NHC said.
""This has the potential to be the strongest hurricane to hit since Hurricane Rita,"" Louisiana Governor John Edwards said at a Monday evening news conference, referring to the Category 5 hurricane that hit in 2005.
The storm comes on the heels of Tropical Storm Marco, which weakened sooner than expected and made landfall on Monday in Louisiana before dissipating.
Laura skirted the southern coast of Cuba on Monday but did not cause as much damage as it did in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where it killed at least 10 people.
The coincidence of Laura's storm surge with high tide along the Gulf Coast from High Island, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana could result in water levels rising as high as 11 feet, the Miami-based forecaster said.

Rainfall along the coast near the Texas-Louisiana border, as much as a foot of water in some places, was expected to cause widespread flooding.

Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan failed to strike an agreement on the operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) before the reservoir behind the dam began being filled in July. But the three countries have returned to talks under African Union mediation.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited Khartoum on Tuesday with a high level delegation to meet Sudanese officials, who have played an increasingly prominent role in negotiations with their two neighbours.
""The two sides emphasised they would make every possible effort to reach a successful conclusion to the current tripartite negotiations,"" a joint statement from Ethiopia and Sudan said. 
The talks should lead to a formula that makes the dam a tool for regional integration, the statement said, praising AU mediation as embodying ""African solutions for African problems"".
Negotiations have previously faltered over a demand from Egypt and Sudan that any deal should be legally binding, over the mechanism for resolving future disputes, and over how to manage the dam during periods of reduced rainfall or drought.
Egypt says it is dependent on the Nile for more than 90% of its scarce fresh water supplies, and fears the dam could have a devastating effect on its economy.

PAYERNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - A parachutist completed the world's first jump from a solar-powered aircraft on Tuesday after the plane soared to a height of 1,520 metres (nearly 5,000 ft) over western Switzerland, Swiss organisers said.
The two-seater prototype plane made the test flight in good weather and to promote renewable energy. Parachutist Raphael Domjan reached a speed of 150 kilometres per hour during his jump, landing near the project base in Payerne. 
""Today there were many firsts but the most important is [this is] the first time ever that someone jumped from an electric aircraft. And this is something that is changing the future for this sport for sky divers,"" said Domjan, the instigator of the SolarStratos project and who co-piloted the plane.
""It was the first time we did a solar skydive, I climbed with the energy coming from the solar cells of the plane,"" he said.

In 2022, the team aims to carry out a high-altitude flight powered exclusively by solar energy, seeking to reach the stratosphere with an altitude of 20,000 metres.

The bombing on Feb. 14, 2019 killed 40 paramilitary policemen, leading to aerial clashes between India and Pakistan, two long-time, nuclear-armed rivals. Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility for the attack.
On Monday, the NIA said four of the seven Pakistani nationals charged in the attack were at large, while the other three had been killed in separate clashes with security forces.
""The charge sheet has brought on record the all-out involvement of Pakistan-based entities (in) carry(ing) out terrorist strikes in India and to incite and provoke Kashmiri youth,"" an NIA statement said.
The other 12 accused are local residents of Indian Kashmir, some of whom have been killed in clashes, some arrested with the rest missing.
One of the accused, a 20-year-old man from Kashmir's capital city Srinagar, ordered 4 kilograms (8.8 pounds) of aluminium powder on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to help his accomplices make explosives used in the attack, according to the NIA.
India has long accused Pakistan of harbouring militants and supporting insurgency in Muslim-majority Kashmir, a Himalayan region split between the two countries but claimed in full by both. Pakistan has denied the accusations. Two of the three wars between India and Pakistan have been fought over Kashmir.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nationalist government tightened its grip on Kashmir last August when it stripped away its special status that allowed it to make some of its own laws.
The decision, the most far-reaching political move in one of the world’s most militarised regions in nearly seven decades, polarised opinion with Kashmiri leaders calling it aggression against the state's people.

DUBAI (Reuters) - If the United States wants an agreement with Iran, it must first come back to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers that Washington abandoned two years ago, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday. 
""Washington's maximum pressure policy on Iran has failed 100%...If Washington wants an agreement with us, then they should apologise for exiting the deal and return to it,"" Rouhani told a televised news conference.
Long-tense relations between the two adversaries have almost come to blows since 2018 when U.S. President Donald Trump ditched the deal reached by his predecessor Barack Obama and reimposed sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy. 
In response to what Washington calls its “maximum pressure” campaign to force Iran to negotiate a new deal, Tehran has breached key limits on nuclear activity imposed by the 2015 accord, under which the Islamic Republic accepted curbs on its uranium enrichment program in return for relief from sanctions.
Trump has pledged to strike a new deal - under which he would seek stricter limits on enrichment, an end to Tehran's ballistic missile program and involvement in various Middle East conflicts - within weeks if he wins re-election in November.
""Trump has been talking a lot ... The next president, whether it is Trump or someone else, must adopt a different approach towards Iran,"" Rouhani said. 
In response to U.S. sanctions, Tehran has breached key limits on nuclear activity imposed by the 2015 accord.
Last week the United States moved to reinstate global U.N. sanctions on Iran, including an arms embargo, arguing Tehran was in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal even though Washington itself abandoned that agreement two years ago.
Council members France, Britain and Germany (E3), which along with Russia and China remain in the accord, have dismissed the move as void given Washington's departure from the deal and said it was harming efforts to restrain Iran's nuclear activity.
But France's foreign minister, echoing the stance of Britain and Germany, told his Iranian counterpart that Paris was worried about the impact of the arms embargo expiring in October.
""The minister reiterated our concern about Iran's destabilising activities and the consequences of the expiration of the...embargo on conventional arms, and told him of the E3's determination to seek solutions preserving security and regional stability,"" ministry deputy spokesman Francois Delmas said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Iran's arch-enemy in the Middle East, urged Britain to join the U.S. bid to reimpose U.N. sanctions during a visit by British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to Jerusalem.
""Look at Iran's aggression today, without a nuclear weapon. What a huge danger Iran would be to the entire world if it did get a nuclear weapon,"" Netanyahu told Raab, according to a statement released by the premier's office.

Iran has repeatedly denied seeking nuclear weapons.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Talks with the U.N. nuclear watchdog's chief were constructive, Iran's top nuclear official Ali Akbar Salehi was quoted as saying on Tuesday, after meeting Rafael Grossi during a visit to seek access for inspectors to two suspected former atomic sites. 
Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency, wants Iran to let his inspectors into the sites because the agency suspects they could still host undeclared nuclear material, or traces of it. 
""Our conversation today was very constructive. It was agreed that the agency will carry out its independent and professional responsibilities and Iran will fulfil its legal commitments,"" said Salehi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, according to the Students News Agency ISNA. 
""A new chapter of cooperation between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency will start,"" said Salehi, but added that ""Iran will not accept any additional demands beyond its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal"". 
""We are working on reaching an agreement on @IAEAorg’s safeguards verification activities in Iran,"" Grossi tweeted after meeting Salehi, without elaborating. But some insiders said it could be a sign of Iran agreeing to grant the IAEA access to the two sites after a months-long standoff. 
Iran has suggested the agency is seeking access based on the Israeli information, which it argues is inadmissible. 
Washington last week pressed the U.N. Security Council to reimpose sanctions lifted under Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, from which the United States has withdrawn.
Tehran says Grossi's visit is unrelated to U.S. moves on sanctions and has called on the IAEA to ""distance itself from political pressure by other countries"".
""There are issues that need to be addressed ... this does not mean a political approach towards Iran,"" Grossi said according to Iranian media.
""The IAEA will not let third countries impact its relations with any other country."" 

Grossi will meet President Hassan Rouhani and other officials during his visit.

China has long denounced U.S. surveillance activities, while the United States has complained of ""unsafe"" intercepts by Chinese aircraft. While such missions happen regularly, for China to talk about them publicly is unusual.
China's Defence Ministry said the U-2 flew without permission over a no-fly zone in the northern military region where live fire drills were taking place, ""seriously interfering in normal exercise activities"".
This could easily have caused a misunderstanding or misjudgement or an ""unexpected incident"", the ministry added.
""It was an act of naked provocation, and China is resolutely opposed to it, and have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. side.""
While it did not say exactly where the incident took place, China is currently carrying out drills in the Bohai Sea. Other exercises are also happening in the Yellow Sea and South China Sea.
The ministry added that the U.S. move ran counter to China-U.S. rules on behaviour at sea and in the air and international norms.
""China demands the U.S. side immediately stop this kind of provocative behaviour and take actual steps to safeguard peace and stability in the region.""
Relations between Washington and Beijing have worsened over everything from trade and human rights to what the United States sees as aggressive moves by China's armed forces, especially in the disputed South China Sea and around Chinese-claimed Taiwan.
In April 2001, an intercept of a U.S. spy plane by a Chinese fighter jet resulted in a collision that killed the Chinese pilot and forced the American plane to make an emergency landing at a base on the southern Chinese island of Hainan.
The 24 U.S. air crew members were held for 11 days until Washington apologised for the incident.

""At the request of the Prime Minister of Israel, a decision was made to significantly restrict the Hasidic pilgrimage to Uman to celebrate Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year),"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office said in a statement.
It did not say how many Hasidic Jews would be allowed into Ukraine for the event or give any further detail.
The head of Israel's coronavirus task force has asked Zelenskiy to ban the annual pilgrimage outright because of concerns the central Ukrainian town of Uman could be a hotbed of coronavirus contagion. 
Zelenskiy's office has declined to comment on whether Kyiv might ban the Hasidic pilgrimage entirely, not just limit it.
Israel is among a series of countries from which any travellers to Ukraine must quarantine themselves for 14 days after arrival. Israel registered 230.6 new infections per 100,000 of its population last week while Ukraine's rate was 54.9.
Tens of thousands of Hasidic Jews descend on Uman every Jewish New Year to visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, who revived the Hasidic movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and died in 1810. 
Rosh Hashanah celebrations this year run from Sept. 18-20.
The Ukrainian and Israeli governments have issued a joint statement pleading with pilgrims to cancel their trips, but significant numbers are still planning to go.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - More than half a million users joined a new Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group created by a critic of the powerful Thai king after the social media company blocked its predecessor under pressure from the government.
The ""Royalist Marketplace"" group, which had over 1 million members, was blocked within Thailand late on Monday after the digital ministry threatened legal action against Facebook under the country's Computer Crime Act. 
Facebook said it was compelled to comply but would mount a legal challenge to the Thai government.
The tension came amid near daily youth-led protests against the government of a former military junta chief and unprecedented calls for reforms of the monarchy, which is illegal to insult in Thailand. 
Hours before the restriction, Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a self-exiled academic and prominent critic of the monarchy, set up a new group with a similar name that has gained over half a million members in one day. 
""If you want to close it down again, then I'll set up another group. To promote freedom of expression, I would do it,"" Pavin told Reuters. 
Pavin, who lives in Japan, created the original group in April, encouraging once-rare free discussion of the monarchy and royal family members, considered taboo subjects in Thailand. 
Thailand's lese majeste laws forbid defaming the king with penalties of up to 15 years in prison, and often form the basis for requests to block or remove content on social media.
Thailand's digital minister said Facebook was at risk of violating a different law, the Computer Crime Act, in not acting on court orders attached to government requests to block content. 
Facebook said it would challenge the government in court over the legality of the orders related to the group and would seek to have them revoked.
""Requests like this are severe, contravene international human rights law, and have a chilling effect on people's ability to express themselves,"" a company spokesperson said.
""We work to protect and defend the rights of all internet users and are preparing to legally challenge this request.""

It said such ""excessive government actions"" undermined its business in Thailand.

Johnson, whose Conservative government has come under fire for how it has tackled education during the coronavirus crisis, said it was ""crucial"" for all children to return to school and that he would look at medical evidence to see whether he should change the government's advice on wearing face coverings.
After his government was criticised for its handling of exam results this month and failed to bring all children back to school before the summer holidays, Johnson wants to show his government can preside over a full-time return to school.
""I'm really pleased by the work that teachers, schools, parents, pupils have done to get ready,"" he said on a visit in southwest England.
Questioned over whether England would have to change its policy on not advising some children to wear face coverings at school as Scotland has, Johnson said: ""You know, we'll look at the changing medical evidence as we go on. If we need to change the advice, then of course we will.""
Johnson has been criticised for his government's wider response to the pandemic, accused by opposition parties and medics for being too slow to lock down, too quick to ease restrictions and for failing to test enough people.

A U-turn on using an algorithm to determine exam results this month added to that criticism, with Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, branding the government ""incompetent"".

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai court on Tuesday issued a new arrest warrant for the heir to the Red Bull energy drink fortune over his alleged involvement in a fatal hit-and-run accident in 2012, police said. 
Vorayuth Yoovidhya was accused of crashing his Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) into a policeman, Wichien Klanprasert, and dragging his body for dozens of metres before fleeing.
Authorities last month unexpectedly dropped the case, sparking public criticism that prompted a government review.
On Tuesday the criminal court in Bangkok approved a new arrest warrant for Vorayuth on a previous charges of reckless driving causing death and a new charge of drug use, assistant national police chief Pol Lt Gen Jaruwat Waisaya told Reuters. 
Vorayuth missed eight court summonses before authorities issued an arrest warrant five years after the incident. He later disappeared, apparently abroad, according to social media posts.
Vorayuth's lawyer, Samack Chouvaparnante, told Reuters he had no knowledge of the new warrant and had not been in touch with his client.
TCP Group, which owns the Thai Red Bull brand, has previously said it has no direct links with Vorayuth. His late grandfather Chaleo Yoovidhya created the energy drink and his father has part ownership of the international Red Bull brand.
A panel this month revisited evidence previously not included in police reports which suggests that Vorayuth's car was travelling faster than previously thought, and reviewed a blood test taken after the accident that pointed to traces of cocaine in his system.
""We will submit a new report within two weeks so the public prosecutor can issue a issue a prosecution order,"" Jaruwat said.

Control of the waters is politically sensitive, and many farmers’ and fishermen’s livelihoods depend on the river. A report by a U.S. research company this year accused China of holding back large amounts of water during a drought last year, a finding Beijing disputed.
Tuesday's statement by the Mekong River Commission, which groups Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, followed an assurance by China to share more water management data from its portion of the river with Southeast Asian nations, although details of its pledge were not immediately clear.
""Any future data and information to be shared by the MRC member countries under the LMC framework should be developed in close collaboration with the MRC secretariat so that we can connect the two platforms effectively,"" said a secretariat official, An Pich Hatda. 
He was referring to the Lancang Mekong Cooperation (LMC) framework for development of the river that includes China and five Southeast Asian nations, which held an online conference on Monday. 
China has no water treaties with the lower Mekong countries and only shares limited data during the monsoon season on flows on the upper stretch of what it calls the Lancang River.
Two years of record drought on the 4,350-km (2,700-mile) Mekong have been devastating for many of the 60 million people whose livelihoods depend on it.
Management of the Mekong has become another front in the battle for influence between China and the United States.

RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. (Reuters) - Before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down air-conditioned shopping malls and movie theaters, Debera Diaz and her adult son Joshua could have ducked inside to escape the 109 degree Fahrenheit heat that roasted their town near Sacramento last week.
So the pair, who have been living in Debera's Honda Civic since her divorce and eviction a few months ago, were grateful to find a cooling center in city hall, complete with masks and a showing of the Meryl Streep movie ""The Devil Wears Prada (OTC:PRDSY).""
""You can't even go to the library,"" said Diaz, 58. ""It was really bad.""
The coronavirus pandemic presents vexing challenges for officials trying to protect residents from extreme weather conditions. Many places people usually go are closed, and public cooling centers like the one in Rancho Cordova can only accept half the normal number of people because of physical distancing requirements. Staying with relatives or friends is also difficult because of health concerns.
At the same time, however, officials worry that fears of catching the virus will keep some vulnerable people from seeking shelter from extreme heat, or even seeking out evacuation centers when wildfire threatens.
Protecting residents from extreme conditions is an issue that increasingly confronts cities and counties across the United States, as storms, heat and wildfire force thousands to seek refuge. Many experts are even more concerned about how to shelter vulnerable residents from extreme cold should the pandemic still be raging in the winter.
""It's changed how we approach this as a city,"" Rancho Cordova Mayor David Sander said of the pandemic. In previous years, churches and nonprofits opened their doors to people seeking shelter, but now many are either closed or unable to help, he said.
The city's cooling center, set up in a large meeting room, can only accommodate 10 people before workers have to open an adjoining room, Sander said. That is half or less than its usual capacity.
The city is not taking the temperatures of everyone who comes in but asks anyone with a self-reported fever to stay away.
Among those most likely to suffer from extreme weather are people without homes like the Diazes, and the elderly on fixed incomes who might not have air conditioning or, if they do, may feel that they can't afford to use it, said Mary Jo Flynn-Nevins, the emergency operations coordinator for Sacramento County.
Public agencies opened eight cooling centers in the county during last week's heatwave, each able to accommodate between 10 and 40 people, she said.
With more than 5,500 people homeless in Sacramento County last year, and around 225,000 elderly, space for residents to shelter from harsh weather can quickly run short, Flynn-Nevins said.
Statewide, cooling centers were opened in 24 of California's 58 counties, according to the California Department of Emergency Services.
The administration of Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom did not respond to requests for comment about the challenges of offering respite from the heat during the pandemic. But the state has encouraged residents to limit their use of electricity to avoid overtaxing the power grid and prompting blackouts.
When the temperature neared 100 Fahrenheit in the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles, Magdalay Arriola went to the East Valley Adult Center, where she sat with a water bottle and portable lunch cooler, reading a book.
About 10 people, 6 feet apart and wearing masks, sat in the air-conditioned room. Employees in protective suits cleaned tables and chairs with disinfectant.
""The AC is not working in my house, and I was getting really overheated,"" said Arriola, 55. ""Hopefully this is safe.""
Her worry that the cooling center may not be safe from COVID-19 is common, said Chad Carter, a spokesman for the Red Cross. People also worry they may spread or contract the virus if they seek shelter with friends or family.
But they also must recognize the dangers of soaring temperatures, which include heat exhaustion and heat stroke. 

""Extreme heat is a risk just like COVID-19,"" he said. ""Extreme heat can be deadly.""

FORT WORTH, Texas (Reuters) - When David Collie slipped off his shirt as he set out one sultry night to visit some friends, he didn't know he was putting himself in grave danger. But he was. He now fit the description: shirtless, Black, male.
Moments later, Collie lay face down on the pavement, gunned down as a possible suspect in a crime he didn’t commit.
The shooter was Fort Worth, Texas, police officer Hugo Barron. He and his partner had been looking for two shirtless Black men wanted for an armed robbery involving tennis shoes. When the cops spotted David Collie, they pulled into the apartment complex, got out of the squad car and started shouting commands at him.
Police dashboard camera video shows that Collie was walking away from the two cops as he pulled his hand out of his pocket and raised his arm. That’s when Barron fired his gun. A hollow-point bullet slammed into Collie’s back, punctured a lung and severed his spine, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.
In the four years since then, Collie, now 37 years old, has lived in nursing homes, afflicted with infections, pressure sores, and bouts of crushing depression. As he talked about the July 2016 shooting and what it took from him, wails from an elderly patient echoed down the corridor. The odors of urine and excrement wafted in from the hall. Collie closed his eyes and exhaled. “Paralyzed over some tennis shoes? Come on, man,” he said. “You’re playing with a human life here.”
To many Americans, the outlines of Collie’s encounter with police have become dismayingly familiar in recent years — and all the more so since the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man, under the knee of a Minneapolis cop sparked mass protests against racism and aggressive police tactics. The fate of Collie’s attempt at redress has become familiar, too, and now underpins demands that police be held accountable when they kill or seriously injure people.
In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Collie accused Barron of excessive force, a civil rights violation under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He thought that any money from a settlement or jury award would give him some measure of independence after the shooting cost him his job and derailed his plans to return to college. He also thought Barron should be held responsible for what he did.
Collie didn’t get very far. Barron, who hadn’t been disciplined or charged with any wrongdoing for the shooting, argued that he had acted reasonably on a fear that Collie was about to shoot his partner. Collie said he took his hand from his pocket to point to where he was going when Barron shot him. The judge sided with Barron — though Collie had nothing to do with the robbery the cops were investigating, had no gun on him, and was 30 feet away with his back to Barron when the cop fired.
The judge ruled that Barron was entitled to qualified immunity, a legal doctrine meant to protect police and other government officials from frivolous lawsuits. A federal appeals court, saying the case “exemplifies an individual’s being in the wrong place at the wrong time,” upheld the lower court’s decision.
“You shoot me, paralyze me, put me in a nursing home, ruin everything, and I can’t get no type of compensation?” Collie said. He leaned back in his bed. “This ain’t justice.”
Collie would have stood a much better chance of getting the justice he sought if he had been able to sue elsewhere. That's because, in excessive force lawsuits, courts in some parts of the United States are more likely to deny cops immunity than others.
In a review of 529 cases since 2005, Reuters found significant differences in how the federal appeals courts treat qualified immunity.
Plaintiffs fared worst in the court that heard Collie’s appeal, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where judges habitually follow precedents that favor police. The court granted 64% of police requests for immunity in excessive force cases.
By contrast, the 9th Circuit has set a higher bar for police. The appellate judges there granted immunity in just 42% of police requests for immunity in excessive force cases.
The regional disparities are also evident in federal district courts, where excessive force lawsuits are actually heard and which must follow precedents set by their respective appellate courts. In an analysis of 435 federal district court rulings in excessive force cases from 2014 to 2018 in California and Texas, the two most populous states, judges in Texas granted immunity to police at nearly twice the rate of California judges — 59% of cases, compared to 34%.
A plaintiff’s chances are so much better in California that one who was armed in an encounter with police is more likely to overcome qualified immunity than one who was unarmed in Texas.
TARGET OF OUTRAGE
For years, the words “qualified immunity” were seldom heard outside of legal and academic circles, where critics have long contended that the doctrine is unjust. But outrage over the killing of George Floyd and incidents like it have made this 50-year-old legal doctrine — created by the U.S. Supreme Court itself — a target of broad public demands for comprehensive reform to rein in police behavior.
The criticism that qualified immunity denies justice to victims of police brutality is well-founded. As Reuters reported just two weeks before Floyd’s death, the immunity defense has been making it easier for cops to kill or injure civilians with impunity. Based on federal appellate court records, the report showed, courts have been granting cops immunity at increasing rates in recent years — even when judges found the behavior so egregious that it violated a plaintiff’s civil rights — thanks largely to continual Supreme Court guidance that has favored police.
The regional differences Reuters has found in how qualified immunity is granted only add to arguments that the doctrine is unfair. “It’s essential to our system of government that access to justice should be the same in Dallas and Houston as in Phoenix and Las Vegas,” said Paul Hughes, a prominent civil rights attorney who frequently argues before the U.S. Supreme Court. “It shouldn’t turn on the happenstance of geography as to whether or not they (plaintiffs) have a remedy.”
The “happenstance of geography” shows up in a comparison of Collie’s case to the one Benny Herrera’s family filed after a cop killed him in 2011. Police in Tustin, California, were looking for the 31-year-old father of four after a former girlfriend reported that he had assaulted her. They found him walking along a lightly trafficked road, behaving erratically. As in Collie’s case, a cop opened fire when he thought Herrera was about to shoot him. Like Collie, Herrera did not have a gun.
In the Herrera family’s lawsuit, the cop was denied immunity. The district court judge, and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals after him, weighed the same question as the courts in Collie’s case: Did the shooter act reasonably on a fear for his and others’ safety when he used deadly force? In this instance, the court said no. The case could move forward.
Before the family’s lawsuit got to trial, the plaintiffs secured a $1.4 million settlement. Herrera always wanted his children to be financially secure, Elizabeth Landeros, mother of one of his children, said. They lost their father, she said, but at least “now they’ll be OK.”
PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES
Qualified immunity plays out differently from region to region because of differences in judicial philosophies among those regions, lawyers and legal experts said.
Over the years, the Supreme Court has repeatedly told lower courts to use an objective analysis when weighing police claims of immunity: They must determine whether the force used was reasonable or excessive, and if the latter, whether the specific type of force used has already been defined as illegal under “clearly established” precedent.
But how judges answer those questions is influenced by their personal views on police authority and individuals’ rights, and their views often reflect the cultural and political landscapes they inhabit. In typically conservative areas, judges tend to favor police, while in more liberal parts of the country, they tend to favor plaintiffs. Those tendencies get baked into circuit court precedents that all judges in that circuit must follow.
Most judges are from the area where they serve and grew up in that culture, and “whether they are liberal or conservative, they are bound to apply the law as it’s developed in that circuit,” said Karen Blum, a professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston and a critic of qualified immunity. “Is it fair? No.”
The liberal-leaning 9th Circuit, where the Herrera family sued, has established in its precedents powerful support for plaintiffs. Among them are rulings cautioning against throwing out excessive force cases before a jury has had a chance to weigh an officer’s credibility, and requiring more than officers’ claims that they feared for their safety as grounds for granting immunity.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly rebuked the 9th Circuit for its willingness to deny cops immunity, and especially for applying, as the high court wrote in a 2011 ruling, “a high level of generality” when analyzing the question of clearly established precedent.
PERCEIVED THREATS
Judges in the 5th Circuit, where Collie’s case was heard, are more likely to prioritize police power over citizens' rights and liberties. Courts in the 5th Circuit habitually cite precedents that favor police by treating an officer’s perception of a threat as the key consideration. They do the same when deciding whether the force used was illegal under clearly established precedent, requiring that the material facts of the two cases be nearly identical.
“If you approach these cases by placing a thumb on the scale in favor of police officers, you will tend to search the record for any basis in which to conclude that the actions police officers ultimately took were justified,” said Hughes, the civil rights lawyer.
Across the country, different judicial approaches result in different outcomes for similar cases — including numerous cases like Collie’s, in which cops claimed they were countering a threat to themselves or others when they shot someone from behind.
In Indio, California, a cop was denied immunity after fatally shooting Ernest Foster Jr three times in the back during a foot chase at a shopping plaza, even though police recovered a gun from the scene. And in Denver, Colorado, an officer was denied immunity after shooting Michael Valdez in the back, severely injuring him, though the cop himself had been shot during the preceding car chase.
These cases were in the 9th and 10th Circuits, respectively, both relatively plaintiff-friendly, based on the Reuters analysis of how often they granted qualified immunity.
But in Houston, a cop was granted immunity after fatally shooting Gerrit Perkins in the back while Perkins crouched in a closet holding a cordless phone. Perkins was unarmed. And in Bradley County, Arkansas, an officer was granted immunity after shooting Davdrin Goffin in the back, partially paralyzing him, even though he had already been patted down for weapons. He, too, was unarmed.
These cases were in the more police-friendly 5th and 8th Circuits, respectively, based on how often they granted qualified immunity.
Minnesota, where George Floyd lived, is also in the 8th Circuit. The day state investigators arrested the Minneapolis officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck as he died, the appellate court granted immunity to cops in Burnsville, Minnesota, who killed Map Kong, a man in a mental health crisis, when they shot him in the back as he ran away holding a knife.
ESSENTIAL TO POLICING
Police officers and their supporters say qualified immunity is essential to ensure that police can make split-second decisions in dangerous situations without having to worry about being sued later. “If we expose police officers to these suits on a regular basis, who would ever want to be a police officer?” said Kent Scheidegger, a lawyer with the pro-law enforcement Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, based in Sacramento, California.
However, denial of immunity doesn’t necessarily mean a certain loss for police. It means only that a lawsuit can move toward a jury trial or a financial settlement. District court data show that when cops were denied immunity in California and Texas, the cases were settled at about the same rate, 64% of the time. In nearly all of the remaining cases, a jury decided in favor of the police.
Even when a plaintiff secures recompense through a settlement or a jury award, the cops are nearly always indemnified against personal liability, meaning local governments — typically named as defendants — or their insurers cover the costs.
This widespread practice, legal experts said, undermines the ability of lawsuits to deter excessive force, particularly since cops are rarely prosecuted or otherwise disciplined for their actions. “There is no sense of justice being done,” said Blum, the Suffolk University law professor. “The goal should be to deter, in some way to have a price paid if you engage in this kind of behavior.”
Blum is part of a broad coalition of lawyers, scholars, civil rights groups and politicians who in recent years have called for qualified immunity to be reined in. As currently applied, they say, the doctrine too often denies even an attempt at justice to people who believe they are victims of excessive force and fails to hold police accountable.
An increasing number of judges of all stripes have also expressed frustration with the doctrine and the Supreme Court’s repeated interventions that have made it harder to deny immunity. In an opinion last year, Judge Don Willett, appointed to the 5th Circuit by President Donald Trump, put it bluntly: “The real-world functioning of modern immunity practice — essentially ‘heads government wins, tails plaintiff loses’ — leaves many victims violated but not vindicated.”
The justices have offered few explanations for their stance on qualified immunity beyond writing in opinions that the doctrine is important “to society as a whole” and balances individuals’ rights with the need to curb litigation that could unduly burden government officials. Two of the justices — liberal Sonia Sotomayor and conservative Clarence Thomas — have criticized qualified immunity in written opinions in recent years. All nine current justices declined to be interviewed for this article.
Amid the protests in the wake of Floyd’s death, expectations ran high that the Supreme Court would finally move to restrict or end qualified immunity by taking up at least one of several petitions to hear cases backed by opponents of the doctrine. But in early June, it rejected those petitions.
Congress moved swiftly to draft police reform measures, but legislative proposals, including some that would have ended qualified immunity, stalled as Democrats and Republicans deadlocked over issues of addressing racial inequality and police accountability. President Donald Trump’s White House and some Republicans in Congress have called eliminating qualified immunity for police a “non-starter” on the grounds that it would deter police officers from doing their jobs properly.
A NEW BEGINNING
In the summer of 2016, David Collie was putting his life in order and putting a troubled past behind him.
More than a decade earlier, as a student at Texas Southern University in Houston, he had become involved in a gang, indulging in “glamor, clothes, money and girls,” he said. When he pulled a gun on an adversary and took his car for a ride, Collie was charged with robbery and evading arrest and spent 11 years in prison.
Two months before Barron shot him, Collie had landed a full-time gig building supermarket produce displays. He liked the work, and he was cheered to be saving money before resuming college classes in cinematography in the fall. “Work and school, that was always the plan,” he said.
On the night of July 27, he got a call. Some friends who lived in the same apartment complex were arguing. It was late, and he had to be at work at 7 a.m., but he decided to walk over to the couple’s home to try to calm them and provide a diversion for their children, who called him Uncle David.
Officer Barron of the Fort Worth police and Tarrant County Deputy Sheriff Vanesa Flores were working off-duty paid security detail for a nearby apartment complex that night. They had just heard from dispatch that two shirtless Black men had made off with two pairs of tennis shoes, valued at $225 each, in a deal organized through Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). One of the suspects, the officers heard, had brandished a gun.
Just after midnight, police dashboard camera video shows, the two officers were walking toward Collie when Flores trains her flashlight on him. Barron pulls out his pistol. Collie turns around briefly and then continues to walk away.
Collie said the pair were shouting commands at him and over each other. He was confused, unsure about what to do, he said. “They asked me where I was going, I was pointing,” he said. “I was trying to comply.”
The instant Collie pulled his right hand out of his pocket to point, Barron fired. “You didn’t have to shoot me,” Collie recalled saying after the force of the bullet slammed him to the pavement.
Time elapsed from the cops first appearing on the dash-cam to the shooting: five seconds.
The Fort Worth Police Department declined to comment and declined to make Barron available for comment. Flores, who no longer works for the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office, could not be reached.
After the Fort Worth police internal affairs division investigated the shooting, the Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney’s Office presented the evidence to a grand jury, which declined to indict Barron on any criminal charges. A spokeswoman for the office noted that Flores “did not cause, participate in, or contribute to the shooting,” and had no further comment.
SHACKLED IN RECOVERY
Collie endured a difficult two-month recovery in hospital. In addition to his paralysis and other medical issues that linger to this day, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Doctors removed a bullet fragment from his chest seven weeks after the shooting.
He was also shackled to his hospital bed for nearly the entire time because police had charged him with aggravated assault on a public servant. A grand jury eventually declined to indict him.
In March 2017, Collie filed his lawsuit in federal district court in Fort Worth, naming Barron, Flores, the City of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, and several other officers as defendants. Any money Collie got would allow him to afford a home and a car modified for his disability. He also hoped to pay for physical therapy to try to walk again, though doctors said that was a long shot. “It’s like the world is saying, ‘I’m sorry, we’re wrong we did that…We’re going to help you out, help you get back on your feet,’ ” Collie said of the recompense he sought.
Less than a month after Collie sued, lawyers for Barron, provided and paid for by Fort Worth, requested qualified immunity for the cop. Early on, Judge John McBryde dismissed Collie’s claims against all defendants other than Barron and Fort Worth.
In court papers, Barron’s lawyers said the cop had acted reasonably because he believed Collie had a handgun and was moving to take aim at Flores. Flores had also told investigators that night that she thought she saw something in Collie’s hand. “In using reasonable force to stop an apparent deadly threat, Officer Barron violated none of Plaintiff’s constitutional or other rights and is entitled to qualified immunity,” Barron’s lawyers argued.
Collie had no gun. A boxcutter was found in the grass near where Collie went down, according to the police report. Collie said he always carried a boxcutter with him because it was necessary for his job. He adamantly denied that he was holding the boxcutter when he raised his hand to point. He said he believes Barron cited it as an excuse to cover up a mistake.
Barron’s request for immunity asserted that whether Collie was armed or not was irrelevant. “Merely arguing that in the end it must somehow be unreasonable to shoot an unarmed suspect is not enough” to let a lawsuit go forward, the request said.
Collie’s lawyers countered that Barron “created a threat in his mind that did not exist.” A forensic expert they hired to map the scene, capture images using a drone and analyze the dash-cam footage concluded that Collie was not holding an object, let alone pointing it at Flores, when he was shot.
EXCESSIVE AND UNREASONABLE?
In July 2017, McBryde granted Barron’s request for immunity. In his decision, he relied on a stringent 5th Circuit standard for finding that excessive force was used: not only that the plaintiff’s injury resulted from force that was “clearly excessive,” but also that the excessive force was “clearly unreasonable.”
As a Texas judge, McBryde supported his ruling that shooting Collie was reasonable by drawing on 5th Circuit precedents that elevate an officer’s perception of a threat as the key consideration in weighing an immunity claim. He cited a 2003 precedent that force is presumed to be reasonable when police perceive a threat, even if alternative courses of action were available.
Even if Collie had nothing in his hand and did not point at Flores, he had no right to a trial, McBryde said in his ruling, “because the test is whether Barron acted reasonably in light of what he perceived.”
McBryde declined to comment.
Collie fared no better with his appeal to the 5th Circuit. Noting that Collie “fit the description of one of the suspects,” the appeals court in 2018 agreed that Barron’s perception that night mattered most.
The appeals court cited its own precedents. One was a 2008 ruling, Ramirez v. Knoulton, which said that cops do not have to wait to act against a threat and that “courts should not second guess the timing of that realization.” Another was a 2016 ruling that singled out a Houston cop’s perception of an immediate threat as the most important consideration in granting immunity. In that case, the cop claimed he shot Ricardo Salazar-Limon in the back, paralyzing him, after Salazar reached for his waistband. Salazar was unarmed.
A spokesman for the 5th Circuit declined to comment for this article.
Manny Ramirez, president of the Fort Worth Police Officers Association, said the courts made the right decision to throw out Collie’s suit. Barron is “a good officer,” Ramirez added. “His work product speaks for itself.” The legal system, he said, must recognize the dangers officers face on the job.
Barron was moved to a special tactical unit of the Fort Worth police in 2018.
Plaintiffs and civil rights activists said the 5th Circuit is providing an easy out for cops who use excessive force because it is particularly receptive to the argument that they perceived a lethal threat.
Daniel Harawa, a lawyer affiliated with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, called this defense “How to get out of a civil lawsuit 101.” He said he fears that as this line of defense succeeds, “we almost incentivize police officers to reflexively say, ‘I saw him reaching, I saw an object.’ ”
MEANWHILE, IN CALIFORNIA
The cop who shot and killed Benny Herrera used the same defense as Barron. But that was in California, not Texas.
On the morning of Dec. 17, 2011, Herrera was visiting his former girlfriend, Hilda Ramirez. He spent time playing with her children and making them breakfast. Over the meal, Ramirez later told detectives, Herrera said he had a feeling something big was going to happen that day.
Around 2 p.m., he left for home. He returned just 15 minutes later, his demeanor changed — paranoid, pacing back and forth, his eyes glossy. Ramirez recognized the signs: Herrera battled substance abuse for much of his life. He had been in and out of prison, too, for armed robbery, drug possession and parole violations. Court records show that in two instances, girlfriends had called the cops because they feared for their safety after Herrera became agitated.
When Herrera saw Ramirez texting her new boyfriend, he punched her in the head, grabbed her cellphone and left. Ramirez called 911 to report what had happened. She told the operator that Herrera had not used a weapon and did not carry one. A dispatcher relayed to the responding officers that Herrera was not known to carry weapons.
Minutes later, Tustin police officers Brian Miali and Osvaldo Villarreal — in separate vehicles — found Herrera walking along El Camino Real where it runs alongside Interstate 5. A cigarette dangled from Herrera’s lips. It was a cold and cloudy afternoon, and he kept his right hand in the pocket of his black hoodie.
Dashboard camera video from the scene shows Herrera running away and then turning around and skipping backward as he veers into the middle of the street. The officers close in, trying to hem in Herrera between the two vehicles. Each cop drew his gun.
“Get your hand out of your pocket!” Villarreal shouted as his vehicle approached Herrera, who at that instant wheeled around toward Villarreal with his right arm flailing. Almost immediately, Villarreal fired his gun through the car’s open passenger side window.
Villarreal told investigators that he felt “trapped” when Herrera turned toward him and that he believed Herrera was armed and would shoot him. When Herrera “charged at me” and started to pull his hand out of his pocket, Villarreal told investigators, “I knew he had the drop on me, and as I came up, I fired twice.”
But Herrera was unarmed. A pack of cigarettes, a syringe, and several coins were recovered near his body. Toxicology tests found methamphetamine and tranquilizers in his blood.
After investigating the incident, the Orange County District Attorney’s Office concluded in a January 2013 report that Villarreal’s use of deadly force was reasonable because he thought Herrera was armed. It recommended no criminal charges.
Herrera’s family filed an excessive force lawsuit in federal district court in Santa Ana against Villarreal and the City of Tustin.
Villarreal quickly requested qualified immunity. Judge Josephine Staton denied the request. She cited a 9th Circuit ruling, Deorle v. Rutherford, that sets a higher bar for cops than the 5th Circuit precedents cited in Collie’s case. It says that “a simple statement by an officer that he fears for his safety or the safety of others is not enough; there must be objective factors to justify such a concern.”
Staton declined to comment.
Villarreal appealed, but in 2016, the 9th Circuit upheld the lower court’s decision. It cited the Deorle precedent and others to conclude that Herrera was not an immediate threat to the officers. Herrera did not try to flee, and Villarreal gave him no time to act upon the order to take his hand out of his pocket before shooting, the appeals court said.
The ruling also cited precedents that clarified when deadly force is justified, including one from 2005 that said a suspect’s involvement in a domestic incident does not necessarily make him an immediate threat to an officer.
A spokeswoman for the 9th Circuit declined to comment for this article.
The appellate court’s decision meant the excessive force claim could proceed. Soon, the plaintiffs faced a choice: continue to trial or accept a settlement with the city.
Elizabeth Landeros, a former girlfriend of Herrera and mother of one of his children, said she felt Villarreal should be held responsible for leaving her child without a father. But the family’s lawyers were wary that the jury would be persuaded by the defense’s arguments that Herrera was a dangerous man with a criminal history and a drug problem. The family ultimately agreed to accept a $1.4 million settlement, split among Herrera’s parents and his four children.
A spokesman for Tustin police said, “The litigation ended to the satisfaction of all parties,” and declined to comment further. Villarreal retired from the department and could not be reached.
‘LET'S BE HONEST’
Without the recompense he sought in his lawsuit, David Collie gets by on Social Security disability benefits and Medicaid. In early June, he moved to an assisted living facility. He still shares a bathroom, but now has his own living space. His mother, Pamela McCloud, whose house doesn’t have wheelchair access, got training as a home health aide so that if her son is ever able to move into his own place, she can care for him.
Collie has closely followed media coverage of the protests sparked by George Floyd’s death and the ensuing debate about police reform. “The part I like about it, as a Black man that experienced it and sees what’s going on, is now you have white people and people from different nationalities saying, ‘Yeah, let’s be honest about it.’ ”
About his own situation, he said that without his Christian faith, “I probably wouldn’t even want to be alive.” His faith has allowed him to forgive Barron, he said, “but he was wrong.”

Collie said he thinks “bad apples” may taint many police departments with racism and excessive force across the country, but in the main, he defends cops, including the Fort Worth police. “It’s an honorable profession,” he said.

KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban insurgents set off a truck bomb on Tuesday in an attack on Afghan army commandos, killing three people and wounding 41, the defence ministry said, despite steps towards peace talks with the U.S.-backed government.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast in the northern province of Balkh, saying on Twitter they had attacked the commandos.
The defence ministry said two members of the commando force were killed and six wounded, while the rest of the casualties were civilians.
The blast came as a Taliban delegation visited the Pakistani capital to discuss a peace process underpinned by an agreement between the Taliban and the United States on the withdrawal of U.S. forces in exchange for Taliban security guarantees and a promise to open power-sharing talks with the government.
But despite what many Afghans see as the best hope for peace since the latest phase of Afghanistan's war began in 2001, the level of violence has remained high.
Diplomats and officials say the violence is sapping the trust needed for talks. 
The government has asked repeatedly for a ceasefire before negotiations start in Qatar's capital of Doha, a request the Taliban have refused.
Diplomats say Pakistan, which has long had influence over different Afghan factions, including the Taliban, has in recent months been pushing for a reduction in violence.

It was not immediately clear what issues would be discussed in the talks between the Taliban and the Pakistanis in Islamabad.

China is trying to rebuild its hog herd after African swine fever killed millions of pigs in the country in 2018 and 2019.
There is no cure or approved vaccine anywhere in the world, but China is close to approving the first African swine fever vaccine and last week said it was expanding clinical trials on a promising candidate.
Illegally-produced vaccines have circulated in the market for months, however, and could complicate the introduction of an officially-approved product.
In May, the state-backed Legal Daily reported that police in Chongqing had arrested seven people found to be producing a fake African swine fever vaccine.
Beijing has previously cautioned against the use of illegal and fake vaccines and warned of strict punishment, but the new crackdown, begun on Monday, appears much more comprehensive.
Provincial authorities will carry out inspections at veterinary laboratories, drug producers and pig farmers for any evidence they could have developed or used an illegal vaccine.
Authorities must investigate veterinary laboratories used for research or commercial purposes and check any unlabelled vaccines and disease materials or reagents along with the records of experiments.
It also wants closer supervision of clinical trials and pilot production of vaccines to ensure there is no illegal transfer of the pilot product.
Provincial authorities will also inspect veterinary product manufacturers and pig breeders, checking immunisation records on farms and running tests on pigs to search for different strains of the swine fever virus.
Any strains with gene deletions could indicate a vaccine had been used and would be immediately investigated, they said.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 06:06AM ET</span>",Wild polio sufferers reflect as Africa set to be declared free of the disease,"By Alexis Akwagyiram and Angela Ukomadu
LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian Gbemisola Ijigbamigbe's right leg was virtually paralysed after she contracted wild polio aged 11 months. Now the 28-year-old leads an active life as a wheelchair basketball player and also enjoys swimming and kayaking. 
""Polio is not a death sentence,"" she told Reuters, smiling.
Thousands of people across Africa still live with the effects of the disease, but on Tuesday the World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to declare the region free of endemic wild polio, four years after the last case was recorded in Nigeria.
Health officials are set to announce that all 47 countries in the WHO's Africa region have eradicated the crippling viral disease that attacks the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours.
Children under five are the most vulnerable, but people can be fully protected with preventative vaccines. To keep the virus at bay, population immunisation coverage rates must be high and constant surveillance is crucial.
Globally, wild polio case numbers have been cut drastically due to national and regional immunisation for babies and children. The disease remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan, however.
""Until wild poliovirus is eradicated everywhere, it's still a risk everywhere,"" Michael Galway, a polio expert at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, told Reuters, urging continued vigilance.
""There's nothing that prevents the virus from making the route from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Africa,"" he said.
'INSIDE I WOULD CRY'
Ijigbamigbe, who is based in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos, looks back on a childhood that was blighted by the emotional pain of wearing over-sized clothes to hide her difficulty walking.
""I was... trying to mask my emotions so that whatever you say does not get to me. But inside... I would cry,"" she recalls, her pronounced limp hinting at her condition.
The WHO estimates that 1.8 million children have been saved from life-long paralysis from wild polio.
Yet despite Tuesday's expected announcement at a videoconferencing event, a vaccine-derived strain of the disease - which can infect people where there is only partial vaccination and results in the same symptoms as the wild form - continues to circulate in Africa.
""We must stay vigilant and keep up vaccination rates to avert a resurgence of the wild poliovirus and address the continued threat of the vaccine-derived polio,"" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.
Vaccine-derived poliovirus cases can occur when the weakened live virus in the oral polio vaccine passes among under-immunized populations and eventually changes to a form that can cause paralysis. 
The 16 countries in Africa affected by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks include Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia.
Usman Yusuf - a member of Nigeria's National Association of Polio Survivors who contracted the disease aged 3 - welcomed wild polio's eradication from Africa.
Speaking after refereeing a soccer game played by polio survivors sitting on wheeled boards and propelled by their arms, Yusuf said he looked forward to an end to all polio one day.

""We are affected. We don't expect our children and our younger ones to follow the same route.""

Posting a picture of herself with a backpack and pushing a bicycle, the Swedish 17-year-old tweeted: ""My gap year from school is over, and it feels so great to finally be back in school again!""
Thunberg, who sparked a global youth-led protest movement after striking outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, has spent the last year berating politicians about rising global temperatures and what she sees as their failure to live up to agreements enshrined in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.
Time Magazine's Person of the Year in 2019, Thunberg has spoken at the World Economic Forum in Davos and the COP25 climate summit in Madrid over the last 12 months, calling for urgent action to prevent a climate disaster. 
In a Reuters interview in July, Thunberg said people in power had practically given up on handing over a decent future to coming generations.
With Europe beginning to emerge from coronavirus lockdowns, there have been calls for the EU's recovery fund to be used to promote a transition to a ""green"" economy.
Meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week, Thunberg called on her to step out of her ""comfort zone"" and speed up action to fight the climate emergency.

“The police brought Anon to the station to read him the charges for his protests on Aug. 10, and will question him before bringing him to court to file for detention,” Police Lieutenant General Amphol Buarabporn told Reuters. 
The rights lawyer will be held along with another political activist, Panupong Jadnok, who was arrested on Monday during a protest against Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who first seized power in a 2014 coup.
Protesters vowed to move ahead with a planned demonstration on Sept. 19, the anniversary of a previous coup in 2006. 
Police said both Anon and Panupong face charges for violating article 116, which covers sedition, and for breaching coronavirus restrictions on public gatherings.
Anon, 36, has been at the forefront of a movement that has staged protests almost daily for the past month in the Southeast Asian country. He was the first to call openly for changes to King Maha Vajiralongkorn's role, breaking a longstanding taboo.
He has been arrested on similar charges twice before, and released on bail. 
Police have arrested student leaders, rappers and activists for participating in demonstrations, but neither Anon or any of the other protesters have been charged under Thailand’s ‘lese majeste’ law, which punishes criticism of the monarchy with up to 15 years in prison.
Thousands of protesters had joined the rally on Aug. 10 at a university on the outskirts of Bangkok, where protesters issued a 10-point plan for reform and also called for Prime Minister Prayuth to resign.
Challenges to the monarchy were extremely rare under Vajiralongkorn's father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016 after 70 years on the throne.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic returned to a United Nations court on Tuesday to appeal his 2017 conviction for genocide and crimes against humanity during the Yugoslav Wars.
Mladic is serving a life sentence after being found guilty of overseeing the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995 and attacking and murdering civilians during the 43-month siege of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo.
Trial judges ruled he was responsible for massacres of Bosnian Muslims and ""ethnic cleansing"" campaigns as part of a plan to forge a Greater Serbia out of parts of the former Yugoslavia, together with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Serb politician Slobodan Milosvic. He was the commander of Bosnian Serb forces during the 1992-95 war that was part of Yugoslavia's breakup. 
At the start of two days of hearings, Presiding Judge Prisca Nyambe said Mladic has put forward nine grounds of appeal, asking for acquittal or a retrial.
""The prosecution responds that Mr. Mladic's appeal should be rejected in its totality,"" she said in opening remarks.
Mladic, 77, appeared wearing a facemask which he removed after a few minutes. The proceedings are being broadcast by video due to the coronavirus pandemic. Mladic's lawyers have sought to delay the appeal, arguing that the former general is in poor health.
Mladic was convicted of 10 out of 11 charges at trial and prosecutors are seeking an additional genocide conviction.
Prosecutors say Mladic's sentence should be upheld and he should also have been convicted of the 11th charge, genocide against Bosniaks and Croats in five municipalities of Bosnia in 1992. 
Mladic's appeal is being held at a U.N. court in The Hague set up to hear appeals and remaining cases from the former Yugoslav Tribunal, which closed in 2017.
Mladic will be allowed to address the court for 10 minutes on Wednesday. Judges have yet to set a date for a decision, likely to be sometime in 2021.

His visit is part of a regional tour following an accord between Israel and the UAE this month to forge full relations, and comes as Israel and the United States push more Arab countries to follow.
""Happy to announce that we are on the FIRST official NONSTOP flight from Israel to Sudan!"" Pompeo said on Twitter.
Pompeo will meet Sudan's prime minister and the head of its ruling council during a brief stopover in Khartoum to discuss U.S. support for the civilian-led government and for ""deepening the Sudan-Israel relationship"", according to the State Department.
Sudan has been restoring its own ties with the United States following the ouster of former Islamist leader Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, and is pushing to be removed from the list of countries that Washington considers state sponsors of terrorism.
Asked if Pompeo would announce a breakthrough in Sudan like normalization of ties with Israel or a removal of U.S. sanctions, a U.S. official on board Pompeo's flight said: ""It's possible that more history will be made.""
The official said Sudan had offered the direct flight, dropping the requirement ""that such a flight make a cosmetic stop en route"".
Ties with Israel are a sensitive issue in Sudan, which was among the hardline Muslim foes of Israel under Bashir. 
In February, ruling council head Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Uganda, but cast doubt on any rapid normalisation of relations.
Sudan announced on Aug. 19 it had sacked its foreign ministry spokesman after he called the UAE decision to become the third Arab country to normalise relations with Israel ""a brave and bold step"".

YANGON (Reuters) - Humanitarian workers battling the novel coronavirus in Myanmar's Rakhine State have urged authorities to restore high-speed internet access to help tackle rising infections in an area where tens of thousands of people have been displaced. 
The region has seen the fastest spread of the coronavirus in Myanmar in recent months with more than 80 confirmed cases out of the country's total of 474.
Citing security, Myanmar has curbed internet access in large swathes of the area, where many people live in camps due to fighting between the army and ethnic minority insurgents.
Aid workers from three groups said the government should restore 4G internet access to help inform people about the virus.
""If they do not do it at this time, when information is essential, it will be recorded in history as a crime,"" said Zaw Zaw Tun, the secretary of one of the aid groups, the Rakhine Ethnic Congress.
The high-speed internet blackout, imposed in June last year, is due to be lifted this month and while the internet is working in some areas, in others there is only slower 2G service. 
A government spokesman did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.
Another humanitarian worker, Aung Than Tun, said the limited access was making it easier for misinformation and rumours about the coronavirus to spread.
Most recent infections have been in the state capital of Sittwe, where officials have imposed a stay-at-home order and a curfew.
Sittwe is also home to camps where about 100,000 Rohingya Muslims have been confined since an outbreak of violence in 2012. Rohingya are mostly denied citizenship and face strict curbs on freedom of movement and access to healthcare.
Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has said people of all faiths and ethnicities would be treated equally. 
Three more coronavirus cases were reported on the weekend in Mrauk U town in Rakhine where internet access is limited to 2G.
Local legislator Tun Thar Sein said the service was too patchy to ensure that people got health and news updates on the outbreak.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic is still expanding, but the rise in cases and deaths has slowed globally, except for southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean regions, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.
In its latest epidemiological update, issued on Monday night, it said that the Americas remains the hardest-hit region, accounting for half of newly reported cases and 62% of the 39,240 deaths worldwide in the past week. 
More than 23.65 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and 811,895​ have died, according to a Reuters tally on Tuesday.
""Over 1.7 million new COVID-19 cases and 39,000 new deaths were reported to WHO for the week ending 23 August, a 4% decrease in the number of cases and (a 12% decrease) in the number of deaths compared to the previous week,"" the WHO said.
Southeast Asia, the second most affected region, reported a jump accounting for 28% of new cases and 15% of deaths, it said. India continues to report the majority of cases, but the virus is also spreading rapidly in Nepal.
In WHO's eastern Mediterranean region, the number of reported cases rose by 4%, but the number of reported deaths has consistently dropped over the last six weeks, the WHO said. Lebanon, Tunisia and Jordan reported the highest increase in cases compared to the previous week.
The number of cases and deaths reported across Africa decreased by 8% and 11% respectively in the past week, ""primarily due to a decrease in cases reported in Algeria, Kenya, Ghana, Senegal and South Africa"", it said.
""In the European region, the number of cases reported has consistently increased over the last three weeks,"" it said. ""However, only a slight decrease (1%) was reported in the most recent week, and the number of deaths have continued to decrease across the region.""
In WHO's western Pacific region, the number of new cases dropped by 5%, driven by less spread in Japan, Australia, Singapore, China and Vietnam. South Korea reported an 180% jump in cases, ""mainly due to an increase in cases associated with religious gatherings"".

230,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>","What happens if Japan's Abe is incapacitated, or resigns?","By Linda Sieg and Kiyoshi Takenaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recent visits to hospital have raised concern whether he will be able to stay on as leader of the world's third-biggest economy until the Sept. 2021 end of his term as ruling party chief, and hence, premier.
Abe plans to hold a news conference on his health as soon as this week, domestic media said on Tuesday. He has been expected to reshuffle his cabinet and top ruling party posts next month.
An extra session of parliament is likely from October or later, media said, and an election for parliament's powerful lower house must be held by late October 2021.
Here are the procedures to be followed if Abe is incapacitated, or if he resigns.
ABE INCAPACITATED, ACTING PM STEPS IN 
Article 9 of Japan's cabinet law says that if a prime minister is prevented from discharging his functions, or the post is vacant, a minister of state he has designated in advance will temporarily perform the role.
In such a scenario, Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as finance minister, is first in line to step in for Abe, followed by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.
The move could be temporary, for example if Abe is hospitalised but expected to resume his duties afterwards.
The law sets no limit on how long the acting prime minister can stay. In April 2000, after prime minister Keizo Obuchi suffered a stroke and fell into a coma, Mikio Aoki, who was then the chief cabinet secretary, stepped in for a few days until a new party leader and premier was chosen. 
An acting prime minister cannot call a snap election but can oversee budget compilation, conclude treaties and order mobilisation of the military.
ABE RESIGNS, NEW LEADER ELECTED
If Abe announces an intention to resign, that would trigger an election within his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to replace him as its president, followed by a vote in parliament to elect a new prime minister.
Abe and his cabinet would continue to run the government until a new premier is elected, but could not adopt new policies.
The winner of the party election would then hold the post until the end of Abe's term in September 2021.
The new LDP president is virtually assured the premiership, since the party has a majority in parliament's lower house.
Usually, the party must announce the election for its leader a month in advance, and its MPs vote along with grassroots members.
In case of a sudden resignation, however, an extraordinary vote has to be called ""at the soonest date possible"" with participants narrowed to MPs and representatives of the party's local chapters. 

In 2007, for example, the LDP held a leadership election within 11 days of Abe's sudden resignation, which capped a troubled year in office as he battled poor health.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh held a ""silent protest"" on Tuesday to mark the third anniversary of clashes between Rohingya insurgents and Myanmar security forces that set off a huge movement into Bangladesh of people seeking safety.
More than 1 million Rohingya live in the world's largest refugee settlement in southern Bangladesh, with little prospect of returning to Myanmar, where they are mostly denied citizenship and other rights.
The refugees said that because of the novel coronavirus they would not hold a mass gathering to mark what they call ""Remembrance Day"". Authorities say 88 cases of the virus have been found in the camps and six people have died.
Three years ago, Rohingya insurgents raided 30 police posts and an army base in Myanmar's Rakhine State, killing at least 12 members of the security forces. 
The Myanmar military crackdown that followed forced 730,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh, joining more than 200,000 already there.
""We were forcibly driven out from our motherland to the world's largest refugee camp,"" Rohingya groups said in a statement.
The United Nations said the crackdown by the Myanmar military was carried out with genocidal intent. 
Myanmar denies genocide, saying its forces were engaged in a legitimate campaign against the Rohingya insurgents, and it was the insurgents who were responsible for most of the violence, including the torching of villages.
The refugees said Rohingya had faced ""hidden genocide"" in Myanmar for decades and they appealed to the United Nations and other organisations to declare what happened in 2017 genocide.
""Please stand with innocent Rohingya, and then hopefully we can return to our home,"" they said in the statement.

In some rare good news for the refugees, Bangladesh said on Monday it would soon lift a ban on high-speed mobile internet in the camps that authorities imposed last year citing concern that social media would be used to stir panic.

MANILA (Reuters) - Twin blasts that killed 15 people in the volatile southern Philippines could both have been suicide bombings, the military said on Tuesday, representing an escalation of violence that the army chief said may require martial law to be re-imposed. 
Monday's explosions on the southwest island of Jolo killed a mix of soldiers, police, civilians and at least one bomber and wounded 78 people, in the Philippines' deadliest attack since a double suicide bombing at a church in January 2019 left 20 people dead and wounded at least 100.
The first explosion on Monday, initially thought to be motorcycle bomb, killed six troops and six civilians, the army said. A policeman and a soldier were killed an hour later when a female suicide bomber approached the site of the first attack.
""The first explosion was possibly suicide bombing also,"" said Brigadier General William Gonzales, regional task force commander. ""But we can't identify the bomber because a body around the crater was mangled to pieces.""
There was no claim of responsibility for the attacks in the main town on Jolo, a stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf, a militant group linked to Islamic State and to at least six suicide bombings, which are a recent phenomenon in the Philippines. 
President Rodrigo Duterte has created a special infantry division in the Sulu archipelago to wipe out the Abu Sayyaf, which is notorious also for kidnappings and beheadings.
Duterte made no mention of the attack in remarks on Tuesday.
Army chief, Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana, said re-imposing martial law in Sulu could help isolate and track down the Abu Sayyaf network.
Martial law was lifted at the end of last year in the Mindanao region, which includes Sulu, two-and-a-half years after it was imposed to fight Islamic State-inspired militants who took over Marawi City. 
""The situation dictates, calls for it, with that recent incident with many casualties, to better control the population,"" Sobejana told reporters. 

""It is wise to declare martial law again.""

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Families of victims gunned down at two New Zealand mosques urged a judge to impose the toughest possible sentence, life without parole, on the gunman as he showed no remorse and appeared to smirk at one survivor during a sentencing hearing on Tuesday.
Mirwais Waziri, who was wounded during the 2019 attack at Christchurch's Al Noor mosque, put aside his prepared court statement and addressed white supremacist Brenton Tarrant directly, after seeing that he did not have ""any regrets, any shame in his eyes"".
""He does not regret anything,"" said Waziri in the High Court in Christchurch on day two of the sentencing hearings. 
""Today you are called terrorist and you proved to the world that us Muslims are not terrorists. I say to the people of New Zealand that terrorist do not have religion, race and colour,"" said Waziri,"" whose words drew applause from the public gallery. 
Nathan Smith, originally from Britain and a survivor of the Al Noor mosque shooting, also spoke directly to Tarrant who sat in grey prison clothes cornered by guards.
""When you get a free minute, which you will have plenty of. Funny, eh? Very funny. Maybe you should try to read the Koran. It's beautiful,"" he said, reacting to Tarrant's apparent smirk.
Tarrant, a 29-year-old Australian, is scheduled to be sentenced this week after pleading guilty to 51 murders, 40 attempted murders and one charge of committing a terrorist act during the 2019 shooting rampage in the city of Christchurch which he livestreamed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Prosecutors have told the court Tarrant carefully planned the attacks to cause maximum carnage by accumulating high-powered firearms and ammunition, training at rifle clubs and studying mosque layouts.
NO PAROLE
A murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison. The judge can impose a life term without parole, a sentence that has never been used in New Zealand.
Farisha Razak said in a recorded message that Tarrant did not deserve any leniency after killing her father, Ashraf Ali, who was visiting New Zealand from Fiji. 
""You made a game out of people's lives,"" said Razak. 
""You should not even be granted parole - ever.""
Zuhair Darwish, who lost his brother Kamel, said Tarrant should receive the harshest possible sentence.
""I know in New Zealand law they have removed the death penalty for humans, but unfortunately he's not a human,"" Darwish said. 
The second day of a multi-day sentencing hearing was dedicated to allowing survivors and family members of victims to address the court, in person and via video.
Tarrant, who is representing himself, will be allowed to speak at some point during the hearings, although Judge Cameron Mander has powers to ensure the High Court is not used as a platform for extremist ideology. 
While most of Tarrant's victims were at Al Noor mosque, he killed seven people at the Linwood mosque, before being detained en route to a third.
The daughter of a woman killed in the Linwood mosque challenged Tarrant to use his life in prison to consider the beauty of the diversity and freedom he sought to destroy.
""While I have pity for your mum, I have no emotion for you. You are nothing,"" said Angela Armstrong, daughter of 65-year-old victim Linda Armstrong.
""While he will remain trapped in a cage my mum is free. I therefore challenge Tarrant to use his remaining lifetime to consider the beauty and life to be found in diversity and freedom that he sought to distort and destroy."" 
Kyron Gosse, nephew of Linda Armstrong, said the shooter had come to New Zealand as a guest, and used that privilege to destroy a family that had lived here for seven generations. 
""Filled with his own racist agenda this coward hid behind his big powerful guns and shot little old Linda from afar,"" said Gosse.
Tarrant ""stole our nation's innocence"", said Gosse. New Zealand had been relatively free from major gun violence until the country's worst mass shooting.
Live reporting from the courtroom was banned, and other restrictions were put in place on what the media could report.
The hearings were adjourned until Wednesday morning.

SEOUL (Reuters) - This time last year Yoon Seok-min, his wife Kim Hyo-jung and their two children were holidaying in the Philippines, Vietnam and Guam. A trip to Hawaii was on the cards for this summer. 
Instead, as the global coronavirus pandemic has stymied overseas travel, the family, like other South Koreans, has turned to a new and extreme form of staycation: transforming their home into their favourite vacation spots.
Now, Kim and Yoon's five-bedroom apartment in Yongin city, south of Seoul, is decked out with potted palms and rattan furniture, bringing the breezy feel of the tropics indoors.
There are even different locales - the couple's bedroom is meant to resemble a Bali resort, while the living room has been designed on the lines of Hawaii.
""Since we can't travel abroad for some time because of the coronavirus, we tried to bring those vacation spots to our home,"" Kim said. 
Yoon and Kim's elaborate home makeover cost them at least 80 million won ($67,464). The couple runs a furniture business, but they are not alone in investing in their home, as social distancing forces people indoors.
Hanssem Co Ltd, South Korea's largest home furnishing company, said that the number of houses they have refurbished in the second quarter of 2020 tripled from a year earlier, leading to a 172% jump in its consolidated operating profit.
HOME-CAMPING WITH VIRTUAL CAMPFIRE
Other couples considering extreme staycation ideas need not look so far afield for inspiration. 
""Home-camping"", where people set up camping gear and barbecue at home just as they would in the woods or on the beach, has also become popular in South Korea. 
A recent spike in coronavirus cases and a monsoon that has lasted nearly two months, the country's longest on record, have spurred Che Min-hee and her husband Lee Seung-yoon to convert their Seoul flat into an indoor campsite. 
They're now on their second weekend home-camping trip. With folding chairs, picnicware and at least 15 different types of twinkling lanterns, the couple settled in on a rainy Saturday evening to enjoy cooking gambas al ajillo, a Spanish garlic shrimp dish, and pasta on a portable stove. 
A crackling campfire video streaming behind them on the television gave the scene an atmosphere of authenticity.
""We were supposed to go on a week-long trip to New York this summer, which we cancelled due to the prolonged coronavirus outbreak,"" said Che. ""Instead we spent that money on camping gear, which cost us around 10 million won ($8,405).""
Che and Lee had to wait two to three months to purchase their tents, folding table and stove, as South Koreans, normally among the top ten spenders on tourism globally according to the World Bank, splurged on equipment to make up for missed overseas trips.
Sales of camping equipment from April to mid-July jumped 51.6% year-on-year, according to South Korea's retail giant E-Mart Inc.
South Korea called on people on Monday to avoid leaving home and to cancel any unnecessary trips, as it considers further tightening social distancing rules.
Lee says he fears these moves mean home-camping is the safest summer getaway this year.
The couple's 7-year-old son Lee Ji-sung is not complaining. 
""My friends seem to be just playing games, but it's really nice that our family is doing something special,"" Ji-sung said.

""I think it would also be good if we can draw trees on the wall.""

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - Wisconsin's governor called out the National Guard on Monday, and police in the city of Kenosha skirmished with protesters during a second night of unrest over the wounding of a Black man shot in the back by police as his three children looked on.
Ordering Guard troops deployed to Kenosha, on the shore of Lake Michigan 40 miles (65 km) south of Milwaukee, Governor Tony Evers also decried what he branded excessive force in the shooting of Jacob Blake, and called for a special legislative session to consider police reforms.
About an hour later on Monday afternoon, Kenosha's mayor faced dozens of angry, jeering protesters demanding the arrest of officers involved in Sunday's shooting. Some in the group tried to force their way into the municipal public-safety building adjacent to the courthouse when the mayor, John Antaramian, retreated from the heckling crowd.
The door was broken from its hinges, but police in riot gear drove the demonstrators back by dousing some with pepper spray.
Shortly after nightfall, scores of protesters defying a dusk-to-dawn curfew massed outside the courthouse, shouting and tossing water bottles at a line of sheriff's deputies, who responded with volleys of tear gas and pepper balls. 
A short time later, several truckloads of National Guard troops were seen rolling into the center of town about a block away. Local media reported that exit ramps leading into the city from an Interstate-94 had been closed to traffic.
Blake, 29, was listed in stable condition following surgery, his father told news media on Monday. His three young sons witnessed the shooting from just a few feet away while sitting in their car, according to the family attorney, Ben Crump.
Video of the encounter taken by an onlooker showed Blake walking toward the driver's side of a gray SUV followed by two officers with their guns drawn at his back. Seven gunshots are then heard as Blake, who appears unarmed, opens the car door and a woman nearby jumps up and down in disbelief. 
It was unknown whether the officers saw something inside the vehicle that prompted them to shoot Blake. It was also not clear whether one or both officers opened fire.
Crowds soon gathered at the scene, and some demonstrators set fires and threw bricks and Molotov cocktails at police, leading authorities to close public buildings in the area.
GOVERNOR CALLS FOR TROOPS, EMPATHY
Evers, a Democrat, said he ordered Guard troops to Kenosha at the request of local officials to help maintain order after activists said they were organizing further demonstrations for Monday night.
He also said police had shown a pattern of ""excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites.""
""We must rise to this movement and this moment and meet it with our empathy, our humanity and a fierce commitment to disrupt the cycle of systemic racism and bias that devastates Black families and communities,"" Evers said in a public address. 
Pete Deates, president of the city's police union, accused the governor of rushing to judgment, calling Evers' comments ""wholly irresponsible.""
The shooting occurred three months after the May 25 death of a Black man in Minneapolis, George Floyd, who was pinned to the street under the knee of a white police officer, sparking nationwide protests against police brutality and racism within the U.S. criminal justice system.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democrat challenging Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, called for the officers involved in Kenosha to be held accountable.
""The nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force,"" Biden said in a statement. ""These shots pierce the soul of our nation.""
The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin denounced the National Guard deployment as an unnecessary and ""militarized"" response to legitimate protests that ""only serves to exacerbate tensions."" 
Sunday's shooting occurred as officers were responding to what they termed a ""domestic incident."" Police immediately took the victim to a hospital, according to a police statement. Authorities gave no further explanation of what led to the shooting.
Attorney Crump, who also has represented Floyd's family, said in a statement that Blake had been trying to de-escalate a domestic incident when the officers first shot him with a stun gun.
""As he was walking away to check on his children, police fired their weapons several times into his back at point-blank range,"" Crump said.

The officers involved were placed on administrative leave while the investigation is underway, the Wisconsin Department of Justice said on Monday.

Tong Ying-kit, 23, had carried a sign reading ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,"" and drove his motorbike into police officers, knocking several down on a narrow street before falling over and getting arrested, police have said.The government of the Asian financial hub has said the protest slogan connotes separatism or subversion under the new law, fuelling concern over freedom of expression in the former British colony.
Tong was among more than 300 demonstrators against the new law who were arrested by police on July 1, less than 24 hours after it was unveiled and took effect.
He was denied bail last month, with the case adjourned to Oct. 6 as prosecutors sought more time to collect evidence.
Tong then sought release from detention via a habeas corpus, which determines whether a detention is lawful, but that application was rejected on Friday. 
He again sought bail on Tuesday but his application was rejected by High Court Judge Alex Lee. 
Hong Kong's common law has traditionally allowed defendants to seek release unless prosecutors can show lawful grounds for their detention. The burden is now placed on the defendant, under the new law drafted by Beijing, where the judiciary is controlled by the Communist Party.
The national security law has drawn wide criticism in the West for jeopardising basic rights and freedoms the special administrative region was promised when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Supporters of the law, which has jail terms for up to life for anything China considers to be secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces, say it would bring stability after a year of pro-democracy and anti-China unrest.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's most populous state said on Tuesday it will compel owners to clear their land of flammable material as it endorsed 76 recommendations from an enquiry into deadly bushfires.
Fires razed more than 11 million hectares (37 million acres) of bushland across Australia's southeast early this year, killing at least 33 people and billions of native animals, a disaster that Prime Minister Scott Morrison called Australia's ""black summer"".
Amid public anger, the federal and state governments commissioned independent enquiries.
New South Wales (NSW), which recorded the highest death toll from the fires at 25, on Tuesday became the first to release findings. Its Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott said the state government had accepted all recommendations.
Among recommendations, the state will require landowners to clear or burn flammable material - usually dried brush and dead leaves - for firefighters to be trained in treating wild animals and the creation of a fund to develop technology to detect fires.
""These 76 recommendations are wide-ranging but what they also show is that there is no silver bullet. The last summer was caused by a crippling drought,"" Elliott told reporters in Canberra.
The issue of hazard reduction, however, is the most contentious as questions arise about the cause of the fires.
Morrison, a supporter of the fossil fuel industry, this year said removing flammable material was as ""important as emissions reduction and I think many would argue even more so"", a stance rejected by several former firefighting chiefs. 
Environmental groups said Australia - one of the world's biggest carbon emitters on a per capital basis - must reduce its greenhouse emissions, amid forecasts for more frequent and severe droughts as the climate changes.

Broadcaster TV Tokyo, citing a government source, said on Tuesday that the press conference could be held as early as this week to give an update on Abe's health, as well as additional COVID-19 measures.

Asked about the plans for a media conference during a regular press briefing on Tuesday, government spokesman Yoshihide Suga referred to Abe's comments on the previous day without elaborating further.

The five storey building near a slum district in Mahad, which housed roughly 200 residents, caved in on Monday evening. 
""One resident was dead and at least 30 were still trapped,"" said Bharatshet Maruti Gogawale, a local lawmaker in Mahad situated about 165 km (100 miles) south of Mumbai.
The building, which comprised of 47 flats, fell almost like a pack of cards, said a police official at the disaster site.
Local residents and police combed through tin sheets, metal rods and other wreckage in a desperate search for survivors as ambulances rushed injured to nearby hospitals amid heavy monsoon rains and fears of Covid-19 infections.
The cause of the accident was not clear. But building collapses are common in India, usually due to shoddy construction, substandard materials and disregard of regulations.
Every year, heavy downpours during the June to September monsoon season bring down rain-sodden small and large structures deemed too dangerous to live in.

More than 1,200 people were killed in 1,161 building collapses across India in 2017, according to latest data from the National Crime Records Bureau.

(Reuters) - More dry-lightning storms hit California on Monday after sparking 625 fires last week as authorities warned the state was trapped in a ""megafire era"" triggered by climate change. 
The worst of the wildfires, including the second and third largest in California history, burned in the San Francisco Bay Area with roughly 240,000 people under evacuation orders or warnings across the state.
Much of Northern California, including the Sierra Nevada Mountains and coast, was under a ""red flag"" alert for dry lightning and high winds, but the Bay Area got a reprieve as storms skipped the region of around 8 million, the National Weather Service reported. 
Close to 300 lightning strikes sparked 10 blazes overnight and more ""sleeper fires"" were likely burning undiscovered in areas shrouded by dense smoke, Governor Gavin Newsom said.
One huge blaze blackened ancient coastal redwood forests south of San Francisco that have never seen fire due to usually high relative humidity levels, Newsom said. 
""We are in a different climate and we are dealing with different climate conditions that are precipitating fires the likes of which we have not seen in modern recorded history,"" Newsom told a news briefing.
The wildfires, ignited by over 13,000 lightning strikes from dry thunderstorms across Northern and Central California since Aug. 15, have killed at least seven people and destroyed over 1,200 homes and other structures. 
""We are essentially living in a megafire era,"" said Cal Fire Santa Clara Unit Chief Jake Hess (NYSE:HES) after California suffered four of the five largest wildfires in its history during the last three years. 
Evacuees returned to homes and vineyards torched by the LNU Lightning Complex wildfire, the second largest in state history, raging across Napa, Sonoma, Lake, Yolo and Solano counties.
""Nothing's left, but we're safe,"" said a man, who did not give his name in an online video showing everything but his patio furniture destroyed at his house near Vacaville. 
Smoke from fires that have burned over 1.2 million acres (485,620 hectares), an area more than three times larger than Los Angeles, created unhealthy conditions for much of Northern California and drifted as far as Kansas.
Firefighters gained 22% containment of the LNU fire, but to the south, the SCU Lightning Complex fire was nearly as large and only 10% contained. Firefighters threw most of their resources at its west flank burning less than 10 miles from downtown San Jose. 
""This fire is by far a long ways away from being done,"" said Cal Fire incident commander Jeff Ike of the blaze affecting seven counties.
With lower temperatures, clouds gathered over coastal forest east of San Jose, helping firefighters achieve 13% containment on the CZU Lightning Complex fire. Some Santa Clara county residents saw the sun after 10 days of dense smoke.
""Omg!!! The sun!!! The sun!!! The sun!!! Clouds and our shadows too. Oh how we've missed you in California,"" tweeted Shana Anderson-Nute, a marketing agent from Sunnyvale.

Over 14,000 firefighters were on the wildfires, with 91 fire crews traveling from seven states and National Guard troops arriving from four states, Newsom said.

241,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>","China Mengniu, Kirin Scrap Australia Deal Over Political Tension","(Bloomberg) -- China Mengniu Dairy Co. and Kirin Holdings Co. terminated their agreement for the sale of the Japanese company’s Australian beverage unit amid increasingly strained relations between Canberra and Beijing.
The announcement comes just days after the Australian Financial Review reported that Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was planning to block the deal, despite Foreign Investment Review Board advice that it should be approved. The government has been tightening restrictions on foreign takeovers.
The companies reached a deal last year for the Chinese dairy giant to buy Kirin’s Lion Dairy & Drinks business for about 45.6 billion yen ($430 million). The companies said in separate statements Tuesday that they were ending the agreement as it hadn’t received regulatory approval.
Strained Ties
The scrapped deal is being viewed in local media through the prism of strained diplomatic ties between Australia and China. Relations between the two countries have been fraught since the government in Canberra barred Huawei Technologies Co. from participating in Australia’s 5G network. China also responded angrily after Australia’s push for an independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak.
China has started an anti-dumping investigation into Australian wine, halted some beef imports and placed tariffs on Australia’s barley exports after the conclusion of an earlier anti-dumping probe. It has also cautioned its citizens against studying in or holidaying in Australia.
The collapse of the Kirin deal shows a reversal of sentiment from a year ago, when Mengniu won approval to buy organic infant formula maker Bellamy’s Australia Ltd. for A$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion). The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission said in February that it wasn’t opposed to the Kirin deal.
Australia announced on March 29 that due to the national security impacts of the coronavirus pandemic it would tighten restrictions on foreign takeovers, with all deals needing government approval, regardless of size.
On June 5, Scott Morrison’s government announced it would seek to implement permanent tougher screening measures on foreign investors seeking to buy sensitive assets from Jan. 1. Yet to be legislated, the changes would see telecommunications, energy, technology and defense-manufacturing companies be included in the zero-dollar threshold for screening.
Tougher Screening
The changes will include a new national security test and give the treasurer last-resort powers to force asset sales.
Australia isn’t alone in ramping up its foreign investment screening -- in recent years, economies including the U.S., Japan and the European Union have toughened their own laws to protect national security.
When asked on Aug. 20 about the Australian Financial Review article, Frydenberg said “the government does not comment on the details of foreign investment screening arrangements as they apply, or could apply, to particular cases.”
Mengniu has been eyeing overseas acquisitions as China’s appetite for milk grows with its middle class. At the same time, China has been seeking to boost the industry and restore confidence after a milk scandal in 2008 killed six children and poisoned 300,000 others.
Kirin shares were little changed in early trading in Tokyo on Tuesday.
“Although this was an unfortunate outcome, we’ll continue to discuss the best potential scenario for Lion,” a Kirin spokesman said.

242,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 09:21PM ET</span>",Long delays at U.S.-Mexico border crossings after new travel restrictions,"By Jose Luis Gonzalez
CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico - Americans who regularly cross the border from Mexico reported long wait times to re-enter the United States on Monday after U.S. officials imposed new COVID-19-related restrictions on cross-border travel by U.S. citizens and permanent residents.
The government closed lanes at select ports of entry on the border and began conducting more secondary checks to limit non-essential travel and slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) representative said on Friday.
According to CBP data, wait times at some border crossings have doubled or tripled. Many crossing points now have only one or two lanes of traffic open. On Monday, border-crossers reported wait times of up to 5-6 hours.
The U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, said ""substantial delays"" over the weekend were due to border agents focusing on ""essential travel,"" and said many people were crossing for other reasons such as shopping, dining and visiting families. 
""Such irresponsible behavior is exacerbating the health crisis,"" he said on Twitter.
Jess Herr, 30, a U.S. citizen who lives in the Mexican border city of Tijuana and works at a restaurant in San Diego in southern California, said she usually wakes up at 4 a.m. and crosses by car in about an hour to make her shift. When she saw the long line of cars on Monday, she decided to cross by foot, although she still had to wait five hours to cross the border.
At the Cordoba bridge joining the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez with El Paso in Texas, only two lanes were open to motorists. Border-crossers who usually waited about 45 minutes told Reuters they had waited more than three hours to cross, and some were late for work. 
Melissa Reyes, general manager for Border Partners, a nonprofit organization, said she had waited 4-1/2 hours to cross the border back into the United States over the weekend after going to Puerto Palomas in Mexico to do some shopping. Normally the wait time would be 15-20 minutes.
The new restrictions announced last week would prove challenging for people whose lives span the border, she said. ""It's gonna be pretty devastating,"" she said.
The U.S.-Mexican border is the world's busiest land border.
Before coronavirus restrictions at the border began in March, over 950,000 people entered the United States from Mexico on foot or in cars on a typical day. 
President Donald Trump has implemented a series of sweeping policies to curb legal and illegal immigration in recent months, saying the moves are necessary to limit the spread of the coronavirus or preserve jobs for American workers.

In March, the United States, Mexico and Canada agreed to bar non-essential travel across their shared borders, but the restrictions still allowed U.S. citizens and permanent residents to return to the United States.

243,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 09:20PM ET</span>",Rohingya politicians excluded from Myanmar election,"By Shoon Naing
YANGON (Reuters) - Aspiring politician Abdul Rasheed was born in Myanmar and is one of the very few members of the Rohingya Muslim minority to have Myanmar citizenship.
His father was a civil servant. But when the country goes to the polls in November, the businessman will not be able to stand as a candidate because officials accuse him of having foreign roots.
Rasheed is among at least a dozen Myanmar citizens from the Rohingya Muslim minority who have applied to be candidates in the Nov. 8 general election, hoping to get into politics under the newly democratic government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
Six of them have been rejected after officials said they failed to prove their parents were citizens at the time of their birth, a requirement under the election law. 
The election is another important test for Myanmar as it makes a transition away from military rule but rights groups say the disqualification of Rohingya candidates demonstrates the limits of reform.
""Everyone in Myanmar, regardless of their ethnicity or religion, must have the same opportunity to contest in elections,"" said Tun Khin, head of the Burma Rohingya Organization U.K, urging international donors to halt funding to the electoral agency.
In his apartment in Yangon, Rasheed leafed through reams of identity cards and letters.
""We have all these documents that the government issued, and they don't accept the fact that my parents are citizens. I feel bad about that and concerned,"" he said.
Myanmar does not recognise the term Rohingya or the community as an indigenous ethnic group.
Instead, they are derided as ""Bengalis"", implying they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite tracing their history in Myanmar's Rakhine State back for centuries.
Successive military governments that ruled Myanmar stripped the Rohingya of identity documents, leaving many with no proof of their origins.
More than 730,000 fled from Myanmar in 2017 after a military crackdown the United Nations said was carried out with genocidal intent. Myanmar denies genocide, saying its security forces were engaged in a legitimate campaign against Rohingya insurgents.
Several hundred thousand Rohingya who remain in Myanmar are mostly confined to camps and villages and subjected to curbs on movement and access to healthcare.
Monywa Aung Shin, a senior official from Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, said the electoral organisations that rejected the candidates were just following the law.
""Whether Bengali or not, foreigners and non-ethnic people are not allowed to run in the election,” he said.
'NO VOTER LIST'
Tin Hlaing, chairwoman of the Rakhine State election commission that rejected Rasheed’s application, said it was “certain” his parents were not citizens at the time he was born.
In his apartment, Rasheed held up the documents held by both his parents, which he said once sufficed as proof of citizenship. The cards were withdrawn in the 1990s when many Rohingya found such cards replaced with temporary ""white cards"".
In 2015, President Thein Sein announced the white cards would also be nullified, stripping Rohingya of the right to vote in 2015 polls that brought Suu Kyi to power.
While excluded from voting or standing in that election, many Rohingya put their faith in the longtime democracy leader’s party.
“We can understand the previous situation, that previous governments backed up by the military did not follow the democratic norms,"" said Kyaw Soe Aung, the general secretary from Democracy and Human Rights party (DHRP), one of three Rohingya parties in Myanmar.
""But it is difficult to understand that Aung San Suu Kyi and her democratic government would do the same.""
The party chairman, Kyaw Min, 72, was also rejected this week, despite winning a seat in a 1990 election, that was nullified by the former military government, and spending years in prison along with other democracy activists.
Abu Tahay, an independent Rohingya candidate who was also barred from the polls, said the exclusion of Rohingya people from the election - as candidates and voters - meant they would feel thwarted in trying to reach their goals of securing citizenship and living in ""peaceful coexistence"" with all citizens.
""They don't have any hope for their future,” he said.
While voter lists have been posted across the country, none has appeared at the camps outside the Rakhine state capital of Sittwe, where about 100,000 Rohingya are confined, community elder Kyaw Hla Aung told Reuters by telephone.
""In 2015, about 200 people appeared on the voter list but this time, there is no voter list,"" he told Reuters by phone.
Aye Win, one of the six Rohingya who have been approved to stand in the election, said there was little hope of victory unless many more Rohingya were granted citizenship ahead of the vote.

""If not, the situation is not good,” he said.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's prime minister-designate Hichem Mechichi announced on Monday a cabinet of independent technocrats without parties, seeking to distance the government from political conflicts and focus on reviving the ailing economy.
Mechichi, 46, is an independent, who was interior minister in the government of Elyes Fakhfakh. Tunisian President Kais Saied last month appointed Mechichi the new prime minister after Fakhfakh resigned over allegations of a conflict of interest.
Under plans to revamp the government and revive the economy, Mechichi gathered the ministries of finance, investment and economy into a single department led by liberal economist Ali Kooli, CEO of Arab Banking Corporation (ABC Bank) in Tunisia.
Mechichi needs to win a confidence vote in parliament in the next few days or face the dissolution of parliament by the president and another election, deepening instability. 
Authorities have been struggling to defuse constant protests over widespread unemployment, lack of investment for development and poor health, electricity and water services.
Western countries have hailed Tunisia for its comparatively successful transition to democracy since the 2011 revolution that ended decades of autocratic rule.
Many Tunisians have grown frustrated since then over economic stagnation, a decline in living standards and decay in public services while political parties often seem more focused on staying in office instead of tackling problems.
Mechichi said earlier this month his government would focus on rescuing public finances and easing social hardships, saying that while political turmoil had dragged out, ""some Tunisians have not found drinking water"".

Tunisia's tourism-dependent economy shrank 21.6 pct in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the same period last year, due to the coronavirus crisis.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia will enter a period of ""selective"" quarantine when its five months of national coronavirus lockdown ends at the close of August, President Ivan Duque said on Monday, and will be part of Johnson & Johnson vaccine trials.
Restrictions on events and large crowds will continue during September while the government evaluates the spread of the virus, Duque said, as more economic reactivation with safety protocols moves ahead.
""On Sept. 1 a new phase begins where we change the concept of preventative obligatory isolation with a large number of exceptions to a concept of selective isolation, of distancing, of individual responsibility,"" Duque said during his nightly television broadcast.
Confirmed and suspected coronavirus patients should still isolate, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz said during the broadcast.
The Andean country will also participate in phase three vaccine trials with Johnson & Johnson, Duque said.
""Colombia today has signed a deal with (Johnson & Johnson) to carry out tests for phase three in the investigation of their vaccine.""
The trial will include 60,000 healthy volunteers worldwide between the ages of 18 and 60 who will receive a single dose of the vaccine, the health ministry said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the capital Bogota will end a strict coronavirus quarantine in seven of its neighborhoods four days earlier than planned because occupation rates in intensive care units (ICUs) have fallen, the mayor said.
The capital - home to more than a third of the country's more than 550,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases - has held several rounds of strict lockdowns by neighborhood even as national quarantine restrictions have loosened.
The most recent round had been set to last until Aug. 30, but will end on Wednesday.
""This Wednesday at midnight all the quarantines by neighborhood will completely end,"" mayor Claudia Lopez said during a virtual press conference.
Occupation of ICUs peaked at 93.2% near the end of July. The units were 77.6% occupied as of Sunday.

More than 17,600 people in Colombia have died from COVID-19.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Business partner of Falwells says he had long affair with evangelical power couple,"By Aram Roston
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a claim likely to intensify the controversy surrounding one of the most influential figures in the American Christian conservative movement, a business partner of Jerry Falwell Jr has come forward to say he had a years-long sexual relationship involving Falwell's wife and the evangelical leader.
Giancarlo Granda says he was 20 when he met Jerry and Becki Falwell while working as a pool attendant at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel in March 2012. Starting that month and continuing into 2018, Granda told Reuters that the relationship involved him having sex with Becki Falwell while Jerry Falwell looked on.
Granda showed Reuters emails, text messages and other evidence that he says demonstrate the sexual nature of his relationship with the couple, who have been married since 1987. “Becki and I developed an intimate relationship and Jerry enjoyed watching from the corner of the room,” Granda said in an interview. Now 29, he described the liaisons as frequent – “multiple times per year” – and said the encounters took place at hotels in Miami and New York, and at the Falwells’ home in Virginia. 
His friendship with the Falwells eventually soured, Granda told Reuters, in part because he wanted to dissolve his ties with the couple and fell into a business dispute with them.
Granda first emerged as a figure in the Falwells’ circle two years ago, when BuzzFeed News reported that the couple had befriended Granda and gone into business with him, buying a Miami Beach youth hostel in 2013. At the time of the BuzzFeed article, a representative of the Falwell family said Granda was “offered a share” in Alton Hostel LLC because Granda lived in Miami and would act as a manager of the youth hostel. Corporate records show that Granda currently has a stake in that venture.
Becki Falwell did not respond to emails or phone and text messages from Reuters. After Reuters presented its initial reporting early last week to the Falwells, a lawyer for Jerry Falwell, Michael Bowe, said the evangelical leader “categorically denies everything you indicated you intend to publish about him.” 
On Sunday night, however, as Reuters was preparing to publish this article, Jerry Falwell issued a statement to the Washington Examiner in which he said that his wife had had an affair with Granda and that Granda had been trying to extort money from the couple over the matter. Granda denies any such intent, saying he was seeking to negotiate a buyout from a business arrangement he says he had with the couple.
Falwell’s statement Sunday to the Examiner said nothing about Granda’s account alleging that the evangelical leader had his own role in the affair, and Falwell didn’t address questions from Reuters about it. In the statement quoted by the Examiner, Falwell said that “Becki had an inappropriate personal relationship with this person, something in which I was not involved.”
Several hours after the Reuters article appeared, the Washington Post and other U.S. media reported that Falwell had stepped down as head of Liberty University, the Christian school he has run since 2007. But later Monday, Falwell disputed those accounts. “I have not resigned,” he told Politico. “I will be on indefinite leave.”
Liberty and Falwell did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on his status.
Falwell, 58, had taken an indefinite leave of absence earlier this month from Liberty. That step, announced in a terse statement from the school’s board of trustees, came days after Falwell posted, then deleted, an Instagram photo of himself with his pants unzipped, standing with his arm around a young woman whose pants were also partly undone. Falwell later told a local radio station that the picture was meant as a good-natured joke.
A MAJOR FORCE IN U.S. POLITICS
If Falwell does step down, his departure from that high-profile perch would represent a remarkable fall from grace for a man who has been a potent force in American conservative politics. His surprise 2016 endorsement of Donald Trump helped the twice-divorced New Yorker win the Republican nomination for president.
Becki Falwell, 53, is a political figure in her own right. She served on the advisory board of the group Women for Trump, which advocates for the president’s reelection campaign. She also spoke as part of a panel with her husband and Donald Trump Jr at last year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, the signature annual gathering of conservatives. Jerry Falwell and others refer to her as “the first lady of Liberty University.”
The university, based in Lynchburg, Virginia, was founded in 1971 by Falwell’s televangelist father, the Rev. Jerry Falwell. The younger Falwell took over in 2007. Today, the university boasts an online and on-campus enrollment that exceeds 100,000 students and holds those who attend to an exacting honor code. “Sexual relations outside of a biblically ordained marriage between a natural-born man and a natural-born woman are not permissible at Liberty University,” the code reads.
The material Granda showed Reuters includes screenshots from what Granda said was a FaceTime conversation he had with the Falwells in 2019. During that call, Granda said, Becki was naked as the two discussed their relationship while Jerry peeked from behind a door. Reuters was able to verify Granda’s description of the screenshots. 
Granda also shared an audio recording that he says captures a conversation he had with the Falwells in 2018. In it, Becki complained about Granda describing his relationships with other people: “He’s like telling me every time he hooks up with people. Like I don’t have feelings or something.” Jerry then chimed in: “You’re going to make her jealous.” “I’m not trying to do that,” Granda replied. 
Earlier texts show a friendly and romantic dynamic between Granda and Becki Falwell. One 2012 text message, which Granda said came from Becki, read in part: “Right now I am just missing you like crazy .... Have you had this effect on all of your lady friends?” 
Other more recent text messages, such as an exchange from this June that Granda provided to Reuters, show Granda growing angry and frustrated as his relationship with the Falwells frayed. 
“Since you’re okay with ruining my life, I am going to take the kamikaze route,” Granda wrote to Jerry Falwell. “It really is a shame because I wanted to reach a peaceful resolution and just move on with our lives but if conflict is what you want, then so be it.”
In the same message string, Falwell replied: “You should by now understand that I will not be extorted. I have always treated you fairly and been restrained in response to your threats because I did not wish to ruin your life. Going forward, stop contacting me and my family.”
Granda said that while he entered into the sexual relationship with the Falwells willingly, today he feels the couple preyed upon him. “Whether it was immaturity, naïveté, instability, or a combination thereof, it was this ‘mindset’ that the Falwells likely detected in deciding that I was the ideal target for their sexual escapades,” Granda said. 

In a statement released Friday, before news of the relationship with Granda became public, Liberty University said its “decision whether or not to retain Falwell as president has not yet been made.” Its board of trustees, the statement read, “requested prayer and patience as they seek the Lord’s will and also seek additional information for assessment.”

Tehran said Grossi's visit would ""strengthen ties and build trust"" between Tehran and the IAEA. However, in a statement on Saturday, Grossi said he would address ""the outstanding questions, in particular, the issue of the access"".
""As long as the IAEA moves based on impartiality, independence and distances itself from political pressure of another countries, there will be no problems between the IAEA and Tehran,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh told reporters, state TV reported.

Grossi's visit comes after Washington's last week pushed at the U.N. Security Council to reimpose international sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.
However, Iranian authorities said Grossi's visit was not related to the U.S. move to return all sanctions on Iran, which other parties to the deal - Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany - have not supported. 
In 2018, President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the agreement and reimposed some sanctions that have crippled Tehran's economy. Iran has retaliated by reducing compliance with the pact's restrictions.

Khatibzadeh said Grossi would meet high-ranking Iranian officials during his visit, including the foreign minister and the country's nuclear chief.

(Reuters) - Portland police used tear gas on protesters and made 23 arrests as it declared a demonstration against police brutality a ""riot"" late on Sunday, saying a group of over 200 demonstrators lit fires and attacked officers with lasers, mortars, rocks and bottles. 
""Portland Police deployed CS gas"", it said in a statement https:// early on Monday. 
""Arrests were made and crowd control munitions were used,"" the statement said, describing members of the crowd which had gathered in the U.S. city's North Precinct as wearing black and carrying shields, helmets and gas masks.
The 23 arrests were made on charges like disorderly conduct, assault, riot and interfering with a peace officer, the police said, adding the arrested individuals were booked in the Multnomah County Detention Center.
In a Twitter post https:// earlier, the police had asked the gathering to disperse, adding that a failure to comply with the order could lead to arrests and crowd control agents, ""including tear gas and impact weapons."" 
Police had also declared a riot just before midnight on Saturday after a group of about 250 people tried to march on a government building that has often been the scene of clashes between protesters and officers during nearly three months of nightly protests.
There were 14 arrests made in that event.
Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have swept the United States since the death in May of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Chilean Supreme Court on Monday rejected a request by the United States to extradite businessman Carlos Cardoen, whom it accuses of having illegally exported a mineral used to make cluster bombs to Iraq.
The court said too much time had lapsed since Cardoen, 78, was indicted by a U.S. court in 1993 for exporting zirconium from the United States and selling cluster bombs to former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein between 1982 and 1989.
Interpol issued a international arrest warrant the same year but Washington asked the Chilean Foreign Ministry only in March last year to arrest Cardoen so he could be tried on U.S. soil. 
The ruling brings an end to an almost 30-year legal saga that has prevented business tycoon Cardoen, once labeled a ""Merchant of Death"" by U.S. Customs officials, from leaving Chile. 
He has turned instead to running a hotel and museum and making wine in the town of Santa Cruz, 100 miles south of the capital, Santiago. 
The U.S. Department of Justice indicted Cardoen in 1993 for conspiring with a U.S. company, Teledyne Industries, to violate export controls on zirconium, which it used to manufacture cluster bombs used by the Iraqi Air Force in its war with Iran. 
Teledyne Industries pled guilty to the charges and paid a $4 million fine in 1995, according to the U.S. Justice Department. 
Cardoen has alleged that U.S. authorities turned a blind eye to his business activities while Saddam was attacking Iran, a U.S. opponent.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Scott Peterson, the California man convicted of murdering his wife and unborn son during a sensational 2004 trial, won a reversal of his death penalty on Monday after the state's top court ruled that the trial judge had erred in jury selection.
But the California Supreme Court, in a more than 100-page ruling, rejected an appeal by Peterson, 47, of his conviction on two counts of murder in the high-profile case. The ruling means that Peterson, who has been held on death row at San Quentin State prison since 2005, has the right to a new penalty phase of his trial. California has not executed a condemned inmate since 2006.
A spokesman for the Stanislaus County District Attorney's Office, which handled the case, said its prosecutors were reviewing the decision and speaking to victims' family members before deciding how to proceed.
The California Supreme Court threw out Peterson's death sentence on the grounds that the San Mateo County Superior Court judge presiding over Peterson's trial wrongly dismissed 13 potential jurors because, in filling out an initial questionnaire, they expressed opposition to the death penalty.
""Long-standing United States Supreme Court precedent makes clear that prospective jurors may not be disqualified from service in a capital case solely because of their general objections to the death penalty,"" Justice Leondra Kruger wrote for the state's top court.
Peterson's pregnant wife, Laci, was reported missing from the couple's home in Modesto, California, on Christmas Eve, 2002, touching off a months-long search and investigation. Her partial remains and those of her unborn son washed ashore along the San Francisco Bay the following April.
Peterson, a fertilizer dealer who told police he had gone fishing in the bay that morning and returned to find his 27-year-old wife gone, was arrested for the murders days later.

Prosecutors argued at trial that Peterson had strangled or suffocated his wife on Dec. 23 or 24 and dumped her body into the bay, weighted down by an improvised concrete anchor.

(Reuters) - More than a dozen environmental groups and one representing northeast Alaskan tribal villages sued the Trump administration on Monday over a plan to open the sensitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling.
In two lawsuits filed in federal court in Alaska, the groups said the plan would cause irreparable damage to a pristine tundra ecosystem that is vital to wildlife including polar bears, Porcupine caribou, and more than 150 species of birds including snow geese and peregrine falcons.
The plan is part of Republican President Donald Trump's effort to expand oil and gas production on federal lands. His opponent in the Nov. 3 presidential election, Democrat Joe Biden, has said he would permanently protect ANWR if elected.
The Gwich'in Steering Committee, which represents tribes that depend on the caribou for subsistence, sued along with several other groups including the Sierra Club. Another lawsuit was filed by Earthjustice and the Natural Resources Defense Council on behalf of groups including the National Audubon Society.

""Birds can't vote and they can't file a lawsuit - but we can. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment to defend the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and protect America's bird nursery from drilling,"" Audobon Society President David Yarnold said in a statement.
The actions came a week after the Interior Department finalized a plan to issue decades-long leases to oil and gas interests in the refuge before a potential change in U.S. leadership. The Trump administration could hold a lease sale before the end of the year, officials said last week.
Regarding the lawsuits, Interior Department spokesman Conner Swanson said the program was mandated by Congress and ""leaves ninety-two percent of the refuge completely off-limits to development. The Department’s decision regarding where and when development can take place includes extensive protections for wildlife, including caribou and polar bears.”

Ecuador's armed forces last week said 149 of some 325 vessels still fishing near the ecologically sensitive islands had turned off tracking systems to prevent monitoring of their activities.
""Except for some delays or temporary loss of satellite signal, all Chinese ships keep operating and using monitoring systems normally,"" Ambassador Chen Guoyou told the international relations commission of Ecuador's congress, speaking through an interpreter.
The government of President Lenin Moreno has said that the fleet has not entered the Ecuador's territorial waters. 
But environmentalists say this type of fishing allows Chinese ships to take advantage of the abundant species that leave the Galapagos Exclusive Economic Zone and cross into the high seas where Ecuador does not have jurisdiction.
Guoyou said the vessels are mostly fishing for squid, with a small percentage of them fishing for tuna.
""The operating characteristics of squid fishing boats do not allow the incidental capture of sharks and other protected marine species,"" he said. ""China is a major fishing nation ... and it is also a responsible fishing nation.""
He said the vessels comply ""strictly"" with the regulations created by of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and Regional Fisheries Management Organizations.
""There is no Chinese fishing vessel"" on the lists of vessels engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing published by these agencies, Guoyou said.
Beijing has promised a policy of ""zero tolerance"" with the boats and has authorized the Andean country to supervise the vessels. It has proposed a fishing moratorium in the area near the Galapagos between September and November. Fishing fleets usually leave the area before that period.
The Ecuadorian Navy has said that ships are now moving at low speeds west of the islands, which served as the basis for British scientist Charles Darwin's theory of the evolution of species in the 19th century.

254,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 04:41PM ET</span>",Merkel tells Russia to investigate suspected poisoning of Kremlin critic,"By Michael Nienaber and Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday called on Russia to investigate the suspected poisoning of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny and hold the perpetrators accountable after doctors found indications of a toxic substance in his body.
A critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Navalny last week collapsed on a plane after drinking tea while on his way to campaign in Siberia. He was flown to Germany for treatment on Saturday.
The Kremlin has said it was unclear what caused Navalny to fall ill and that initial tests did not show he was poisoned, as his aides charged. 
But German doctors treating Navalny at a Berlin hospital said on Monday that medical examinations indicated poisoning with some kind of cholinesterase inhibitor, although the specific substance is not yet known.
""In light of the prominent role played by Mr. Navalny in the political opposition in Russia, the authorities there are now urgently called upon to investigate this crime to the last detail - and do so in full transparency,"" Merkel said in a joint statement with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.
""Those responsible must be identified and held accountable,"" Merkel added.
Berlin's Charite hospital said a team of doctors there had examined him in detail after his arrival. ""Clinical findings indicate poisoning with a substance from the group of cholinesterase inhibitors,"" the hospital said in a statement.
""The specific substance involved remains unknown, and a further series of comprehensive testing has been initiated.""
Russian health officials contradicted the German diagnosis, saying Navalny had tested negative for cholinesterase inhibitors when he was hospitalised in Omsk last week.
Navalny showed no signs of having been poisoned when he was admitted to the clinic and tests were carried out on him to check for a wide range of substances, including inhibitors, the health ministry in Omsk said in a statement.
""POISONING ATTACK""
Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level graft and mobilising crowds of young protesters.
He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings and rallies and sued over his investigations into corruption. He was barred from running in a presidential election in 2018.
The German government said earlier that Navalny was being guarded in hospital due to concerns for his safety.
""Because one can say with near certainty that it was a poisoning attack, protection is necessary,"" Merkel's chief spokesman told journalists.
The incident could further strain Russia's fraught relations with its European and NATO neighbours, who have accused it of mounting attacks on dissidents in Europe in the past - accusations that Russia has dismissed.
In their statement, the German doctors said Navalny was being treated in intensive care and remained in a medically induced coma. While his condition was serious, it was not currently life-threatening, they said.
The outcome remained uncertain and long-term effects, especially to the nervous system, could not be ruled out, the statement added.
Cholinesterase inhibitors are a group of chemical compounds used in everything from chemical weapons to pesticides designed to kill bugs, and human medicines designed to alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's and other types of dementia. Nerve gases and the so-called ""Novichok"" group of chemicals are also cholinesterase inhibitors.
The hospital statement said that Navalny was being treated with the antidote atropine.

That is the same drug used by British doctors to treat Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter Yulia, who were poisoned with a nerve agent in 2018 in Salisbury, England. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied involvement in that and other such incidents, calling accusations it was responsible anti-Russian provocations.

The footage, published by El Universal newspaper, shows an incident that the newspaper said came from a shootout in Nuevo Laredo last month, when 12 people who authorities said were drug cartel members were killed.
The video, apparently filmed from a helmet camera, shows a soldier firing a mounted gun from an army truck speeding along a dark highway in Nuevo Laredo, a violent northern city that borders the United States.
The video shows the vehicle coming to a halt near a pick-up truck, where after more shooting a person calls out to hold fire. 
""He's alive,"" soldiers shout in the video, pointing to the bed of a pick-up truck used by the alleged gang members.
""Kill him!"" someone can be heard yelling, followed by an expletive in Spanish.
Reuters has been unable to verify the contents of the video.
Lopez Obrador said he had asked for an investigation and said it appeared soldiers were ordered to ""finish off"" a suspect.
He said his government would ""not allow this practice.""
The military has been dogged by allegations of extrajudicial killings since former President Felipe Calderon sent the army to bring gangs to heel in 2006.
The struggle has taken a toll on the reputation of the armed forces.
At the time of the incident, the military said there were no survivors requiring medical assistance. According to an official statement afterwards, the gunmen attacked soldiers near the city's airport.
El Universal previously reported that three kidnapped civilians, with their hands and feet tied, were also among those killed by the soldiers.
The defense ministry has not commented on the video. One ministry official told Reuters the military supports an inquiry.

""The process will proceed under the presumption of innocence,"" the official said.

Lopez Obrador, who has cast preceding administrations as deeply corrupt, has made combating graft his top priority as he gears up for the lower house election in June 2021 that will determine whether he can keep control of Congress.
The leftist president told a regular news conference he would prefer that around 1.6 million citizens sign a petition by mid-September calling for the referendum, or that lawmakers formally request one.
""I'm going to wait until the end, but I don't rule out the option of doing it myself,"" said Lopez Obrador, referring to a constitutional provision allowing him to request a referendum by Sept. 15.
He added that a citizen vote could also take place next August, following the legislative elections, and expressed no preference between the two dates.
Critics accuse Lopez Obrador of focusing on allegations of graft under his immediate predecessors, Enrique Pena Nieto and Felipe Calderon, to distract from recession, record levels of violent crime and his management of the coronavirus pandemic.
He said he would personally argue against them facing trial, adding his oft-repeated slogan: ""Revenge is not my strong suit.""
A leaked deposition last week from the ex-boss of Mexico's state oil firm Pemex revealed details of a bribery scandal that alleges widespread corruption among high-ranking politicians, including the two former presidents.

Calderon has denied the allegations, while Pena Nieto has yet to comment. Neither man has been charged with anything.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru, battling one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks and a five-month lockdown, was reeling on Monday after the deaths of 13 people, most of them young women, in a stampede at an illegal nightclub triggered by a police raid.
The tragedy at the club, which authorities called ""a breeding ground"" for COVID-19, has exposed tensions in the Andean nation of 33 million people that has one of the world's worst per capita fatality rates with almost 28,000 deaths.
Infections are rising again in a dangerous second wave and total almost 600,000, the sixth highest in the world.
With Latin America an epicenter of the global COVID-19 pandemic, countries are grappling with how to slow the spread of infections while easing quarantines in the face of rising public anger at the tough economic and social impact.
The police raid that started late on Saturday evening, which prompted a rush for the club's exit, was to enforce a ban in effect since March on bars and nightclubs. This month the government has re-tightened rules on social gatherings.
Geraldine Sanchez, who visited the club with her sister hours before the incident, told Reuters TV they had only planned to stay a short time at the venue before going home. Her 24-year-old sister died in the stampede.
""Thank God I was saved. Otherwise I could have suffocated and died there like my sister,"" she told Reuters at the door of the morgue in search of information about the body of her sister. ""Tear gas bombs were fired and women were scared.""
The government has denied that the police used tear gas or weapons in the raid, while President Martin Vizcarra has called for strong punishment of the nightclub's owners. Police say a preliminary examination indicated no use of tear gas. 
The club's owners and many of the partygoers have been arrested or detained, and many have tested positive for COVID-19, the government has said. 
Reuters was unable to reach the owners for comment. 
'BREEDING GROUND' FOR INFECTION
Authorities said the party at the club had risked spreading the virus. Eleven of the 13 victims tested positive for COVID-19 and 15 of the 23 detained also, police said.
""The nightclub was a breeding ground for the transmission of this disease: there was a viral load because it was a closed environment,"" Claudio Ramírez, a health ministry official, told reporters after rapid tests on attendees.
Images on social media and TV footage showed police officers hammering at a door to rescue victims. On the stairs were shoes, broken bottles and masks.
""The nightclub had not had an operating permit since 2016. We don't know how it operated,"" councilman Javier Sulca, from the Los Olivos municipality of Lima, told reporters.
Peru was one of the first in the region to impose a strict lockdown, which failed to slow the rise in infections, while hammering the mining-driven economy, which contracted 30% in the second quarter of the year, one of the deepest in the world.
The tragedy could open another flank of criticism of the government's handling of the pandemic. Vizcarra's popularity remains high, but has fallen in recent months. On Monday, the opposition-dominated Congress summoned Interior Minister Jorge Pérez to explain what happened at the club.
On social media, many were critical of those who went to the club, though others called for an investigation into the actions of the police over the deaths.
""Attributing the blame to the young people who attended the disco is to have lost social empathy,"" Marcel Velázquez, a Peruvian professor of history and literature, wrote on Twitter.
""Several of the deceased are my daughter's age, I feel the pain of the parents.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean police should drop a criminal case against feminist collective Lastesis whose anti-violence song and dance routine ""A Rapist In Your Path"" inspired performances around the world, a group of UN experts said on Monday.
Police in the coastal city of Valparaiso laid a complaint with prosecutors in June against four named members of the group over a video posted on YouTube in which they allegedly said ""fire for the cops.""
Police said the women, who were filmed standing outside a police station in masks, were inciting violence against their institution.
The UN experts, volunteer members of the working group on discrimination against women and girls for the body's Human Rights Council, said Lastesis had been instrumental in denouncing police and gender violence in Chile.
“The group and the song have become a symbol of the universal demand of women to be able to live a life free of violence,” they added. “We fear prosecution of Lastesis could have a chilling effect on women in many other countries who are standing up for their human rights.""
The group said it had raised the issue with the Chilean government and was awaiting a response.
Lastesis' ""A Rapist In Your Path"" rose to prominence in November last year during intense social protests against inequality and elitism that were marked by massive marches but also clashes with police and looting and arson attacks.
The unrest resulted in at least 31 people killed, 3,000 injured, and 30,000 detained. Prosecutors are probing allegations of abuse made by over 5,000 people against the security forces. [nL2N27505X]
Lastesis in May signed a joint declaration with the Russian feminist protest group Pussy Riot calling for action to stop ""police violence."" 

Thirty Hollywood actresses including Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore, Milla Jovovich and Olivia Wilde have also signed an open letter calling for the case against Lastesis to be dropped.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main coalition partner, Defence Minister Benny Gantz, have been at odds over whether a one-year or two-year budget should be passed, with a second wave of COVID-19 infections fuelling an economic crisis.
Failure to approve a budget in parliament by Aug. 25 would have automatically triggered an election by law, but Netanyahu's right-wing Likud and Gantz's centrist Blue and White party agreed to push the deadline ahead by 120 days.
Parliament ratified the postponement in a vote two hours before the original deadline had been due to expire at midnight.
The delay will give Netanyahu and Gantz more time to try to resolve the weeks-old dispute that is also weighing on the power-sharing accord they reached after an election in March, which followed inconclusive ballots in April 2019 and September 2019.
Under that agreement, Netanyahu, now in his fifth term and on trial on corruption charges that he denies, is due to hand over his post to the former general late next year.
Speculation had been high in Israel that Netanyahu would opt to allow the original budget deadline to expire so that a new election would be held.
Under that scenario, he would by law remain caretaker prime minister until after a new election in November. Under the coalition agreement, if the government breaks up for any reason other than a budget impasse, Gantz becomes caretaker premier.
Just before the vote Netanyahu posted a video on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) saying he would ""do the right thing - prevent unnecessary elections.""
Gantz held a press conference warning the situation was so tense in Israel that with new elections there would be ""blood in the streets.""
Opinion polls show a sharp decline for Gantz's party but the resurgence of coronavirus infections and Netanyahu's legal troubles have also cut into the veteran leader's popularity amid a wave of street protests calling for his resignation.
Rating agencies have cautioned that further budget delays would raise concerns about Israel's ability to implement prudent fiscal policies and could impact credit ratings. 

Israel's economy has entered a recession and is forecast to shrink some 4.5% in 2020, while the jobless rate is at 12.3% due to a March-April lockdown.

The Roman Catholic Church suspended Father Robson Oliveira on Sunday, pending the investigation by prosecutors looking into money laundering, fraud, tax evasion and organized crime charges involving up to 1.7 billion reais ($300 million) over a decade.
Oliveira has around 3.9 million followers on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and had been running the Basilica of the Eternal Father in Trindade, a colonial town just outside the city of Goiania in the central state of Goias.
More than a million people flock to the shrine each year and take part in celebrations that feature a procession of ox carts.
Prosecutors said they suspect Oliveira, aged 46, was skimming off part of the 20 million reais ($3.6 million) in donations the basilica receives on average each month and investing the proceeds through front-men associates. They said they had contacted Vatican officials about the case.
Police raided properties linked to Oliveira on Friday. The raids were code-named Operation Merchants, from the biblical passage of Jesus Christ driving merchants from the temple. One house they raided had a jacuzzi, a heated pool and baths made of marble, they said at a news conference on Friday.
In a video posted on Facebook, the priest said he was confident his innocence would be established very quickly and the investigation would confirm that ""all the money donated to the Eternal Father was used for evangelization.""

It was unclear whether the dead were members of the security forces, civilians or the attackers. The witnesses asked not to be named for fear of repercussions. 
The fighting in Bugarama district in Rumonge province began on Sunday and continued into Monday and people were hiding in the bush, a resident who escaped the attack told Reuters. 
""The gunmen kidnapped everyone they met and killed them before engaging in fighting with the army on Sunday morning,"" the man said. He asked for anonymity to avoid reprisals. 
A senior government official said the attack, which occurred as the country was holding local elections, was not unexpected and potentially linked to the imminent repatriation of refugees from Rwanda. 
""The government anticipated that armed groups opposed to the government will attempt to carry out attacks ahead of the first repatriation of refugees from Rwanda,"" the official said. 
Rwanda hosts thousands of refugees from neighbouring Burundi who fled violence in 2015. 
A message posted on Twitter claiming to be from Red Tabara, a Burundian rebel group that says it is based in Congo's South Kivu region, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had ""neutralized"" nine policemen and about 20 militants. The veracity of the account or the message could not be verified. 
The statement on Twitter said presidential elections in May, won by the ruling party’s candidate Evariste Ndayishimiye, were ""a farce"" and called for a new vote. 
The statement also called for the disarmament of several militia groups such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a group founded by Hutu officials who fled Rwanda after orchestrating the 1994 genocide, which it claims has infiltrated security forces in Burundi. 
The army did not respond to requests for comment on the fighting.
Burundi has an ethnic Hutu majority and Tutsi minority, the same split as in Rwanda.
It has been plagued by decades of ethnic and political violence, including a bloody civil war which lasted 12 years in which 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - At least 100 people are feared trapped in the debris of a five-storey building that collapsed on Monday in an industrial town in western India, a lawmaker said.
Not all the roughly 200 residents of the building in Mahad, about 165 km (100 miles) south of India's financial capital Mumbai, were at home when it crumbled in the evening, Bharatshet Maruti Gogawale, the local lawmaker, told Reuters.
""I believe about 100 to 125 people must have been inside at the time of its collapse,"" Gogawale, who was present at the site, told Reuters.
The building comprised around 47 flats, according to the police department of western Maharashtra state.
Authorities have yet to ascertain the cause of the collapse and the number of casualties, but about 30 people were pulled out by rescue teams and local residents.
TV channels showed footage of the debris with locals and police trying to reach the trapped people. The TV footage also showed at least one ambulance leaving the area as people surrounding it made frantic phone calls.
Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has assured the local administration of all possible support for speedy rescue and relief work, his office said on Twitter.
Three teams from the National Disaster Response Force have been moved to the site, the NDRF said in a statement.
Old creaky structures and illegal constructions in India often lead to collapses, typically during torrential rain.

""The ones who throw Greece in front of the Turkish navy will not stand behind them,"" Erdogan said after a cabinet meeting. He added that Athens did not have the right to broadcast maritime navigational and weather advisories, known as Navtex, in areas claimed by Ankara.
""Greece has declared its own Navtex unlawfully and in a spoiled manner...With this approach, Greece has sown a chaos that it will not be able to escape from,"" Erdogan said.
Turkey has extended the exploration mission of its Oruc Reis survey ship in a disputed part of the eastern Mediterranean to Aug. 27, stoking tensions in the region. Athens has called the survey illegal.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Talks between West African mediators and Mali's military coup leaders ended on Monday after three days of discussions without any decision on the make-up of a transitional government, a junta spokesman said.
West Africa's regional bloc dispatched negotiators to Mali at the weekend in a bid to reverse President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita's removal from power last week. But talks had focused on who would lead Mali and for how long, rather than the possibility of reinstating the president, diplomats said.
The coup has raised the prospects of further political turmoil in Mali which, like other countries in the region, is facing an expanding threat from Islamist militants.
Colonel Ismael Wague said mediators would report to regional heads of state ahead of a summit on Mali this week but, highlighting the backing the soldiers enjoy, the final decision on the interim administration would be decided locally.
""Nothing has been decided. Everyone has given their point of view,"" Wague told reporters. ""The final decision of the structure of the transition will be made by us Malians here."" 
Former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who led the regional mediation team, said they requested and were granted access to Keita.
""President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita told us that he has resigned. That he was not forced to do so. That he does not want to return to politics and that he wants a quick transition to allow the country to return to civilian rule,"" Jonathan told reporters. 
Talks were taking place with the threat of regional sanctions hanging over the junta, known as the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP).
""(Mediators) will discuss this with the heads of state so they can lift or at least ease the sanctions. Sanctions are not good for us or the population,"" Wague said. 
The regional branch of West Africa's BCEAO central bank reopened on Monday.
TRANSITION
Four sources, who have direct contact with people involved in talks, had said earlier that Keita would not be involved in any transition.
Two sources said a year-long transition, similar to the one in Niger following a 2010 coup, was on the table. Another source said the junta was eager to prioritise reforms over elections so it could be longer. 
Wague earlier denied reports by French radio RFI that the CNSP wanted a three-year transitional government led by a soldier and mostly made up of the military.
An African diplomat monitoring the talks said that ECOWAS was keen to push for a ""short transition"" with a focus on holding the elections and allowing an elected civilian administration to handle the reforms afterwards.
However, several analysts warned against rushing to fresh elections without addressing the corruption and mismanagement that the soldiers and opposition leaders who led weeks of protests in the run up to the coup complained about.
""We did that in 2012 and here we are with another coup,"" said Lori-Anne Theroux-Benoni, head of the Dakar office of the Institute for Security Studies, referring to the vote that brought Keita to power in 2013 after his predecessor was also ousted.

""We should be innovative and use the time of the transition to make the process of the reform irreversible,"" she said. ""This might take longer than what some international actors want.""

Mexico has yet to publish official data, but private-school bodies consulted by Reuters said almost 2 million students at all levels were expected to quit private schools because of the crisis to join an already overcrowded public system.
The lack of both in-person teaching and access to facilities has left many parents unwilling to shoulder private-school costs.

Supporters of private schools worry the turmoil could stretch the education system, especially after President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador last year canceled a reform that the previous government said would improve teaching standards in Mexico, one of the worst-performing countries in the 37-nation Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Schools were among the first institutions the government ordered into lockdown in March, taking over 30 million students from some 216,500 public schools, and 5 million private students, out of classrooms.
Mexico has since recorded more than 60,000 deaths from COVID-19, the third-highest toll from the pandemic globally.
In an attempt to hold on to students and the payment of fees, private schools are trying to make deals with parents, offering more discounts, scholarships and other benefits.
It has not been enough for some.
""It's ridiculous. They reduced (tuition) 3%, but before that they raised it 30% in the previous cycle,"" said housewife Alicia Martinez, 37, who from the beginning of the crisis began struggling to support her two children in a paying school.
The pandemic has recently eased, but the government decided that infections remained too high to risk reopening schools. 
So students must start the new academic year with a home-learning program broadcast by major television networks until infection rates are deemed sufficiently low.
PRIVATE EXODUS
The outlook has forced over 48,000 private schools to delay a return to classrooms and instead move online - a major setback for many centers whose reputation rests on their facilities.
At least 15 parents who spoke to Reuters in recent days said they had withdrawn their children from private schools to put them in the public system.
The government says it can pick up the slack.
""Nobody's going to be left out. We're ready to receive this wave of migration from private schools,"" Deputy Education Minister Marcos Bucio told a news conference.
The ministry says it will not have an estimate of the extent of the shift to public from private education until after September, when the formal enrollment period has ended.
According to the National Confederation of Private Schools (CNEP), most of its 3,500 members will see enrollment drop by up to 30% during the current school year. Some private schools anticipate a decline of up to 60%.
""The situation is really chaotic,"" said its president, Maria de Jesus Zamarripa. ""With fewer children in the groups, a lot of schools are bound to have to make staffing changes.""
Private-school representatives will propose a series of measures to the government to try to rescue their operations, including tax breaks during the pandemic, she said.

""We hope we can achieve this,"" Zamarripa said.

Elected last December, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has repeatedly pledged to introduce political and economic reforms and to meet demands raised in demonstrations that toppled veteran president Abdelaziz Bouteflika in April 2019.
The new constitution would give the prime minister and parliament more powers to govern North African country of 45 million people, a draft released earlier this year showed.

The referendum date was announced after Tebboune's meeting with the head of the election authority Mohamed Chorfi earlier on Monday, the presidency said in a statement.

The New IRA, one of a small number of active militant groups opposed to Northern Ireland's 1998 peace deal, have been behind some of the sporadic attacks that have continued, including the murder of journalist Lyra McKee last year. [nL8N2DO5J8]
The nine people were charged with a total of 38 offences as a result of a coordinated investigation with police in Scotland, Ireland and Britain that was also assisted by Britain's MI5 domestic intelligence agency.
The 10th person arrested remains in custody.
The New IRA is far smaller than the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which disarmed after the peace accord mostly ended three decades of conflict between mainly Protestant supporters of continued British rule of the province and largely Catholic proponents of unification with the Irish Republic.
The group was formed in 2012 after three of the four main militant nationalist groups merged, the first time since the peace deal that most of the disparate nationalist groups still intent on violence came together under one leadership.
It has also been responsible for the separate killings of two prison officers since then.

MINSK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The authorities in Belarus arrested two leading opposition figures on Monday and called a Nobel laureate in for questioning, a day after thousands of people defied the army to march demanding the downfall of president Alexander Lukashenko.
Two weeks after an election which his opponents say he rigged, Lukashenko has shown little sign of bringing a halt to the demonstrations, the biggest threat to his 26-year-old rule.
The president, who has called the protesters ""rats"", said last week he ordered police to put down any demonstrations in Minsk. But tens of thousands took to the streets on Sunday in one of the biggest demonstrations since the election, and dispersed peacefully. 
In a sign of the peril to an already shaky economy, several banking sources told Reuters most banks had effectively run out of foreign currency to meet surging demand from residents trying to sell the Belarusian rouble. Queues have become common at exchange points.
A board member at the Belarus central bank told Reuters the issue was a technical one involving the physical availability of banknotes, and did not signal liquidity problems. 
A spokesman for the Coordination Council, an opposition body set up last week, told Reuters two of its highest profile members, Olga Kovalkova and Sergei Dylevsky, had been detained on Monday near a factory entrance.
Separately, Belarusian Nobel laureate author Svetlana Alexievich has been called in for questioning by state investigators over a criminal case against the Council, the spokesman said, and is due to meet them on Wednesday. 
Alexievich, who won the 2015 Nobel literature prize, is a member of the Council, which was set up with the stated aim of promoting a peaceful handover of authority and comprises dozens of public figures including the former head of the main state drama theatre. 
The government has launched a criminal investigation, calling the Council an illegal attempt to seize power. Many leading opposition figures are in jail or have fled the country. 
""Belarus has changed and authorities will have to talk to us,"" one of the council members, Maria Kolesnikova, told reporters.
CURRENCY SHORTAGE
Central bank board member Dmitry Murin told Reuters any shortage of foreign currency at exchange points ""has a technical nature - there is an issue with physical availability of the banknotes. Banks do not have forex liquidity shortages as of now."" 
Banking sources described what appears to be a serious shortage of hard currency despite an infusion of cash last week.
""There is panic now, demand for foreign currency cash is very high,"" one currency dealer in Minsk told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""The only bank that has (foreign) cash is Raiffeisen Bank, which sold it very actively last week. But the last plane carrying cash arrived in Belarus last Friday. Our bank and others wanted to buy foreign cash today but Raiffeisen said they have none."" 
A spokesperson for Priorbank, Raiffeisen's subsidiary in Minsk, declined to comment.
A source at a state-run Belarusian bank told Reuters his bank had received requests from customers to withdraw $2.5 million but had just $100,000 in its coffers.
Another person at a unit of a Russian bank said withdrawals had to be requested several days in advance and there was no guarantee they would be granted.
On the official market, the Belarus rouble fell around 1% against the both the euro and the dollar on Monday. Against the euro it was at a record low.

FINANCIAL CRISIS
The currency weakness would make it costlier to service $2.5 billion in debt payments due by end-2020. The central bank had less than three months' import cover as of end-2019, World Bank estimates show.
""It is very clear that there is a massive shortage of foreign exchange, and of course it is one of the countries that definitely already has low FX reserves,"" said David Hauner, head of emerging markets cross-asset strategy for EMEA at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Research. ""....The country does not have a lot of cushion to weather that sort of turmoil for a prolonged period.""
(Graphic: Belarus import cover, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovaqjnjva/Pasted%20image%201598267679735.png) 
The CEO of Viber Rakuten, which runs the Viber messaging service, was quoted by Interfax as saying the firm was considering halting investments in Belarus. Djamel Agaoua said employees had been moved out of Minsk to remote locations.
Belarus is the former Soviet state with the closest political, economic and cultural ties to Russia, and its territory is seen as crucial to Russia's European defence strategy. That has left the Kremlin with a choice of whether to continue to back Lukashenko as his authority ebbs.
Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Sunday Belarus protesters were seeking a Venezuela-style crisis and 'bloodshed' rather than peaceful resolution. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko spoke by phone on Monday in their third call in just 10 days, touching on the Belarus situation and agreeing that Belarusians would take part in trials of Russia's coronavirus vaccine. 
Western countries have had to balance their sympathy for a nascent pro-democracy movement with concern about provoking Moscow. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun met top opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya in Lithuania on Monday, and is due to discuss Belarus during a trip to Russia.

""She's a very impressive person and I can see why she is so popular in her country,"" Biegun said. ""The purpose of the meeting was to listen, to hear what the thinking is by the Belarusian people, and to see what they are doing to obtain rights of self-determination.""

Alexievich, who won the Nobel prize for literature in 2015, is a member of an opposition coordination council that was set up by opponents of Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko after a disputed Aug. 9 election that has sparked nationwide protests. 
Alexievich will come in for questioning at the Belarusian Investigative Committee on Wednesday, a spokesman for the council said. 
Alexievich, 72, is not known to have taken part in any of the council's public meetings. She is known to rarely leave her home because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The demonstrations pose the biggest challenge to Lukashenko, a former Soviet state farm boss, in his 26 years in power. The move to question Alexievich comes hours after police detained two high-profile council members, Sergei Dylevsky and Olga Kovalkova.

Alexievich's writings, based on recorded oral histories, mapped decades of life in the Soviet Union before its implosion in 1991, as well as experiences of people during World War II and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

LONDON (Reuters) - Trainee Santas in Britain are learning how to make traditional grottos COVID-safe this year, with festive red velvet masks, spaced seating and a contact-free transfer of gift to child.
London entertainment company Ministry of Fun has been running ""Santa School"" for 25 years and this year started earlier than usual to reassure clients hiring a Santa and the public that it's possible to make the experience safer during the coronavirus pandemic.
Trainer and organisation founder James Lovell said there are three key changes they have advised on.
""We've created these masks, which, as you can see, they're red velvet with white fur trim, just like Santa's costume... I think a child will feel comfortable with that because I think we underestimate just how used to masks we all are.
""Secondly, there's the social distance grotto... Very easy to do and to make a child two metres away from Santa does not in any way take away from the magic,"" he added.
Thirdly, the school has invented a small sleigh on which Santa puts presents and which children can pull towards them.
Last year he said they had over 1,000 bookings over an eight week period for Santas. This year bookings are at half the normal levels, Lovell added.
""People aren't entirely sure about what they can do. And I'm hoping that what we're doing here today at Santa School is showing people what they can do and that they can do it magically.""
One performer dressed as Santa said, ""we have to be a bit distant from the children and also the grown ups too... but the fun and the joy and the love and the magic will never change.""
Lovell did not say how much Santas are paid for appearing in grottos, but said the job was harder than it looked. 

""It's very rare that an actor will have to stay in character and improvise and be magical to an audience of one or two standing a metre away from them. It takes a lot of concentration.""

272,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: Untangling the conflict in Libya,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Rival authorities have backed a ceasefire in Libya, raising the prospect of a de-escalation in the country's long-running conflict. Achieving a lasting deal will require political and economic agreements that have proved elusive for years, and cooperation from foreign powers. 
WHO'S BEEN FIGHTING WHO?
Khalifa Haftar's self-proclaimed Libyan National Army (LNA) has been battling forces aligned with the Tripoli-based, internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). Both sides are formed from local armed factions, whose shifting loyalties have helped steer the course of the conflict. 
Both have depended heavily on foreign allies pursuing strategic and political goals in Libya. Turkey stepped up its military support for the GNA in January after signing a maritime deal with Tripoli, allowing it to repel a 14-month LNA offensive against the capital. 
Haftar has long enjoyed backing from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Russia and Jordan. 
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
Libya's fault lines surfaced nine years ago as local groups took different positions in the NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi.
An attempted democratic transition slid out of control as armed groups built local power bases and coalesced round rival political factions.
After a battle for Tripoli in 2014, one faction moved east and set up a parallel government and institutions. It recognised Haftar as military chief as he began a long campaign against Islamist groups and other opponents in Benghazi. 
The GNA emerged from a December 2015, U.N.-backed agreement struck as Islamic State gained a foothold in Libya and migrant smuggling to Europe surged. But eastern factions spurned the deal.
Instead, Haftar consolidated control of the east and swept south in early 2019 before launching his offensive on Tripoli.
WHO CONTROLS WHAT?
Front lines are drawn at LNA-held Sirte, roughly the midpoint of Libya's Mediterranean coastline and a gateway to major oil ports. 
The GNA and affiliated groups control Libya's densely populated northwest and the LNA holds the east. Allegiances in the south are more tenuous. 
WHAT'S THE DAMAGE?
Nearly 400,000 Libyans have been displaced over the past nine years. Thousands more have died.
The conflict has cost tens of billions of dollars in lost oil revenue, damaged infrastructure, and sharply reduced living standards.
Coronavirus infections have started to surge.
The collapse of public services has fuelled protests in western Libya against the political elite. 
WHAT CHANCE OF PEACE?
Fighting stopped in June but both sides have continued to mobilise. The ceasefire call by GNA head Fayez al-Sarraj proposed demilitarising Sirte, allowing an oil restart by freezing revenues until a political deal is reached, and elections in March.
But it is unclear how much backing those ideas have in the west, let alone the east. 
The LNA dismissed the Sarraj's announcement as a ploy. A parallel ceasefire call by Aguila Saleh, head of an eastern parliament aligned with Haftar, proposed Sirte as the seat of a new government.
The United Nations is pushing the two sides to resolve issues including oil revenue distribution, the make-up of a unity government and the status of armed groups.
Foreign powers officially back the process, but have also shipped arms to their allies, undercutting diplomatic efforts. 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OIL?
OPEC member Libya holds Africa's largest oil reserves, producing 1.6 million barrels per day before 2011. Blockades have caused output to fluctuate sharply since then.
Production climbed to around one million bpd from late 2016, then plunged to less than 100,000 bpd as the LNA's allies closed ports and pipelines in January.
The National Oil Corporation says it will restart exports only if military forces leave oil facilities.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's main opposition Conservative Party on Monday elected Erin O'Toole, a former cabinet minister and armed forces veteran, to be its new leader and the primary challenger to Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
O'Toole, 47, replaces Andrew Scheer, who failed to unseat Trudeau in an election last year even though his center-left Liberals had been weakened by political scandals. 
O'Toole's main task is to woo voters in the populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec, which together account for 59% of seats in the House of Commons, and largely shunned the party's platform in 2015 and 2019 votes.
Darrell Bricker, chief executive officer of Ipsos Reid, said by email that O'Toole's win ""gets the Conservatives on track to mount a serious threat to the Trudeau Liberals,"" in particular the fact he comes from Ontario.
While there is no election looming, Trudeau needs the support of at least one of three opposition parties to stay in power, and a crucial confidence vote on the government's COVID-19 economic recovery plan is expected in late September.
""The Conservative Party will be ready for the next election and we will win the next election,"" O'Toole said in his acceptance speech, delivered early in the morning after hours of technical delays.
O'Toole describes himself as a ""true blue Conservative"" and has vowed to ""put Canada first"" while helping families and the economy recover from the coronavirus crisis.
He beat out the better known Peter MacKay, who was a high-profile member of former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government from 2006 to 2015.
O'Toole ran on a more right-wing platform than MacKay, promising to defund the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC), the public broadcaster, crack down on crime and cut taxes.
Frank Graves of polling firm Ekos said O'Toole would need to rely on the fact that center-left voters in Canada can choose between four parties.
""My guess is that he theoretically has the same available constituency in Quebec and Ontario that propelled Stephen Harper to success,"" he said by email.
The Liberals quickly accused O'Toole of ""wanting to take Canada backward"".
This, it said in a statement to supporters, ""would mean making harmful cuts to services that Canadians count on, rolling back our work to fight climate change, weakening Canada's gun control laws, and much more"".
Trudeau will face at least two confidence votes this year but looks set to survive with support from the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP).
Support for the Liberals surged as the government spent hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency aid during the pandemic, but they have lost ground recently amid an ethics scandal involving Trudeau and his former finance minister.
Liberals would get 36.4% of the votes if an election were held today, with the Conservatives on 29.9%, according to the CBC's poll tracker, an aggregate of recent surveys.
O'Toole must boost support in urban centers such as Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, which were Liberal strongholds in the past two national elections.
In his speech, O'Toole reached out to left-leaning voters, saying there was room for them in the party. 
The son of a retired Ontario politician, O'Toole was first elected in 2012 and served as veterans affairs minister from February to November 2015.

He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force at 18, working as a helicopter navigator before transferring to the Canadian Forces reserves. He then trained and practiced as a lawyer.

Biegun spoke in Lithuania, which shares a border with Belarus, and his trip signals a greater U.S. role in trying to settle the strife that erupted when Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko cracked down on peaceful protesters who rejected his claim of a landslide election victory.
Asked about possible Russian military intervention, the number two U.S. diplomat said: ""Of course that would be most unwelcome, but we don't have any indication beyond some of the public remarks that we've heard.""
He spoke after meeting Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opposition candidate in Belarus's Aug. 9 presidential election who took refuge in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius after the vote, which protesters say was rigged.
""We urge the government of Belarus to accept the OSCE chair's offer to facilitate dialogue and engage all stakeholders,"" Biegun told a conference in Vilnius.

""The United States cannot and will not decide the course of events in Belarus, this is the right of the Belarusian people.""

The announcement by the head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization marked the first official report on the contents of the cockpit voice and data recordings, which were sent to France for analysis in July.
Iran's Revolutionary Guard has said it accidentally shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 on Jan. 8, mistaking it for a missile at a time when tensions were high between Iran and the United States.
Many of the 176 victims killed in the crash were Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
Tehran said the analysis shows the plane was hit by two missiles 25 seconds apart and that passengers were still alive for some time after the impact of the first blast.
""This preliminary report only provides limited and selected information regarding this tragic event,"" Canada's Transport Minister Marc Garneau and Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said in a statement on Sunday night.
""The report only mentions what transpired after the first missile strike but not the second.""
They asked why the missiles were launched and why Iran's air space was open.
An association representing families of the plane's victims dismissed the report in a statement that said they needed to know why a second missile was fired at the aircraft.
Earlier on Sunday, Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB) questioned why commercial airlines continued operating in the area affected by the conflict. 

Under U.N. rules, Iran retains overall control of the investigation while the United States and Ukraine are accredited as the countries where the jet was respectively built and operated. Canada has also played a role as the home of many of the victims on the downed plane.

PARIS (Reuters) - A naturist resort on France's Mediterranean coast has seen a sharp spike in coronavirus infections and nudists have been ordered to at least wear masks and practice social distancing, health authorities said on Monday. 
Tests had shown a 30% infection rate in people who had visited Village Cap d'Agde - which advertises itself as a village for naturists and libertines - the Occitanie region health authority said.
That was more than four times higher than the 7% rate recorded in other people in the area who had not visited the centre, the authority added.
Officials at the resort, which is about 60 km (40 miles) down the coast from Montpellier, did not respond to calls seeking comment.
The health authority's director general, Pierre Ricordeau, said social distancing had probably not been sufficiently respected at the centre. 
""There are infections everywhere, including among people who are not libertines. The message is the same for everyone: wear a mask, wash your hands and practice social distancing, whether you are a libertine or not a libertine,"" Ricordeau said. 
After the tests, the government prefect for the region ordered people to wear masks in the camp, banned gatherings of more than 10 people there and scrapped exemptions on night club opening hours. 
He also asked anyone planning to go to the village to delay their travel plans.
Cap d'Agde, set in a huge circular modernist building by the beach, is one of France's oldest and biggest naturist resorts and draws tens of thousands of visitors per day in summer. 
On Sunday, France reported nearly 5,000 new coronavirus infections, a new post-lockdown record.

The threat of a walk-off comes after a nine-year-old girl was hospitalized with a gunshot wound after an attack on her father´s cement truck. Police have launched an investigation but have yet to identify suspects.
The country´s National Confederation of Cargo Transport (CNTC) said Congress had failed to pass laws necessary to stop these kinds of attacks and punish them adequately.
""We demand that Congress urgently...approve the 13 laws related to the prevention, persecution and sanctioning of crime,"" they said in the statement, referring to bills currently under review by lawmakers. 
Barring that, they said, a strike would begin after midnight on Thursday. They encouraged others to join in the walk-off to ensure ""the re-establishment of the rule of law.""
Chile´s Araucania has seen a spike in attacks on transport trucks and factories in recent months. The region of south-central Chile has long been convulsed by a simmering conflict between the indigenous Mapuche and the Chilean government. 
Mapuche groups renounced the attack on Saturday and Sunday. It was still not immediately clear who, if anyone, had claimed responsibility for the incident.
The Araucania is home to many of the 1.7 million indigenous Mapuche that live in Chile. Indigenous activists there say their lands are increasingly threatened by agriculture, forestry and other industries; they blame the state for failing to uphold their historical rights.
Militant groups who say they fight for Mapuche rights have claimed responsibility for some previous attacks on truck drivers and companies, police have said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The United States will ensure Israel retains a military advantage in the Middle East under any future U.S. arms deals with the United Arab Emirates, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday.
""The United States has a legal requirement with respect to qualitative military edge. We will continue to honour that,"" Pompeo told reporters after a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Netanyahu said he had been reassured on the issue by Pompeo, who began a Middle East visit in Jerusalem that will showcase U.S. support for Israeli-Arab peace efforts and building a front against Iran. It will also include Sudan, the UAE and Bahrain.
A U.S.-brokered deal on normalising relations between Israel and the UAE was announced on Aug. 13. But there has been some dissent in Israel over the prospect of the Gulf power now obtaining advanced U.S. weaponry such as the F-35 warplane. 
Speaking on CNN on Saturday, senior White House adviser Jared Kushner said the UAE had been trying to get the F-35 for a long time.
""This new peace agreement should increase the probability of them getting it. But it's something we're reviewing,"" he said.
Pompeo said Washington had provided the UAE with military support for more than 20 years, measures he described as needed to stave off shared threats from Iran - also Israel's arch-foe.
""We're deeply committed to doing that, to achieving that and we'll do it in a way that preserves our commitment to Israel and I'm confident that objective will be achieved,"" Pompeo said.
Bruised by the U.N. Security Council's rejection of a U.S. draft resolution for extending an arms embargo on Iran, the Trump administration is seeking a ""snapback"" of U.N. sanctions that had been eased as part of a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran.
""We are determined to use every tool that we have to ensure that they (Iran) can't get access to high-end weapons systems,"" Pompeo said. ""We think it's in the best interest of the whole world.""
The Palestinians warned the Trump administration against trying to sideline them in the Middle East diplomatic push.

""Recruiting Arabs to recognise Israel and open embassies does not make Israel a winner,"" Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said in an interview with Reuters. ""You are putting the whole region in a lose-lose situation because you are designing the road for a forever conflict in the region.""

SLIM, Malaysia (Reuters) - Convicted of corruption less than a month ago and sentenced to 12 years in jail, former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak was back campaigning for a party candidate over the weekend in a by-election for a state assembly seat.
Out on bail, Najib is waiting for his appeal date to be set, while standing accused in two other trials and waiting for two more to begin - mostly linked to the looting of billions of dollars from defunct sovereign fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).
Despite that, his party - the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) - and its ethnic Chinese and Indian party allies invited Najib to be their star campaigner for a by-election this month in Slim district, about 90 minutes north of the capital Kuala Lumpur.
Najib was voted out of office in 2018 amid outrage over the 1MDB scandal. But since then, he has undergone a public relations makeover to shed his image as a blue-blooded member of the elite and broaden his appeal to ordinary Malays. 
With more than 4 million followers on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter, he has become more popular on social media than any other Malaysian politician.
Having always denied guilt, Najib said the court verdict had not affected his voter appeal, or that of his party.
""On the contrary, some people say I have much more sympathy from the people,"" Najib told Reuters after breakfasting with supporters during a campaign stop in Perak, a northern state on the Malay Peninsula.
BIKER ""BOSS""
Najib's fortunes appeared to improve in February as his rivals' coalition government imploded, and UMNO returned to power in an alliance led by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.
On the stump in rural Perak, Najib was very much in his comfort zone, though the numbers attending election rallies were restricted by coronavirus social distancing rules. 
As he arrived at the breakfast gathering, loudspeakers blasted out a thumping rap to deliver Najib's catchphrase.
Using biker slang, the message goes: ""What's to be ashamed of, my boss?"" 
Around a hundred supporters present cheered enthusiastically.
Later in the day, he visited homes in communities fringed by palm oil estates and posed for selfies over lunch at a restaurant.
Shahrum Abdul Rakeb, a diner, told Reuters Najib had his unwavering support.
""We will see how the situation turns out but either way, I still support him,"" Shahrum said. ""I think the people have begun to realise, we know who is better for us.""
Others were also unsure what to believe about 1MDB.
""We don't know for sure whether he is really guilty or not,"" said Vangdasalam Govindasamy, a 45-year-old voter. 
""As far as I am concerned, when he was in power, he did things for us. He helped us.""
MAKING A COMEBACK?
Some critics say Najib's camp has employed cybertroopers to amplify social media presence and paid people to show up at rallies. 
""The momentum that we created... is coming from the people,"" Najib said, denying resorting to such tactics.
Political analysts say his comments on the economy had resonated with ordinary Malays, the most dominant ethnic group in Malaysia, revitalising his appeal, especially in more rural areas. 
""On his social media Najib speaks to the Malay working class. He is accepted as one of them,"" said Adib Zalkapli, Malaysia director for political consultancy Bower Group Asia. 
Though he retains his seat in parliament, where Muhyiddin's alliance holds a wafer-thin majority, Najib cannot contest an election so long as the guilty verdict hangs over him.
Najib did not elaborate on his plans but said his priority was to be the ""voice of the people"". Few people would bet against him making a comeback if his appeal succeeds or he is granted a royal pardon.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Sunday ordered a stay in President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign’s lawsuit seeking to ban drop boxes and other changes to Pennsylvania’s mail-balloting procedures.
The Nov. 3 election promises to be the nation’s largest test of voting by mail and the two major parties are locked in numerous lawsuits that will shape how millions of Americans vote this autumn.
The Republican president has repeatedly and without evidence said that an increase in mail-in ballots would lead to a surge in fraud, although Americans have long voted by mail. 
There is perhaps no more consequential lawsuit than the one in Pennsylvania, which Trump won by less than 1 percentage point in 2016 and is considered essential to his re-election effort.
J. Nicholas Ranjan, U.S district judge for western Pennsylvania, said the federal case brought by the Trump campaign would not move forward until similar lawsuits in state courts are completed or unless they are delayed.
Justin Clark, Trump's deputy campaign manager, said the judge's decision recognized that the issue touched on both state and constitutional issues.
""The federal court is simply going to reserve its judgment on this in the hopes that the state court will resolve these serious issues and guarantee that every Pennsylvanian has their vote counted—once,"" Clark said. 
The Trump campaign is seeking to ban ballot drop boxes, which were deployed in the state’s most recent primary and that allow voters to submit absentee ballots and bypass the U.S. Postal Service.
The campaign argues the drop boxes were not explicitly authorized in a bipartisan bill passed by the state legislature last year that expanded the state’s mail-balloting procedures.
The suit also wants the residency requirement for poll watchers lifted, so that any Pennsylvania voter could serve in that function at any polling location in the state.
The judge, a Trump appointee, said the suit involved state laws and he would defer for now to the state courts. 
“The Court will apply the brakes to this lawsuit, and allow the Pennsylvania state courts to weigh in and interpret the state statutes that undergird Plaintiffs’ federal-constitutional claims,” Ranjan said.

The Trump campaign says the ballot drop box invites fraud. The federal judge asked the campaign to provide evidence of actual fraud, but the campaign declined, arguing it did not have to do so in order to win the case.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>","As president, Biden would not trash all Trump's foreign policy legacy","By David Brunnstrom, Humeyra Pamuk and Luke Baker
WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - When Donald Trump was elected U.S. president in 2016, almost immediately, and with evident relish, he set about trying to demolish Barack Obama's carefully crafted foreign policy legacy.
In the following days, months and years, Trump threw out a trade deal with the Asia-Pacific, a global climate accord, a nuclear agreement with Iran and a process to end decades of hostility with Cuba.
The Republican leader also publicly attacked long-time U.S. allies from Berlin to Tokyo while praising authoritarian rulers from Russia's Vladimir Putin to North Korea's Kim Jong Un. 
And after heaping praise on China's Xi Jinping, he launched trade and rhetorical battles with Beijing that have sparked fears of a new Cold War - or even military conflict.
Top former diplomats from around the world say Trump has severely damaged faith in U.S. leadership and a Joe Biden victory in the Nov. 3 presidential election would bring even bigger sighs of relief in many capitals than those when George W. Bush's presidency ended more than a decade a ago.
They expect quick action by a Democratic administration to restore signature Obama-era policies, starting with the climate accord.
But despite the widespread ill-feeling Trump has provoked, not all his policy legacy will be hurled out of the window, and neither long-term allies nor strategic rivals expect a soft touch from Biden, vice president under Obama and a former senator with decades of foreign policy experience. 
They also do not expect much change from the inward-looking tendency embodied by Trump's ""America first"" approach.
""We are really in a period of transition of defining a new American policy in power politics, with China, with Russia ... so it's a new world,"" said Gerard Araud, France's former ambassador to Washington.
""American presidents will be more committed to the national interest of the U.S. The U.S. doesn't want to be the policeman of the world any more; I think Obama and Trump understood that.""
TRUMP'S CHALLENGE TO CHINA
While the Trump administration has provoked some alarm with the tone of its recent attacks on China on issues ranging from the coronavirus to espionage, there is broad agreement little will change in substance under a Biden government when it comes to policy towards Beijing.
Indeed, while Trump has sought to portray both Obama and Biden as ""soft"" on China, the previous administration pursued a tougher line against Beijing than Trump did initially.
""In the last two years of Obama, they had a new China strategy,"" said Michael Pillsbury, a former U.S. defense official and China analyst who has worked as an outside adviser to Trump. ""Many people think this was a Trump invention; it's not.""
He noted that Biden advisers Ely Ratner, Kurt Campbell, Brian McKeon, Tony Blinken, Bob Work and Ash Carter had produced tough analyses on China and shared deep concerns about its military buildup, espionage activities and trade practices.
Peter Ricketts, a national security adviser to former British Prime Minister David Cameron, had some praise for Trump's China approach, but also a warning.
""The Trump administration crystallized a growing concern about China's activities, including its much more assertive foreign policy and its crackdown at home. 
""Trump's willingness to come forward and challenge that, to call China out, that's been positive. The risk is that it could now go too far and pitch into an all-out Cold War with China.""
Tom Fletcher, a foreign-policy adviser to three past British prime ministers, said he did not expect big changes on China under a Biden administration, but a less abrasive style.
""I don't think the Biden policy will be a million miles away from the Trump China policy. But the language will be different, and there will be more wisdom and strategy behind it,"" he said.
Some analysts say Trump's unprecedented but still unsuccessful engagement with North Korea could offer a future building block. Biden has called Trump's personal diplomacy a ""vanity project"" that should only happen with a strategy to move North Korean denuclearization forward.
HIT TO AMERICAN CREDIBILITY
David O'Sullivan, the former EU ambassador to Washington, said Trump had a ""hugely damaging effect"" and it would take time to rebuild America's image and leadership role.
But he had articulated some deeply felt concerns among Americans about the extent of U.S. overseas involvements and a feeling that some allies were not pulling their weight.
""There will be no tears shed in Europe if Trump loses the election,"" O'Sullivan said. ""This administration has been particularly inept, and particularly maladroit and, frankly has tended to alienate allies and give comfort to people who previously have been considered adversaries.
""Equally, I don't think anyone is under the illusion that a Biden administration will herald a kind of golden era of European-U.S. cooperation ... the differences will remain, but we will start from a point of mutual respect.""
O'Sullivan and others said Biden would likely seek to revive the Iran agreement and Asia trade deal, but not without revisions to secure the sort of ""better deal"" Trump often talks about getting.
While relations can be patched up, experts said scars will remain from Trump's abrasive approach that could affect the willingness of countries to stick their necks out to follow American leads. 
""The fundamental faith in American constancy has been shaken,"" said Adam Ereli, a State Department spokesman under George W. Bush and an ambassador to Bahrain under Obama.

""In the back of their minds will be, 'Could Trump happen again?'""

Details were not available, and it was not clear whether China would work with the 25-year-old Mekong River Commission (MRC), or if it would keep the data-sharing within its own Lancang Mekong Cooperation (LMC) organisation. 
""China is willing to offer more assistance within its capacity to other Lancang-Mekong countries for better utilizing water resources,"" Prime Minister Li Keqiang was quoted as saying by the Xinhua News Agency.
He spoke at a video-conference summit of leaders of the six LMC members: China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
Two years of record drought on the 4,350-km (2,700-mile) Mekong River have been devastating for many the 60 million people who depend on it for fishing and farming.
A report published by a U.S. research company this year accused China's 11 dams on the upper stretches of the river of holding back large amounts of water during a drought last year, a finding China disputed. 
China has no water treaties with the lower Mekong countries and only shares limited data during the monsoon season on flows on the upper stretch of what it calls the Lancang River. 
Thai government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri told Reuters specifics on data-sharing would be worked out in coming months.
""Details will be discussed among relevant ministers from the six countries,"" he said.
Downstream countries say they need more data from China to help them make plans and request adjustments in the river’s flow.
Thailand also urged the China-backed LMC, set up in 2016, to work with experts at the Mekong River Commission (MRC) when developing its information-sharing platform, the government said in a statement.
Management of the Mekong has become another front in the battle for influence between China and the United States, with the U.S. ambassador to Thailand describing China as setting up the LMC as a way to set the agenda on developing the waterway.
The MRC traces its origins back to U.S. efforts to promote development during the Cold War. It works with the governments of Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam to foster the sharing and sustainable development of the river and its resources.

Officials at the MRC say it welcomes cooperation with the LMC and China.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - More than two weeks after a massive explosion tore through Beirut killing 181 people and leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins, Sandra Abinader still jumps at the slightest sound. 
""The other day, I was trying to open a jar and the popping sound made me jump back and scream. I felt for a second I needed to run away.""
Despite recognising the magnitude of her ordeal, Sandra, 18, said she was not interested in seeking professional help. ""We're used to dealing with our problems on our own,"" she said, stoically. 
Her attitude is common in Lebanon, a country hardened by past wars and sectarian conflict and where stigma still rules attitudes towards mental health.
But the blast caught Lebanon at an extremely vulnerable point following months of severe economic crisis compounded by the coronavirus pandemic.
Now practitioners are warning of a national mental health emergency as people begin to show signs of trauma from the explosion, including nightmares, flashbacks, crying, anxiety, anger and exhaustion. 
Psychologists say this is being exacerbated by the constant stream of images on Lebanese TV and social media showing the blast and its bloody aftermath.
""Every time we say it can't get worse in Lebanon, it somehow does,"" said Jad Daou, a volunteer with Lebanese mental health NGO Embrace, who mans the phones at its crisis clinic. ""A lot of people are feeling hopeless about the entire situation here in Lebanon.""
The explosion was a tipping point. Embrace, which usually receives between 150-200 calls a month, says more people have been reaching out since the blast. The group has stationed volunteers in one of the affected neighbourhoods and has started home visits.
Many mental health professionals have mobilised in the wake of the blast to offer their services and post tips on social media, but some are struggling to cope themselves.
""I never had psychologists say, 'we are not ready to talk at this moment. I need time to heal for myself,'"" said psychologist Warde Bou Daher. ""But the trauma affected everyone … they need to heal their own wounds before being able to help others.""
While Sandra insists she has not cried once since it happened, her cousin cannot hold back tears as she recounts her experience of the explosion, which wounded 6,000 people and was so loud it could be heard as far as Cyprus, 100 miles (160 kms) away.
When the blast hit, Lourdes Fakhri ran from the supermarket where she works to her home in the Karantina neighbourhood near the port, one of the worst affected, fearing that her family had been killed.
""There was rubble everywhere, so high. I could picture them all lying there on the floor, with our house on top of them.""
Lourdes' parents and six siblings survived but the feeling of terror has remained with her. 
For older Lebanese, the blast triggered memories of the 1975-1990 civil war and the 2006 war with Israel among others.
Many have never dealt with their traumas and don't know how to help their children, said Ola Khodor, a 25-year-old child psychologist.
""A lot are telling their children that nothing happened, that it was a game,"" Khodor said. ""The child deserves to know the truth – not the very detailed truth, but they deserve to know what exactly happened to allow them to grieve and to process the event like they need to.""
Experts say trauma begins to set in several weeks after an event, as people progress out of a period of ""acute stress"". Unicef on Friday estimated that half of the children they have surveyed in Beirut are already showing signs.

One father told Reuters that when his four-year-old son came back home for the first time after the explosion, he invented a game called ""pretend boom"" in which his playhouse was hit by an explosion and rabbits needed rescue from the broken glass.

Indonesia has reported more than 155,000 coronavirus infections and 6,759 deaths as of Monday, the highest number of fatalities in Southeast Asia. 
Authorities halted international tourism in early April as the outbreak picked up pace. 
Governor Wayan Koster said in a statement that plans to open up Bali to foreign tourists were postponed because the ""situation in Indonesia isn’t conducive to allow international tourists to visit the country, including Bali."" 
A decision on when foreign tourism could resume would depend on the ""assessment of the situation in and outside of the country"", said Koster in the statement signed on Saturday.
""Bali cannot fail because it could adversely impact the image of Indonesia including Bali in the eyes of the world, which could prove counter-productive to the recovery of travel,"" he said.
Tourism is Bali's main source of income and travel restrictions due to the pandemic have hammered the local economy.
The occupancy rate at Bali's starred hotels plunged to 2.07% in May, according to Bali's statistics bureau, from 62.55% in December before the pandemic hit and down from 51.56% in May 2019.
Bali opened up travel to local tourists on July 31, and Koster estimated 2,300-2,500 tourists came onto the island each day from then until August 14.
Bali has reported 4,576 coronavirus infections and 52 deaths as of Monday.

The treasure was discovered on Aug. 18, the Israel Antiquities Authority said on Monday, by teenagers volunteering at an excavation in central Israel where a new neighbourhood is planned to be built.
""The person who buried this treasure 1,100 years ago must have expected to retrieve it and even secured the vessel with a nail so that it would not move. We can only guess what prevented him from returning to collect this treasure,"" said excavation director Liat Nadav-Ziv.

MANILA (Reuters) - A bombing in a town on a restive southern Philippines island killed nine people and wounded dozens on Monday, among them soldiers and civilians, the military said, with Islamist militants suspected of being behind the attack.
Two explosions believed to be homemade bombs were triggered within one hour of each other in the main urban centre on the island of Jolo, a stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf, a militant group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
It was the biggest attack in the town since January 2019, when twin suicide bombings before Sunday service at a Jolo church killed more than 20 people and wounded at least 100. 
A faction of Abu Sayyaf was blamed for that attack, which Philippine authorities said involved Indonesian bombers. 
The first blast on Monday happened around noon in front of a food centre, outside of which two military trucks were parked, the army said. A second blast followed later, but there were no immediate reports of casualties from that incident. 
That first bomb killed five soldiers and four civilians and 16 military personnel were among dozens wounded, said Lieutenant general Corleto Vinluan, head of the Western Mindanao command.
Lieutenant Colonel Ronaldo Mateo, a military spokesman, said the bomb was attached to a parked motorcycle. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility and police said an investigation was underway. 
Abu Sayyaf was founded in the 1990s with its roots in a separatist cause that it long since abandoned. It is active in the Sulu archipelago of Mindanao, where hundreds of military have been deployed to try to destroy the group, which has been linked to Islamic State and al Qaeda. 
The group's various factions have grabbed headlines, most recently for suicide bombings, but also for banditry, piracy and kidnap for ransom, for which it has become notorious for beheading captives, among them westerners.

Hogan apologised again on Sunday for attending the event after Ireland's prime minister and deputy prime minister asked him to consider his position. An EU official said Hogan would not heed the calls to resign.
The golf dinner has infuriated Irish people who have been unable to attend funerals or had to cancel holidays or weddings because of some of the strictest COVID-19 rules in Europe. 
It has led to other political resignations, including a cabinet minister, and Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Sunday said that it had damaged the national effort to fight COVID-19 at a time when infections are rising.
Signalling that the controversy had not been shrugged off in Brussels, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asked Hogan to deliver a full report of what happened, shortly after which Irish media reported details of the police incident.
""While driving in County Kildare, he (Hogan) was stopped by a Garda (police officer) for using his mobile phone while driving,"" a spokesman for Hogan said late on Sunday, confirming that the politician had been cautioned for the offence.
Kildare was in a local lockdown after a spike in COVID-19 cases when Hogan returned briefly to his apartment to collect what his spokesman described as personal belongings and essential work documents relating to trade negotiations between the EU and United States.
The local lockdown guidelines provide for exceptional travel outside the county ""to travel to work and home again"", the spokesman added.

SEREMBAN, Malaysia (Reuters) - A Malaysian court opened an inquest on Monday into the death of an Irish teenager whose body was found near a jungle stream, 10 days after she went missing during a family holiday at a rainforest resort. 
The naked body of Nora Anne Quoirin, 15, who suffered from learning difficulties, was found in a ravine near the Dusun resort in Seremban, about 70 km (44 miles) south of the Malaysian capital in August last year.
Police ruled out abduction as a motive, saying they had found no sign of foul play, but her family questioned the findings and said she had never before left them voluntarily. 
The inquest aimed to answer questions including ""when and where did the deceased die, how and in what manner the deceased came by her death, and ... whether there is any person who was criminally concerned in the cause of death"", coroner Maimoonah Aid told the court. 
Government lawyer Muhamad Iskandar Ahmad said 64 witnesses were expected to be called during the two-week inquest at the Seremban Coroner’s Court.
Quoirin was from London and had an Irish mother and French father.
The family will not attend the inquest but the hearing is being streamed online.
Authorities had previously said an autopsy established that Quoirin had died from internal bleeding, probably caused by prolonged hunger and stress. She had suffered intestinal damage and died two or three days before her body was found, officials said.
The forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy found some small scratches on Quoirin's legs but ruled that they would not have contributed to her death, police said.

The family feared a criminal connection to the disappearance, saying she had special needs and had never before left them voluntarily, a British victims' group, the Lucie Blackman Trust, said last year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to take care of his health and do his utmost at his job, he said on Monday, after a second hospital visit within days sparked concern whether he could stay on as leader of the world's third biggest economy.
The visit came as Japan's longest-serving prime minister surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago, adding to speculation Abe could resign after reaching the milestone.
Abe, criticised for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak and some scandals, has suffered a slide in voter support to one of the lowest levels since returning to office for a second term in 2012 with promises to revive the economy and bolster defence.
""I'd like to take care of my health and do my best at my job,"" Abe told reporters at his official residence, after visiting a Tokyo hospital where he said he had received results of an exam done last week and undergone additional examinations.
Abe, who turns 66 next month, also said he wanted to speak again later about his medical tests.
Earlier, government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said Abe was having a follow-up to a check a week ago when his examination lasted 7-1/2 hours, fuelling worries about his health.
But major broadcaster Nippon TV said Abe was being treated for a chronic illness rather than a check-up, citing multiple unidentified government and ruling party sources.
Abe has been prime minister since 2012 in his second stint after a troubled term from which he resigned abruptly in 2007, because of struggles with ulcerative colitis, a disease he now keeps in check with medicine that was not previously available.
""NOT AT ALL"" WORRIED
His office did not give a detailed explanation for the hospital visits, but close aide Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said last week's visit was a regular check-up and he was ""not at all"" worried about Abe's health.
Japanese media have speculated about Abe's health this month, including detailed reports on his walking speed.
Weekly magazine Flash said Abe had vomited blood at his office on July 6. Reuters was unable to verify the widely cited report, which was denied by government officials.
Abe gets a regular check-up twice a year, with his most recent on June 13, Kyodo news agency said, adding that last week's visit was a follow-up to a June check-up, citing a hospital source.
If Abe is incapacitated, Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, 79, who doubles as finance minister, would take over temporarily as acting prime minister. 
If Abe says he has decided to resign, he would stay on until formally replaced, which requires a ruling Liberal Democratic Party presidential election, followed by the winner's formal election in parliament. 
Abe's tenure as LDP president, and thus, premier, ends in September 2021 unless he steps down earlier.
Those tipped as possible successors include Aso, former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, ex-foreign minister Fumio Kishida, Suga, and Defence Minister Taro Kono. 
All are veteran LDP lawmakers unlikely to make huge policy shifts, despite differing over details. 
But any successor may find it tough to emulate Abe's political longevity, which followed years of revolving-door premiers and was aided by the strong economy, tight control over bureaucrats and weak opposition parties.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's main opposition Congress Party called a meeting of its highest decision-making body on Monday, following a letter from almost two dozen top leaders seeking changes to the way the party is run. 
Long a dominant force in Indian politics, the Congress has suffered two heavy defeats in general elections by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, led by current Prime Minster Narendra Modi. 
The letter, that calls for better decision making within the party, is a rare challenge to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, that has dominated the Congress since India won independence from colonial power Great Britain in 1947. 
The signatories of the letter expect the Gandhi family to either play a proactive role or step down, according to two sources in the party. Over 300 regional Congress politicians have also supported the letter, they added. 
Local media reported the party's interim president Sonia Gandhi would offer to resign, though several figures in the party, including the chief ministers of Congress-led states, have publicly backed her to continue. 
""News of 23 senior most Congress leaders writing (a) letter... is unbelievable and if it is true - it’s very unfortunate,"" Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said in a tweet, calling for Sonia Gandhi to stay on. 
Supporters of the Gandhi family stood outside party headquarters in the capital New Delhi on Monday, holding placards and shouting slogans. 
A meeting of the Congress Working Committee is scheduled to begin at 1500 local time on Monday (0930 GMT)
Sonia Gandhi took over de-facto leadership of the party last year from her son Rahul. His father, grandmother and great-grandfather have all served as Prime Minster of India.

Instead, the spread of the coronavirus has halted new orders and stalled overseas travel, including to and from the United States. He is now holding off on producing a replica of Joe Biden.
""Tourist sites, amusement parks, houses of famous people are temporarily not open,"" Zeng said. ""Since they can't resume work, we can't get new orders.""
Shanghay Maiyi Arts was founded in 2012 as a manufacturer and supplier of wax figures.
Located in the outskirts of Shanghai, about an hour's drive from the city centre, its exhibition hall also doubles as makeshift museum, where guests can pose next to replicas of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, martial arts star Jackie Chan, and others.
Zeng says that by 2019, the company was shipping up to 700 figures annually to customers, with about one-third going overseas.
The virus, however, hit orders twice: first in China, when factories and tourist sites closed, and then overseas. Business remains about two-thirds its normal size, Zeng says.
Zeng says that the hardest part of making a replica is the face. It can take a month alone to design and sculpt perfect features. 
The company uses specialists to make a replica's hair and clothing. It can take three months to bring a figure to fruition, from start to finish.
Although Trump is the company's best-selling model in the United States, in China, the top seller is something closer to home: a replica of a security guard, asleep and slumped in a chair, brings in the most orders.

Last year the shop produced 16 Trump wax statues, six of which went abroad.

Floodwaters caused by unusually heavy rainfall dragged debris and vehicles along a road, leaving them buried in mud, footage from the province of Giresun showed. Residents were seen clearing streets, as construction machines lifted the debris and cleared roads.
Several roads have been blocked due to overflowing streams, while power outages were experienced in various parts of the region. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Sunday power was restored to some areas, but the damage to infrastructure was extensive.
Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said in a statement that 157 people had so far been rescued with efforts from nearly a thousand aid workers. It said efforts were underway to re-open 83 roads, adding that the agency had sent 9 million lira ($1.23 million) in emergency funds to the region.

303,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>",Turkey’s Record Gold Output Is All Headed for the Central Bank,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey is poised to produce a record amount of gold this year and the central bank will probably buy all of it -- at prices near record highs.
Production by one of the world’s top buyers of the precious metal is expected to increase 16% to 44 tons this year, Hasan Yucel, the head of Turkey’s Gold Miners Association, said in an interview.
Legislation introduced in 2017 gives the central bank the first right of refusal to purchase gold mined in the country at prevailing market prices. The value of its gold reserves surged to an all-time high in the week through Aug. 7, only to drop 5% a week later, the biggest decline in five months. That effectively mirrored the moves in market prices over the same period.
“The central bank has always been our only buyer since the legislation was changed,” Yucel said, predicting that the trend is unlikely to change this year.
The value of the central bank’s stockpiles have surged even as it ran down foreign-exchange reserves to an almost 15-year low to support its weakening currency.
Turks are big consumers of the commodity, which is used as a traditional gift for events ranging from weddings to circumcision ceremonies. It’s typically also used by merchants inside Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, one of the world’s oldest covered markets, to pay rent.
That’s helped keep local demand at about 160 tons for the past 25 years, and consumers are expected to buy at least 150 tons, Yucel said.
The central bank, based in Ankara, had 583 tons of gold reserves at the end of June, according to the World Gold Council. While it’s still far behind top holders like the U.S. or Germany, the Turkish regulator has been the biggest bullion buyer so far this year, adding about 170 tons to its stockpile. In terms of consumer demand, Turkey is the fifth largest.
A spokesman for the central bank declined to comment on its purchasing strategy.
The jump in gold prices has boosted appetite among local investors to produce the metal, even though local consumer demand has cooled as a result, said Yucel, who is also the chief executive officer of Nurol Holding AS’s gold-mining unit, Tumad Madencilik AS.
The industry has attracted $6 billion of investment in exploration in the past three decades, he said.
A Canadian mining company, which Yucel didn’t identify, Nurol, Guris Holding AS and Calik Holding AS plan to invest at least $100 million in western Turkey’s Canakkale and Balikesir regions, or in Artvin province, in the northeastern tip of the country bordering Georgia, Yucel said.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2020 11:50PM ET</span>",How does Japan's Abe score on his policy agenda?,"By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the nation's longest serving premier, visited a Tokyo hospital on Monday as concerns deepened about his ability to continue in his post due to health issues and fatigue from handling the coronavirus crisis.
Here are key elements of Abe's record since returning to office in December 2012. He ended a first troubled 2006-2007 term as premier by quitting abruptly, citing ill health.
COVID-19 RESPONSE, SCANDALS
Japan has not suffered an explosive virus outbreak, but a recent rise in infections has fuelled concern that Abe is putting too much emphasis on the economy over health.
Abe has drawn fire for an initial response to the outbreak that critics called clumsy and, more recently, for a seeming lack of leadership, including few media appearances.
Dissatisfaction with his response, as well as scandals such as the arrest of a former justice minister and his lawmaker wife on suspicion of vote-buying, have eroded Abe's ratings.
A Kyodo news agency weekend survey showed Abe's voter support at 36.0%, down from 38.8% the previous month and the second lowest since he returned to office in 2012.
""ABENOMICS""
Abe's signature ""Abenomics"" policies of bold monetary easing and fiscal spending encountered headwinds last year as a U.S.-China trade war hit exports and a sales tax rise hurt business and consumer sentiment.
Now the pandemic has hit Japan with its biggest economic slump on record. A third straight quarter of declines knocked real gross domestic product (GDP) to decade-low levels, wiping out the benefits of ""Abenomics"".
Critics have also said Abe relied too heavily on his monetary and fiscal policy without following through on a pledge of a ""third arrow"" of structural reform to achieve long-term growth despite a fast-ageing and shrinking population.
SECURITY
Abe bolstered defence spending after years of declines and expanded the military's ability to project power abroad.
In a historic shift in 2014, his government reinterpreted the post-war, pacifist constitution to allow troops to fight overseas for the first time since World War Two.
The following year, legislation ended a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defence, or defending a friendly country under attack.
Faced with divided public opinion, however, Abe has not achieved his long-held goal of revising the U.S.-drafted constitution by writing the Self-Defense Forces, as Japan's military in known, into the pacifist Article 9.
PERSONNEL APPOINTMENTS
By creating a Personnel Affairs Bureau at the cabinet, Abe and his right-hand aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, gained greater control over appointments of bureaucrats, who for decades have dominated policymaking, shifting the balance of policy power toward politicians.
DIPLOMACY
Abe has cultivated warm personal ties with U.S. President Donald Trump, averting worst-case outcomes on trade. He has overseen a cautious improvement in ties with China, although a territorial row and Beijing's clampdown on Hong Kong are causing strains. Relations with South Korea turned frigid due to disputes over the wartime past.
Abe has made little progress toward resolving a long-running feud with Russia over disputed islands seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War Two. The row has kept the two countries from signing a formal peace treaty ending the war.

Nor has Abe been able to settle a feud with North Korea over Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang's agents in the 1970s and 1980s, an issue he put at the centre of his political career.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The man who killed 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand in 2019 meticulously planned his shooting rampage to maximise casualties, a prosecutor said at the start of sentencing hearings on Monday.
Australian Brenton Tarrant, 29, has pleaded guilty to 51 murder charges, 40 charges of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist act in relation to the massacre in the city of Christchurch which he livestreamed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
He faces a life prison term, possibly without parole in what would be a first for New Zealand, when a High Court judge sentences him later this week.
Handcuffed and dressed in grey prison clothes, Tarrant sat with hands clasped for most of the morning's proceedings. He showed little emotion, and looked directly at those delivering victim impact statements.
Crown prosecutor Barnaby Hawes said Tarrant told police after his arrest that he wanted to create fear among the Muslim population.
""He intended to instil fear into those he described as invaders, including the Muslim population or more generally non-European immigrants,"" Hawes said.
Tarrant also expressed regret for not taking more lives and had planned to burn the mosques down, Hawes said. 
The shooter spent years purchasing high-powered firearms, researched mosque layouts by flying a drone over his primary target, and timed his March 15 attacks to maximise casualties, the prosecutor said.
The shooter went to Christchurch about two months before the attack and flew a drone directly over the Al Noor mosque, with a focus on its entry and exit points. 
While most of Tarrant's victims were at Al Noor mosque, he attacked a second mosque before being detained en route to a third.
The attacks prompted a global outpouring of grief as well as scrutiny, with regulations imposed on online platforms after the then 28-year-old live-streamed the mosque shootings shortly after uploading a manifesto.
Gamal Fouda, imam of Al Noor mosque, told Tarrant that he was ""misguided and misled"" and that his hatred was unnecessary.
""I can say to the family of the terrorist that they have lost a son and we have lost many from our community too,"" Fouda said.
""I respect them because they are suffering as we are.""
Security is tight outside the court, with police dogs pacing the streets and snipers on rooftops, television footage showed.
With social distancing measures in place due to the re-emergence of coronavirus in New Zealand, a small public gallery is at the main court, with survivors and families of victims viewing the proceedings in seven overflow court rooms.
Live reporting from the courtroom is banned, and other restrictions have been put in place on what the media can report.
High Court judge Cameron Mander said that he had received more than 200 victim impact statements, along with submissions from various organisations. 
""I have read them all,"" said Mander, who added that he would not sentence Tarrant before Thursday morning after survivors and family members of victims had an opportunity to address the court.
A murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison. The judge can impose a life term without parole, a sentence that has never been used in New Zealand.

MINSK (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of protesters demanding Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko step down defied a warning from the military on Sunday and flooded into Minsk, briefly gathering near the president's residence, before dispersing peacefully.
The veteran leader denounced the demonstrators as ""rats"" and was seen in state media footage wearing body armour and holding a rifle, projecting an unyielding image amid the huge nationwide demonstrations that erupted after a disputed election on Aug. 9.
The protests have provided the biggest challenge yet to Lukashenko's 26 years at the helm and tested the loyalty of his security forces. 
Minsk's streets turned red and white as demonstrators carried flags symbolising their opposition to Lukashenko and chanted for him to leave power and for new elections to be held. 
The crowd marched towards Lukashenko's residence at the Independence Palace, on the northern edge of the capital, the majority gathering at some distance, while a smaller group approached to between 10 and 20 metres of the building, a Reuters witness said. 
Lukashenko, a former Soviet state farm boss, was shown in state media footage flying over the protests in a helicopter before landing at his residence and emerging in body armour with a rifle in his hand.
Some protesters milling below chanted ""coward"" as a helicopter was seen flying out of the residence, the Reuters witness said. 
Later, a video circulated by state media showed Lukashenko walking over to riot police outside his residence and thanking them, eliciting an outburst of applause from security staff.
It was the first time in this month's demonstrations that protesters have neared the building's doors. The approach to the palace took place after a crowd estimated by a Reuters witness to number as many as 200,000 rallied in central Minsk for the second weekend in a row. 
The crowd began to disperse in early evening. Reuters witnessed no clashes with police.
""They have scattered like rats,"" Lukashenko could be heard saying in a video clip published by the Belta news agency as he flew overhead.
Belarus state television said 20,000 people took part in the protest.
Earlier, the defence ministry said the army would deal with security around national World War Two memorials and issued a direct warning to protesters whom it likened to fascists.
""We categorically warn: any violation of peace and order in such places - you will have the army to deal with now, not the police,"" it said in a statement. ""We, soldiers, will not allow these places to be desecrated, there can be no fascism there!""
MOSCOW'S VIEW
Protests triggered by Lukashenko's claims of a landslide election victory on Aug. 9 found a leader in opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a former teacher who took her jailed husband's place on the ballot. 
Following threats to her safety, Tsikhanouskaya fled to neighbouring Lithuania.
Traditional ally Russia issued some of its strongest comments yet criticising Tsikhanouskaya on Sunday. 
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said her statements were directed at a Western audience. 
""It seems ... she has started to make political statements, harsh ones, demanding walk-outs, strikes, protests,"" Lavrov was cited by the RIA news agency as saying. 
He described her political agenda as the opposite of constructive, focused instead on creating disunity by generating anti-Russian sentiment and squeezing out the Russian language and culture, and by aiming to join the European Union and NATO.
Tsikhanouskaya, who speaks Russian at home, has said she would like to see Belarus maintain close relations with Russia, but that Belarus should remain independent and not integrate further into Russia.

Lavrov said that by calling for Lukashenko to quit, protesters were pushing for a Venezuela-style crisis.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Mediators from West Africa's regional bloc reached agreement on certain points in talks with Mali's military junta that are aimed at returning the country to civilian rule, the parties said on Sunday, adding that some outstanding issues remained.
The negotiations will continue on Monday, members of both delegations told journalists in Bamako. 
Leaders of the military junta led by Colonel Assimi Goita and mediators from West Africa's regional bloc led by Nigeria's former president, Goodluck Jonathan, met behind closed doors all day on Sunday.
""We have been able to agree on a number of points but not yet on all the discussions,"" Jonathan told reporters on Sunday night after negotiations that lasted around nine hours.
A spokesman for the military junta, Colonel Ismael Wague, said: ""We reached compromise on certain aspects and the negotiations will continue tomorrow.""
Neither gave details on what issues they had reached agreement on, and what were the outstanding issues.
A senior officer close to the junta told Reuters earlier on Sunday that discussion during the morning session had focused on the bloc's sanctions on Mali following the military coup.
Other key issues would include the fate of deposed President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, and details of Mali's transition to civilian rule.
French Radio RFI reported late on Sunday that the junta, known as the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP), proposed a three-year transition led by a soldier and made up of mostly soldiers. 
The report added that the junta was also ready to allow Keita to return to his home or leave the country.
A spokesman for the CNSP could not be reached for comments. 
The overthrow of Keita on Tuesday has been condemned abroad, but celebrated by many in a country battling an Islamist insurgency and months of political unrest following a disputed legislative election in March.
While the delegation arrived in Bamako on Saturday with the aim of reversing the coup, a diplomat told Reuters that reinstating Keita - who is being held by the junta - was out of the question, adding that the only thing it could achieve was a transition. 
The 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), weary of prolonged instability in Mali and the potential for similar power grabs in the region, have taken a hard line on the coup.

It suspended Mali from its decision-making institutions, shut borders and halted financial flows with the country.

Abe, 65, is planning to go to the Keio University Hospital in Tokyo to receive the results of tests he underwent last Monday, the paper said, citing multiple sources in the government and ruling party. Abe hasn’t commented on the reason for the tests.
Japan’s longest-serving prime minister suffers from chronic ulcerative colitis, a condition affecting the digestive tract that can be worsened by stress.

In 2007, he resigned from an abbreviated first term in office, saying a worsening of the illness made it impossible to carry out his duties. Speculation over Abe’s health has spread in recent weeks, as he appeared to be avoiding extended public appearances.
Abe returned to work last Wednesday and made a brief statement to reporters, saying he underwent tests to make sure that he is “doing everything possible to maintain my physical condition.”
Abe on Monday broke the record for most consecutive days as prime minister, surpassing the mark set by his great uncle Eisaku Sato.

The incident between Department of State Services (DSS) agents and members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) took place in southeastern Nigeria's Enugu state. 
DSS said two of its personnel were killed in what they called an unprovoked attack, while IPOB, in a statement, said 21 of their members were killed and more than 40 others arrested after security forces stormed one of their meetings. 
DSS did not immediately respond to queries on IPOB member deaths. IPOB described itself as a peaceful group and denied killing any DSS agents. 
IPOB leaders have called for secession in the region, where tensions have simmered since a Biafra separatist rebellion sparked a civil war in 1967-70 that killed an estimated one million people.
In 2017, Nigeria's armed forces designated IPOB as a ""terrorist organisation"" after it stepped up calls for secession. 
Amnesty International in 2016 accused Nigeria's security forces of killing at least 150 Biafra separatists at peaceful rallies. The military and police denied the allegations.

Protesters marched to the headquarters of the Government of National Accord (GNA) to voice anger over what they called a ""slow death"" due to collapsing public services, corruption and economic pressures, before heading to central Tripoli's Martyrs Square, where they were scattered by gunfire.
The area was later closed off amid heavy security. The Interior Ministry blamed ""infiltrators"" for violence against peaceful protesters that left one person injured, and said it was investigating.
The protest came two days after GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj announced a ceasefire in Libya's long-running conflict and called for the lifting of an oil blockade by rival authorities based in the east of the country.
For more than five years, Libya has been divided into rival camps based in the east and west. In June, Turkish military support for the GNA forced the eastern-based Libyan National Army to retreat from a 14-month offensive on Tripoli.
The LNA has received backing from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia in a conflict that has become an arena for regional rivalries. Front lines have settled for weeks round the LNA-held city of Sirte, in the centre of Libya's coastline, and Jufra to the south.
LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari dismissed Sarraj's ceasefire announcement as a ploy.
""The initiative that Sarraj signed is for media marketing,"" Mismari said. ""There is a military buildup and the transfer of equipment to target our forces in Sirte."" 
Mismari made no reference to a parallel ceasefire call also issued on Friday by the head of Libya's eastern-based parliament, Aguila Saleh.
Saleh has gained influence compared with LNA commander Khalifa Haftar since the LNA's retreat.
Some of the protesters in Tripoli carried white flags to show their lack of allegiance to any of Libya's main factions, and pictures of Sarraj, Haftar and Saleh with their faces crossed out in red.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's sister, a retired federal judge, called him a liar with ""no principles"" in audio recordings made public this weekend, the latest attack on the president's character in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election.
Maryanne Trump Barry, 83, also criticized the Republican president for ""phoniness"" and ""cruelty"" in interviews that were secretly recorded by her niece Mary Trump during a series of conversations in 2018 and 2019, according to The Washington Post, which obtained the recordings from her.
The remarks surfaced days before Republicans convene to back Trump for another four years in the election against Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Last week, more than 70 former Republican national security officials endorsed Biden, saying Trump had engaged in corrupt behavior ""that renders him unfit to serve as president.""
Trump dismissed his sister's remarks in a written statement.
“Every day it’s something else, who cares,"" he said. ""Our country will soon be stronger than ever before!”
Trump Barry could not immediately be reached for comment.
In one of the recordings, some of which were also obtained by Reuters, Trump Barry addressed the president's suggestion in 2018 - while she was still a sitting judge - that he might send her to the border to deal with a surge in migrants. 
“All he wants to do is appeal to his base,” Trump Barry said. “He has no principles. None.""
Mary Trump, the president's niece and a trained psychologist, published a tell-all book in July in which she concluded he likely suffers from narcissism and other clinical disorders.

Chris Bastardi, a spokesman for Mary Trump, said she taped the conversations as part of a legal dispute over her inheritance following the death of Fred Trump Sr., the president's father and her grandfather, ""in order to protect herself.""

Szijjarto rejected the accusations but did not specify where the comments by Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth were published. 
His spokesman, however, told Reuters that Szijjarto was referring to an interview with website t-online.de published late on Friday in which Roth criticised Hungary and Poland for an erosion of democratic culture and also said one aspect that ""led to the Article 7 case against Hungary was rampant anti-semitism in Hungary"".
The EU invoked Article 7 of its governing treaty against Hungary in 2018, having invoked the procedure for the first time against Poland in 2017, for flouting the rule of law. The process could lead to the suspension of their EU voting rights if all other capitals agreed.
In the past few years, Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, in power since 2010, has also angered the EU with his harsh anti-immigration stance and a 2017 campaign against U.S. financier George Soros which critics said had anti-Semitic undertones. The government rejected that accusation.
Orban has pledged zero tolerance for anti-Semitism.

Szijjarto said on Sunday that the Jewish community was safe in Hungary, and shrugged off Roth's remarks, calling on him ""to stop the unworthy attacks on the Hungarian people"".

DUBAI (Reuters) - A fire at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility last month was the result of sabotage, the spokesman for Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation told state TV channel al-Alam on Sunday. 
""The explosion at Natanz nuclear facility was a result of sabotage operations, security authorities will reveal in due time the reason behind the blast,"" said Behrouz Kamalvandi. 
Iran's top security body in July said that the cause of the fire had been determined but would be announced later. Iranian officials said that the fire had caused significant damage that could slow the development of advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges.
The Natanz uranium-enrichment site, much of which is underground, is one of several Iranian facilities monitored by inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. nuclear watchdog.
Some Iranian officials have said the fire may have been the result of cyber sabotage, and have warned that Tehran would retaliate against any country carrying out such attacks.
An article by Iran's state news agency IRNA in July addressed what it called the possibility of sabotage by enemies such as Israel and the United States, although it stopped short of accusing either directly.
Israeli officials declined to comment on Sunday. 
The IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said on Saturday he will make his first trip to Tehran in that role on Monday to pressure Iran to grant inspectors access to two suspected former atomic sites. 
The IAEA suspects activities possibly related to developing nuclear weapons were carried out in the early 2000s at these sites. Iran insists its nuclear programme has no military dimensions.
""Iran has not opposed access to its nuclear facilities, but the IAEA's questions and allegations should be based on serious evidence and documents,"" Kamalvandi said. 
Iranian officials said on Sunday that Grossi's visit was not related to the U.S. push at the U.N. Security Council to reimpose international sanctions on Tehran, Iran's state TV reported.

Washington maintains strict sanctions against Iran’s oil industry to try to halt the country’s nuclear program. Earlier this year, Tehran sent several gasoline cargoes to Venezuela to help it overcome fuel shortages, as well as equipment to help state oil company PDVSA repair its dilapidated refineries.
“We are helping each other,” Maduro said in an interview broadcast on state television. “I think the Iranian experience will help us reinforce our management capacity.”
He did not provide further details of how Iran was helping, noting he should maintain “silence since we are in a war.”
Washington's sanctions on PDVSA are meant to pressure Maduro, a socialist accused of rigging his 2018 re-election, to resign. Earlier this month, the United States seized four cargoes of Iranian gasoline en route to Venezuela. 
The growing ties between Iran and Venezuela are concerning other countries in the region. Colombian President Ivan Duque said this week Maduro was eyeing missile purchases from Iran, which Venezuelan officials denied.

But in the interview, Maduro said Duque’s statement was a “good idea” he had not yet considered. “If it is possible and convenient, we will buy those missiles,” he said.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's premier-designate plans to gather the ministries of finance, investment and state property into a single department to be led by economist Ali Kooli under plans to revamp government and revive the economy, political sources said.
Hichem Mechichi, a political independent, is expected to announce his technocratic government's 23 ministers within the next few days, the sources told Reuters on Sunday. Kooli is CEO of Arab Banking Corporation(ABC Bank) in Tunisia.
Mechichi was proposed by President Kais Saied last month to replace Elyes Fakhfakh, who quit over allegations of conflict of interest, deepening a political crisis at a time when international lenders are asking Tunis to make painful reforms.
Authorities have been struggling to defuse constant protests over widespread unemployment, lack of investment for development and poor health, electricity and water services.
Western countries have hailed Tunisia for its comparatively successful transition to democracy since the 2011 revolution that ended decades of autocratic rule.
Many Tunisians have grown frustrated since then over economic stagnation, a decline in living standards and decay in public services while political parties often seem more focused on staying in office instead of tackling problems.
Mechichi, 46, needs to form a government capable of winning a confidence vote in parliament by a simple majority by Wednesday or face dissolution of parliament by the president and another election, deepening instability.
Mechichi said earlier this month his government would focus on rescuing public finances and easing social hardships, saying that while political turmoil had dragged out, ""some Tunisians have not found drinking water"".
Tunisia's tourism-dependent economy shrank 21.6 pct in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the same period last year, due to the coronavirus crisis.
The government said last month it had asked four creditor countries to delay debt repayments, as it announced more pessimistic economic and budget forecasts for 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The U.S. ambassador to Tashkent, Daniel Rosenblum, said this month he was ""deeply concerned"" by the case of Bobomurod Abdullayev and called for his release. Abdullayev was detained in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan at Uzbekistan's request.
Abdullayev has told Kyrgyz media he was accused of being behind an anonymous Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account that published allegations of corruption among senior Uzbek officials. He denied that accusation.
Uzbekistan's state security service did not confirm or deny the nature of the charges, but said on Sunday he has been allowed to go home after his extradition from Kyrgyzstan on Saturday and subsequent questioning in the presence of a lawyer.
The lawyer, Sergei Mayorov, told Reuters Abdullayev has been released pending investigation. He said a non-disclosure agreement prevented him from commenting on the nature of the charges.
State security also circulated a video in which Abdullayev thanked President Shavkat Mirziyoyev for his release and said he had published no stories attacking the country's leadership.
Abdullayev came to prominence in a landmark case in 2018 when an Uzbek court cleared him of charges of conspiring against the government, although he was still sentenced to community service for anti-government propaganda.
His case highlighted a thaw initiated under Mirziyoyev following the 27-year rule of his predecessor Islam Karimov who had tolerated no dissent and whose poor human rights record had drawn strong criticism from Western countries.

In power since 2016, Mirziyoyev has overseen a series of major economic reforms and worked to limit the powers of security services while improving ties with both the West and Russia as he seeks to attract foreign investment.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli authorities on Sunday erased a ""Peeping Toms"" mural that had long been a fixture at a Tel Aviv beach, responding to public outrage over the suspected gang rape of a 16-year-old girl in the southern resort of Eilat.
Painted 18 years ago and often criticised as sexist, the mural was removed by a municipal worker with a paint roller from the exterior wall of a women's changing room. The image showed two young men in bathing suits peering inside.
It was a nod to the beach's name - ""Metzizim"", Hebrew for ""Peeping Toms"" - identical to the title of a 1972 Israeli cult film about a lifeguard who spies on his friends' sexual escapades at the seashore.
The mural, located at what the Lonely Planet guide describes as ""actually a family-friendly beach"" on the Mediterranean, had previously survived defacement by women's rights groups, which complained that sexual assault cases in Israel are not prosecuted thoroughly.
But Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai said on Sunday it was time for the painting to go in the wake of the assault against the teenage girl at Eilat, on the Red Sea, on Aug. 12. 
""Freedom of expression and the arts are important values in our city, but because the painting was seen as acceptance of a forbidden and criminal act, we have decided to say goodbye to it,"" Huldai wrote on Twitter.
Police said they would ask a court later in the day to extend the detention of three suspects arrested so far in the rape case. The teenager's lawyer said one of them told police that about 30 men had waited in line to rape her.
Israeli media reports said police believed the number of those involved was far smaller.
In demonstrations in several cities last week and on social media, Israelis have rallied against sexual violence. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement on Thursday, described the Eilat incident as ""a crime against humanity"".

Women's rights groups planned more protests for Sunday.

Before he collapsed on a flight during a trip to Siberia Navalny was followed by plainclothes FSB officers and his movements were closely monitored via CCTV, the report in the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper said.
Navalny, a long-time opponent of President Vladimir Putin and campaigner against corruption, was flown in an air ambulance on Saturday for treatment in Germany.
Navalny, 44, was in an induced coma when he was evacuated from the Siberian city of Omsk, but there has been no word yet from the Charite hospital in Berlin on his condition.
His team were due to host a briefing via YouTube on Sunday evening to discuss ""everything we know so far about Alexei's poisoning,"" but subsequently cancelled it saying they were not ready, press secretary Kira Yarmysh and campaign HQ head Leonid Volkov wrote on Twitter.
Citing security service sources, the Moskovsky Komsomolets described the timeline of his trip before he fell ill down to the number of rooms his team booked in a local hotel and the fact that Navalny chose not to sleep in the room booked under his name. 
An apartment rented for him by one of his supporters was discovered by police surveillance, the paper reported, when a sushi takeaway was ordered to the address by one of Navalny's supporters.
""The scale of the surveillance does not surprise me at all, we were perfectly aware of it before,"" Yarmysh wrote on Twitter. 
""What is surprising, however, is that (security service sources) did not shy away from describing it.""
In its report, the Moskovsky Komsomolets paper cited security sources as saying that their surveillance of Navalny's movements did not reveal any suspicious contacts that could be related to his illness.
Security services believe that if Navalny was poisoned, the incident took place either in the airport or on the plane, the newspaper wrote. 
However the paper said they are still awaiting results of laboratory tests of samples taken by police from all the places Navalny and his team visited on their trip, including samples of the air.
Initial results are expected on Monday, with results from tests for radioactive material due later in the week, the paper said. It did not say whether or not these would be made public.
Doctors at the hospital in Omsk where Navalny was treated before his evacuation to Germany have said they do not believe he was poisoned. They diagnosed him with a metabolic disease that may have been caused by low blood sugar.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that it was still unclear what caused Navalny to fall ill. He had previously said that any poisoning would need to be confirmed by laboratory tests and that doctors were doing everything they could to help Navalny.

The destruction of the 120,000-tonne capacity structure at the port, the main entry point for food imports, meant buyers must rely on smaller private storage facilities for their wheat purchases with no government reserves to fall back on.
Kuwait's ambassador to Lebanon, Abdulaal al-Qenaie, said in comments to local radio VdL at the weekend that the silo was first built in 1969 with a Kuwaiti development loan.
The Gulf monarchy will now rebuild the silo so it remains a symbol of ""how to manage relations between two brotherly countries that respect each other"", Qenaie was cited as saying. 
The port explosion killed at least 180 people, injured thousands and wrecked swathes of the Lebanese capital, pushing the government to resign.
The now caretaker economy minister, Raoul Nehme, has reassured the public that there would be no flour or bread crisis in Lebanon, which buys almost all its wheat from abroad. 
Plans for another grain silo in Lebanon's second largest port Tripoli were shelved years ago due to a lack of funding, a U.N. official, port official and regional grain expert told Reuters earlier this month.
Humanitarian aid has poured into Lebanon. But foreign donors have made clear they will not bail out the state without reforms to tackle entrenched corruption and negligence. 

Gulf Arab states who once gave Lebanon financial support have grown weary in recent years of the Iran-backed Hezbollah's expanding role in state affairs.

Brenton Tarrant disembarked a New Zealand air force plane at Christchurch Airport on Sunday afternoon, wearing a protective vest and helmet and escorted by armed officers, before being directed into the back of a white van, television footage showed.
He has pleaded guilty to 51 charges of murder, 40 charges of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist act.
Tarrant was transported to Christchurch, the city where the shootings occurred, from Auckland Prison at Paremoremo, the New Zealand Herald reported.
A court in Christchurch will begin multi-day sentencing hearings on Monday, where survivors of the attack and family members of those killed will deliver victim impact statements.
Tarrant, an Australian, will be sentenced after being allowed to make a statement.
Murder convictions carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison. The judge can impose a life term without the possibility of release, a sentence that has never been used in New Zealand.

CAMP TAJI, Iraq (Reuters) - United States-led international coalition troops withdrew from Iraq's Taji military base on Sunday and handed it over to Iraqi security forces, Reuters witnesses and the coalition said.
The base, 20 km (12 miles) north of Baghdad, had been the site of frequent rocket attacks by Iran-backed militias targeting U.S.-led troops in recent months.
""The movement of coalition military personnel is part of a long-range plan coordinated with the government of Iraq,"" the coalition said in a statement, adding that Camp Taji has historically held up to 2,000 coalition members, most of whom have departed this summer.
Remaining coalition troops will depart in the coming days after finalising the handing over of equipment to Iraqi security forces, it added. 
This was the eighth transfer of a coalition portion of an Iraqi base back to Iraqi forces, it said.
The withdrawal came days after U.S. President Donald Trump redoubled his promise to withdraw the few U.S. troops still in the country. The United States has had about 5,000 troops stationed in the country and coalition allies a further 2,500.
Iraq's parliament had voted this year for the departure of foreign troops from Iraq and U.S. and other coalition troops have been leaving as part of a drawdown.

Sudan has been normalising relations with the United States since the overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir in April 2019 but is still seeking removal from a list of countries the U.S. considers as state sponsors of terrorism.
Pompeo is also due to visit Israel and the United Arab Emirates on Monday and Tuesday following an accord between the two countries this month to forge full relations.
The Sudanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to give details of Pompeo's visit.
Ending the terrorism listing is a top priority for Sudan's transitional military-civilian ruling council and the government of technocrats that serves under it.
The listing dates to 1993 and makes Sudan, struggling with a deep economic crisis, technically ineligible for debt relief and financing from international lenders.
A senior government source told Reuters last week that significant progress was expected on the issue in the coming weeks.
In February, the head of Sudan's ruling council met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but cast doubt on any rapid normalisation of ties.

The announcement by the head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization marks the first official report on the contents of the cockpit voice and data recordings, which were sent to France for reading in July.
Tehran has said it accidentally shot down the Ukraine airliner in January, at a time of extreme tensions with the United States. All 176 people aboard the plane were killed.
""Nineteen seconds after the first missile hit the plane, the voices of pilots inside the cockpit, indicated that the passengers were alive ... 25 seconds later the second missile hit the plane,"" Touraj Dehghani-Zanganeh was cited as saying by state television. 
Iran has been in talks with Ukraine, Canada and other nations that had citizens aboard the downed plane, and who have demanded a thorough investigation into the incident.
""The data analysis from the blackboxes should not be politicised,"" Zanganeh said.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards shot down the Ukraine International Airlines flight with a ground-to-air missile on Jan. 8, just after the plane took off from Tehran, in what Tehran later acknowledged as a “disastrous mistake” by forces on high alert during a confrontation with the United States.

Iranian and Ukrainian officials have held talks on the compensation to families of the victims. Another round of talks is set for October.

The rare joint statement from the top health advisers to the governments of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland represents a boost for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who has said getting children back to school is a national priority.
Confidence in the government's approach to schooling during the coronavirus pandemic took a hit last week when education minister Gavin Williamson was forced into an embarrassing U-turn over examination results.
""Very few, if any, children or teenagers will come to long term harm from COVID-19 due solely to attending school,"" they said. ""This has to be set against a certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people from not attending school,"" the CMOs said in a joint statement published late on Saturday.
Evidence showed that a lack of schooling increased inequalities, reduced opportunities and could exacerbate physical and mental health issues, the statement said.
By contrast there was clear evidence of a very low rate of severe disease in children, even if they caught COVID-19, and an exceptionally low risk of dying.
""The percentage of symptomatic cases requiring hospitalisation is estimated to be 0.1% for children aged 0-9 and 0.3% among those aged 10-19, compared to a hospitalisation rate of over 4% in the UK for the general population,"" the statement said.
Johnson has said reopening schools in September is a social, economic and moral imperative, insisting they would be able to operate safely despite the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Separately, England's chief medical officer was quoted as saying it would be foolish to count on a coronavirus vaccine being ready for use this year.
""I think if we look forward a year, I think the chances are much greater than if we look forward six months and we need to have that sort of timescale in mind,"" Chris Whitty told Sky News.
""So planning for the next winter, it would be foolish to plan on the basis we will have a vaccine.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - One of India's most prominent lawyers faces a Monday deadline to apologise to the Supreme Court or risk jail in a case testing the judiciary's openness to criticism and sparking a debate on freedom of speech in the world's largest democracy.
Prashant Bhushan, 63, was found guilty of criminal contempt for attempting ""to scandalize the entire institution"" with Twitter posts depicting the chief justice on a motorcycle while the court's work was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and criticising previous top judges.
The top court on Thursday ordered Bhushan, who has championed public interest litigation, to issue an ""unconditional apology"" by Monday. He faces up to six months in jail or a fine of 2,000 rupees ($27) or both.
""Any apology would be insincere,"" Bhushan told Reuters, declining to comment further as the matter is before the court.
He told the court in a statement on Thursday that he would ""cheerfully submit to any penalty"" over the two June tweets, which he said ""represented my bonafide beliefs, the expression of which must be permissible in any democracy.""
If Bhushan apologises, the court has said it would hold a hearing on Tuesday. It was not clear when or how the court would respond if he does not apologise.
Regardless of the outcome, Bhushan's case is putting the Supreme Court, one of India's most respected institutions, on trial, testing how much judges may be openly criticised in a society known for free-wheeling debate.
Freedom of speech is a fundamental right in India and highly contentious. The top court often hears cases where litigants argue their right to express themselves is being infringed.
Some lawyers and media editorials support Bhushan, saying the court is being too harsh, arguing that his tweets amounted to legally protected criticism.
""A bar silenced under the threat of contempt will undermine the independence and ultimately the strength of the court,"" more than 2,400 Indian lawyers wrote in an online petition.
Others criticised Bhushan, who has 1.7 million Twitter followers. 
""A lawyer is not above the law, nobody is,"" said Satyadarshi Sanjay, a lawyer who signed an open letter by more than 100 people, including former judges, who support the court's decision.

Judges too sometimes chastise the judiciary. In 2018, four sitting Supreme Court justices held a rare press conference criticising the court's distribution of cases to judges and raising concerns about judicial appointments.
The Supreme Court, in its 108-page order in Bhushan's case, noted it is ""required to be magnanimous"" to criticism - though it said ""such magnanimity cannot be stretched"".
In his first tweet, Bhushan posted a viral photo of Chief Justice S.A. Bobde astride a Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG). He wrote Bobde was sitting on a 5 million rupee ($67,000) bike without a mask or a helmet when citizens were being denied justice as the court was in lockdown. 
The Supreme Court ruled the tweet was ""patently false"" and had the ""tendency to shake the confidence of the public"", as the court was hearing matters even during the coronavirus shutdown.
In the other tweet, Bhushan wrote that when historians look at how democracy has been destroyed in India in the past six years, they will mark the role of the court and the past four top justices.
That tweet ""has the effect of destabilising the very foundation of this important pillar of the Indian democracy"" and ""directly affronts the majesty of law"", the court said.

Both of Bhushan's tweets have been suspended by Twitter.

At least six were injured, including three police officers, as around 120 people tried to escape the Thomas Restobar club on Saturday night as police arrived to break up a party on its second floor, national police and government officials said. 
Neighbors had alerted police about the raucous event at the club in the Los Olivos district of the Peruvian capital.
""In these circumstances when people begin to fight to get out, it's tumultuous, everyone goes against each other,"" Orlando Velasco of the National Police told local radio station RPP. 
An Interior Ministry statement said the revellers tried to squeeze en masse through the only entrance door and became trapped between the door and a staircase leading to the street.
Police detained at least 23 partygoers, the ministry said.
Peru ordered the closure of nightclubs and bars in March and banned extended family gatherings on Aug. 12 to fight what is Latin America's second highest COVID-19 infection rate, according to a Reuters tally. A Sunday curfew is also in effect. 
Peru had recorded a total of 585,236 coronavirus cases as of Saturday, double the number reported on July 2, while the known death toll has risen to 27,453.

KINMEN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Amid rising tensions with Beijing, the de facto U.S. ambassador in Chinese-claimed Taiwan took part on Sunday for the first time in commemorations of a key military clash and the last time Taiwanese forces joined battle with China on a large scale.
China has stepped up military activity around the democratic island, moves denounced by Taiwan's government as an attempt at intimidation to force them to accept Chinese rule.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen laid a wreath and bowed her head in respect at a memorial park on Kinmen island, which sits a few kilometres (miles) off the Chinese metropolis of Xiamen, to mark the 62nd anniversary of the start of the second Taiwan Straits crisis. 
In August 1958, Chinese forces began more than a month of bombarding Kinmen, along with the Taiwan-controlled Matsu archipelago further up the coast, including naval and air battles, seeking to force them into submission. 
Brent Christensen, head of the American Institute in Taiwan and Washington's de facto representative, offered his respects too, standing behind Tsai, in a symbolic show of U.S. support for the island. 
Christensen also laid wreaths at a monument honouring two U.S. military officers who died in a 1954 Chinese attack on Kinmen, the institute said.
""Commemorations such as these remind us that today's U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation builds on a long and proud history that exemplifies the phrase 'Real Friends, Real Progress,"" it said in a statement.
Taiwan's presidential office thanked Christensen for participating on a day it said serves to remind Taiwan's people of the importance of defending freedom and democracy.
China’s Taiwan affairs office did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on the commemoration.
Washington has no formal ties with Taipei but is its largest arms supplier. President Donald Trump's administration has made bolstering relations a priority, to Beijing's anger.
Like Tsai, Christensen did not make public comments.
Taiwan fought back at the time with support from the United States, which sent military equipment like advanced Sidewinder anti-aircraft missiles, giving Taiwan a technological edge. The crisis ended in a stalemate.
Major General Liu Qiang-hua, spokesman for the Kinmen Defence Command, said it was important to remember an event that was crucial to ensuring Taiwan's security.
""Of course we hope there is no war, but it is dangerous to forget about war. This is the spirit we need to safeguard,"" he told Reuters.

Formerly called Quemoy in English, Kinmen today is a popular tourist destination, though remnants of past fighting like underground bunkers are scattered across the island, and Taiwan maintains a significant military presence.

The region, long convulsed by simmering conflict between the indigenous Mapuche and the Chilean government, has seen a spike in arson attacks on trucks and factories in recent months.
Early on Saturday morning, a 9-year old girl was hit by a stray pellet when her father´s cement truck was attacked by at least four armed men on a local highway, police said. 
""The example of this girl will help us maintain the strength...to find and punish the terrorists who hesitate at nothing, and are capable of injuring a 9-year-old girl,"" Pinera said in a televised statement.
The child is currently being treated for serious injuries in a hospital in Temuco, in south-central Chile, local media reported.
It was not immediately clear who, if anyone, had claimed credit for the attack. Chile´s Public Ministry told reporters on Saturday it had launched an investigation.
Araucania is home to many of the 1.7 million indigenous Mapuche that live in Chile. Indigenous activists there say their lands are increasingly threatened by agriculture, forestry and other industries; they blame the state for failing to uphold their historical rights.
Militant groups who say they fight for Mapuche rights have claimed credit for some previous attacks on truck drivers and companies, police have said.
The conflict in Araucania has flared up in recent months, aggravated by the economic fallout resulting from coronavirus lockdown measures.
Last week, a United Nations Human Rights team confirmed it sent a fact-finding team to the region where jailed indigenous Mapuche leader Celestino Cordova has spent more than 100 days on hunger strike.
It said it had met police, prosecutors and business representatives, and indigenous leaders who laid allegations of forced evictions from council property, excessive or unnecessary use of force by the authorities and racial discrimination.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2020 10:56PM ET</span>",California seeks help as wildfires threaten communities,"By Sharon Bernstein
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Nearly two dozen massive wildfires continued to ravage parts of California on Saturday, fueled by high temperatures and ongoing lightning strikes, including 100 that hit on Friday, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) said.
The fires have killed six people and incinerated nearly 700 buildings since beginning after an earlier lightning storm last week. Together, the blazes have burned nearly a million acres, the agency said Saturday.
Wildfire is threatening parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, the forested region near the University of California at Santa Cruz and a wide swath of the area between San Francisco and the state capital of Sacramento.
On Saturday, President Donald Trump declared the fires to be a major disaster, the White House said. The declaration, which allows federal funds to be used to help people and businesses harmed by the fires in seven counties to pay for temporary housing, home repairs and other needs, came despite a threat from Trump earlier this week to withold aid from California. 
Nearly 14,000 firefighters have been deployed to the blazes, but containment of the largest ones remains low and the state has requested additional support from other states and local jurisdictions in California, CalFire said Saturday.
""They're scrambling for bodies"" to help fight the fires, said Jay Tracy, a fire marshal with the city of Fresno who was deployed as a spokesman for the LNU fire complex, which had burned 314,000 acres in five counties, including some of the state's storied wine country and communities between San Francisco and Sacramento.
Firefighters have improved containment of the southern edge of that fire, but winds are expected to push it northwest toward the wine country towns of Healdsburg and Guernville, he said. 
Local agencies like his are limited in how many reinforcements they can send to help state firefighters because many are still needed at home, while the sheer volume of fires burning in the state have stretched resources, Tracy said. 
Additional lightning storms are expected later this weekend, and the danger of new or growing wildfire is extreme, CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said. 
The fires increased modestly in size on Saturday after more than doubling on Friday, becoming some of the largest in state history and threatening small towns in the path of the flames. In addition to the fatalities, 43 firefighters and civilians have been hurt.
Including smaller blazes, crews are fighting a total of 560 wildfires across the state, California Governor Gavin Newsom said Friday. Evacuations have been ordered in numerous regions. About 175,000 people were told to leave their homes, although many in the community around Vacaville between Sacramento and San Francisco have been allowed to return. 

In Santa Cruz, a city of around 65,000 people on California's central coast, residents were told to prepare ""go bags"" as bulldozers cut fire lines and flames came within a mile of the University of California Santa Cruz campus.

Also on Pompeo's agenda will be the security challenges posed by Iran and China in the region, said the sources, who declined to be identified by name or nationality.
Israel and the UAE announced earlier this month that they would normalise diplomatic ties and forge a broad new relationship.
Under the accord, which U.S. President Donald Trump helped broker, Israel agreed to suspend its planned annexation of areas of the occupied West Bank. 
The deal also firms up opposition to regional power Iran, which the UAE, Israel and the United States view as the main threat in the conflict-riven Middle East.
White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, is expected to travel to Israel and the UAE in early September, and may stop in other countries as well, an administration official said. Kushner will be accompanied by Avi Berkowitz, Trump's Middle East envoy, the official said.

Iran in May supplied gasoline to Venezuela to ease chronic shortages, triggering alarm bells in Washington as the two countries expand trade relations amid efforts to undermine aggressive U.S. sanctions programs.
""It had not occurred to me, it had not occurred to us,"" Maduro said during a televised broadcast with cabinet members, instructing Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino to follow up and jokingly telling his cabinet to keep the plan a secret.
""Padrino, what a good idea, to speak with Iran to see what short, medium and long range missiles they have, and if it is possible, given the great relations we have with Iran.""
Colombian President Ivan Duque said on Thursday that Maduro is looking to buy Iranian missiles and is handing over weapons made in Russia and Belarus to Colombian armed groups, citing intelligence reports. 

Weapons purchases appear relatively unlikely for Maduro, whose government is struggling to buy basic food and medicine or to provide fuel to the population due sanctions as well as chronic dysfunction of the country's refineries.

(Reuters) - Marco, one of two tropical storms headed for the U.S. Gulf Coast, was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane later on Saturday as coastal governors urged residents to prepare for the unprecedented weather event amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Tropical Storm Marco, located about 50 miles (80 km) west of Cuba with winds of 65 mph, was expected to intensify as it moved through the Yucatan Channel into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, according to the National Hurricane Center's latest bulletin.
To the east, Tropical Storm Laura was packing 50 mph winds as it moved west at 18 mph about 100 miles west of Ponce, Puerto Rico, the center said. It is forecast to hit the U.S. Gulf Coast on Wednesday, NHC projections show.
The two storms simultaneously working their way into the Gulf is a rare weather event that could wreak havoc on the region with damaging winds, rains and storm surges. There have never been two hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico at the same time, according to the National Hurricane Center. The last time two cyclones were in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was in 2002. 
On Saturday morning, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency, urging residents to make preparations, given the unpredictability of the storms and the limited amount of available shelter space due to social distancing requirements caused by the pandemic. 
""Should you need to get out ... you need to make plans early to do so,"" he said. ""We cannot have ... a mad rush of people into our shelters. We want to put you on alert.""
Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez also issued a state of emergency and warned residents to remain indoors as Laura was lashing the island with rain and high winds on Saturday.
""Do not cross flooded areas, do not expose your life. Stay away from rivers and streams,"" she warned Puerto Ricans on Twitter. 
Tropical storm conditions from Laura were expected to also strike the Virgin Islands on Saturday and the Dominican Republic and Haiti on Sunday while Marco is forecast to thrash northwestern Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba on Saturday. 
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards also declared a state of emergency on Friday night for the state that is forecast to be drenched next week by both storms. He encouraged residents to put together emergency kits that include face masks and hand sanitizer to stay protected against the COVID-19 virus. 
""Everybody in coastal Louisiana needs to be paying attention to these storms,"" he said. 
Tropical Storm Laura prompted the Dominican Republic to put 14 northern and eastern provinces on high alert as meteorologists warned of 4-8 inches of rain possible along with high waves and surges in river levels. The government also closed beaches and ordered a halt to aquatic sports and leisure activities in the mountains. 
Cuba braced for possible hits from both storms, putting its eastern provinces on alert and warning of intense rain and winds due to Laura that could bring flooding, especially in the coastal city of Baracoa. 
The Cuban government also put southern and western provinces of the Isle of Youth and Pinar del Rio on alert due to the risks of worsening weather from Marco.

Bashir, who has been in jail in Khartoum since he was toppled after mass protests last year, is wanted by the ICC for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur in a conflict that killed an estimated 300,000 people.
The government reached a deal with rebel groups in February that all five Sudanese ICC suspects should appear before the court but Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok had not previously publicly affirmed Sudan's position.
""I reiterate that the government is fully prepared to cooperate with the ICC to facilitate access to those accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity,"" Hamdok said in a televised address on the anniversary of his ascent to office.
Sudan's transitional government, a three-year joint civilian-military arrangement led by Hamdok, says it is close to a peace deal with some rebel groups active in Darfur, a vast region roughly the size of France.
The government and some of the rebels are expected to initial an agreement on Aug. 28.
Hamdok also said during his TV address that Sudan had come a long way towards being removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.
There are intense communications with the American administration about removing Sudan from the list and significant progress is expected in the coming weeks, a senior government source told Reuters on Sunday.
Washington added Sudan to the list in 1993 over allegations that Bashir's Islamist government was supporting terrorist groups at the time.

The designation makes Sudan technically ineligible for debt relief and financing from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The U.S. Congress would need to approve Sudan's removal from the list.

Tuesday's overthrow of Mali President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita has been condemned abroad, but celebrated by many in a country battling an Islamist insurgency and months of political unrest.
A delegation from the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) earlier arrived in the capital, Bamako, for talks aimed at reversing the overthrow of Keita. 
The bloc has taken a hard line on the coup, shutting borders and halting financial flows - a move diplomats said was as much about warning opponents at home as stabilising Mali. 
Ahead of a series of meetings with the mutineers and other groups, the head of the delegation, Nigeria's former President Goodluck Jonathan, sounded optimistic. 
""I believe at the end of the day we will come up with something that is best for the people and is good for ECOWAS and the international community,"" he told journalists.
The most-anticipated meeting was held in the defence ministry, where ECOWAS mediators in face masks sat at a long table opposite junta leader Assimi Goita, who wore a desert camouflage uniform and was flanked by other military officers in berets and fatigues, photos on Twitter showed.
The talks were set to last 90 minutes, according to a provisional ECOWAS schedule, seen by Reuters. But the meeting ended after just 20 minutes, a Reuters reporter said.
It was not clear if the schedule had been changed or talks were cut short. ECOWAS and the coup leaders, who call themselves the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP), have yet to comment on the discussions. 
The CNSP has controlled the country since Tuesday, when the mutineers detained Keita at gunpoint and forced him to resign. They have promised to oversee a transition to elections within a ""reasonable"" amount of time.
The ouster of Keita, known as IBK, has been welcomed by many in Mali, which was rocked by months of protests calling for his resignation over alleged corruption and worsening security in areas where affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State are active.
TEAR GAS
The presidents of Ivory Coast and Guinea are among those pushing for the tough ECOWAS response, one diplomat said, as both have faced violent public protests to their third-term bids and want the bloc to show it will not allow power grabs in its own backyard.
""They cannot tolerate this taking place. They are taking it very personally. It is on their doorstep and they think they are next,"" a second regional diplomat said. 
After three days of post-coup calm in the capital Bamako, police used tear gas earlier on Saturday when a scuffle broke out between a group of 50 pro-Keita protesters and local residents who threw stones, an eyewitness told Reuters.
""Reinstating IBK is out of the question. The only thing they (the delegation) can achieve is the transition. Under the rules of ECOWAS, ECOWAS should midwife the transition,"" one of the diplomats said, referring to the outcome of the delegation's visit.

On Friday, thousands of the coup's supporters gathered in a central square in Bamako to celebrate the takeover. There is no outward sign ECOWAS's suspension of financial relations is yet being felt.

Bolivia's justice ministry this week filed a complaint against Morales, 60, for statutory rape and human trafficking in connection to his alleged relationship with a 16-year-old girl. 
""Former President Evo Morales will not comment on the de facto government's dirty war created for electoral purposes,"" a press representative said in a statement late on Friday. 
Bolivia's interim government, run by conservative caretaker President Jeanine Anez, was installed after Morales, a long-serving socialist, resigned in the wake of a disputed election last year. 
Morales is barred from running for office but the candidate from his MAS political party and Anez are two of the main contenders in the Oct. 18 presidential election. 
Bolivia's deputy minister of transparency Guido Melgar said the government had reviewed photographs, audio files and messages that the woman, now 19, sent to the former president by cell phone when she was underage. 
""This suggests that there was a relationship of infatuation between the two people,"" Melgar said. ""According to the information, this lady went everywhere with Morales when he was president.""
The woman, however, accused the police of forcing her to say she had a relationship with Morales, in a letter sent to Bolivia's Ombudsman's office.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - A Panama-flagged ship boarded by Somali police is safe and underway, the EU Naval Force said on Saturday, after conflicting reports two days earlier about whether it had been hijacked by Somali pirates.
The Aegean II had originally altered its course due to a damaged hull and after local police had boarded it, ""there had been certain incidents on board the vessel"", the EU force said in a statement.
""At this point, it cannot be classified as a maritime security incident, but a more detailed investigation is in progress,"" the statement said, noting that the ship's progress was being closely monitored by the ESPS Santa Maria, a Spanish warship operating as part of the naval force. 
A regional governor in Somalia told Reuters on Thursday that the ship had been hijacked as it carried a cargo from the United Arab Emerites to Mogadishu port. But port authorities told the EU force that local police had boarded it as the ship was drifting after it had been damaged, the EU statement said.
Piracy expert Jay Bahadur noted that Somali security forces, often made up of local militias, had previously hijacked vessels. He said on Thursday he had received reports that the Somalis who boarded the vessel had robbed the crew and disarmed a private security team. 
Local authorities were not immediately available for comment.
At the height of their power in 2011, Somali pirates launched 237 attacks off the coast of the country, the International Maritime Bureau says, and held hundreds hostage.
But the number of attacks plummeted after shipping firms implemented better security protocols and a coalition of international naval forces stepped up patrols. The last successful hijacking in Somali waters was in 2017.

The attacks were also condemned by Human Rights Watch Americas director Jose Miguel Vivanco. 
""The security situation is deteriorating noticeably,"" Vivanco said via Twitter. 
Eight people were shot dead by an unidentified armed group in a contested drug trafficking area in Narino province a week ago.
Another five people were killed in an attack in a neighborhood in the east of the city of Cali on Aug. 11. 
Drug trafficking fuels Colombia's decades-long internal conflict, which has killed more than 260,000 and displaced millions.
The leftist guerrilla group the National Liberation Army, former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels who reject a 2016 peace deal, criminal groups composed of former right-wing paramilitaries and drugs gangs are all involved in trafficking.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya sees herself as a symbol of change whose role is to help deliver new elections as President Alexander Lukashenko will have to quit sooner or later, she told Reuters on Saturday.
Speaking in Lithuania where she and her two children have fled for security reasons, Tsikhanouskaya said she felt duty-bound to do what she could to support protesters in her home country but would not run for president again.
""During the campaign I didn't see myself as a politician but I pushed myself forward,"" she said. ""I don't see myself in politics. I am not a politician.""
Tens of thousands of Belarusians have taken to the streets for nearly two weeks to protest against what they believe was a rigged Aug. 9 presidential election. They want veteran leader Lukashenko to quit so new elections can be held.
Tsikhanouskaya, who ran in the election against Lukashenko after her husband, a well-known video blogger, was jailed, said fate had handed her a role that she had no right to forsake.
""It is my fate and my mission, and I don't have the right to step away. I understand that I'm in safety here, but all the people who voted for me in Belarus ... need me as a symbol. They need the person they voted for. I couldn't betray my people.""
She has been making regular video appeals to try to keep up the protests' momentum. She said she had also fielded phone calls from world leaders who had asked her how they could help.
None gave concrete promises to support her, and none said they regarded her as the president-elect.
""I understand that they have no right and possibility to interfere in internal affairs of our country ... I asked everybody to respect the independence of our country, the sovereignty of our country"", she said.
'SOONER OR LATER'
When asked which countries had called, she referenced Canada, the United States, Britain, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and others.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country has close ties with Belarus, had not been in touch, and Tsikhanouskaya said she would not attempt to reach him herself.
""I don't have anything to ask him about, just (to respect) sovereignty,"" she said. ""Any future relationship with Russia or other countries would be decided by people and by the new president.""
Tsikhanouskaya said that Lukashenko's authority was badly damaged and that things would be different in Belarus, even if he managed to cling to power for now. 
Lukashenko said on Saturday he would close factories that have seen worker protests, the Russian RIA news agency reported, his latest attempt to quell a wave of opposition rallies since the contested elections.
""Belarusian people have changed during this year. The Belarusian people won't be able to accept him as the new president, and will not allow him to treat him as they did before,"" she said.

Lukashenko also suggested he would fire the workers concerned.
""If a factory is not working then let's put a lock on its gate from Monday, let's stop it,"" RIA cited Lukashenko as saying in the town of Grodno near the border with Poland. ""People will calm down and we will decide whom to invite (to work) next."" 
In the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's 26 years in power, people have taken to the streets in many Belarusian towns, including in its capital Minsk, for nearly two weeks, protesting against the result of an Aug 9 election that they say was rigged to give the president re-election.
Some workers at a number of state factories have also joined protests.
Lukashenko has denied any fraud in the vote. 
His main opponent in the election, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has fled to neighbouring Lithuania. Without naming anybody, Lukashenko said on Saturday that arrangers of the country-wide rallies ""are sitting abroad in neighbouring countries"" and enjoying political support from those countries' leaders. 
In an interview with Reuters on Saturday, Tsikhanouskaya said she sees herself as a symbol of change whose role is to help deliver new elections as Lukashenko will have to quit sooner or later.

Two leading members of a newly formed opposition council in Belarus were questioned on Friday in a criminal case over what Lukashenko calls an attempt to seize power.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss People's Party (SVP) elected Marco Chiesa from Italian-speaking region Ticino as president of the right-wing party on Saturday as it tries to sharpen its profile and rebuild its appeal among voters.
Chiesa, 45, was nominated in a surprise move last month after Switzerland's biggest party tried for months to find a successor to outgoing president Albert Roesti, who announced last year he was stepping down.
Top of his agenda will likely be the party's campaign in a Sept. 27 referendum on ending free movement of people with the European Union. Opinion polls suggest a majority in favour of keeping free movement, but if the vote goes the other way bilateral trade agreements between Switzerland and the EU could be at risk.
Chiesa vowed to stick to the party line, saying: ""I don't want to have to watch how Swiss families suffer from the burden of millions of immigrants from the European Union.""
Swiss broadcaster SRG published a poll on Thursday suggesting 61% would vote against the proposal and 35% for it.
The trained economist was elected at a party meeting in Brugg Windisch, west of Zurich. He was the only candidate standing for election, a lack of choice criticised by some delegates at the meeting.

The SVP used to dominate Switzerland's political debates with often inflammatory campaigns targeting immigrants and the European Union. But its profile fell somewhat under Roesti, who took over in 2016 but announced his resignation last year after the party lost ground in parliamentary elections.

(Reuters) - Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi had just embarked on a state visit to Washington when gunmen shot dead the young protest leader Reham Yacoub in her car in Basra on Wednesday.
Yacoub, 29, was an outspoken critic of the Iran-backed militias whose power and influence Kadhimi has been trying to rein in since taking office in May. 
The attack was the third on activists in the southern city in a week. Tahseen Oussama, 30, was gunned down on Aug. 14 and four others were shot at while together in a car Monday. 
Her killing cast a pall over the prime minister's trip to the United States. The violence reignited anti-government protests in Basra and the U.S. State Department publicly urged Kadhimi to hold the militias accountable, just two days after he sacked the Basra police and national security chiefs and formed a special committee to investigate the attacks. 
""The reality is the PM and his team are unable to control these groups,"" said Renad Mansour, director of the Iraq Initiative at Chatham House. 
""Removing a police chief ... is not even scratching the surface of the problem."" 
Kadhemi's visit was intended to cement U.S. support for his government and while he was there, five U.S. firms, including  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), signed agreements with Iraq aimed at boosting its energy independence from Iran.
""The PM is hoping he can go to the U.S. and sign a bunch of deals and say this is how he can fix things, but it doesn't look good that while you're away young activists are being killed by militias and forces under your government,"" said Mansour.
Most of the militias come under Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces, an umbrella grouping of paramilitary forces. Although formally integrated in Iraq's security forces, in practice they operate independently and have resisted all attempts to curb their influence.
Neither do they tolerate any dissent from the population. Yacoub and Oussama were killed two weeks after a national umbrella grouping of activists, to which both belonged, announced it would form a political party to challenge the dominance of militia groups in parliament. 
The Basra killings come after Husham al-Hashemi, a well-known security analyst and government advisor, was gunned down outside his Baghdad family home in July by men on a motorbike. 
Kadhimi talked tough after Hashemi's killing, pledging to hunt down his assailants and keep the armed groups in check. But there have been few developments since.
His efforts to employ law and order to restrain the groups earlier in the year also backfired.
When Iraqi forces arrested 14 fighters in June for their alleged involvement in rocket attacks on U.S. installations, their comrades drove vehicles into the heavily fortified Green Zone to pressure Kadhimi for their release. All but one were let go.
In May, an arrest raid in Basra on the Iran-aligned Tharallah group, accused of shooting protesters, also failed to result in any prosecutions. In both cases judges cited a lack of evidence.
""The situation in Iraq has devolved to the point that gunmen can roam the streets and shoot well-connected members of civil society with impunity,"" said Belkis Wille, senior Crisis and Conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. 

""One has to question whether the federal government is even capable of reining in the violence at this point.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Gravely ill Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was evacuated to Germany for medical treatment on Saturday, flown out of the Siberian city of Omsk in an ambulance aircraft and taken to a hospital in Berlin.
There was no word yet from the Charite hospital on his condition but the founder of the activist group that arranged the flight called Navalny's health condition ""very worrying"".
A long-time opponent of President Vladimir Putin and campaigner against corruption, Navalny collapsed on a plane on Thursday after drinking tea that his allies believe was laced with poison.
Medical staff at the hospital in Omsk said on Friday evening, after clearing Navalny to be flown out, that he was in an induced coma and his life was not in immediate danger.
The air ambulance, arranged by the Cinema for Peace Foundation, flew to Berlin's Tegel airport early on Saturday and Navalny, 44, was rushed to the Charite hospital complex.
The hospital said in a statement it would provide an update about his condition and further treatment once tests have been completed and after consulting with his family. It added this could take some time.
""His health condition is very worrying,"" Cinema for Peace founder Jaka Bizilj told reporters outside the hospital.
""We got a very clear message from the doctors that if there had not been an emergency landing in Omsk, he would have died,"" said Bizilj, adding that it would be up to doctors and Navalny's family to provide further information on his condition.
Bizilj, a Slovenian-born activist and filmmaker, was earlier quoted by Bild tabloid as saying Navalny's condition was stable during the flight and after landing.
Kira Yarmysh, Navalny's spokeswoman, said on Twitter that ""This is another proof that nothing was preventing Navalny from being transported, and it was necessary to do so as early as possible.""
DELAYED EVACUATION
German doctors flew to Russia on Friday to evacuate Navalny at the request of his wife and allies who said that the hospital treating him was badly equipped. 
But there was then a delay flying him out as the Omsk hospital initially said his condition meant he could not travel.
The Omsk doctors later said they had no objections after the German doctors deemed him fit for travel.
Navalny's wife, Yulia, sent a letter to the Kremlin directly appealing for it to intervene and grant permission for him to be allowed to be flown out.
Navalny's allies have said they feared authorities in Russia might try to cover up clues as to how he fell ill. 
The doctors in Omsk said on Saturday they were ready to share all information they have with the German clinic. 
Two years ago, Pyotr Verzilov, another anti-Kremlin activist and a member of the Pussy Riot art collective, was treated at the Charite hospital after he was poisoned in Moscow.
Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level graft and mobilising crowds of young protesters.

He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings and rallies and sued over his investigations into corruption. He was barred from running in a presidential election in 2018.

The International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution in June raising pressure on Iran to let inspectors into the sites mentioned in two quarterly IAEA reports because they could still host undeclared nuclear material or traces of it.
""My objective is that my meetings in Tehran will lead to concrete progress in addressing the outstanding questions that the Agency has related to safeguards in Iran and, in particular, to resolve the issue of access,"" Grossi, who took over as IAEA director general in December, said in a statement.
The statement said Grossi would meet ""high-level Iranian authorities"", without specifying whom. Diplomats in Vienna have said they hope the standoff over access will be resolved before the next Board of Governors meeting in September.

""We hope this visit will lead to reinforced mutual cooperation,"" Iran's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Kazem Gharibabadi, said, according to a statement posted by his mission on Twitter.

BENI, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Suspected Islamist militants killed 13 people during raids on two villages in eastern Congo, the army and a village chief said, the latest in a spate of attacks the United Nations says may constitute war crimes.
The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan armed group operating in North Kivu province in Democratic Republic of Congo, have killed more than 1,000 civilians since the start of 2019, according to U.N. figures.
Militiamen tied up the victims in the villages of Kinziki-Matiba and Wikeno, 10 km east of the city of Oicha, before killing them in the attack on Friday afternoon, said Chui Mukalangirwa, a local village chief. 
""We beg the authorities to put an end to this bloodbath,"" he said. 
The army helped civilians bury the bodies and is looking at deploying more units in the area, army spokesman Antony Mwalishayi said.
The ADF has operated in the dense forests near the Ugandan border for more than three decades. Late last year the Congo army launched a large-scale operation against them, sparking a violent backlash against civilians.
Several attacks attributed to the ADF have also been claimed by Islamic State, although researchers and analysts say there is a lack of hard evidence linking the two groups.
The insecurity has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes and complicated Congo's response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as an Ebola epidemic that has killed more than 2,200 people.

Residents of Khabarovsk, 6,110 km (3,800 miles) east of Moscow, have protested since the detention of Sergei Furgal, the region's popular governor, on July 9 in connection with murder charges which he denies. 
His supporters say the detention is politically motivated.
People marched on Saturday with posters reading ""Freedom to Furgal"" and ""Belarus - Khabarovsk is with you"" - a sign of support for opposition rallies in Belarus protesting against the alleged rigging of its presidential election. 
On Saturday, posters wishing recovery for Alexei Navalny, a Kremlin critic who collapsed on a plane on Thursday after drinking tea that his allies believe was laced with poison, were also seen among the people marching in Khabarovsk. 
Navalny was evacuated from the Siberian city of Omsk and brought to Germany for medical treatment on Saturday. 

Regional authorities estimated around 1,500 people took part in Saturday's march, a smaller turnout than in previous weeks.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has deported a Bangladeshi worker who criticised the government's treatment of migrants in a documentary made by broadcaster Al Jazeera, the country's director general of immigration confirmed on Saturday.
Mohammad Rayhan Kabir was deported to Bangladesh late on Friday, Khairul Dzaimee Daud told Reuters. He did not respond to further queries on why Rayhan was deported.
Accompanied by immigration officers, he was seen waving and giving a thumbs up to reporters at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Friday night, state media outlet Bernama reported.
Malaysia arrested 25-year-old Rayhan and blacklisted him from entering the country last month, after Al Jazeera's July 3 documentary on Malaysia's treatment of undocumented foreign workers during the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a backlash in the Southeast Asia nation.
At that time, Qatar-based Al Jazeera said it was disturbing Rayhan had been arrested ""for choosing to speak up about some of the experiences of the voiceless and the vulnerable."" 
Rights groups have accused the government of suppressing media freedom after authorities questioned Al Jazeera's journalists, raided their office, and opened into alleged sedition, defamation and violation of a communications law.
Malaysia arrested hundreds of undocumented foreigners, including children and Rohingya refugees, after the country imposed a lockdown to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.
Malaysian officials said the arrests were necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, which human rights activists have condemned as inhumane.
Activists have also voiced concerns that the nearly six-month-old administration of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin is stifling dissent amid a series of clampdowns, an accusation the government has denied.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarusian politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who has led the biggest challenge to Alexander Lukashenko's 26-year rule of Belarus, said in an interview aired on Friday that would not run for the presidency if the country holds new elections.
Tsikhanouskaya, who became Lukashenko's opposition rival in the contested Aug. 9 election in which he was declared the victor, has fled to neighbouring Lithuania. She emerged from obscurity to take her husband Siarhei Tsikhanouski's place in the election campaign after he was jailed in May.
    ""I'm not planning to run myself,"" Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Belsat TV when asked if she or her husband, a well-known video blogger, would run for the presidency if new elections are held as the opposition has sought.
    ""More than enough,"" Tsikhanouskaya, who led some of the biggest protests against Lukashenko since he came to power with the fall of the Soviet Union, replied when asked if she had enough of politics.
Mass protests broke out against Lukashenko, accusing him of rigging the election, allegations that he denies.
    Tsikhanouskaya said the release of political prisoners is one of the demands of protesters and ""new fair transparent elections can restore justice.""
    The 37-year-old former English teacher was never supposed to be the leader of popular resistance to Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm boss. But when her husband was jailed and other candidates were barred from running in the election, Tsikhanouskaya became the prime challenger to Lukashenko, whose claims of a landslide victory were disputed by the opposition.
    Earlier this week, Tsikhanouskaya had said she was ready to lead Belarus, a country of 9.5 million, and had called for the creation of a legal mechanism to ensure that a new fair presidential election could be held.

OMSK, Russia (Reuters) - Gravely ill Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was let out of hospital and delivered to an airport early on Saturday to be airlifted to Germany to receive medical care after the opposition politician's allies accused the Russian authorities of trying to stop his evacuation.
Navalny's life was not in immediate danger, he was in an induced coma and his brain was in a stable condition, the medical staff at a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk said on Friday. 
Navalny was delivered to Omsk airport in an ambulance minutes after 0000 GMT, a Reuters witness said. Kira Yarmysh, Navalny's spokeswoman, said she expected him to be flown out to Germany on Saturday morning.

German doctors flew in to evacuate Navalny, 44, at the request of his wife and allies who said they feared authorities might try to cover up clues as to how he fell ill and that the hospital treating him was badly equipped. 
Medical staff at the Omsk hospital initially said on Friday that while Navalny's condition had improved slightly overnight he was in too unstable a state to be safely transported out of the country. 
But late on Friday they said they would not object to him being moved after the German doctors were granted access to Navalny and said they thought he was fit to travel.
A senior doctor at the hospital, Anatoly Kalinichenko, said the hospital could help transport Navalny to the airport and that he would be moved within several hours. 
""We have taken the decision that we do not object to him being transferred to a different hospital,"" Kalinichenko said.
WIFE'S APPEAL
Navalny's wife Yulia earlier sent a letter to the Kremlin directly appealing for it to intervene and grant permission for him to be allowed to be flown out. 
""It's a shame it took so long for the doctors to make this decision. The plane has been waiting since morning, the documents were also ready then,"" Yarmysh, Navalny's spokeswoman, said on Friday evening. 
Alexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor at the hospital, said earlier that Navalny had been diagnosed with a metabolic disease that may have been caused by low blood sugar.
He said traces of industrial chemical substances had been found on Navalny's clothes and fingers and that doctors did not believe he had been poisoned.
Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level graft and mobilising crowds of young protesters.

366,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 08:55PM ET</span>",Libya's Tripoli-based government and rival parliament take steps to end hostilities,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognised government in Tripoli announced a ceasefire on Friday and the leader of a rival parliament in eastern Libya also appealed for a halt to hostilities.
The statements offered hope for a deescalation of a regionalised conflict that has wracked the country since a 2011 uprising, displacing hundreds of thousands, slashing oil production and opening space for migrant smugglers and militants. 
However, previous efforts to secure lasting truces and political settlements have stalled, and political leaders hold limited sway over armed groups in two broad factions that have been split between western and eastern Libya since 2014.
The Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) faces east-Libyan based forces led by veteran commander Khalifa Haftar, who launched a 14-month offensive on Tripoli before Turkish military support for the GNA forced him to retreat in June.
Both sides and their foreign backers have been mobilising around the central city of Sirte, though there has been little fighting in recent weeks.
Following international calls for a ceasefire and a demilitarised zone around Sirte, on Friday the GNA said its head Fayez al-Sarraj had ""issued instructions to all military forces to immediately cease fire and all combat operations in all Libyan territories"".
There was no immediate comment from Haftar or his Libyan National Army (LNA), but the head of an eastern-based parliament aligned with Haftar issued a statement appealing for an end to hostilities across the country.
The GNA and eastern parliament speaker Aguila Saleh both cited the spread of coronavirus as a reason for backing a ceasefire.
Saleh is seen to have gained influence compared to Haftar since the LNA's retreat from Tripoli. 
International involvement has often swung the course of Libya's conflict since 2011, and has deepened since the LNA, which is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, began its offensive on Tripoli in April 2019. 
Regional powers have long voiced support for a political solution while routinely violating an arms embargo on Libya, according to U.N. experts. 
On Friday, many welcomed the ceasefire push, including Egypt, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which is aligned with Turkey and the GNA, also praised the move. 
The GNA called for the lifting of a seven-month blockade on oil facilities that has all but stopped the country's output, saying revenue should be held in a special account and only be released after a political deal was reached.
The state-run National Oil Corporation (NOC) said it backed that proposal, but military forces should be withdrawn from oil facilities before any resumption of exports.
Distribution of oil revenue has been a key source of tension between the two sides. The acting U.N. envoy to Libya, Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB), said she ""warmly welcomed the points of agreement"" in the statements by Sarraj and Saleh, including calls for resuming oil production.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ""hopes the calls for a ceasefire will be respected immediately by armed forces from both sides."" 

The United Nations has been coordinating international efforts for military, political and economic deals in Libya following an international summit in January in Berlin.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States was further isolated on Friday over its bid to reimpose international sanctions on Iran with 13 countries on the 15-member U.N. Security Council expressing their opposition, arguing that Washington's move is void given it is using a process agreed under a nuclear deal that it quit two years ago.
In the 24 hours since U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he triggered a 30-day countdown to a return of U.N. sanctions on Iran, including an arms embargo, long-time allies Britain, France, Germany and Belgium as well as China, Russia, Vietnam, Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa, Indonesia, Estonia and Tunisia have already written letters in opposition, seen by Reuters. 
The United States has accused Iran of breaching a 2015 deal with world powers that aimed to stop Tehran developing nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief. But President Donald Trump described it as the ""worst deal ever"" and quit in 2018.
Diplomats said Russia, China and many other countries are unlikely to reimpose the sanctions on Iran. Pompeo again warned Russia and China against that on Friday, threatening U.S. action if they refuse to reimpose the U.N. measures on Iran. 
The United States acted on Thursday after the Security Council resoundingly rejected its bid last week to extend an arms embargo on Iran beyond its expiration in October. Only the Dominican Republic joined Washington in voting yes.
Dominican Republic has not yet written to the council to state its position on the sanctions snapback push.
Under the process Washington says it has triggered, it appears all U.N. sanctions should be reimposed at midnight GMT (8 p.m New York time) on Sept. 19 - just days before Trump is due to address world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, the annual meeting that will be largely virtual because of the coronavirus pandemic.
WHAT NOW?
A 2015 Security Council resolution enshrining the nuclear deal states that if no council member has put forward a draft resolution to extend sanctions relief on Iran within 10 days of a non-compliance complaint, then the body's president shall do so within the remaining 20 days. 
The United States would be able to veto this, giving it a cleaner argument that sanctions on Iran have to be reimposed. 
However, the 2015 resolution also says the council would ""take into account the views of the states involved."" Given the strong opposition, some diplomats say the council president - Indonesia for August and Niger for September - would not have to put up a draft text. 
""Faced with this very strong view of a majority of Security Council members that the snapback process has not been triggered, as the presidency they are not bound to introduce the draft resolution,"" said a U.N. Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Pompeo and outgoing U.S. Iran envoy Brian Hook signaled that Washington expects Indonesia or Niger to put a text to a vote. Another U.S. option is to put forward the draft itself or ask the Dominican Republic to do so.
The United States argues that it can trigger the sanctions snapback process because the 2015 Security Council resolution still names it as a nuclear deal participant.
However, in a joint letter to the Security Council on Thursday hours after the U.S. submitted it complaint, Britain, Germany and France said: ""Any decisions and actions which would be taken based on this procedure or on its possible outcome would also be devoid of any legal effect.""
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres distanced himself from the showdown in the Security Council.

""Security Council members will need to interpret their own resolution,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters. ""It's not the Secretary-General.""

It was too early to tell whether the infant is male or female but the baby marks the fourth successful pregnancy for Mei Xiang, a 22-year-old panda who, because of her advanced age, had a slim chance of having a healthy cub, zoo officials said. 
""We are thrilled to offer the world a much-needed moment of pure joy,"" said Steve Monfort, zoo director. 
The zoo only confirmed this week the presence of a fetus via ultrasound, which they posted online. 
News of Mei Xiang's pregnancy sparked enthusiasm among animal lovers who flocked to the zoo's panda cams https://nationalzoo.si.edu/webcams/panda-cam to get a glimpse of the expectant mother. 
Scientists at the zoo first detected fetal tissue last week after Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated in March with previously frozen sperm after previous failed pregnancy attempts and despite being near the end of her reproductive lifecycle.
""We knew the chances of her having a cub were slim,"" Monfort said in a written statement. ""However, we wanted to give her one more opportunity to contribute to her species' survival."" 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the zoo's experts implemented special precautions to reduce person-to-person contact during the process.
The father is Tian Tian, who came to Washington with Mei Xiang in 2000. Tian Tian has fathered Mei Xiang's three other surviving cubs, who have all returned to China under an agreement between Beijing and Washington.
Mei Xiang's last cub, Bei Bei, left for China in November last year as part of a breeding program that is key to efforts to reintroduce pandas into the wild. 

Pandas have been reclassified from ""endangered"" to ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, thanks to reforestation to expand habitats in which the species can survive. There are an estimated 1,800 giant pandas in the wild.

BOSTON (Reuters) - ""Full House"" actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli were sentenced on Friday to respective prison terms of two months and five months for participating in a vast U.S. college admissions fraud scheme.
Loughlin, 56, choked up as she apologized to U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston for the ""awful decision"" she made to help her daughters gain an ""unfair advantage"" in the college admissions process and get into their preferred school.
She and her husband were sentenced after they pleaded guilty in May to engaging in a fraud scheme aimed at securing spots for their daughters at the University of Southern California as fake athletic recruits.
They did so through what Gorton called a ""blatant"" scheme that involved wealthy parents, including the couple, conspiring with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and fraud to secure their children's admissions to top schools.
Loughlin, in her first public remarks about the case since her March 2019 arrest, said she had acted out of love for her daughters.
The actress, who became the public face of the scandal, said she understood her actions ""helped exacerbate existing inequalities in society generally and the higher education system for specifically.""
""I am truly, profoundly and deeply sorry, and I need to face the consequences and make amends,"" she said during a hearing held via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Gorton also ordered Loughlin and Giannulli to pay respective fines of $150,000 and $250,000 and complete 100 and 250 hours of community service. He said he was ""dumbfounded"" by how Loughlin could aid the corruption of the higher education system.
""We can only hope that you will spend the rest of your charmed life, as you've said you will, making amends for the system that you have harmed,"" he said.
Loughlin and Giannulli are among 56 people charged in a scheme masterminded by consultant William ""Rick"" Singer, who has admitted to facilitating cheating on college entrance exams and using bribery to secure the admission of children to schools under the guise of being sought-after athletes.
The parents include actress Felicity Huffman, who received a 14-day prison sentence for paying to rig her daughter's college entrance exam. An insurance and private equity executive, Mark Hauser, on Friday became the latest parent to cut a plea deal.
Prosecutors said Loughlin and Giannulli conspired with Singer to fabricate parts of their daughters' applications for admission to USC so they could be admitted as fake rowing team recruits.
Prosecutors said Giannulli, the ""more active"" parent in the scheme, also paid $500,000 in purported ""donations"" as a quid pro quo to induce a USC employee to facilitate the recruitment of daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose Giannulli.
Defense lawyer B.J. Trach said the case had ""devastating"" effects on Loughlin's career, leading to her losing multi-year acting contracts. ""She has become intertwined with the college admissions scandal,"" he said.

The couple is due to report to prison on Nov. 19.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number two U.S. diplomat will visit Russia and Lithuania soon for talks on Belarus, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, as Washington seeks a peaceful resolution to that country's election crisis that averts Russian intervention.
Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun's planned mission signals a greater U.S. role in trying to settle the strife that erupted when Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko brutally cracked down on peaceful protesters rejecting his claim of a landslide Aug. 9 election win.
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
One source, a former senior U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Biegun was expected to leave in the coming days for Moscow and the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, where Belarusian opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya took refuge after Lukashenko launched his crackdown.
The United States and European Union have condemned the election as marred by irregularities. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday urged Lukashenko to accept international help in opening talks with the opposition and implicitly warned Russia, Belarus' massive neighbor, not to intervene.
Lukashenko has appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin for help salvaging his 26-year rule. Belarus is bound to Russia by a mutual defense treaty and deep economic, political and cultural ties.
Putin has offered assistance, if required. Moscow on Wednesday said it saw no need to help for now, but has warned against outside involvement in Belarus and said the crisis should be settled internally.
The second source said he did not know Biegun's planned message but thought he would aim to prevent further violence in Belarus or Russian intervention.
""I would guess the administration is trying to dissuade Moscow from either intervening on its own or using its influence with Lukashenko to encourage him to have a (more) violent crackdown,"" said this source, also on condition of anonymity.
EU member Lithuania, which has sought backing from Washington, has been an outspoken critic of Lukashenko's crackdown on the demonstrations by tens of thousands of Belarusians in which his security forces have beaten, teargassed and arrested thousands of people, many of whom say they were tortured. 
Experts say Washington seeks a larger role in a search for a negotiated resolution to the crisis. The turmoil disrupted a U.S. effort to exploit tensions between Putin and Lukashenko, with Pompeo visiting Minsk in February for talks on normalizing diplomatic relations.
Protesters are not demanding closer ties with the West, experts noted, but a redo of the vote and respect for human rights, which Washington has a strong interest in promoting.
Moreover, the crisis gives Washington an issue on which to unite with European allies amid serious tensions over the Iran nuclear deal and U.S. President Donald Trump's expressions of disdain for the trans-Atlantic alliance, they said.
""From the U.S. perspective, there's a whole host of issues both in terms of human rights and democracy, but there's also a security component,"" said Jonathan Katz, a former U.S. official and expert on Eastern Europe with the German Marshall Fund, a thinktank. ""Belarus borders the Baltic allies and Poland."" 
At the same time, he said, Washington wants to avoid giving Putin an excuse to intervene militarily in Belarus as he did in 2014 in Ukraine, when Russian forces seized Crimea and backed separatists in the country's east after the ouster of a pro-Moscow government.

""There are concerns about the potential for Moscow to act militarily,"" said Katz. ""You can't dismiss it even if you think the likelihood is not there.""

Colombian authorities had said they were informed by Venezuelan counterparts that the Simon Bolivar bridge connecting the cities of Cucuta and San Antonio would be closed due to the high number of recently arrived Venezuelans who are in quarantine to halt the spread of COVID-19 on the other side.
But later on Friday, Venezuela's foreign ministry said the bridge was briefly closed due to a disinfection operation to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, but re-opened at 10 a.m. local time (1400 GMT).
Colombia is a top destination for Venezuelans fleeing the political, economic and social crisis in their country. Some 1.7 million Venezuelans reside in Colombia.
Since March, when Colombia declared a national lockdown to combat the new coronavirus, around 100,000 Venezuelans have returned home. 
Another 40,000 are waiting to cross the border, according to Colombian migration authorities, amid weekly limits by Venezuelan authorities on the number of citizens allowed to return. 
""We are concerned for the health of everyone along the border and as such we have decided to suspend transport of Venezuelan citizens to Norte de Santander (MC:SAN) (province),"" Colombia's migration director Juan Francisco Espinosa said in a statement.
Colombian authorities had been bussing Venezuelans who wanted to return home from the interior of the country to Cucuta, but would stop to avoid border bottlenecks and possible health emergencies, Espinosa said.
""Together with mayors and governors we will begin to organize a new transfer schedule in response to the situation in our neighboring country,"" he added.

FELTON, Calif. (Reuters) - California's lightning-sparked wildfires more than doubled in size into some of the largest in state history on Friday, forcing over 175,000 people to flee their homes.
At least six people have died, 43 fire fighters and civilians have been injured, and over 500 homes and other structures destroyed as one fire burned within a mile of the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) campus.
Firefighting forces were depleted from over 370 fires and so far only 45 of 375 out-of-state fire crews requested by California had arrived, said a spokeswoman for wildfire authority Cal Fire.
The state has been hit by its worst dry-lightning storms in nearly two decades. Over 11,000 strikes have sent fire racing through grassland and forest parched by record-breaking heat.
Most of the fires are in the San Francisco Bay Area, with a complex of blazes east of Palo Alto and another in wine country south of Sacramento now the seventh and tenth largest in state history, respectively, according to Cal Fire.
""The fire continues to advance, and much of what will happen next depends on weather conditions such as wind direction and speed,"" UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive wrote in a tweet, after ordering the evacuation of the campus, which is located in hills around three miles (4.8 km) northwest of coastal city Santa Cruz's boardwalk.
""We're still understaffed for a fire of this size,"" said Daniel Potter, a Cal Fire spokesman, in reference to the Santa Cruz blaze, which has forced 64,000 people to evacuate from vulnerable towns where houses are built amongst the trees. 
One of those is Felton, a community of 4,000, where some stayed behind to defend homes after fire torched houses and California's oldest state park to the north, a Reuters photographer said.
Around 1,000 firefighters in the area fought multiple fires blown in shifting directions by erratic winds as propane tanks and ammunition stores exploded in homes, he said.
In the North Bay Area, four people died in a cluster of fires that have destroyed over 480 homes and structures in wine counties such as Napa, Solano and Sonoma, Cal Fire reported.
A utility crewman died on Wednesday while on duty helping clear electrical hazards for first-responders at the same fire, dubbed the LNU Complex. Earlier that day, the pilot of a firefighting helicopter contracted by the state was killed in a crash in Fresno County.

The largest fire, known as the SCU Complex, east of Palo Alto, more than doubled in size from Thursday to around 230,000 acres or 359 square miles, an area approaching the size of New York City.

More than 5,800 Swedes have died of COVID 19, a much higher death rate than in neighbouring Norway, Denmark and Finland which adopted much tougher measures than Sweden, leading many to question the government's approach.
But Lofven said Sweden had made the correct choice.
""The strategy that we adopted, I believe is right - to protect individuals, limit the spread of the infection, etc,"" he said in an interview in daily Dagens Nyheter.
""What has been discussed most, and what we did differently in Sweden, was that we did not close schools. Now there are quite a few people who think we were right.""
While many countries enforced strict lockdowns, Sweden has relied mainly on voluntary measures focused on social distancing, though public gatherings have been limited and care homes - which saw a heavy death toll - quarantined.
While Sweden has seen more fatalities than its neighbours, it has not been as badly hit as countries like Britain and Spain, which adopted much stricter lockdown measures.
Furthermore, while many parts of Europe are seeing a pick up in new cases as they gradually loosen restrictions on travel and social interactions, Sweden has seen a decline in both infections and deaths in recent weeks.
Lofven also defended the decision by the Public Health Agency not to enforce the wearing of facemasks, as many European countries have done, to fight the spread of the virus.
""What they are saying, and what I absolutely believe, is that they cannot be the main tool we use,"" Lofven said.

""What is important still is social distancing, testing and tracking. Those must be our main focus in order to reduce infection.""

Mancuso is in custody in the United States, where he was convicted of drug trafficking following his extradition along with other paramilitary leaders in 2008.
Colombia this week asked for his extradition. The former paramilitary boss' lawyers are seeking his deportation to Italy, where he also has citizenship and faces additional drug-trafficking charges.
The red notices, which ask authorities worldwide to provisionally detain people pending possible extradition or other legal actions, were a joint effort between the foreign ministry, the justice ministry, the national police and the high peace commission.
""By request of the justice and peace chambers of the superior tribunals of Barranquilla and Bogota, today there are three Interpol red notices against Salvatore Mancuso,"" High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos said in a video statement.
The red notices are related to murder, forced disappearance, forced displacement, torture, hostage-taking, sexual abuse and conspiracy, Ceballos said.
Mancuso, 56, was one of the main leaders of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, the country's main paramilitary group.

Far-right paramilitary units surged in the 1980s with support from farmers, land owners and others who sought to defend themselves from attacks by leftist guerrillas amid state absence. The groups became involved in drug trafficking, massacres and sexual violence, among other crimes.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The remains of four mummified humans dressed in bright colors and buried in formal graves have been uncovered during work to expand the Quebrada Blanca copper mine in the north of Chile, the mine's operators said on Friday.
The remains were found last year during excavations for a new port and could date back to Mesoamerica's Early Formative Period that ran between around 1,100 and 400 BC, Canada's Teck said.
The company said the mummies, wearing sophisticated turbans and sandals, had been perfectly preserved in the arid climate. Tests are now being run on them to determine their precise age.
""As a result of the saline conditions of the soil, the lack of rainfall and relatively low humidity, the remains are mummified in complete outfits and with a number of implements that indicate their way of life,"" it said in a statement.
Ancient kitchen areas and living rooms, as well as items including ornaments, baskets, mats and hunting items were also identified, Teck said.
The company has reported the find to the Chilean government, which will determine how to preserve the artifacts, described by archeologist Mauricio Uribe as ""one of the most remarkable finds of recent years in the Norte Grande region."" 
Teck said it would preserve the area and maintain archaeological monitoring during the remainder of the project, which seeks to extend the mine's useful life by almost 30 years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration's efforts to require airlines to collect contact tracing information from U.S.-bound international passengers has stalled, five people briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday, adding such a mandate is unlikely this year.
Major airlines and administration officials have held talks for months over a long-standing effort by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to mandate the collection and reporting of tracing information from passengers arriving to the United States from foreign destinations.
In June, Reuters reported the White House had tasked an interagency working group with adopting an interim solution that could be in place by Sept. 1 as the issue gained urgency with the coronavirus outbreak.
After a White House meeting this week, airline and U.S. officials, who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity, said no plan is likely to be adopted and in effect before the end of 2020. Some government officials have raised privacy concerns about moving forward with any contact tracing requirements.
White House spokesman Judd Deere (NYSE:DE) said Friday ""the White House continues to work with the airlines on the best solution to protect the health and safety of the public not only during this ongoing pandemic but for future ones as well.""
A spokeswoman for Airlines for America, a group representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and others, said Friday the group continues ""to work collaboratively with the federal government to implement contact tracing. We believe contact tracing is a key measure that will instill confidence for the traveling public that airlines and the federal government are prioritizing their health and safety.""
The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.
The debate over how and what data should be collected from passengers to quickly identify and contact people exposed to the coronavirus has dragged on for months. 
In February, the CDC issued an interim final rule to require airlines to collect five contact data elements from international passengers, including phone numbers, and electronically submit them to Customs and Border Protection to facilitate contact tracing.
That has not been enforced. Airlines protested, arguing they could not provide such information, especially from passengers booking tickets through third-party websites.

Airlines backed setting up a website and mobile application for passengers to send contact information directly to the CDC.

(Reuters) - A pair of tropical cyclones forecast to become hurricanes early next week are headed for the U.S. Gulf Coast and will spin over the Gulf's warm waters simultaneously, a rare weather event that could cause massive disruption as they make landfall.
The last time two cyclones entered the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was in 1959, according to meteorologists interviewed by Reuters, and there have only been a handful of other occasions when two storms entered the Gulf simultaneously. In 1933, a Category 3 hurricane and moderate tropical storm hit the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, but there have not been records of two hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico at the same time.
Tropical Storm Laura and a separate tropical depression brewing near Honduras could make landfall as hurricanes next week in an area spanning Texas to the Florida Panhandle, according to the National Hurricane Center.
Meteorologists say there is still a lot of uncertainty around the systems and how they develop and move in coming days, particularly as they cross land.
Both storms currently look on track to remain separate, however, any interaction between the two could change their intensity or trajectory, said Dan Kottlowski of AccuWeather. It is unlikely they would combine, he added.
""More than likely one will become stronger, and inflict more vertical wind shear causing the other to weaken,"" Kottlowski. ""But if they stay of equal strengthen, then they will probably prevent each other from getting really strong.""
In some cases when storms interact, they can orbit each other and the speed of one cyclone could accelerate the other, part of something known as the ""Fujiwhara effect,"" said David Streit of Commodity Weather Group.
Tropical Storm Laura, which is currently east of the Antilles, was upgraded from a depression on Friday and has sustained winds of 45 miles per hour (72 kph), according to the NHC. Laura is forecast to make landfall as a hurricane on Wednesday in an area spanning Louisiana to the Florida panhandle.
Tropical Depression 14, which would be named Marco if it strengthens, is on track to make landfall on Tuesday near the Texas and Louisiana border. It would arrive around the three-year anniversary of Hurricane Harvey, which dumped a record 50 inches (127 cm) of rain on parts of Houston in August 2017 and caused billions of dollars in damage.
""My concern is that this doubles the number of people that have to deal with it and the potential damage it might cause,"" said AccuWeather's Kottlowski.
He added that Tropical Depression 14 is likely to become the stronger storm as it is slated to pass over a relatively flat area of the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where it can gain strength.
""Tropical Depression 14 doesn't look robust right now, but it looks to be in an environment conducive to strengthening,"" said Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University.
Major oil producers  BP  (L:BP) and Shell (L:RDSa) on Friday said they were taking steps to prepare for the storm. BP said it was evacuating offshore personnel and shutting in production, while Shell said it had begun to evacuate non-essential personnel.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - The United States said on Friday it had suspended cooperation with Mali's military in response to the overthrow of the president, as thousands gathered in the capital to celebrate the junta's takeover.
The ousting of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on Tuesday has dismayed Mali's international partners, who fear it could further destabilise the former French colony and West Africa's entire Sahel region.
""Let me say categorically there is no further training or support of Malian armed forces full-stop. We have halted everything until such time as we can clarify the situation,"" the U.S. Sahel envoy J. Peter Pham told journalists.
The United States regularly provides training to soldiers in Mali, including several of the officers who led the coup. It also offers intelligence support to France's Barkhane forces, who are there to fight affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State. 
Pham said a decision on whether Washington would designate the actions a coup, which could trigger a cut-off of direct support to the government, had to go through a legal review. A Pentagon spokesperson referred on Friday to the events as an ""act of mutiny"".
Supporters of the junta filled Independence Square in the capital, Bamako, which has been largely peaceful since Tuesday's turmoil. Many of them sang, danced, tooted vuvuzelas and waved banners thanking the mutineers.
""It's a scene of joy. God delivered us from the hands of evil, we are happy, we are behind our army,"" said a 59-year-old farmer who gave his name only as Souleymane.
Some protesters also showed their disapproval of different foreign powers. One sign had the words ""Barkhane"" and ""MINUSMA"" crossed out, the latter a reference to the U.N. peacekeeping force in Mali. 
Meanwhile a couple of Russian flags could be seen waving in the crowd. Russia's ambassador to Mali has met representatives of the junta, Russian state news agency RIA reported.
France said on Thursday that Barkhane's operations would continue despite the coup. 
TRANSITION
The junta leaders have said they acted because the country was sinking into chaos and insecurity that they said was largely the fault of poor government. They have promised to oversee a transition to elections within a ""reasonable"" amount of time. 
Junta spokesman Ismael Wague said on Thursday that the officers were holding talks with political leaders that would lead to the appointment of a transitional president. 
They have held Keita since detaining him and forcing him to dissolve parliament and resign. 
A United Nations human rights team visited Keita and 13 other senior figures held by the junta late on Thursday, spokeswoman Liz Throssell said. 
""There are no indications that these people have been ill-treated,"" she told a news briefing in Geneva, where she called for their release. 
Earlier on Friday, the mutineers freed Finance Minister Abdoulaye Daffe and the president's private secretary, Sabane Mahalmoudou, the head of Keita's party, Bocary Treta, said.
A delegation from the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is expected to arrive in Bamako on Saturday, after the bloc held an emergency summit aimed at reversing Keita's ouster.

ECOWAS has already suspended Mali's membership, shut off borders and halted financial flows to the country.

The U.S. State Department did not name the 13, but in a statement said it was also designating a 14th Iranian, Hojatollah Khodaei Souri, who it said as director of Iran's Evin Prison ran an institution ""synonymous with torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.""
""The United States will continue to pressure Iran to treat its own people with dignity and respect,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.
Pompeo's statement barring the 13 officials from traveling to the United States was likely in reference to the 1990 killing of Kazem Rajavi, a leading opponent of the Iranian Government who was shot near his home in Switzerland, Reuters reported at the time, citing relatives.
Rajavi was the brother of the leader of the People's Mujahedeen, a leftist guerrilla group. The Mujahedeen's European office in Paris at the time issued a statement quoting Massoud Rajavi as saying the Iranian Embassy in Switzerland organized the killing.
Pompeo said the officials, who he called ""assassins,"" posed as Iranian diplomats and acted ""under the highest orders of their government to silence opposition and show that no one is safe from the Iranian regime.""
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have spiked since Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and began reimposing sanctions that had been eased under the accord.
The United States moved on Thursday to restore U.N. sanctions on Iran, including an arms embargo, arguing Tehran was in violation of the deal it struck with world powers in 2015 even though Washington itself abandoned the agreement.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian government on Friday appealed a Federal Court ruling that struck down on human rights grounds a pact that compels asylum seekers trying to enter Canada via the American border to first seek sanctuary in the United States.
In July, the Ottawa-based court decided the 2004 ""Safe Third Country Agreement"" between the United States and Canada violated the human rights of those trying to enter Canada because they could end up being detained by U.S. authorities.
The case will now be heard by the Federal Court of Appeal and could end up at the Supreme Court.
Craig MacBride, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, said the government believes there were factual and legal errors in the Federal Court's ruling.
""The decision suggests all asylum claimants who are ineligible ... and turned back to the U.S. are automatically detained as a penalty. This is not the case,"" MacBride said.
Experts have said that suspending the agreement would have important implications for the Canada-U.S. relationship.
Under the pact, which remains in force because the court suspended its decision to allow time for Parliament to weigh in, asylum seekers who arrive at a formal Canada-U.S. border crossing are blocked and told to apply for asylum in the first country in which they arrived.
Lawyers for refugees who were turned away at the Canadian border say the United States does not qualify as a ""safe"" country under President Donald Trump, who has taken a hard line toward legal and illegal immigration and asylum seekers.
Maureen Silcoff, president of Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, said the appeal was problematic.

""I'm deeply concerned the government wants to continue turning people back into U.S. prisons where we know they will continue to suffer,"" Silcoff said by phone, adding that the court ""cited specific examples of how people experienced intolerable conditions in detention.""

Ottawa and the province of Ontario decided to invest C$23 million ($17.5 million) each to expand the facility after experiencing serious problems as they tried to stock up on foreign-made personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers in the first weeks of the outbreak.
""We were left in a terrible, terrible situation ... and the terrifying reality is, at one point back in April, Ontario was left with less one week's supply of N95 masks,"" Premier Doug Ford told reporters.
""I promised the people of Ontario that we would never, ever again be left at the mercy of other countries for this critical PPE,"" Ford spoke at the plant in Brockville, a town about 110 km (70 miles) south of Ottawa.
Starting next year it will produce 25 million masks for the federal government and another 25 million for Ontario.
In April, Ford complained the United States had blocked the export of more than 3 million face masks Ontario had bought.
Canada has reported 123,873 total cases and 9,054 deaths. Ontario accounts for the 31% of the death toll.
Federal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the plant would help ""ensure we have the capacity to make whatever we need, here in our own communities"" and could one day export masks.

The German Foreign Ministry warned against non-essential travel to EU regions where there have been more than 50 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the past week. Belgium's province of Antwerp is already subject to a warning.
""There is currently a warning in place for non-essential, tourist travel to the capital Brussels and the province of Antwerp,"" the ministry said on its travel advice website. The restrictions mean returnees face a compulsory virus test and two weeks' quarantine if they refuse.
The ministry also issued a warning against travel to French Guyana, the French overseas province in South America that is home to the European Space Agency's main spaceport.

The protesters had gathered to demand that Iraq's parliament sack the provincial governor after two activists were killed and others wounded in three separate attacks by unknown gunmen this week. Security forces opened fire while the protesters lobbed petrol bombs.
Activist Reham Yacoub, who had led several women's marches in the past, was killed on Wednesday and three others wounded when gunmen, brandishing assault rifles on the back of a motorcycle, opened fire on their car.
It was the third incident this week in which gunmen targeted an anti-government political activist, after one activist was killed and four others had their car fired upon in a separate incident.
The wave of violence began when activist Tahseen Osama was assassinated last week, prompting street demonstrations lasting three days in which security forces opened live fire on protesters who threw rocks and petrol bombs at the governor's house and blocked several main roads.
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi sacked the Basra police and national security chiefs on Monday and ordered an investigation into the violence. That calmed protesters until Yacoub's killing brought them back out on the streets.

Kadhimi took office in April, becoming the third Iraqi head of government in a chaotic 10-week period that followed months of deadly protests in the country, which has been exhausted by decades of sanctions, war, corruption and economic challenges.

Two injured crew members have been rescued from the dredging vessel Waymon L Boyd after it caught fire, while a search for missing crew members continues, the Coast Guard said.
The fire started shortly after 9:00 AM ET (1300 GMT) in an area referred to as ""refinery row"" because of its proximity to several refining facilities, according to a spokeswoman for the Corpus Christi fire department. 
Corpus Christi is home to a number of oil refineries and shipping ports, and has become an important exporting locale for crude oil. Valero on Friday said operations at its refinery were normal. 
The U.S. Coast Guard closed the Inner Harbor from Harbor Bridge inward of the Port of Corpus Christi ship channel.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean police special forces operative appeared in court on Friday over the blinding with rubber bullets of a student during protests over inequality in November last year. 
Lieutenant Colonel Claudio Crespo was detained at his home in the capital Santiago early on Friday morning, the Chilean prosecutor's office said, on suspicion of being the officer who fired the shots that blinded Gustavo Gatica in both eyes. 
Gatica, 22, a psychology student at a Santiago university, was one of two people blinded in both eyes by police rubber bullets. At least 400 more people were injured or blinded in one eye, according to Chile’s human rights watchdog, in a grisly feature of the protests that has driven anger towards the center-right government of President Sebastian Pinera. 
The protests over inequality and elitism in Chile also resulted in at least 31 people killed, 3,000 injured, and 30,000 detained. Prosecutors are probing allegations of abuse made by over 5,000 people against the security forces.
The arrest comes before the first anniversary of the outbreak of protests on Oct. 18, and in anticipation of more amid the economic hardship wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The delayed investigation into the Gatica shooting has provoked further criticism of the authorities. Gatica told Reuters in March this year that until justice was done in his case and others, people would continue to protest.
Crespo appeared before a court in Santiago on charges of grievous bodily harm and misconduct. A spokesman for Chile's investigative police said they did not rule out further arrests. 
Jorge Martinez, a for Crespo, said his client denied responsibility for what happened and had been in a nearby church that was being looted at the time. 
Neither the prosecutor's office nor the police responded to requests for comment. 

Enrique Gatica, the victim's brother, told Reuters the family would ""wait to see how the case progresses.""

GAZA/TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Gaza militants fired rockets towards Israel, which responded with air strikes overnight, the Israeli military said, in the most serious escalation of cross-border violence in months, prompting mediators to step up de-escalation efforts. 
There were no reports of injuries on either side. An Israeli military spokeswoman said its Iron Dome system intercepted nine of 12 rockets.
Anticipating Israeli retaliation, Hamas, Gaza's Islamist ruler, routinely evacuates personnel from its sites.
Hamas has been trying to pressure Israel to ease its blockade of Gaza and allow more investment, in part by permitting Palestinians to launch helium balloons carrying incendiary material that have torched tracts of Israeli farmland in recent weeks.
""The Egyptians, the Qataris and (U.N. Middle East envoy) Nickolay Mladenov have stepped up their efforts in order to restore calm, but calm can only come if Israel agrees to demands presented by Hamas and other factions,"" a Palestinian official told Reuters.
Mladenov's office did not respond to a request for comment.
With tensions high, Israel has closed its only commercial crossing with Gaza, banned sea access and halted fuel imports into the coastal strip, causing its only power plant to shut down earlier this week.
Egyptian mediators held talks in Gaza on Monday to restore calm but left without striking an agreement, Palestinian political sources said. 
Gaza's Joint Command of armed factions, of which Hamas is a part, claimed responsibility for the rocket fire overnight, saying it would ""respond to every attack by the enemy against its positions and against our people"".
Buildings and vehicles in the southern Israeli city of Sderot were damaged, police said, and some Gaza commercial buildings and homes near the sites of Israeli air strikes on Hamas facilities were damaged. 
Later on Friday, Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz said the military ""will attack the attackers in turn, inflicting serious damage"".
""The people of Gaza suffer because of Hamas and we will continue to protect the residents of the south and the citizens of Israel,"" Gantz said following a meeting with military chiefs. 
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum accused Israel of tightening restrictions on Gaza, which Israel has blockaded since 2007 citing security concerns from Hamas. 
Israel ""undermines the life of (Gaza's) people and bombs resistance positions, and therefore they have to bear responsibility and pay the price"", Barhoum said.

There were truck lines stretching 30 km in both directions as a result of the protest that began on Monday on the BR-163 highway in the region of Novo Progresso, the tribe said in a statement.
The BR-163 highway links towns in the nation's biggest farm state Mato Grosso to the port of Miritituba, an important export river gateway in Pará state. With the soy season almost over, the main grain transported on the road at present is corn.
The tribe says the federal government has failed to protect them from the coronavirus pandemic that has killed four of their elders. 
The Kayapó are also demanding that the government resume payment of environmental reparation money agreed years ago when paving of the BR-163 highway began. 
In the talks with the Pará government, representatives of the local government also promised to help broker talks with the federal government on the Kayapó demands, according to the Kabu Institute.
Among their grievances, the tribe says it was not consulted by the federal government on plans to build the so-called Ferrogrão railway, set to cross part of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to connect Mato Grosso state to river ports for soy and corn.
The railway will run parallel to the BR-163 highway.
The Kayapó, who live on the adjacent Menkragnoti e Baú indigenous reservations, claim the road has brought illness to their people.

392,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 01:11PM ET</span>",Belarus opposition summoned; Kremlin seen standing by weakened Lukashenko,"By Andrei Makhovsky and Andrew Osborn
MINSK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two leading members of a newly formed opposition council in Belarus were questioned on Friday in a criminal case over what President Alexander Lukashenko calls an attempt to seize power, after nearly two weeks of mass rallies against his 26-year rule.
More public figures, including an Olympic athlete, came out in opposition to Lukashenko, whose political challengers say he rigged an Aug. 9 election.
In the latest act of protest, the streets of the capital Minsk were paralysed on Friday by a motorists' strike, with hundreds of drivers honking horns and abruptly abandoning cars in traffic.
The loosening of Lukashenko's grip poses a challenge both for the Kremlin, determined to keep its sway over its most loyal neighbour, and the West, which is sympathetic to a nascent pro-democracy movement but wary of provoking Russian intervention.
Two sources close to the Kremlin told Reuters President Vladimir Putin believes Lukashenko will probably cling to power for now, and is content to let him sweat it out. 
Lukashenko, who has repeatedly vowed to crush the unrest, insisted the crisis would be over soon.
""This is my problem, which I should resolve, and we are resolving it,"" he told workers at a state food factory named after the founder of the Soviet KGB. ""And believe me, in the coming days it will be resolved.""
In a sign of his dependence on Moscow, he also confirmed for the first time that journalists had been brought from Russia to staff state TV, where workers abruptly quit last week in protest against what they described as orders to broadcast propaganda.
Two leading members of the opposition Coordinating Council, Maksim Znak and Sarhey Dyleuski, were accompanied by dozens of supporters as they arrived for questioning at the headquarters of the Investigative Committee in a criminal case accusing the council of trying to seize power.
Znak, a lawyer, said on entering that he feared he might be arrested. But when he emerged later, he said he had had ""productive discussions"" and would get back to work.
The council was launched this week with the self-described aim of negotiating a transfer of power. It includes an array of public figures, among them a Nobel Prize-winning author and the ousted head of the country's main drama theatre.
The latest local hero to desert Lukashenko was Vadim Devyatovsky, an Olympic silver medallist previously prominent as a supporter, who wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that Lukashenko was ""not my president"".
NOT INTIMIDATED
A police crackdown does not seem to have intimidated the protesters and opposition has spread to include strikes at state factories long seen as bastions of support for Lukashenko.
Thousands turned out Friday, and much larger protests are expected over the weekend.
""I couldn't sit at home,"" said Tatyana, 45, a medic. ""I am not afraid. If you stay home, that means you have to live your whole life in fear.""
Lukashenko's main opponent, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has fled to neighbouring Lithuania, where she has released a steady stream of video messages calling on her followers to rise up peacefully. On Friday she called for more workers to strike.
At her first public news conference since going into exile, the 37-year-old political novice noted that Moscow had not made contact.
Belarus has by far the closest political, economic and cultural ties to Moscow of any former Soviet state, meaning Lukashenko's immediate fate is probably in the hands of the Kremlin.
The borders between Belarus and NATO are seen as vital for Russia's defence strategy, and the prospect of Moscow allowing a pro-Western government to emerge there all but inconceivable. But Lukashenko is seen in Moscow as erratic and truculent, and has long had a difficult personal relationship with Putin.
The two sources close to the Kremlin said Moscow was perfectly content to see him face difficulties.
""They'll be happy to wait a while and watch him struggle a bit. They don't like him much, but they still back him,"" said one of the sources, who regularly speaks to senior government and Kremlin officials.
The second source said: ""Lukashenko will be critically weakened. You'll be able to make mincemeat out of him. Our guys will definitely use this.""
The European Union, which has rejected Lukashenko's re-election, called for the case against the opposition council to be dropped. But European officials are keen to avert a repeat of unrest six years ago in neighbouring Ukraine, when a pro-Russian leader was toppled in an uprising and Moscow intervened militarily, precipitating Europe's deadliest ongoing conflict.

That has meant a cautious approach, including reassuring Moscow that the West is not trying to pry Belarus from Russia's orbit. ""Belarus is not Ukraine: the people there are not seeking closer ties with the EU,"" a senior EU official told Reuters.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>",Malta police question former prime minister over journalist murder,"VALLETTA (Reuters) - Malta's former prime minister Joseph Muscat was questioned by police on Friday afternoon about testimony given to officers by the suspected mastermind in the murder of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, businessman Yorgen Fenech.
Muscat resigned after it was revealed he was friends with, and had received expensive gifts from Fenech, who is awaiting trial for alleged complicity in the murder. Fenech denies the charges. 
The former premier was at police headquarters just outside Valletta for about an hour on Friday. He told journalists as he walked out that he was questioned in relation to Fenech's statement to police, details of which were reported by the Sunday Times of Malta.
""I replied to all their questions, and the police confirmed again that I am not considered a suspect,"" Muscat told waiting reporters. Police have not commented.
Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb in October 2017. Three other men are accused of setting off the bomb and are awaiting trial.
Fenech, one of Malta's top businessman, was arrested in November. 
Muscat announced his resignation immediately after Fenech's arraignment and stepped down in January. Fenech also had links with Muscat's then chief of staff Keith Schembri.
Media have reported Fenech told investigators that Muscat asked him if Schembri featured in secret recordings made by Melvin Theuma, the self-confessed middleman in the murder plot who has turned state evidence. Fenech reportedly replied that he was doing his best to protect Schembri.
Muscat has denied the claims.
A Fenech company won a contract from Muscat's government to build a power station in 2014 and a Dubai-based company owned by Fenech was identified in a Reuters investigation as a vehicle to funnel funds to secret Panama companies owned by Schembri and former Energy Minister Konrad Mizzi.

Both resigned shortly before Muscat. Both deny wrongdoing and no evidence has emerged that money was exchanged.

394,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>",Decorated veteran at center of U.S. fraud charges on border-wall fundraising,"By Joseph Tanfani and Julia Harte
(Reuters) - Brian Kolfage lost both legs and his right hand in a 2004 rocket attack in Iraq. He earned a Purple Heart and became known as one of the most severely injured U.S. service members to survive the war.
It was this reputation as a war hero - showcased particularly in conservative media - that helped him raise $27 million for President Donald Trump’s promised “wall” on the U.S. southern border, a centerpiece of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.
Now Kolfage is one of four defendants, including former presidential adviser Steve Bannon, named in a federal indictment alleging the group secretly diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars for their personal use. The indictment was unveiled in New York Thursday.
Last year, Kolfage told Reuters that his wall initiative stemmed from a desire to bolster American security amid an onslaught of immigrants from Mexico. “As citizens of our country, it’s our duty to do what’s right,” the former airman said.
At the time, Kolfage, 38, said his team had coordinated closely with the White House. Trump associate Kris Kobach - a former Kansas Secretary of State and attorney for Kolfage’s organization - briefed the president regularly on the effort, Kolfage said.
Kolfage made a seemingly patriotic promise not to “take a penny” from the wall venture. But U.S. attorneys from the Southern District of New York said in their indictment that the pledge was actually cover for a fraud and money laundering scheme that appealed to credulous donors with a story of Kolfage’s “sainthood.”
“Some of those donors wrote directly to Kolfage that they did not have a lot of money and were skeptical of online fundraising, but they were giving what they could because they trusted Kolfage would keep his word,” the indictment says.
Kolfage and Kobach did not respond to calls or messages seeking comment. Kolfage’s lawyer also declined to comment, saying he was still gathering information about the charges.
Upon leaving court in Manhattan on Thursday where he pleaded not guilty to the charges, Bannon told reporters the indictment was a “fiasco” meant to thwart efforts to build a wall. Reuters was unable to reach him separately. The other two partners, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea, were released on bond. They did not return calls and emails seeking comment. A public defender in Florida who represented Badolato at the hearing declined to comment.
Trump told reporters Thursday that from what he had read about the wall venture, he “didn't like it” and sought to distance himself from those charged. A White House spokesperson told Reuters Thursday that it had nothing to add to the president’s comments.
Americans all over the country poured money into the wall project, including Benton Stevens, an 8-year-old Texas boy who set up a hot chocolate stand and website to raise funds in early 2019. Stevens donated approximately $28,000 to Kolfage’s effort, according to his parents, and he helped cut the ribbon on Kolfage’s first completed wall project.
Jennifer Stevens, Benton’s mother, said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday that Kolfage’s enterprise had seemed “pretty legit,” and it would surprise her if the charges against Kolfage were true.
“Of course, Benton doesn’t know any of this and we probably won’t let him know about the latest news, because I don't want him to think his efforts were - you know, he's 8,"" she added.
The wall venture was not the first - or the last - instance in which Kolfage used his military record as a marketing tool and encountered controversy.
He became steeped in right-wing politics after his return from Iraq and helped launch conservative news sites. His social media posts – including false claims that President Obama’s birth certificate was fake – led Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in 2018 to ban him for breaking its rules against “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” a Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters in 2019.
In an appearance on Fox News opinion host Laura Ingraham’s show, Kolfage complained that he was being treated unfairly by Facebook. “I sacrificed three limbs for everybody, for your freedom, for your families’ freedom,” he said. He also promoted a GoFundMe campaign that raised $600,000 for Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious Supreme Court nomination.
Judicial ethics guidelines prohibit justices from accepting such donations, and in the end the money was not sent to Kavanaugh. The group said they would give the money instead to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., and some donors withdrew their pledges.
At the end of 2018, the archdiocese told Quartz it had received just over $320,000. The archdiocese did not return a request for comment on Thursday.
In March, as the COVID-19 pandemic spurred worldwide shortages of protective medical gear, Kolfage told Reuters he had launched a business called America First Medical to find and sell scarce face masks and tests to the U.S. government and hospitals. He said his goal was to prevent price gouging and scams. The prices for the masks he sold were steep, but he said they were lower than other vendors’ and he would receive only modest commissions.
“Our sole mission in this whole thing is supplying American citizens with the equipment they need,” he said, lamenting that the federal government had not responded to his mask offers, including pitches on Instagram.
'SEVEN FIGURES’
Kolfage was born in Detroit and grew up in Hawaii, according to his website. In Iraq, he was nearly killed in the rocket attack on Sept. 11, 2004. He ultimately moved to Arizona and married Ashley Kolfage, who describes herself on Instagram as a model.
Initially, Kolfage was celebrated by members of both parties. In 2012, he attended President Obama’s State of the Union address as the guest of then-U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat.
He told Reuters in the 2019 interview that he had earned “seven figures” by creating popular conservative websites such as Freedom Daily, profiting from advertising revenue, and then selling them. Reuters was unable to verify Kolfage’s claim about his earnings.
In December 2018, Kolfage launched a fundraising campaign on the GoFundMe platform called “We the People Build the Wall,” promising to turn over all money to the federal government. The appeal immediately attracted a flood of donations, aided by attention from Fox News and other media.
Facebook removed several pages about the campaign for violating the social media company’s misrepresentation policies, according to a Facebook spokeswoman in 2019.
Asked about the removals in the June 2019 interview with Reuters, Kolfage said he wasn’t involved in Facebook posts. ”I don’t touch the Facebook stuff, that’s our social media” people, Kolfage said.
But according to Thursday’s indictment, Kolfage told Shea, his partner and now co-defendant, that he could justify secret payments to Kolfage as compensation for his work on “social media.”
In January 2019, Kolfage announced his team would not donate the funds to the government but would instead use the money to hire private contractors to build it. He rebranded the effort as “We Build the Wall” and started a nonprofit organization with that name. GoFundMe donors were given the option to get refunds or transfer the funds to the new group.
In the new campaign, Kolfage, Bannon and other participants doubled down on promises that they weren’t keeping any of the money. In January 2019, Kolfage wrote on Twitter: “I made a promise I would NEVER take a penny….100% means 100% right?”
In another Twitter post, he asked donors to the wall to buy from his “Military Grade Coffee” business to help him pay his bills.
In March, Kolfage told Reuters he had begun accepting $10,000 a month in salary from the wall organization, saying the amount was modest compared to salaries paid by other nonprofits of that size.
Actually, according to the indictment, he had received a one-time payment of $100,000 as early as February 2019, plus $20,000 a month routed through a Bannon nonprofit and corporations that were supposedly working on the wall project.
Kolfage spent the money on items including home renovations, cosmetic surgery, jewelry, a 2018 Land Rover and payments on a fishing boat called ""Warfighter,"" the indictment alleged.
GoFundMe said Friday that it had banned Kolfage from the site given the fraud indictment.
‘QUITE DISAPPOINTING’
Some donors to “We Build the Wall” are withholding judgment on the charges against Kolfage.
Ray Nurnberger, a lumber yard manager from Long Island, New York, told Reuters on Thursday that they are “quite disappointing” if true. But Nurnberger said he wouldn’t be surprised if they were false, since the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office “has it in for anything or anyone to do with President Trump.”
Ultimately, Kolfage’s group paid to build two sections of wall, one about a mile and the other 3.5 miles. The project drew praise from Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, who credited him for “showing really what capitalism is all about” at a July 2019 immigration symposium at the southern border, according to a video posted on We Build the Wall’s website.
Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for Donald Trump Jr., said in a statement that he had no involvement with the group besides that event.

“If he and others were deceived, the group deserves to be held accountable for their actions,” she said.

Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, he has traded in his comfortable house in Havana for his roadside, tiny wooden juice shack out by the fortress overlooking the city bay to self-isolate. 
The 55-year-old considers that up on the sparsely populated hillside from which Spanish soldiers used to fend off pirates, he is safe from the highly contagious virus that has infected around 2,000 in the city sprawling below.
He can also better look after his hut that usually sells lemonade, coconut water and mojitos to tourists but has been closed for business ever since the Caribbean island nation in March shut its borders and ordered a lockdown.
The suspension of public transport means his night custodian cannot make it to work and he is worried about vandals.
""I feel protected here in my little home,"" said Viguera, who usually lives in a residential, western Havana district with his sister and nephew. ""I miss being with my family but I chat with them by phone.""
Viguera sleeps on a camping bed in the 3.5 meter by 2.5 meter shed and leaves the front flap open to prevent it heating up too much in the fierce summer sun. A friend brings him food and water.
In the evenings, he sometimes wanders over to the cantine for the soldiers who work at the fortress to get a hot meal, trusting it follows COVID-19 hygiene recommendations to the letter.
They welcome him with open arms, he says, as he used to work there too until he decided to go it alone, setting up shop in Cuba's fledgling private sector.
Now he struggles to live off his savings as there has been no financial aid for those who are self-employed.
While Cuba has done a fairly successful job at containing its coronavirus outbreak, Viguera says he will ride it out in his hut until the end.

""I wish the illness would end now so I could go home,"" he said. ""But I will be here until there isn't a single case, until the pandemic is over.""

CALAIS, France (Reuters) - Standing in front of the remains of dozens of inflatable craft in the backyard of a police station, Captain Eric Binet has a message for migrants considering the sea crossing to Britain: don't risk your lives. 
Warm weather and a deceptively calm-looking sea are tempting dozens of migrants to board rubber dinghies for the 30 km crossing to Dover (NYSE:DOV), whose white cliffs are visible from Calais, while police try to stop them before they put to sea. 
On Wednesday, a young Sudanese man was found dead on a French beach, the first victim this year of a new route to Britain used by hundreds of people in recent weeks. 
At the Marquise police station near Calais, the engines and jerrycans full of fuel are stored inside, but piled against a wall outside is an assortment of inflatable craft confiscated from migrants in recent weeks. 
""From here, it looks like Britain is just a hop, skip, and a jump, but that is an illusion. The Channel is a busy shipping highway, and there are violent currents,"" Binet told Reuters, adding that migrants often take to sea with 20 to 25 people in an underinflated boat with an underpowered engine.
Day and night, police scour the beaches and dunes around Calais, looking for migrants hiding as they wait for the right moment, their equipment often buried under the sand. 
Major Florent Decrouille, who commands a patrol on the beaches west of Calais, said his men prevent several crossing attempts each week. 
A few days ago they stopped a vehicle carrying seven migrants, an inflatable boat, an engine and a can of fuel. 

""It is a good thing their attempt failed, they would have risked their lives. The sea was very, very rough,"" he said.

MINSK (Reuters) - A husband in jail, her children hurried abroad and a secret crossing from Belarus into Lithuania in the dead of night: Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's journey from home life to opposition hero has been an improbable one. And it's not over yet.
The 37-year-old former English teacher was never supposed to be the figurehead of popular resistance to President Alexander Lukashenko, the former Soviet collective farm boss who has ruled for over a quarter of a century. 
But when her husband, a well known video blogger, was jailed in May and other candidates were barred from running in the Aug. 9 presidential election, Tsikhanouskaya emerged as challenger-in-chief to a man whose position suddenly looks precarious.
""Initially, I was not going to do this. It did not even occur to me,"" Tsikhanouskaya told Reuters in a July 30 interview, referring to her decision to take her husband's place as an opposition candidate on the ballot.
""It was an emotional decision when they refused to register Syarhei.""
At first she shied away from the public gaze.
""I was confused, I didn't know what to do,"" she said.
But she carried on, encouraged by other opposition leaders and the thousands of signatures collected on her behalf that were needed for her to register as a candidate. Her campaign rallies drew tens of thousands of people as support snowballed.
Lukashenko's claims of a landslide election victory were disputed by the opposition and sparked mass protests in the country of 9.5 million.
Now all eyes are on Tsikhanouskaya, in self-imposed exile in neighbouring Lithuania since Aug. 11, when she slipped over the border at 3.30 a.m.
There, reunited with her children, she has tried to orchestrate opposition to a leader who is used to getting his own way. Yet Lukashenko clings to power.
    
GROWING ANGER
Tsikhanouskaya's husband, who compared Lukashenko to a moustachioed cockroach from a children's fairy tale, had tapped growing frustration against the president, in power since 1994.
He is in prison charged with assaulting a police officer, violating public order and preparing riots. Supporters say the accusations against him are fabricated. 
Frustration turned to anger for many over Lukashenko's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which he dismissed as a ""psychosis"" and recommended drinking vodka, taking saunas and driving tractors as remedies.
Pro-government media ridiculed the aspirations of the stay-at-home mother to become president. Lukashenko said the burden of office would cause a woman to ""collapse, poor thing"".
But the campaign gained momentum, helped by two other women - Veronika Tsepkalo, wife of former U.S. ambassador Valery who was barred from running, and Maria Kolesnikova, member of the team of Viktor Babariko, who was jailed at the start of the campaign.
""We could not imagine that it would be supported by the whole of Belarus society, this idea of three women organized against this regime. It has became a symbol of resistance for the whole world,"" Valery Tsepkalo told Reuters from exile in Moscow on July 26.
The head of the Central Election Commission, Lidia Yermoshina, mockingly called them the ""Three Graces"". 
Yet when they embarked on a series of electoral rallies, the women quickly drew crowds of thousands of people across the country.
Throughout the campaign, the pressure on Tsikhanouskaya and her family did not let up.
According to his associates, Syarhei was sent to solitary confinement for 14 days in June and another 4 days in July as punishment for sitting on the windowsill of his cell, for not removing a cobweb on the ceiling and for not shaving.
Tsikhanouskaya said she could barely recognise her husband because he had lost so much weight when she saw him on a screen at a court hearing. The interior ministry declined comment on the conditions of her husband's detention and his weight loss. 
On June 16 she said she had been threatened with having her children taken away if she did not give up.
The General Prosecutor's office has said it would investigate the suspected threats against Tsikhanouskaya's children. They declined further comment.
    
MYSTERY DISAPPEARANCE
When Lukashenko claimed to have won 80 percent of the Aug. 9 vote, Tsikhanouskaya refused to recognise the result and demanded a recount.
The next day she went to the Central Election Commission (CEC) to submit an official complaint. Then she vanished.
Reuters was not able to establish all of the details of what happened inside the building.
According to Olga Kovalkova, one of Tsikhanouskaya's aides who accompanied her there, she was separated from her lawyer and taken to an office.
The head of the commission, Yermoshina, said she introduced Tsikhanouskaya to two security men who had a long discussion with her, according to comments to Russia's Komsomolskaya Pravda. The election commission could not be reached for comment.
Tsikhanouskaya did not re-emerge, Kovalkova said, and it was only when she turned up in Lithuania that they knew she must have left the commission via another exit.
""When we arrived at the CEC building, there were no plans from her that she was planning to leave Belarus. We planned to fight for victory,"" Kovalkova told Reuters.
Her husband also did not know, and found out from his lawyer Viktor Matskevich, the lawyer said.
    
PLOT THICKENS
Hours after she disappeared, looking shaken and downbeat, Tsikhanouskaya released a video from Lithuania. 
""You know, I thought that this whole campaign had really toughened me up,"" she said to the camera.
""But, probably, I'm still the weak woman I was in the first place. I have made a very difficult decision for myself,"" she said, adding that political tumult in Belarus was not worth anyone losing their life for.
""Children are the main thing in life.""
Lukashenko said the government had helped Tsikhanouskaya leave ""at her request"", without elaborating. 
A separate video surfaced on Aug. 11, apparently filmed at the election commission building.
In it, she read from a piece of paper in stilted official language and reversed her earlier stance by asking supporters to accept the election results and stop protesting. The government and the election commission could not be reached for comment on the video.
Tsikhanouskaya's political ambitions are not over, however.
She released a video this week urging foreign powers not to recognise the election results and helped set up an opposition council to push for a transition of power.
Belarus has launched a criminal case against the council, accusing it of an illegal attempt to seize power, and Lukashenko threatened to clear the streets of protesters who reject his re-election.
In her first press conference since leaving Belarus, she called for new elections that were free and fair, and told reporters she would return home when she felt it was safe. 

Asked whether she had been threatened by the Belarus authorities, Tsikhanouskaya declined to comment. She travels around Vilnius in a black van with tinted windows, followed by three police vans carrying armed police in bullet proof gear.

Video run by Belgian media on Wednesday showed the man bleeding after banging his head against the wall of a police cell. Later it appeared to show an officer kneeling on him, while another raised her hand in what resembled a Nazi salute.
The man, Josef Chovanec, in his late 30s, died in hospital the day after his detention.
""This footage shocked us as well as the entire Slovak society. We resolutely reject ... practices. (They) are unacceptable and have no place in democratic society,"" , Slovak Foreign Minister Ivan Korcok told reporters.
He said a verbal note on the incident was delivered to the Belgian government in Brussels, including complaints about ""police brutality"".
A Belgian interior minister spokesman said the images were ""shocking"" and the ministry had asked the national police to consider disciplinary measures against the officers involved.
The national police said an internal investigation had begun, in addition to a judicial inquiry that was launched after the incident and remains ongoing.
Chovanec was detained after causing a disturbance at Charleroi airport in southern Belgium. He had repeatedly travelled to Belgium on business.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 09:22AM ET</span>","EU, Britain trade blame after scant progress towards post-Brexit deal","By Gabriela Baczynska and William James
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union made scant progress towards a deal on future ties in talks this week, and their chief negotiators blamed each other for the stalemate as time ticks down to an end-of-year deadline.
""Those who were hoping for negotiations to move swiftly forward this week will have been disappointed,"" the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told a news conference after two full days of talks in Brussels.
His British counterpart David Frost said a deal on post-Brexit relations was ""still possible"" and was still London's goal but would not be easy to achieve.
""There are ... significant areas which remain to be resolved and even where there is a broad understanding between negotiators, there is a lot of detail to work through,"" Frost said in a statement. ""Time is short for both sides.""
British officials said London was willing to talk about any issue and that the EU's insistence Britain must accept its position on state aid and fisheries meant Brussels was responsible for slowing the talks down.
On Jan. 31, Britain became the first country ever to leave the EU, which it had joined in 1973. 
Their relationship is now governed by a transition arrangement that keeps previous rules in place while they negotiate a new partnership, to be effective from 2021, on everything from trade and transport to energy and security.
The EU says Britain can only go on trading freely with its lucrative single market of 450 million people if London accepts ""level playing field"" rules to guarantee fair competition.
""THE CLOCK IS TICKING""
Without an agreement, trade and financial ties between the world's fifth-largest economy and biggest trading bloc would break down, potentially deepening the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Disagreements over state aid rules and fishing quotas have so far thwarted a deal, which the EU says must be in the making in time to be approved at an Oct. 15-16 summit of the bloc's 27 national leaders to enable ratification this year. 
Beyond the biggest stumbling blocks, differences also linger in discussions on migration, security, dispute-settling mechanisms, human rights guarantees and other areas.
With the coronavirus pandemic wreaking economic havoc and both sides of the Channel wanting to avoid an even deeper recession, EU sources had been relatively upbeat in recent weeks that an agreement could be reached on time. 
Barnier sounded downbeat on Friday, however, saying he was ""disappointed and concerned"" because British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told the EU he wanted to speed up the negotiating process over the summer.
""This week, once again, as in the July round, the British negotiators have not shown any real willingness to move forward on issues of fundamental importance for the European Union,"" Barnier said. ""And this despite the flexibility which we have shown over recent months.""
Barnier said no progress at all was made this week on the vexed question of fishing rights in UK waters, and overall negotiations often appeared to be going backwards rather than forwards and so, at this stage, an agreement looked unlikely.
""On the European side, we are very concerned about the state of play in our negotiations. The clock is ticking,"" he said.
He did note, however, some progress on energy and anti-money laundering cooperation from 2021.

An EU diplomat said few had expected significant progress this month, and there are better prospects for headway to be made in the next round of negotiations, which will be held in London during the second week of September.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko will probably cling to power for now despite protests against him and is content to let him sweat it out, two sources close to the Kremlin said.
Lukashenko, a long-standing but truculent Moscow ally, has been buffeted by nearly two weeks of street protests which have loosened his grip on power in a country many Russians regard as another Russian region in all but name.
That, the two sources said, suits the Kremlin. It is keen to deal with a weakened Lukashenko who has resisted and sometimes publicly railed against Moscow's offers of deeper political and economic integration. 
""They'll be happy to wait a while and watch him struggle a bit. They don't like him much, but they still back him,"" said one of the sources, who regularly speaks to senior government and Kremlin officials.
The second source said a diminished Lukashenko would suit the Kremlin's needs. 
""Lukashenko will be critically weakened. You'll be able to make mince meat out of him. Our guys will definitely use this.""
The Kremlin did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Putin has offered Lukashenko assistance if needed but the Kremlin said on Wednesday it saw no need to help Belarus militarily or otherwise for now.
An EU diplomat said Russia had many levers to influence the situation in Belarus and was probably not too concerned yet by events there.
""They have to be smart, but I think they still feel in control of the situation,"" the diplomat said. 
The Kremlin has told EU nations to keep out of Belarus.
WEATHER THE CRISIS
Joined by a treaty that proclaims, on paper, a ""union state"" with a Soviet-style red flag, the two countries usually have no border controls, and are culturally, linguistically and economically intertwined. Putin has pushed hard to make the union state more of a political and economic reality.
Russia has repeatedly asked Lukashenko to let it open an air base in Belarus, something he has refused in the past.
The first source said that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the Belarusian opposition leader who fled into exile in Lithuania last week, did not yet look like a serious contender in Moscow's eyes.
Tsikhanouskaya has led the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's 26-year rule. Speaking at her first press conference since leaving Belarus, she said on Friday that Russia had not made contact with her campaign.
Both sources said the Kremlin calculated that Lukashenko would weather the crisis, despite making tactical mistakes and resorting to heavy-handed policing.
""Everything will end badly for Lukashenko, just not yet,"" the second source said.
Lukashenko knows that Moscow ""always supports existing regimes, no matter how unpalatable"", the source said, and forecast that protests alone would not be enough to force him out.
""Somebody else needs to put pressure on him for that to happen, and there's nobody to do that.""
A spokeswoman for Lukashenko could not immediately be reached for comment.
STRATEGIC PRIZE
Russian energy exports flow via Belarus to the West, Moscow supplies cheap oil and gas to Belarus, and Russian troops have taken part in huge war games on Belarusian soil in the past. 
Ukraine's Commander in Chief at the time, Viktor Muzhenko, told Reuters in 2017 that he believed Russia had left thousands of troops behind in Belarus after a huge military exercise, something which both Belarus and Russia have denied.
The Russian air force has a radar station in Belarus designed to track ballistic missile launches. It also has a naval communications facility which Moscow uses to communicate with its nuclear submarines. Russia's western border, which faces the EU, is heavily militarised.
Moscow has long regarded Belarus as a buffer zone against NATO, according to Western diplomats, who say they believe any move for Belarus to join the European Union or NATO would be a red line for Russia and could prompt it to send in troops.
Reuters has observed busy Russian air traffic between Russia and Belarus since the crisis erupted there on Aug. 9 after a presidential election which protesters said Lukashenko rigged.
A Russian government plane made a quick flight to Belarus and back in the early hours of Wednesday, flight tracking data showed. The plane has been used in the past to carry senior officials, including the head of the FSB security service.
On Aug. 12, two military planes flew to Belarus and a third, a military transport plane, turned off its transponder en route there, according to the tracking data.
Western diplomats say they cannot envisage Russia surrendering its influence over Belarus.
Via Belarus, it has access to the so-called Suwalki Gap, a strip of land which separates Poland from Lithuania. On the opposite side of that gap lies the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

In the event of conflict with NATO, Russia could in theory cut off the Baltic states from the rest of the Western military alliance by seizing the gap. That, say the diplomats, is a strategic prize Moscow is unlikely to relinquish anytime soon.

MINSK (Reuters) - Two leading members of a newly formed opposition council in Belarus were questioned on Friday in a criminal case that accuses the body of trying to seize power from President Alexander Lukashenko after a disputed election.
Dozens of supporters accompanied Maksim Znak and Sarhey Dyleuski as they arrived for questioning at the headquarters of the Investigative Committee.
Znak, a lawyer, said on entering that he feared he might be arrested. But when he emerged later, he said he had ""productive discussions"".
""We gave our explanation, we will continue to work,"" he said.
The Coordinating Committee was launched this week with the self-described aim of negotiating a transfer of power amid the largest political crisis in Belarus since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Lukashenko, in power for 26 years, was declared the winner of an Aug. 9 presidential election, but tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets saying the election is rigged.
A police crackdown does not seem to have intimidated the protesters and opposition has spread to include strikes at state factories long seen as bastions of Lukashenko's support.
Public figures from sport and the media have deserted him in recent days, significant developments in a country where the state controls nearly all cultural bodies.
""NOT MY PRESIDENT""
Vadim Devyatovsky, an Olympic silver medalist previously prominent as a Lukashenko supporter, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that Lukashenko was ""not my president"". His previous position was ""treason to myself"" and having switched sides ""everything has become lighter"", he said.
Lukashenko's main opponent, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has fled to neighbouring Lithuania, where she has released a steady stream of video messages calling on her followers to rise up peacefully. On Friday she called for more workers to go on strike to protest against the election result.
At her first public news conferece since going into exile, the 37-year-old political novice said she would return to Belarus when she felt it was safe.
Prosecutors opened a criminal case on Thursday alleging that the Coordinating Committee was set up as an illegal attempt to seize power. The committee, made up of dozens of public figures including a Nobel Prize-winning author and the ousted head of the country's main drama theatre, says its aims are peaceful and its tactics lawful.
Council member Deleuski said after Friday's questioning that he had told the investigators the body did not seek power but aimed to mediate.
""There is a disputed situation now between the authorities, the state, and the people of the Republic of Belarus. We were established to settle this situation in a safe way, without conflict, by peaceful means.""
The European Union, which has rejected Lukashenko's re-election, called for the case to be dropped.
""We expect the Belarusian authorities to stop the criminal case and instead to engage in a dialogue in view of moving towards a peaceful way out of the current crisis,"" Nabila Massrali, an EU foreign policy spokeswoman, said.
Belarus is a close ally of Moscow and the crisis is a test for the Kremlin, which must decide whether to stick with Lukashenko or try to engineer a transfer of power. 
It is also a challenge for the West. The country's borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia are NATO frontiers and eastern European states have spoken in support of the opposition.
But European officials are also keen avert a repeat of unrest six years ago in neighbouring Ukraine, when a pro-Russian leader was toppled in an uprising and Moscow intervened militarily.
That has meant a cautious approach, including reassuring Moscow the West is not trying to pry Belarus from Russia's orbit.
""Belarus is not Ukraine: the people there are not seeking closer ties with the EU,"" a senior EU official told Reuters.

The EU was trying to encourage Belarusian authorities to negotiate with the opposition, ""without tilting the geo-political balance for Belarus between the EU and Russia"".

Control of the waters is politically sensitive, and many farmers' and fishermen's livelihoods depend on the river. A report published by a U.S. research company this year accused China of holding back large amounts of water during a drought last year, a finding Beijing disputed.
China has no formal water treaties with the lower Mekong countries - Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam - and is currently only sharing limited data during the monsoon season on flows to what it knows as the Lancang River.
""China stressed that it is ready to share information with us in a clear, meaningful and transparent way throughout the year,"" Nikorndej Balankura, a senior Thai foreign ministry official told reporters. ""Information will be shared seamlessly.""
China's Foreign Ministry said in response to a request for comment that it did not want to pre-empt an online summit on Monday of leaders of the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) group, which includes China and the Mekong countries.
Lower Mekong countries already share water data through the Mekong River Commission (MRC), an intergovernmental body with headquarters in Vientiane in Laos. The LMC water center is based in Beijing.

The MRC this month called for better data-sharing between countries and companies that operate hydropower dams along the Mekong as flows hit record lows for a second consecutive year.

404,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",Explainer: Reaching herd immunity in a viral pandemic,"By Manas Sharma, Simon Scarr and Jane Wardell
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The novel coronavirus pandemic has brought ""herd immunity"" to the public consciousness, kindling hope the phenomenon can help slow or even end the outbreak.
Herd immunity refers to a large portion of a community developing a degree of immunity to a virus, thereby reducing person-to-person spread. As a result, the whole community gains protection, not just those who are immune.
(Click here for a Reuters graphic on how a vaccine slows the spread of a virus https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/HERD%20IMMUNITY%20(EXPLAINER)/ygdvzmqqgpw/index.html)
NATURAL INFECTION VS VACCINATION
There are two pathways to herd immunity: natural infection or vaccination.
Natural infection refers to when a large number of people have had a disease and recovered. However, the extent of protection via natural infection is unknown with the new coronavirus. Moreover, more people would die while waiting for herd immunity than if a vaccine was produced.
""The risk is not acceptable,"" said Catherine Bennett, epidemiology chair in the Faculty of Health at Melbourne's Deakin University. ""We can't afford to have people infected to reach herd immunity when we know so little about the longer-term effects.""
Vaccination can provide widespread immunity faster and more reliably.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19 - the disease caused by the novel coronavirus - though trials at different stages are underway around the world. It usually takes several years for a vaccine to be identified, tested, produced and distributed for public use. Vaccine makers hope to dramatically compress that timeline for COVID-19 through faster trials and by manufacturing at scale even before products have proved successful. 
Experts believe if no other measures are taken, herd immunity could kick in when 50% to 70% of a population gains immunity through vaccination. The precise level depends on the vaccine's efficacy rate, which experts say will be 70% at best.
BALANCING VACCINE DISTRIBUTION
How a vaccine is distributed has implications for effectiveness. If shared unevenly - for example, if the wealthy have greater access than those in poorer locations - that would create safe clusters but leave large areas of susceptible people.
In the early stages of distribution, higher priority may be given to healthcare workers and others on front lines, or those considered most vulnerable - a process known as targeted vaccination. That risks missing people who might be considered ""super spreaders"", such as public transport workers.
""We need to be sure that we spread the vaccine equitably through the population,"" said Joel Miller, a senior lecturer in applied mathematics at La Trobe University in Melbourne, who uses mathematical models to help governments and non-profit organisations formulate policies to control infectious diseases.
MOVEMENT RESTRICTIONS
The movement of people also has implications for the spread of a virus.
At lower vaccination levels, the number of people who eventually become infected is similar in a group of people who mix and travel widely, and a group of people who are relatively static. However, the spread is much slower in a static population, hence governments worldwide imposing lockdown measures.
Even when a high percentage of the population is vaccinated, infection numbers can be reduced further if people refrain from travel.
WHILE WE WAIT
The new coronavirus is spread primarily via droplets expelled when a person coughs, sneezes or even talks.
Until a vaccine is developed, wearing masks, physical distancing and hand hygiene can help reduce transmission and contribute to creating herd immunity.
Epidemiologists largely agree that a combined approach is critical given early vaccines brought to market will likely not have 100% efficacy.

""It's about adding layers,"" said Deakin University's Bennett. ""It gives us extra protection from community spread. The situation is very much better in places where a combination of measures is being used.""

Jacob Ngarivhume has been in detention for a month after his arrest along with journalist Hopewell Chin'ono on charges of inciting violence, after he called for protests on July 31 against corruption and the government's mishandling of the economy.
Critics accuse President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government of persecuting its opponents amid the worst economic crisis in more than a decade, a charge the authorities deny.
Magistrate Trynos Utahwashe said the fact that July 31 had come and gone without the violence the state had feared was ""not sufficient to guarantee the safety of the public if the accused is granted bail"".
Ngarivhume, who arrived at court in leg irons and handcuffs, will return to court on Sept. 4 for a routine appearance.
His lawyer Moses Nkomo said he was ""stunned"" by the court's decision but would appeal at the High Court next week.

BETHON, France (Reuters) - Winemakers in France's Champagne region are this week gathering a bumper grape harvest, but there is a bitter aftertaste: the slump in demand for bubbly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic means some of the harvest will go to waste.
""We make the wine of happiness, and when people are sad, like during the lockdown, sales of champagne tend to collapse,"" said Vincent Leglantier, a 34-year-old wine grower in Bethon, about 120 km (75 miles) east of Paris.
At the Brun de Neuville vineyard collective, to which Leglantier belongs, teams of pickers in baseball caps worked their way along rows of vines, collecting grapes by hand. Most are migrant workers from eastern Europe who come every harvest season.
But this year is different. Sales are sharply down because weddings and parties -- drivers of demand for champagne -- are being cancelled around the world. 
In response, French champagne producers decided this month to put a cap on the amount of grapes they send for processing into wine.
They took the decision because a glut of the drink in cellars and on wholesalers' shelves would drive down prices and tarnish the aura of luxury and exclusivity that the industry has spent years building up. 
But the cap - limiting the amount of grapes that can be harvested from a hectare to 8,000 kg -- means that anything over that figure must be left to rot.
The quota is one fifth less than last year's harvest and this year, because of hot sunny weather that growers ascribe to climate change, the yield in many vineyards is even more bountiful than usual.

""You could say it's maybe the best of the bad deals we could have reached,"" Damien Champy, head of the Brun de Neuville vineyard cooperative, said of the quota as he stood in the cellar where bottles of champagne are left to mature.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's plan to roll-out its ""Sputnik-V"" COVID-19 vaccine even before full trials show how well it works is prompting concern among virus experts, who warn a partially effective shot may encourage the novel coronavirus to mutate. 
Viruses, including the pandemic SARS-CoV-2, are known for their ability to mutate all the time - and often this has little or no impact on the risk posed to people. 
But some scientists are worried that adding ""evolutionary pressure"" to the pathogen by deploying what might not be a fully protective vaccine could make things worse.
""Less than complete protection could provide a selection pressure that drives the virus to evade what antibody there is, creating strains that then evade all vaccine responses,"" said Ian Jones, a virology professor at Britain's Reading University.
""In that sense, a poor vaccine is worse than no vaccine.""
Sputnik-V's developers, as well as financial backers and Russian authorities, say the vaccine is safe and that two months of small-scale human trials have shown that it works. 
But the results of those trials have not been made public, and many Western scientists are sceptical, warning against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory hurdles have been passed.
Russia said on Thursday it plans to begin a large-scale efficacy trial of the vaccine in a total of 40,000 people, but will also begin administering it to people in high-risk groups, such as healthcare workers, before the trial has produced any results. 
""You want to make sure the vaccine is effective. We really don't know that (about the Sputnik vaccine),"" said Kathryn Edwards, a professor of paediatrics and vaccine expert in the infectious diseases division at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in the United States.
She said that the risk of what a vaccine might do to a virus - in terms of fighting it, blocking it, or forcing it to adapt - is ""always a concern"".
Dan Barouch, a specialist at Harvard's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, noted that mutation rates for coronaviruses are far lower than for viruses like HIV, but added: ""There are many potential downsides of using a vaccine that doesn't work. The risk that it (the virus) would mutate is a theoretical risk.""
Scientists say similar evolutionary pressure to mutate is seen with bacterial pathogens, which - when faced with antibiotics designed to target them - can evolve and adapt to evade the drugs and develop resistance. 
Antibiotic resistance and the rise of superbugs, is described by the World Health Organization as one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development today. 
Jones stressed that vaccine-induced viral mutations are ""a rare outcome"", and the greater the efficacy of the vaccine in blocking a virus' ability to enter cells and replicate there, the lower the risk of it having an opportunity to circulate and ""learn"" how to evade antibody defences.

""If (a vaccine) is completely sterilizing, the virus can't get in, so it can't learn anything because it never gets a chance,"" he said. ""But if it gets in and replicates ... there is selection pressure for it to evade whatever antibodies have been generated by the inefficient vaccine. And you don't know what the outcome of that will be.""

408,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",Northern Cyprus set to reopen Cypriot ghost town on ceasefire lines,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Northern Cyprus is almost ready to begin reopening the town of Varosha, the breakaway state's premier said on Friday, a former resort area fenced off and abandoned in no-man's land since a 1974 Turkish invasion that split the island.
Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Ersin Tatar said the revival of Varosha, now an eerie collection of derelict hotels, churches and residences, would bring trade and tourism benefits. 
The move is likely to anger Greek Cypriots, 39,000 of whom once lived in Varosha before fleeing advancing Turkish forces 46 years ago, and stoke tensions between the two sides.
Varosha, a southern suburb of the city of Famagusta, has been a ghost town since the invasion, following a brief Greek-inspired coup, that partitioned the eastern Mediterranean island along ceasefire lines into Turkish and Greek Cypriot sides.
The former holiday resort has been off limits to all but the Turkish military since 1974.
Varosha has become a bargaining chip in the decades-long dispute between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Ringed by a fence extending into the sea, the town is overrun by cacti and debris.
""Varosha is most definitely going to be opened. The tide has shifted, a new page has been turned,"" Tatar said. (Northern Cyprus) will become stronger by opening Varosha to tourism."" 
Tatar gave no specific time line for reopening Varosha.
""Varosha lies within TRNC territory,"" he said, referring to Northern Cyprus, recognised as a state only by Turkey. ""Nobody can take it from us. We are successfully continuing on our path. The inventory work is almost complete, we are in the opening phase.""
In February, Turkish and Turkish Cypriot officials visited Varosha, marking one of the most concrete steps by either side towards reviving the ghost town.

The island's Greek Cypriots live mainly in the south, a republic that is in the European Union. Several peacemaking efforts have made no significant progress and the discovery of offshore energy resources has complicated the picture further.

The city-state, which currently only allows official and business travel to selected countries, also said it would allow students to travel for study overseas if distance-learning was not available.
The measures would take effect on Sept. 1, with various restrictions, the health ministry said.
Singapore sealed its borders in March and subsequently went into a two-month lockdown as mass outbreaks in cramped migrant worker dormitories emerged. 
Those lockdown measures were lifted in June and the travel and tourism hub - facing its worst recession in history - has been taking steps to slowly resume business and stimulate the economy.

411,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 06:46AM ET</span>","Russia's Navalny, Putin's nemesis and crusader against graft","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Alexei Navalny has been the biggest thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, persistently detailing what he says is high-level graft and mobilising crowds of young protesters in a country where the opposition has no meaningful power.
The 44-year-old lawyer, in a coma in hospital on Friday after a suspected poisoning, has never challenged President Vladimir Putin at the ballot box but is the highest-profile leader of Russia's deeply divided government opponents.
Part of a new generation prepared to take to the streets to make their views heard, he came to prominence when demonstrations against Putin took off in December 2011, 12 years after the former KGB officer first came to power.
Navalny was one of the first protest leaders arrested and after 15 days in jail for obstructing police, he emerged a hero, with protesters chanting his name at demonstrations and giving his booming, rousing speeches the biggest cheers.
By the time the protests started to fade in the spring of 2012, Putin was back in the Kremlin as president while Navalny had established himself as the largey undisputed leader of an opposition operating mostly outside official structures.
That preeminence has faded amid internal policy differences and squabbling among various factions, and some other opposition figures have questioned how far his support extends beyond Russia's big cities.
He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings and rallies and sued over the detailed investigations into corruption which he posts on his YouTube channel, gaining millions of views. 
He was barred from running in a presidential election in 2018 and jailed last summer after calling for mass opposition protests in Moscow which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets. 
His anti-corruption foundation has been found guilty of violating a ""foreign agent"" law and he was convicted of corruption by Russian authorities in 2013. His supporters say it and other cases against him are politically motivated.
""Putin is very angry and is stamping his feet,"" he said last year after police raided the homes and offices of his supporters across Russia in what they said was an investigation into money laundering at his foundation.
Four days earlier, he had led a tactical voting campaign that dented the ruling party's hold on Moscow city assembly.
The son of an army officer, he was born on June 4, 1976, and grew up mainly in Obninsk, about 100 km (62 miles) southwest of Moscow.
After a law degree, he spent time in the United States on a fellowship at Yale, which pro-Kremlin critics have seized on as evidence that he is a foreign agent.
In 2007, he was expelled from Russia's liberal Yabloko opposition party for nationalist views which he has since toned down.
He also studied securities and exchanges and bought small stakes in some of Russia's biggest companies to demand greater transparency for shareholders and the public.

He is now in a Siberian hospital in a serious condition after falling ill on a flight and being stretchered off the plane.

The mediaeval Church of the Holy Saviour in Chora, built near the ancient city walls of Constantinople, contains 14th century Byzantine mosaics and frescoes showing scenes from biblical stories.
They were plastered over after the city was conquered by the Muslim Ottomans in 1453, but brought to light again when - like Hagia Sophia - the building was converted to a museum by Turkey's secular republic more than 70 years ago.
Erdogan, whose AK Party is rooted in political Islam, has positioned himself as a champion of Turkey's pious Muslims and last month joined tens of thousands of worshippers in the first prayers at Hagia Sophia in 86 years.
The move was sharply criticised by church leaders and some Western countries, who said that reconverting Hagia Sophia exclusively for Muslim worship risked deepening religious rifts.
Last year a Turkish court annulled a 1945 government decision converting Chora - known as Kariye in Turkish - into a museum run by the Education Ministry. 
On Friday, an edict signed by Erdogan and published in Turkey's official gazette declared ""the management of the Kariye Mosque be transferred to the Religious Affairs Directorate, and (the mosque) opened to worship.""
A church was first built at the site in the 4th century, but most of the existing building dates to an 11th century church that was partly rebuilt 200 years later following an earthquake.
Erdogan's edict on Friday did not say when the first Muslim prayers would be held at Chora, or what arrangements would be made for the Christian artworks there. 

At Hagia Sophia, curtains have been drawn in front of an image facing worshippers of Mary and the infant Jesus.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge granted a preliminary injunction on Thursday against federal officers, exempting journalists and legal observers from orders to disperse after the officers declare riots at Portland protests.
The 61-page order prohibited federal officers from seizing any ""photographic equipment, audio- or video recording equipment, or press passes"" from reporters and legal observers.
A lawyer from the U.S. Justice Department had argued that the press does not hold any special right when police declare an unlawful assembly or riot and order crowds to break up.
""If military and law enforcement personnel can engage around the world without attacking journalists, the federal defendants can respect plaintiffs' First Amendment rights in Portland"", U.S. District Judge Michael Simon said in the order filed in the United States District Court for Oregon.
Protests against racism and police brutality have swept the United States since the death on May 25 of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The protests, including those in Portland, have occasionally erupted in arson and violence, and federal officers sent into the northwestern city have repeatedly clashed with crowds targeting its federal courthouse.
Portland Police had declared a riot for a second successive night on Wednesday and said they had fired crowd control munitions and tear gas to break up a gathering of about 200 people who threw rocks, lit fires and vandalized a U.S. immigration agency building.
Thursday's order came in a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Foundation of Oregon, which called it ""a crucial victory"" for civil liberties and press freedom.
Separately on Thursday, Portland Police issued a timeline of protests, showcasing they had declared riots 17 times between May 29 and Aug. 19.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines has lodged a diplomatic protest over what it said was China's illegal confiscation of fish aggregating devices from Filipino fisherman in a disputed lagoon held by Beijing in the South China Sea.
The Philippine foreign ministry said the incident happened three months ago at the Scarborough Shoal, a prime fishing site seized by Beijing in 2012 after a standoff that prompted an unprecedented international legal challenge by Manila.
In a statement late on Thursday, it gave no other details about that incident, but it also protested China's ""continuing illicit issuances of radio challenges (to) Philippine aircraft conducting legitimate regular maritime patrols."" 
China's coast guard routinely warns foreign planes and vessels passing through and over international waters.
The Philippine protest comes amid concern in the region and by the United States and allies about what they see as provocative Chinese activities and military exercises in contested parts of the strategic waterway. 
Vietnam on Thursday complained about the presence of Chinese bombers on the Paracel islands.
China claims historic ownership of most of the South China Sea using old maps that it says are proof of sovereignty. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have claims.
China's foreign ministry on Friday insisted its coast guard was enforcing the law in what were Chinese waters. 
The Scarborough Shoal is located within the Philippines' 200-mile exclusive economic zone and an arbitral tribunal in The Hauge ruled in 2016 that China's claim to it - and to most of the South China Sea - had no basis under international law.
China on Friday also accused the Philippine aircraft of violating its sovereignty. 
""The Chinese side immediately urged the Philippines side to stop these illegal and provocative actions,"" ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a briefing.
Using frigates converted into coast guard vessels, China for years blocked Filipinos from the Scarborough Shoal, about 130 miles (209 km) off the Philippines and about 400 miles from China's Hainan Island.

The coast guard after 2017 allowed some Filipinos to return, owing to President Rordrigo Duterte's good ties with Beijing.

(Reuters) - Next week's Republican National Convention will be a four-day celebration of President Donald Trump, featuring a younger generation who may be hoping for a shot at the White House in 2024, as well as a St. Louis couple who brandished guns at anti-racism protesters.
Here is a look at speakers featured in a mix of live and virtual programming starting on Monday.
GREAT AMERICAN STORY
The theme of the nominating convention will be ""Honoring the Great American Story"", and will culminate in a live acceptance speech from Trump on Thursday night on the South Lawn of the White House.
The White House grounds will also be used on Tuesday night, when First Lady Melania Trump and Trump's adult children will speak from the Rose Garden.
Trump will be the central focus and will make appearances on most days, according to campaign sources, including one event when he will honor doctors, nurses and other workers on the front line of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Vice President Mike Pence will be the main speaker on Wednesday, delivering his remarks from Baltimore's Fort McHenry, made famous in the War of 1812 when it was successfully defended against an attack by the British navy, inspiring the poem that became the lyrics for The Star-Spangled Banner (NASDAQ:BANR).
Some government ethics experts have expressed concern over the use of federal properties as stages for partisan political speeches, but a law prohibiting the use of federal funds for campaign appearances excludes the president and vice president. In 1940, Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt accepted his party's nomination from the White House via radio.
On Monday, the convention theme will be the ""Land of Promise,"" Tuesday's will be the ""Land of Opportunity,"" Wednesday will focus on the ""Land of Heroes"" and events culminate in the ""Land of Greatness"" on Thursday.
TRUMP CHANGED MY LIFE
Trump has been criticized for his response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 170,000 Americans and triggered a severe economic downturn, as well as his reaction to nationwide protests over racial injustice and police brutality against Black Americans.
To counter those criticisms, the convention will also feature everyday Americans who will testify that Trump has changed their lives in positive ways, according to a member of Trump's campaign. 
They will also sound the alarm over the dangers of a victory for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
Among them will be Mark and Patricia McCloskey, a St. Louis couple who brandished their guns in front of Black Lives Matter protesters who marched through their gated community in July. They were charged with felony weapons offenses, which Trump has called a ""disgrace."" Their attorney, Joel Schwartz, said their appearance has now been confirmed by Republican organizers.
Other citizen speakers will include police Sergeant Ann Dorn, whose husband, retired police captain David Dorn, was killed during violent protests in St. Louis in June; Tanya Weinreis, who will say her Montana coffee shop and employees' livelihoods were saved by a loan from the federal coronavirus relief Paycheck Protection Program, and the parents of Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian worker murdered by Islamic State.
Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed in the 2018 Parkland, Florida, school massacre, will also speak. He is an advocate for enhanced school safety measures, including armed guards.
2024 HOPEFULS

The convention will also feature Republicans considered prospective 2024 presidential hopefuls. They include Nikki Haley, Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations; South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem; South Carolina U.S. Senator Tim Scott; and the president's son Donald Trump Jr., who some party members want to see continue the Trump legacy.

417,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Saudi price for ties with Israel is Palestinian state: Saudi royal,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's price for normalising relations with Israel is the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, a senior member of the Saudi royal family reaffirmed on Friday.
Prince Turki al-Faisal was apparently responding to U.S. President Donald Trump who said on Wednesday he expected Saudi Arabia to join a deal announced last week by Israel and the United Arab Emirates to normalise diplomatic ties.
The UAE is only the third Arab state in more than 70 years to forge full relations with Israel. Under the U.S.-brokered deal, Israel shelved plans to annex settlements in the occupied West Bank, which Palestinians seek as part of a future state.
The UAE said Israel's commitment had kept alive the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Israel hitherto had no formal ties with Gulf Arab states but shared concerns with the UAE about Iran's regional influence and actions, along with the UAE's role as a regional business hub, led to a limited thaw and discreet contacts in recent years.
The deal raised speculation that other U.S.-backed Gulf Arab countries might follow. But Prince Turki said Saudi Arabia, the biggest Gulf Arab power which has traditionally guided policy towards Israel, expected a higher return from Israel.
""Any Arab state that is considering following the UAE should demand in return a price, and it should be an expensive price,"" he wrote in the Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat. 
""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has set a price for concluding peace between Israel and the Arabs - it is the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as capital, as provided for by the initiative of the late King Abdullah.""
That 2002 Arab League plan offered Israel normalised ties in return for Israeli withdrawal from all territories - the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem - captured in the 1967 Middle East war, and a Palestinian state there.
But Prince Turki also voiced understanding for the UAE's decision, noting that Riyadh's close ally had secured a key condition - a halt to Israeli annexation plans.
In the first Saudi reaction to the UAE-Israeli deal, Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said on Wednesday Riyadh remained committed to the Arab peace initiative.

Prince Turki, a former ambassador to Washington and ex-intelligence chief, holds no government office now but remains influential as current chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies.

Police said Tong Ying-kit, 23, carried a sign reading ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,"" and drove his motorbike into officers, knocking down several on a narrow street, before falling over and getting arrested. 
The government of the Asian financial hub has said the protest slogan connotes separatism or subversion under the new law, stoking concern over freedom of expression in the former British colony.
Two judges of Hong Kong's High Court rejected Tong's application for release from detention, and set Tuesday for a bail hearing.
""The applicant's application for a writ of habeas corpus is dismissed,"" judges Anderson Chow and Alex Lee said in the ruling, adding that Tong should have instead sought review of an order that denied him bail. 
Tong was denied bail last month, with the case adjourned to Oct. 6, as prosecutors sought more time to collect evidence.
He was among more than 300 demonstrators against the new law who were arrested by police on July 1, less than 24 hours after it was unveiled and took effect.
Hong Kong's common law has traditionally allowed defendants to seek release unless prosecutors can show lawful grounds for their detention. 
But the burden is now placed on the defendant, under the new law drafted by Beijing, which is not a common law jurisdiction and where the judiciary is controlled by the Communist Party.
Article 42 says, ""No bail shall be granted to a criminal suspect or defendant unless the judge has sufficient grounds for believing that the criminal suspect or defendant will not continue to commit acts endangering national security.""
The national security law has drawn wide criticism in the West for jeopardising basic rights and freedoms the global financial hub was promised when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 

Supporters of the law, which provides for jail terms of up to life for anything China considers to be secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces, say it would bring stability after a year of pro-democracy and anti-China unrest.

Nineteen people have tested positive for the virus in the western region since Monday, health officials said on Friday, the first local transmission in Myanmar in months, bringing the total number of cases to 409.
Myat Htut Nyunt, deputy director at Myanmar's department of medical research, said the type of virus was the same as a mutation detected earlier this week in Malaysia, which has been found in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia and is thought to be more infectious.
""So we would like to inform the people that this kind of virus has a faster rate of transmission,"" the official said.
The vast majority of the recent cases have been in the town of Sittwe, where officials have issued a stay-at-home order and imposed a curfew. Domestic airlines have suspended services between Sittwe and the commercial capital of Yangon.
Tens of thousands of people are living in displacement camps across Rakhine due to fighting between government troops and ethnic insurgents.
Sittwe is also home to camps where about 100,000 Rohingya Muslims have been confined since an outbreak of violence in 2012. Rohingya are mostly denied citizenship and face strict curbs on freedom of movement and access to healthcare.
Kyaw Hla, a community leader in one camp, said government staff had visited on Friday but conditions there were too poor to follow advice on social distancing and hygiene. 
""It's not OK to live here, in a small space with many people. We have always had concerns in the camp, COVID-19 or other issues. Families live in 8 foot by 10 foot or 8 foot by 14 foot rooms. Things are not going to get better.""

DIJON, France (Reuters) - In exactly two weeks, Alain Cocq says he will begin his own slow and agonising death by refusing the round-the-clock medical care that is keeping him alive.
Before that happens he has set himself a final task: to persuade French President Emmanuel Macron to change the law so that healthcare professionals can make his death swifter and less painful.
""Some people want to carry on to the end,"" Cocq, who is 57, said from the bed he has been confined to for two years as a result of a degenerative disease that has no treatment.
""But there are people like me ... who wish to take their leave with dignity.""
France's neighbours Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands have adopted laws that allow medically-assisted dying in some cases.
But France has resisted that step, in part under pressure from the Catholic church which teaches that life should end only at the moment of natural death.
Cocq, from Dijon in eastern France, is fed by a drip and his digestive system is connected to a colostomy bag. His condition has caused brain aneurysms, and he experiences convulsions if he does not take his medicine. He said he experiences constant pain.
""It's reached a stage where it's no longer tolerable,"" he said. ""So I'm saying stop.""
He has announced that on Sept. 4 he will exercise his right under French law to cease being fed and given medical care. But he said it will take him days to die. His options are to endure the agony, or be sedated.
But Cocq said he wanted to be able to be conscious when his life ends. Medically-assisted suicide would give him that, but it is illegal in France.
He said he has been granted a meeting via video conference on Aug. 25 with two of Macron's aides, where he will make his case for a law change. The presidential administration did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 

""I will have to follow a path that is very painful if President Macron does not allow me to die in dignity,"" Cocq said.

HARARE (Reuters) - Victor Mpofu is using satire to shine a light on Zimbabwe's political problems, reaching a growing audience despite living in fear of retribution from President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government.
Mpofu, aka Doc Vikela, has seen his followers on YouTube channel Simuka Comedy grow from less than 1,000 subscribers in January when he ventured into political satire to 23,000 now.
The 34-year-old father of two is among a generation of online stand-up comedians critical of government excesses.
Critics have accused Mnangagwa of reverting to the authoritarian tendencies of the Robert Mugabe era amid a worsening economic crisis.
In his skits, Mpofu assumes the character of Mnangagwa with a trademark colourful scarf, at times mocking some of the president's decisions. 
""What we are simply saying is that there are problems. These problems we are highlighting through our content. We say 'do you feel we should continue going on like this'?"" he said.
Critics, including church leaders and lawyers, have accused the government of using the COVID-19 pandemic to trample on human rights and of abducting and torturing opponents. The government denies the accusations.
Mpofu says his comedy work is difficult ""because you have the fear of disappearing, you have the fear of being abducted.
""You don't know whether your content will touch on the right nerve or wrong nerve so you always live in fear,"" he said.
In one skit, Mpofu, speaking as Mnangagwa, justifies naming his deputy Constantino Chiwenga as health minister citing his admission into foreign hospitals as experience for the job.
With inflation running at 837.5%, unemployment above 80% and a collapsing public health sector, Zimbabweans are angry.

""So it is important for us to pack this into satire instead of (people) drowning in depression, drowning into sorrow,"" said Mpofu. ""We give them humour, sometimes it's good to laugh.""

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Doctors in most public hospitals in Kenya's capital went on strike on Friday to protest against delayed salaries and a lack of protective equipment when handling patients who may have COVID-19. 
The strike began at midnight on Friday, said Thuranira Kaugiria, secretary general for the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union.
He said 320 doctors employed by the Nairobi County government were taking part in the strike because they had inadequate health insurance, poor quality protective gear and too few isolation wards to treat COVID-19 patients. 
The strike will not affect private hospitals and public hospitals within Nairobi run by the national government. 
Latest data show 31,441 confirmed coronavirus cases in Kenya, 620 deaths and 13,536 recoveries out of 407,610 tests done so far. The majority of confirmed cases have been in the capital.
Kenyan doctors have been posting pictures on Twitter of what they say is inadequate gear supplied by the government, including porous overalls meant to protect against dust that would not prevent the spread of the virus. 
    In a separate incident on Friday, police used tear gas against dozens of protesters who had gathered at Freedom Corner in Uhuru Park to demonstrate against allegations of corruption in the procurement of protective gear. 
The head of the government-run Kenya Medical Supplies Authority has been suspended over allegations the agency procured low quality items and inflated prices of others. 
""We are tried of being bombarded every single day with news of how much money we are losing that should be going to fight the COVID pandemic,"" said Wanjeri Nderu, who helped organise the protest.
""We decided today to have a peaceful march. We were teargassed more than 20 times ... some of my colleagues have been arrested.""
Activists were considering launching private prosecutions of some officials, she said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese-owned bulk carrier that ran aground off Mauritius and spilled oil over pristine waters and fragile coral reefs diverted more than 100 kilometres from a regular shipping lane, data from a maritime analysis firm showed.
The MV Wakashio, owned by Nagashiki Shipping and chartered by Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd, struck a coral reef on Mauritius's southeast coast on July 25 and later began leaking oil. Two of the ship's officers have since been arrested on charges of endangering safe navigation. 
The iron-ore carrier was using a well-travelled shipping lane that passes near Mauritius when the accident happened, according to maritime analysis firm Windward and shipping sources. 
It appears to have deviated from that lane about 55 nautical miles (102 km) from Mauritius and headed straight for the Indian Ocean island, the data showed. The data shows the ship's track during the last few hours of its journey, including a minor turn after crossing into Mauritius' territorial waters.
""It was on a very bad trajectory,"" Omer Primor, Windward's head of marketing, told Reuters.
(Open https://tmsnrt.rs/3j27L5C in an external browser to see a graphic on the wreck of the MV Wakashio.) 
It was not immediately clear why the ship appeared to deviate from its course. Tracking data for other cargo vessels passing close to Mauritius recently show them all sticking to the shipping lane. 
The Mauritius coast guard had repeatedly tried to reach the ship to warn it that its course was dangerous but received no reply, Reuters reported this week.
When asked about the Windward data, a Nagashiki Shipping spokesman said: ""We have submitted our route record data to the police, but we cannot comment on the data, as the police are investigating the incident"".
The company has declined to comment on the report that the coast guard had tried to contact the ship. A spokesman at Mitsui OSK, which chartered the ship, said it was also investigating the carrier's course. He declined to comment further.
One regional maritime official said Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) data he had seen did not show the ship's turn inside Mauritius' territorial waters, but added that it could be because of an inaccuracy in AIS data.
The government of Mauritius and maritime authorities there did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the data.
Mauritius said on Thursday it has started to scuttle the ship, after announcing the plan a day earlier, which had raised alarm from environmentalists worried about further damage after more than 1,000 tons of fuel oil leaked. 
Scientists say that the full impact of the spill is still unfolding but that the damage could affect Mauritius and its tourism-dependent economy for decades. 

The wildlife at risk include the seagrasses blanketing sand in the shallow waters, clownfish living in coral reefs, mangroves systems, and the critically endangered Pink Pigeon, endemic to the island.

Yemen has been locked in conflict since 2014 when the Iran-aligned Houthis seized Sanaa, the capital, and then much of the country's north. Fighting escalated in March 2015 when the Saudi-led coalition intervened to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

Despite the relaxed guidelines, a large proportion of people continued to wear masks in Beijing on Friday. 
Some said the mask made them feel safe, while others said social pressures to wear the masks were also a factor. 
""I think I can take off my mask anytime, but I'll need to see if others accept it. Because I'm afraid that people would be scared if they see me not wearing mask,"" one 24-year old Beijing woman surnamed Cao told Reuters. 
It's the second time Beijing's health authorities have relaxed guidelines on mask wearing in the capital, which has largely returned to normal after two rounds of lockdowns brought it to a standstill.
Beijing's municipal Centers for Disease Control first said residents could go without masks in outdoor areas in late April, though the rules were swiftly reversed in June after a new outbreak in a large wholesale market in the city's south. 
China has reported no new locally transmitted cases on the mainland for five days after successfully controlling flare ups in the capital, Xinjiang and elsewhere.
Experts say the key to the country's success in controlling the disease has been the strict enforcement of local rules, including wearing masks, mandatory home quarantine and participating in mass testing.

Authorities reported 22 imported cases in the mainland on for Aug. 20, and has closed its borders to most non-Chinese citizens. The country has reported a total of 84,917 cases since the outbreak began.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A New Zealand court will begin hearings on Monday on the sentencing of a suspected white supremacist accused of killing 51 Muslim worshippers in a massacre that shocked the world and prompted a global campaign to stamp out online hate.
Brenton Tarrant, an Australian national, attacked Muslims attending Friday prayers in the South Island city of Christchurch on March 15 last year with semi-automatic guns, broadcasting the shooting live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Tarrant pleaded guilty to all charges in March, which include 51 charges of murder, 40 charges of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist act.
High Court judge Cameron Mander will hear statements from 66 survivors of the attack early in the week and Tarrant is likely to be present in the courtroom. Tarrant will be allowed to speak to the court before sentencing.
The attack led to a ban on firearms in New Zealand and a campaign against hate content online led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, a response that was hailed as a model for other countries.
""This will be the acceptance of his guilt and acknowledgement of his punishment,"" said Aliya Danzeisen, a community leader and member of the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand.
""Obviously he could appeal, but for families this will be that closure in the sense that he did damage to us and he's having to pay for it,"" said Danzeisen, who will be in court with a friend who was a victim of the attack.
Justice Mander said in an order issued earlier this month that the court has discretionary powers to prohibit the publication of victim statements, if needed, and also ensure it is not used as a platform to cause further harm.
Tarrant faces life imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 17 years. But the judge has the power to decide on imprisoning him without possibility of release, which means Tarrant would be imprisoned for the rest of his life. Such a sentence has never been imposed in New Zealand. 
COVERAGE
Tarrant stormed into the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch on March 15 last year, spraying bullets on worshippers, including women and children, before attacking another neighbouring mosque. He was arrested on the way to a third attack.
A manifesto posted online by Tarrant shortly before he attacked the mosques, and video recordings of the mosque shootings are banned by New Zealand's censor board. 
The greater coverage Tarrant gets, the more opportunity it gives him to say things that could resonate with others, said Chris Wilson, the programme director for the master of conflict and terrorism studies at the University of Auckland. 
""We do need to have some coverage. We need to know, the Muslim community needs to know ... we need justice. But it needs to be done in a way where it's not an inspiration to others,"" he said.

Live reporting from the courtroom is banned, and other restrictions have been put in place on what the media can report.

The dining restrictions in the China-ruled Asian financial hub ban eating in any outlet after 6 p.m. At other times in the day, restaurants can only operate at half-capacity and with two people per table.
As a result, plastic from eating out has doubled from last year since takeaway food is the only option for many people who do not cook at home. Hundreds of thousands of people in the crowded city live in compact apartments with tiny or non-existent kitchens.
Pavements in residential and office areas are littered with Styrofoam boxes and coffee cups spilling out from bins, while plastic bags and wrappers are seen floating at popular swimming sites. 
""For many people, the biggest issue is they don't deal with their own waste on a daily basis so they aren't realising the scale of their own consumption,"" said Tracey Read, founder of Plastic Free Seas in Hong Kong.
The city's residents are consuming more than 101 million disposable plastic items for takeaway every week, according to environmental group Greeners Action, more than double the amount discarded last year.
Hong Kong's government said existing landfills will reach capacity this year and in June it announced it was disposing of human graves to further extend one site.
Single use plastic tableware is one of the top ten categories of marine litter in Hong Kong, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
""Emerging food delivery online platforms are definitely one of the contributors exacerbating the severity of the problem,"" said June Wong, an executive at WWF who focuses on marine litter and plastic.
WWF is working with delivery companies, Deliveroo and Foodpanda, to combat disposable plastic cutlery.
The government told Reuters it was promoting minimising the use of disposable tableware ""wherever practicable"".
A waste charging bill, proposed over a decade ago and aimed at tackling soaring waste, was put off the legislative agenda again in June due to time constraints. 
Edwin Chau, executive director at the Green Earth NGO, said the city needed much stronger measures, for instance expanding a plastic collection and recycling scheme to all districts and a landfill ban for plastic.

""Hong Kong cannot not afford to keep ignoring its own waste crisis,"" he said.

DHAKA/GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - On the third anniversary of a mass exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh, prospects look bleak for about 1 million members of the Muslim minority from Myanmar living in bamboo and plastic shelters in refugee camps.
Two attempts to get a repatriation process going, in 2018 and 2019, failed as the refugees refused to go back to Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship and considered outsiders, fearing violence.
Some take the dangerous option of travelling with people-smugglers by boat to Southeast Asia. Scores of people have been killed in recent years as their over-crowded rickety boats have capsized or run out of water and food.
But even that perilous route is getting more difficult now as countries like Malaysia shut their borders, threatening to push boats back out to sea, to protect jobs and resources amid novel coronavirus lockdowns.
Some Rohingya are clinging to the hope of a third option - resettlement in a rich country.
""I just pray and hope that one day my family will be settled in a Western country,"" said Mohammed Nur, who lives in a refugee camp in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district neighbouring Myanmar.
Nur was on a short-list for resettlement under an earlier programme.
But Bangladesh, which has for decades given refuge to waves of Rohingya fleeing from Myanmar, ended the resettlement programme in 2010 out of fear it would become a hub for refugees seeking to move to the West.
Nur lives in hope the programme will be revived and has even put off marriage because he worries a bigger family would see him dropped from the list.
""I'm 29 now but still not married as I don't want to expand my family,"" he said.
Whether a resettlement programme gets going or not depends on Bangladesh.
Bangladesh's refugee commissioner told Reuters the focus was on repatriation but his agency was ready to work to resettle refugees in other countries if his government decided to resume the programme.
Talukder said it was up to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to request the resumption of resettlement, then his government would decide.
""If the government takes the decision, we're ready to implement it,"" the commissioner, Mahbub Alam Talukder, said.
From 2006 to 2010, the programme saw 920 Rohingya resettled in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States.
Bangladesh's foreign minister and the ministry's secretary did not respond to requests for comment.
'THIRD-COUNTRY PATHWAYS'
The UNHCR said it was in ""continuous dialogue"" with the Bangladesh government over the Rohingya.
""We continue to pursue durable solutions for the Rohingya refugees including repatriation in safety and dignity when conditions allow, as well as through third-country pathways for those with the most acute vulnerabilities, if this option becomes available,"" UNHCR spokeswoman Louise Donovan said.
Before the programme was suspended, the UNHCR had identified https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-bangladesh/u-n-wants-to-negotiate-with-u-s-canada-to-resettle-rohingya-refugees-idUSKBN15V1OJ about 1,000 people for relocation, based on medical grounds or for reasons of family re-unifications.
The suspension left those people in limbo, some after they borrowed and even packed their bags in preparation for their move.
""We dreamt of a better life when we got selected to be resettled in the UK,"" said Mohammed Ismail, 32, who fled to Bangladesh when he was only eight. 
""But my poor luck, we never could fly.""
Ismail and several others on the list with their families said they had heard nothing about the possibility of resettlement in recent years.
But even if Bangladesh were to agree to resume the programme, it won't be easy for Rohingya to start new lives in the West.
H.T. Imam, a political adviser to Bangladesh's prime minister, has in the past called the resettlement process unrealistic https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-bangladesh/u-n-wants-to-negotiate-with-u-s-canada-to-resettle-rohingya-refugees-idUSKBN15V1OJ because of the reluctance of European countries and the United States to take Muslim refugees.
He declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

The UNHCR said globally resettlements had decreased significantly over the past few years, from a peak of more than 126,000 in 2016 that it was involved in, to about 64,000 last year.

With 75,000 cubic metres per second of water flowing in from the Yangtze river on Thursday, the reservoir's depths reached 165.6 metres by Friday morning, up more than 2 metres overnight and almost 20 metres higher than the official warning level. 
The maximum designed depth of China's largest reservoir is 175 metres. 
Authorities raised the discharge volume to a record 48,800 cubic metres per second on Thursday to try to lower water levels, and they might have to increase it again to avoid the possibility of a dangerous overflow.
""They will do everything they can to prevent the dam from overtopping,"" said Desiree Tullos, a professor at Oregon State University who studies the Three Gorges project. 
""An overtopping dam is a worst-case scenario because it produces significant damage... and can lead to the entire thing collapsing.""
Rainfall in the Yangtze basin has been well over double the seasonal average this year. The floods had caused nearly 180 billion yuan ($26 billion) in economic damages by last week, and 63 million people have been affected.
The Three Gorges Project, completed in 2012, was designed not only to generate power but also to tame the fierce Yangtze, the cause of many devastating floods throughout China's history.
China's giant hydroelectric dams have stored more than 100 billion cubic metres of floodwater this year, and shielded 18.5 million residents from evacuation, according to government figures. The Three Gorges project alone has cut downstream floodwaters by 34%, officials said. 

But opponents say the flood control capability of the Three Gorges Dam is limited, and it could even make the problem worse in the long term.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Soaring demand for Vanuatu's controversial passport scheme has kept the South Pacific island nation's budget in surplus despite the COVID-19 pandemic and a damaging cyclone crippling its dominant tourism sector, budget papers show.
Vanuatu late on Thursday reported a budget surplus for the first six months of 2020 of 3.8 billion vatu ($34.16 million), led by 32% rise in sales of citizenship, worth 7.1 billion vatu.
The jump in passport sales has helped Vanuatu avoid the mounting debts some Pacific island states have racked up with China and other lenders, but experts warn the practice risks harming Vanuatu's beneficial relationship with countries such Australia.
""Some of the people buying these passports have been on Interpol red notices and the more that happens, the more it undermines the value of the passport,"" said Jonathan Pryke, Director, Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute.
Vanuatu charges $130,000 for local citizenship, giving access to a passport that is highly valued as holders can travel visa-free to over 100 countries and territories including the European Union, Britain, Russia and Hong Kong - countries that can be difficult to visit for some nationalities.
There are no residency requirements on people who acquire Vanuatu citizenship.
The Vanuatu government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The scheme is controversial, however, with four Chinese people stripped of their citizenship last year after records showed they were on Interpol's wanted list.
But Vanuatu, which has no personal or corporate income tax, says the scheme has allowed it to issue a 4.2 billion vatu stimulus package - one of the most generous in the Pacific - amid estimates that tens of thousands of locals have lost their jobs after the closure of the country's border.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell's chance of a fair trial on criminal charges she aided Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of girls could be destroyed by substantial negative publicity if a deposition she gave four years ago were publicly released, her lawyers said.
The lawyers made the argument in a Thursday night filing asking the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan to reverse a lower court judge's order to unseal the deposition and other documents.
Maxwell's deposition had been taken in April 2016 for a now-settled civil defamation lawsuit against the British socialite by Virginia Giuffre, who said Epstein kept her as a ""sex slave"" with Maxwell's assistance.
Lawyers for Maxwell said the unsealing order did not take into proper account their client's privacy interests or the promise of confidentiality she received before being deposed.
""If the unsealing order goes into effect, it will forever let the cat out of the bag,"" the lawyers said, warning that ""intimate, sensitive, and personal information"" about Maxwell might ""spread like wildfire across the Internet.""
The lawyers also said an unsealing would cause irreversible and unconstitutional negative publicity, and undermine the ""truth-seeking function"" of Maxwell's trial by leading witnesses to ""recast their memories of events from decades ago.""
Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and eventually abuse three girls, who prosecutors did not publicly name, from 1994 to 1997, and to committing perjury by denying her involvement under oath.
She was arrested on July 2 in New Hampshire, where prosecutors said she was trying to evade capture, and is being held in a Brooklyn jail after a judge called her a flight risk.
Maxwell's trial is scheduled for next July.
Epstein was found hanged at age 66 last August in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Giuffre has been one of Epstein's most visible accusers, and her lawyers have said the public has a right to see Maxwell's deposition.
Lawyers for Maxwell disagreed, saying her constitutional rights to remain silent and get a fair trial by an impartial jury outweigh any presumption of public access.
Maxwell would not be required to testify at her trial.
A lawyer for Giuffre did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Oral arguments are scheduled for Sept. 22.
Some documents from the defamation case were released last month. Maxwell's lawyers asked the appeals court for permission to seal more than 1,000 pages of additional materials, which include her deposition, filed with the appeal.

Maxwell is separately seeking to have prosecutors identify the three accusers in her indictment and challenging her confinement conditions at the Brooklyn jail, saying she is being treated worse than other pretrial inmates.

BOULDER CREEK, Calif. (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of displaced Californians huddled under evacuation orders in the midst of a heat wave and a pandemic on Thursday as lightning-sparked firestorms raged through dry brush, grass and chaparral around San Francisco Bay.
With firefighting resources strained to their limits by the heaviest spate of incendiary lightning strikes to rake California in more than a decade, officials scrambled to bring in reinforcements sought since Wednesday from out of state.
An estimated 11,000 lightning strikes, mostly in northern and central California, ignited more than 370 individual fires this week, spawning nearly two dozen major conflagrations that threatened thousands of homes and prompted mass evacuations.
""Everything is gone,"" resident Nick Pike told CapRadio in Sacramento after he and three neighbors lost their homes near the town of Vacaville, about 55 miles (88 km) northeast of San Francisco. 
As of Thursday, the biggest fires had collectively scorched more than 500,000 acres, or 780-plus square miles, an area well over twice as large as New York City's entire land mass. Scores of homes and other buildings were left in ruins, and at least two people have lost their lives.
A utility worker died on Wednesday while on duty helping clear electrical hazards for first-responders. Earlier the same day, the pilot of a firefighting helicopter contracted by the state was killed in a crash during a water-dropping mission in Fresno County.
HARD TO BREATHE
Plumes of smoke and ash fouled air quality for hundreds of miles around fire zones, adding to the misery and health risks of residents forced to flee or those stuck inside sweltering homes that lacked air conditioning.
One of the greatest threats was posted by a cluster of fires roaring through the Santa Cruz mountains south of San Francisco, forcing some 22,000 residents to flee their dwellings and destroying at least 20 structures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire).
Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California's oldest state park with redwood trees up to 2,000 years old, sustained extensive damage to historic buildings, the state parks department said. The nearby community of Boulder Creek, the park's unofficial gateway town, was also evacuated.
As the fire moved south, the University of California at Santa Cruz called for voluntary evacuations from its campus on the northern flank of that coastal city.
To the north, another group of fires raced through hills spanning several counties in northern California's wine country, about 35 miles (56 km) southwest of Sacramento, destroying more than 105 homes and other structures, CalFire said.
A number of wineries in the region were forced to cease operations mid-harvest as evacuations expanded in Napa and Sonoma counties, the San Jose Mercury News reported.
Collectively known as the LNU Complex Fire, those blazes had blackened 131,000 acres (53,000-hectares) by Thursday, a day after residents of communities overrun by flames had to flee for their lives, four of them suffering burns.
Another group of fires dubbed the SCU Lightning Complex grew to about 140,000 acres on Thursday some 20 miles east of Palo Alto, with containment reported at just 5%.
The blazes raged amid a record-breaking heat wave that has baked California since last Friday, resulting from a dome of atmospheric high pressure hovering over the American Southwest.
Meteorologists say that same high-pressure ridge has also been siphoning moisture from remnants of a now-dissipated tropical storm off the coast of Mexico and creating conditions rife for thunderstorms across much of California.
Most of the precipitation from those storms evaporates before reaching the ground, however, leaving dry lightning strikes that have only added to what was already a volatile wildfire season. 
The American Lung Association warned on Thursday that the coronavirus pandemic has considerably heightened the health hazards posed by smoky air and extreme heat.

Inhaling smoke and ash can worsen the weakened lungs of people with COVID-19 and undermine the natural defenses of those who do not have it, said Dr Afif El-Hassan, a physician spokesman for the lung association.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday it will ask the nation's top court to reinstate Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death sentence for helping carry out the 2013 attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others.
U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston said that after considering victims' views, the department had decided to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review an appellate court's July 31 decision to order a new death penalty phase trial for Tsarnaev.
""Our hope is that this will result in reinstatement of the original sentence and avoid a retrial of the death penalty phase,"" Lelling said in a statement.
His statement came after U.S. Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press the department will ""do whatever's necessary"" and continue to pursue the death penalty, a position consistent with President Donald Trump's views.
Victims have been divided over seeking the death penalty, and David Patton, Tsarnaev's lawyer, had argued prosecutors should allow ""closure"" by permitting a life prison sentence.
In its ruling, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that a trial judge ""fell short"" in conducting the jury selection process and screening jurors for potential bias following pretrial publicity.
Tsarnaev, 27, and his older brother, Tamerlan, sparked five days of panic in Boston on April 15, 2013, when they detonated two homemade pressure cooker bombs at the marathon's finish line and then tried to flee the city.
In the days that followed, they also killed a police officer. Tsarnaev's brother died after a gunfight with police.

A federal jury in 2015 found Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 counts he faced and later determined he deserved execution for a bomb he planted that killed 8-year-old Martin Richard and 23-year-old Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu. Restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, was also killed.

440,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 11:09PM ET</span>","Kim Jong Un Warns on Economy, Promotes Sister, in Sign of Crisis","(Bloomberg) -- Kim Jong Un issued a dire warning for North Korea’s economy amid reports that he delegated some power to his sister, including responsibility for relations with the U.S.
Kim told a gathering of ruling party leaders that the country “faced unexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects” and that his development goals had been “seriously delayed,” state media said Thursday. The unusually candid assessment came as sanctions, flooding and the coronavirus pandemic pushed the North Korean economy toward what was expected to be its worst contraction in more than two decades.
Hours later, South Korean lawmakers told reporters that the country’s spy agency determined that Kim had delegated responsibility for relations with Seoul and Washington to his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong. While she had taken an increasingly public role in diplomatic matters, such as responding to a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year, one lawmaker described a more formal power-sharing arrangement.
Intelligence committee member Ha Tae-keung, who was among National Assembly lawmakers briefed by the spy agency Thursday, said the move didn’t indicate that Kim was adopting a “collective leadership” system similar to China’s Communist Party. “The absolute power of Kim Jong Un is being shared under the current leadership style of North Korea,” Ha said, adding that Kim still retained ultimate control.
North Korea also announced plans for the first national congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea since 2016 next year. The key party meeting in January would provide another platform to promote prominent officials such as his sister, and purge others. Last week, Kim replaced the premier he appointed a little more than a year ago, in another sign of political tension in Pyongyang.
Duyeon Kim, a senior adviser for Northeast Asia and Nuclear Policy at the International Crisis Group, expressed skepticism that Kim would relinquish authority as supreme leader. “To say there is a partial transfer of power seems to be an exaggeration, given the system in North Korea,” she said.
The statement on the economy was the latest in a series of complaints by Kim Jong Un about the pace of key policy goals. In recent months, he has lashed out at cadres over what he saw as lax virus management and blasted the people responsible constructing his showcase Pyongyang General Hospital, saying they were flouting party policies and being “careless” with spending.
The North Korean leader also pledged to unveil a new five-year economic development plan at the upcoming party congress. The last meeting in 2016 of what is ostensibly North Korea’s highest-level decision-making assembly ended a 36-year lull when Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, ignored party rules requiring such a gathering every five years.
“Planned attainment of the goals for improving the national economy have been seriously delayed and the people’s living standard has not been improved remarkably,” Kim told a gathering of the party’s Central Committee, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.
While state media made no mention of the U.S.-led sanctions regime on the country, Pyongyang has repeatedly lashed out at the campaign. In December, Kim similarly told the Central Committee that “the conditions of the national economy have not turned better,” adding “the role of the state as the organizer of the economic work has not been enhanced.”
Kim is facing difficulties on various fronts, and a reported health scare earlier this year raised questions about succession. His nuclear discussions with Trump have ground to a halt without him winning any sanctions relief, and the U.S. and South Korea this week kicked off joint military drills.
At a campaign stop in Pennsylvania, Trump repeated his claim that the U.S. would have been at war with North Korea if not for him. Democrats have accused Trump of fueling tensions with Pyongyang to a point where conflict seemed possible.
The economy was already under pressure from his decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus, which slammed the brakes on its minuscule legal trade. This year, the troubles could send the economy into its biggest contraction since 1997, according to Fitch Solutions.
Torrential rains that hit his state this summer have wiped out farmland, increasing food insecurity in the country where the United Nations World Food Program says about 40% of the population is undernourished. North Korea has boasted that it doesn’t have any confirmed cases of Covid-19, a claim doubted by U.S. and Japanese officials.
“Unless there is a major change -- such as pushing for economic reform or improving relations with South Korea, China and/or Russia -- it would be difficult for North Korea to deliver the economic prosperity it vowed,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul who has advised the South Korean government over the years.

Here is a timeline of events in the crisis:
Aug. 25, 2017 - Muslim insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attack 30 police posts and an army base in the north of Rakhine State.
Aug. 26, 2017 - As fighting spreads between the army and ARSA, thousands of Rohingya flee to Bangladesh.

China has stepped up its military activity around the democratic island Beijing claims as sovereign Chinese territory, sending fighter jets and warships on exercises close to Taiwan, including last week when the U.S. health secretary was in Taipei. 
Taiwan's defence ministry, in a statement late Thursday to accompany a video showing Taiwanese forces drilling, said it was ""expressing its stern attitude about recent Chinese Communist People's Liberation Army military pressure acts"". 
Taiwan will not provoke, but it will also not show weakness, it added. 
""Absolutely do not treat lightly our resolve to defend Taiwan,"" the ministry said.
""The most arrogant country can easily provoke a war, and the most ignorant government can be caught in the flames of war.""
China's provocations and threats will only further unite Taiwan's people and ""recognise the essence of the Chinese Communist's militarism"", it said.
""In the end it will have the opposite effect, inciting the wrath and antipathy of Taiwan's people, seriously hurting peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.""
The slickly produced video, also released on the ministry's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, shows Taiwan's F-16s screaming into the air, missiles being fired from land and at sea, and soldiers on manoeuvres.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan's people have shown no interest in being run by autocratic Beijing.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is overseeing a military modernisation programme, though Taiwan's forces are dwarfed by China's, which now have advanced equipment including stealth fighters and aircraft carriers.
The United States, Taiwan's main arms supplier, has ramped up support for the island. Last year, the U.S. State Department approved arms sales worth $10 billion for Taiwan.

443,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 08:26PM ET</span>","Putin critic Navalny fights for life, aides suspect poisoning","By Andrew Osborn and Anton Zverev
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was fighting for his life in a Siberian hospital on Thursday after drinking tea that his allies believe was laced with poison.
If confirmed, it would be the latest in a long series of poisonings and suspected poisonings of people who have fallen out with the Kremlin, which denies settling scores with its foes by murdering them.
Navalny, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin and his lieutenants, began feeling ill on a plane to Moscow on Thursday morning after drinking tea at an airport cafe in the Siberian city of Tomsk.
His condition became so serious that the plane made an emergency landing at the city of Omsk, en route to Moscow, where he was carried off on a stretcher. 
Kira Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, said he was in intensive care in a serious but stable condition, and on an artificial lung ventilator in a hospital in the city, about 2,200 km (1,370 miles) east of the Russian capital. 
""We assume that Alexei was poisoned with something mixed into his tea. It was the only thing that he drank in the morning. Alexei is now unconscious,"" Yarmysh said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that any poisoning would need to be confirmed by laboratory tests and that doctors were doing everything they could to help Navalny. He wished him a speedy recovery.
The incident coincides with a political crisis in Belarus, a close Russian ally, and comes ahead of regional Russian elections next month. 
Some anti-Kremlin protesters in Russia's far east have started chanting ""Long live Belarus!"" in support of the protesters in Minsk, 9,000 km (5,590 miles) to the west.
""Putin is scared,"" said an EU diplomat, who declined to be named. ""He is sending a message to his own people not to try do at home what they see on TV from Belarus."" 
U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that his administration was looking at the matter.
Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, called the alleged poisoning of Navalny ""extraordinarily concerning.""
""If the Russians were behind this ... it's something that we're going to factor into how we deal with the Russians going forward,"" he told Fox News in an interview. 
Doctors gave contradictory information about Navalny's condition, saying it had stabilised and that he was in a coma, but also that there was still a threat to his life and they were working to save him. 
Navalny's wife Yulia flew from Moscow to be with him. Yarmysh said hospital officials so far had prevented Navalny's personal doctor, who had also flown in, from seeing him. 
Doctors were also refusing to discharge him so that he could be flown to Europe for emergency treatment, she said. The hospital said his condition meant he could not be moved for now.
Germany and France offered to provide Navalny medical care.
An air ambulance with a team specialised in treating coma patients was due to leave Germany to pick up Navalny on Thursday evening, the Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation said.
HISTORY OF POISONINGS
There is a long history of Kremlin foes being poisoned or falling ill after suspected poisonings.
They include Sergei Skripal, a former double agent poisoned with a nerve agent in 2018 in Salisbury, England, and Alexander Litvinenko, who died in London in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with polonium-210. 
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied involvement in those and other incidents, calling them anti-Russian provocations.
Yarmysh did not say who she believed may have poisoned Navalny but said police had been called to the hospital.
Police said they had not yet opened an investigation.
A regional health ministry spokeswoman, Tatyana Shakirova, said doctors in Omsk had assessed his condition as serious and were doing everything possible to stabilise him. She said the cause of his illness was not yet clear but poisoning had not been ruled out.
Navalny, a 44-year-old lawyer and anti-corruption activist, has served many stints in jail for organising anti-Kremlin protests and has been attacked in the street by pro-government activists. He has published investigations into what he says are examples of official corruption, with his videos garnering millions of views. 
Navalny and his allies were in Tomsk to try to increase support for candidates they back in next month's regional elections. 
MOTIONLESS
Pavel Lebedev, a passenger on the flight with Navalny, posted an account of what he saw on social media. 
""At the start of the flight he went to the toilet and didn't come back. He started feeling really sick. They struggled to bring him round and he was screaming in pain,"" he said. 
Footage on social media showed a motionless Navalny being stretchered into an ambulance after the emergency landing in Omsk.
The airline, S7, said Navalny had started feeling very ill soon after take-off and the captain had decided to make an emergency landing. He had not eaten or drunk anything on board, it said. 
Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, drew a parallel with an incident last year in which Navalny suffered an acute allergic reaction that one doctor said could have resulted from poisoning with an unknown chemical.
British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said he was deeply concerned, as did Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius.

""If (poisoning is) confirmed, those responsible must face consequences,"" Linkevicius said on Twitter.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Alaska’s highly prized salmon - a favorite of seafood lovers the world over - are getting smaller, and climate change is a suspected culprit, a new study reported, documenting a trend that may pose a risk to a valuable fishery, indigenous people and wildlife.
The study, led by University of Alaska at Fairbanks (UAF) scientists, found that four of Alaska’s five wild salmon species have shrunk in average fish size over the past six decades, with stunted growth becoming more pronounced since 2010.
Hardest hit is Alaska’s official state fish, the Chinook salmon, also known as king salmon.
Chinooks on average are 8 percent smaller than they were before 1990, according to the study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications. Also shrinking are Alaska’s sockeye, coho and chum salmon, the report said. The findings are based on data from 12.5 million samples collected over six decades.
The study confirms first-hand anecdotal accounts from Alaskans with generations of salmon tradition, said co-author Peter Westley of UAF’s College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences
“People are walking into their smokehouses and not having to duck anymore,” he said. “The fish are just smaller. ”
Warmer seas attributed to climate change and increased competition among all species of salmon are the likeliest factors behind the fish shrinkage, he said.
Salmon are maturing in the ocean at earlier ages and returning to fresh water younger and smaller than in the past, the study found.
In waterways like the Yukon River, famous for its Chinooks, the “really big whoppers” that spend seven or eight years in the ocean are no longer seen, Westley said. Instead, many returning Chinooks are only four years old, he said.
Alaska produces nearly all of the nation’s wild salmon. Last year, commercial fishermen harvested over 206 million salmon and sold them for $657.6 million, according to state officials. Salmon are also a dietary staple for some indigenous people of Alaska and Canada’s Yukon Territory.
The red-fleshed fish are also eaten by Alaska’s bears and other wildlife. Smaller fish mean fewer nutrients for those animals – and fewer salmon eggs, which can have long-term consequences for wildlife that feed on them, said UAF’s Krista Oke, the study’s lead author.
“It is impacting things that eat eggs, but it also impacts the salmon population itself,” Oke said.

The findings show the need to manage salmon not just for the size of their runs but for the size of individual fish, Westley said. “If you lose the diversity of fish and only have small fish, then you’re in troubled waters,” he said.

Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary and Cabinet colleagues significantly tightened nationwide coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday to try to rein in one of the sharpest infection surges in Europe, including limiting indoor gatherings to just six people.
The Irish Examiner newspaper reported that on the next night, 81 people, including current and former politicians, attended a dinner hosted by the Irish parliament's golf society in a hotel.
Calleary said in a statement that in light of the updated public health guidance, he should not have attended the event. 
""I wish to apologise unreservedly to everyone. We are asking quite a lot from everyone at this difficult time. I also offer this apology and my sincere regret to my government colleagues,"" he said.
A version of the statement on Calleary's Twitter account received almost 2,000 replies within two hours, many from people angry that they were unable to attend funerals because of the restrictions or had to cancel holidays or weddings.
Hogan, Ireland's representative on the European Union's executive, also attended the event, national broadcaster RTE quoted a representative for the commissioner as saying. Hogan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
An opposition member of Ireland's parliament, Paul Murphy, said Hogan's attendance raised a question over whether he quarantined if he came from Brussels to attend the dinner.
Visitors from most EU countries, including Belgium, are required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Ireland under some of the strictest travel restrictions in the bloc.
The Irish Examiner quoted a spokesman from the County Galway Station House Hotel, where the event was held, as saying it was told by the hotel sector's representative body that until guidance on the new restrictions was available, the dinner would adhere to guidelines if fewer than 50 people dined in adjoining rooms.
The two sets of diners were divided by a removable partition, the spokesman said.

446,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>","Biden on North Korea: Fewer summits, tighter sanctions, same standoff","By Josh Smith, Hyonhee Shin and Trevor Hunnicutt
SEOUL/WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - No more ""Little Rocket Man"", exchanging love letters or summit pageantry. 
If Joe Biden is elected U.S. president, American policy toward North Korea is likely to see less emphasis on personal dealings with leader Kim Jong Un, and more focus on allies and working-level diplomacy, campaign advisers and former officials say.
President Donald Trump has said he will make deals with North Korea ""very quickly"" if re-elected on Nov 3. 
Pyongyang officials, however, have said while Kim still has a good relationship with Trump, they have to look ahead to a time when Trump isn't president.
Last year, North Korea lashed out at Biden, calling him a ""rabid dog"" that should ""be beaten to death"" for comments seen as disparaging of Kim.
Biden, who has a solid lead in most opinion polls, cited those threats in January when he said he would not meet with Kim unless unspecified preconditions are met.
After months of trading threats and insults - Kim was ""Little Rocket Man"" and Trump a ""deranged U.S. dotard"" - Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to meet with a North Korean leader when he held a summit with Kim in Singapore in 2018. 
The two leaders met twice more, and exchanged what Trump called ""beautiful letters"", but failed to resolve a standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons.
""There's no question that the era of love letters will be over,"" one Biden policy adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
Biden told The New York Times he would not continue the personal diplomacy with Kim, calling the meetings a ""vanity project"" that should only happen if coupled with ""an actual strategy that moves the ball forward on denuclearization.""
""ALLIES AND PARTNERS""
Biden would not shut the door to diplomacy, but instead ""empower negotiators and implement a sustained and a coordinated effort with allies and partners"" to pressure and incentivize North Korea to denuclearize, while also drawing attention the country's human rights abuses in a way that has been lacking in current U.S. policy, the Biden adviser said.
Biden was vice president under Barack Obama, and some parts of his policy would likely be similar to Obama's ""strategic patience"", which sought to isolate North Korea and not offer diplomatic rewards for its provocations.
""Many advisers in Biden’s campaign were part of the 'strategic patience' team, which is pro-alliance and takes orthodox approaches to foreign policy, including North Korea politics,"" said Chang Ho-jin, a former South Korean presidential foreign policy secretary who worked with several Biden aides.
""North Korea wouldn’t have to face fears of unpredictable military action as Trump had floated, but would likely suffer from tighter screws.""
Biden's promise to work more closely with allies may be complicated by South Korean President Moon Jae-in's push for more engagement with North Korea and looser sanctions, while downplaying human rights issues.
""That could create a discord with Seoul,"" said James Kim, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.
A PROVOCATION BY PYONGYANG? 
Kim has also made significant progress in advancing his military capabilities since Biden last held office, successfully testing North Korea's largest nuclear bomb and missiles capable of striking anywhere in the United States.
The U.S. arms control community is likely to have a strong voice in a Biden administration and will argue it is time to accept the idea that North Korea is now a nuclear power, said Evans Revere, a former U.S. negotiator with North Korea. 
But that approach would effectively grant North Korea's long-time goal of cementing its nuclear status, and a Biden presidency will almost certainly take a more hard-nosed approach, likely prompting pushback from Pyongyang, Revere said.
""If Biden wins in November, we can expect North Korea to take a dramatic step later this year, possibly by conducting a nuclear or ICBM test, to warn the new administration away from this path,"" he said.
The Biden adviser declined to elaborate on what Biden might do if North Korea returns to nuclear or ICBM tests.
Jung Pak, a former CIA analyst who now works at the Brookings Institution and provides informal counsel to the Biden campaign, said any North Korean provocation could be used by a new administration. 
""A nuclear or ICBM test by North Korea would provide an opportunity for the new administration to highlight the threat that the Kim regime poses and try to build some consensus or agreement with our allies on a coherent North Korea policy,"" she said, while noting that she does not speak for Biden's campaign. 

""That is, don’t let a good crisis go to waste.""

BOSASO, Somalia/NAIROBI, Kenya (Reuters) - Somali pirates have released three Iranian hostages held for five years, a maritime security official said on Thursday, as conflicting reports emerged whether another ship had been seized after a three-year hiatus in hijackings. 
The three Iranians are the last of the crew of the Iranian fishing vessel FV Siraj, which was captured by pirates on March 22, 2015.
""This marks the end of an era of Somali piracy and the pain and suffering of Somalia's forgotten hostages,"" said John Steed, the coordinator of the Hostage Support Programme, a volunteer organisation based in Nairobi begun to help rescue crews abandoned by their employers. 
The release was meant to mark the end of an era for Somalia's pirates, who held over 2,300 crew between 2010 and 2019. 
But instead, six armed men hijacked the Panama-flagged Aegean II late Wednesday after it had engine problems, a regional governor in Somalia told Reuters. 
Musse Salah, the governor of Gardafu in the semi-autonomous northern region of Puntland, said the ship was travelling from the United Arab Emirates to Mogadishu port when pirates attacked it, in what would be the first successful hijacking since 2017. 
There were 20 crew onboard, said a resident in contact with the men who had seized the ship. 
A regional security official said the men appeared to have links to a local militia that functioned as a police unit in the Bari region. The official asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
POLICE, PIRATES, OR BOTH?
Jay Bahadur, a Somali piracy expert who was previously head of a United Nations group of experts enforcing an arms embargo on Somalia, said that being a pirate and a member of the Somali police had not historically been mutually exclusive.
He said it appeared that a group of men wearing police uniforms had boarded the ship, robbed the crew and taken the weapons of a private security team on board.
The man reported to be the ringleader of the attack on the Aegean II had repeated phone contact with another pirate who was part of a group that carried out Somalia's last hijacking in 2017, he added. The contact happened in the months prior to the 2017 hijacking.
""If it was indeed the police, it bears resemblance to one of the earliest Somali piracy incidents, when members of the Puntland coast guard hijacked the boat they were supposed to be guarding,"" he said.
Satellite tracking data showed the ship appeared to have rounded the Horn of Africa and was going south past the Somali port of Hafun before suddenly turning sharply to the north and docking in Bereeda. Pictures sent to Reuters from Bereeda showed the Aegean II, a small tanker that carries chemical or crude products. 
The European Union Naval Force, known as EU Navfor, was checking on the incident, said a source in their Somalia Joint Operation Centre. 
At the height of their power in 2011, Somali pirates launched 237 attacks off the coast of the country, the International Maritime Bureau says, and held hundreds hostage.
The number of attacks later tumbled as shipping firms implemented better security protocols, including posting look-outs, sailing further away from Somalia, and hiring private security. International warships operating as part of a coalition also prevented several attacks.
Somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991 and is controlled by a patchwork of local militias, pockets of federal forces, African Union peacekeepers and Islamist insurgents. The Horn of Africa nation has also been intermittently plagued by pirates.

""Mexico was offered at least 2,000 doses of the vaccine to do its protocol to start testing it in Mexico, which is very good news because again we buy ourselves time,"" said Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard.
On Wednesday, Mexico's government told Moscow it would like to carry out phase 3 testing of the vaccine, as part of the Latin American country's efforts to secure early supplies of an effective medicine to control the coronavirus pandemic.
Mass testing of Russia's COVID-19 vaccine to get domestic regulatory approval will involve more than 40,000 people and will be overseen by a foreign research body when it starts next week, backers of the project said on Thursday.
The vaccine has been dubbed ""Sputnik V"" in homage to the world's first satellite launched by the Soviet Union.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In a shift that some experts believe exacerbates already deep inequalities in the U.S. economy, more Americans than ever are working from home, and many are likely to continue to do so even after the health threat from COVID-19 has abated.
With cases of the virus still on the rise, about 40% of the U.S. labor force is working from home. They are five times as likely to have a university degree as those who are not, Stanford University professor Nicholas Bloom said at an event convened on Thursday by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank to discuss the future of work. 
Surveys show that most want to keep working at home at least part-time even after the pandemic is over, and a recent survey by the Atlanta Fed shows firms expect that as well. 
At the same time, about 30% of people are still doing their jobs in person, Bloom noted. Their jobs tend to be lower-paying, and often put workers at risk of contracting the virus either on the job or during their commute. 
Another 30%, Bloom said, have lost their jobs or left the workforce. They risk their skills and work connections atrophying, setting them up for potentially lower pay in the future. 
The pandemic has thrown a spotlight on inequalities of all sorts, including access to healthcare, housing and jobs.
""Working from home really risks a big increase in inequality,"" Bloom said. 
But to Github Chief Operating Officer Erica Brescia, a fellow panelist, the ability to work from home makes businesses ""much more inclusive."" 
Giving workers the flexibility to arrange their schedules around non-work obligations has made it possible to hire people who otherwise might not have been able to take a job, she said. Github allowed workers to work fully or partly from home even before the pandemic. 

Recent census data shows that women ages 25-44 are almost three times as likely as men to be out of work, due to the demands of childcare.

""We have made offers in the past that would allow U.S. citizens to leave, but all were rejected by Maduro and his cronies,"" the spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said in an emailed statement, adding that Washington was looking at all options to ensure the secure return home of U.S. citizens.
She did not say how many Americans were stuck in Venezuela.
Washington has disavowed the government of Maduro and instead recognizes opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, even though Maduro remains in control of state institutions.
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza wrote on Twitter on Thursday that Caracas has offered to repatriate U.S. citizens via flights to the United States on state-owned airline Conviasa.
That proposal would be impossible under Trump administration sanctions that bar flights between the two countries and prohibit U.S. citizens from dealings with Conviasa.
U.S. diplomat James Story of the Venezuela Affairs Unit, based in neighboring Colombia, said last week that Americans were being held hostage by Maduro's government.
""I have more than 800 people who have asked for my support in helping leave the country,"" Story said in an interview with Venezuelan journalist Vladimir Villegas broadcast online.
He did not say how many of those were U.S. citizens. It was not immediately clear how many Americans are in Venezuela.
Countries including Spain have been allowed by Maduro's government to organize flights to repatriate their citizens.
The United States and about 60 other countries recognize Guaido and regard Maduro's 2018 re-election as a sham. But Maduro has remained in power, backed by the OPEC nation's military as well as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran.

U.S. officials say privately that Maduro's continued rule despite heavy U.S. sanctions has been a source of frustration for U.S. President Donald Trump.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile on Thursday faced questioning by a United Nations water rights expert who suggested the government could be placing economic development over human rights through controversial agriculture and energy projects.
Leo Heller, the UN special rapporteur on human rights to drinking water and sanitation, said he had asked the government to ""clarify"" its approach to the intensive cultivation of avocados in the central coastal region of Valparaiso, as well as the Alto Maipo Hydroelectric Project which lies southeast of the capital, Santiago.
""The Chilean Government would not be fulfilling its international human rights obligations if it prioritises economic development projects over the human rights to water and health,"" he said in a statement. 
""These two projects may put that supply at risk, which is particularly worrying during the COVID-19 pandemic.""
Chile has been in the grip of one of the worst droughts in 60 years and last year declared a water emergency in Petorca, the center of its world-leading avocado trade.
One avocado tree uses more water per day than the 50-litre daily quota set aside for each resident, Heller said, yet the government continues to grant new water rights to agricultural companies. 
The current quota for residents did not account for the frequent hand washing required to kill coronavirus, he added.

UNITED NATIONS/DUBAI (Reuters) - The United States moved to restore all U.N. sanctions on Iran on Thursday, arguing Tehran was in violation of a nuclear deal it struck with world powers in 2015 even though Washington itself abandoned that agreement two years ago.
The United States submitted a letter to the 15-member U.N. Security Council accusing Tehran of non-compliance, starting a 30-day clock that could lead to the ""snapback"" of U.N. sanctions even though remaining parties to the nuclear deal oppose this.
The U.S. move, taken partly because of the impending October expiration of a U.N. arms embargo on Tehran, drew condemnation from Iran, which said Washington had no right to trigger the re-imposition because it had abandoned the nuclear agreement and asked Council members to oppose the U.S. action.
""It is an enormous mistake not to extend this arms embargo. It's nuts!"" Pompeo told reporters at the United Nations as he harshly criticized what he described as the ""one-sided, foolish"" nuclear deal negotiated by former U.S. President Barack Obama.
A snapback of U.N. sanctions would reimpose the conventional arms embargo, ban Iran from developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and bring back targeted sanctions on dozens of individuals and entities.
It would also require Iran to halt all nuclear enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development, and ban imports that could contribute to those activities or the development of nuclear arms delivery systems.
Countries also would be urged to inspect shipments to and from Iran and authorized to seize any banned cargo. 
Diplomats say the process of restoring the U.N. sanctions will be messy as Russia, China and other countries question the legality of the U.S. move because Washington no longer abides by what President Donald Trump called the ""worst deal ever.""
Iran's U.N. Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi said Tehran was confident that the Security Council would reject the U.S. move.
""A permanent member of the Security Council is acting like a child, is being ridiculed by the other members of the international community,"" he told reporters after Pompeo spoke.
Russia, which said it would not restore the U.N. sanctions, called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss Iran on Friday.
IRAN WAITS FOR BIDEN
Three senior Iranian officials told Reuters this week Iran’s leadership is determined to remain committed to the nuclear deal, hoping that a victory by Trump rival Democrat Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election will salvage the pact.
Biden, who was vice president when the Obama administration negotiated the accord, said he would rejoin the deal if Iran first resumed compliance.
""If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement and build on it, while working with allies to push back on Iran's destabilizing actions,"" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told Reuters.
Trump's administration abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, which was designed to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, arguing in part that its limitations on Iran's atomic activities were inadequate.
In his letter to the U.N. Security Council, Pompeo said Iran had breached many of the deal's central limits without acknowledging that most of the Iranian ""non-performance"" came only after Washington had pulled out.
In his own letter to the Security Council, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Washington had no right to trigger the ""snapback"" mechanism as it was no longer a party to the 2015 nuclear pact.

Under that accord between Iran and six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - Tehran committed to limit its nuclear activities in return for wide relief from sanctions.

455,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 05:05PM ET</span>","Former Republican CIA, FBI heads and national security officials to back Biden","By Tim Reid
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Over 70 former Republican national security officials including ex-CIA and FBI chiefs will endorse Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Friday while launching a scathing indictment of President Donald Trump, calling him corrupt and unfit to serve.
The group, called Former Republican National Security Officials for Biden, includes some of the most senior Republican members of the U.S. defense and intelligence establishment to have served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Trump.
The 73-strong group includes retired General Michael Hayden, who served as national security director and head of the CIA; William Webster, the only man to serve as both head of the CIA and FBI; John Negroponte, the first director of National Intelligence; Michael Leiter, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center; and Mike Donley, former Air Force secretary.
Their full-throated condemnation of Trump and backing of Biden will come three days before Trump's nominating convention opens on Monday and underscores how the Republican president has alienated some members of his own party, especially among intelligence and foreign policy veterans.
""Trump has demonstrated that he lacks the character and competence to lead this nation and has engaged in corrupt behavior that renders him unfit to serve as president,"" the group plans to declare in a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal on Friday.
""We have concluded that Donald Trump has failed our country and that Vice President Joe Biden should be elected the next President of the United States,"" it adds.
The group is one of a number of Republican organizations opposing Trump's re-election in the Nov. 3 election.
Collectively, they object to his alienation of U.S. allies abroad and his leadership at home, most recently his response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 170,000 Americans and triggered a severe economic downturn, as well as his reaction to nationwide protests over racial injustice and police brutality against Black Americans.
The Trump campaign has described Republican-led groups campaigning for Biden, such as Republican Voters Against Trump and 43 Alumni for Biden - hundreds of officials who worked for George W. Bush - as ""the swamp,"" disaffected former officials ""trying to take down the duly elected President of the United States.""
Trump himself has expressed contempt, saying on Twitter last year that such ""Never Trump Republicans"" are ""human scum.""
'GLOBAL CHAOS'
Bob Tuttle, who was director of personnel under Reagan and ambassador to the UK under George W. Bush, is a member of the national security group and said Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis had been ""abominable.""
""He's a malignant narcissist. He's a liar. He's a despicable human being and the worst president in American history - it's not even close,"" Tuttle told Reuters.
Another group member, James Glassman, an undersecretary of state in the George W. Bush administration, said Trump had created ""global chaos.""
""Lack of leadership has led to the deaths of 170,000 Americans,"" Glassman said. ""There's no excuse in the country with the best health scientists in the world.""
The group lays out a detailed charge sheet against Trump, including accusations that he is unfit to lead in a national crisis, undermined confidence in U.S. elections, aligned himself with dictators, preached a ""dark and pessimistic view of America"" and attacked and vilified immigrants.
The national security group will launch a website on Friday and come under the umbrella of another anti-Trump organization run by Republicans, Defending Democracy Together. The former national security officials raised $140,000 among themselves to launch their effort.

Colombia does not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's leader and Duque refers to him as a dictator. The Colombian government is among more than 50 countries which consider opposition leader Juan Guaido to be Venezuela's president.
Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza called the claim ""fiction"" on Twitter. 
""In Colombia the massacres, unleashed violence, uncontrollable drug trafficking do not stop,"" he wrote. ""@IvanDuque returns to infamies and anti-Venezuelan fiction to distract public opinion.""
Though Venezuela has previously purchased weaponry from countries such as China and Russia, Maduro's government is mired in a long-running fiscal crisis, struggling to provide basics like fuel despite its huge oil reserves.
""There is information from international intelligence organisms that work with us which shows there is interest from the dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro in acquiring some medium and long-range missiles through Iran,"" Duque said during a virtual event. 
""The information is that (the missiles) still haven't arrived but there has been contact especially under instructions from (Venezuela Defense Minister Vladimir) Padrino,"" Duque said.
Duque reiterated his frequent accusation that Maduro protects and supports former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia rebel group who reject a 2016 peace deal and the still-active National Liberation Army guerrillas. 
The neighboring countries' 2,219 kilometer (1,380-mile) and border is home to numerous armed groups principally involved in drug trafficking and illegal gold mining.

Colombia is the top destination for Venezuelans who have fled their country in recent years. More than 1.7 million Venezuelans reside in Colombia.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Before coronavirus shut down the United States, gym re-opening used to mean simply unlocking the front door and greeting the herds squeezed into spandex pants. 
Now, as New York gyms gird to re-open as soon as Monday, exercise centers like Chelsea Piers Fitness in Manhattan are upgrading air filters to hospital grade, disinfecting sand on the beach volleyball court, spreading work-out equipment 6 feet apart, and cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.
""Reopening is going to be intense. It's going to be tough,"" said Chelsea Piers trainer Oscar Herrera as preparations to re-open one of the largest gyms in New York City kicked into high gear.
While New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said gyms could reopen with restrictions as early as Monday, hopes of quickly reopening in New York City were dealt a setback by Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said none would reopen before Sept. 2. 
State restrictions include limiting admittance to one-third of capacity, temperature checks and wearing masks at all times. Gyms must maintain sign-in sheets to help contact tracers.
New York will join at least 43 states and Washington, D.C., in permitting gyms to reopen to some extent since the coronavirus pandemic forced shutdowns beginning in March, said Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Poppler, spokeswoman for the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association, a nonprofit trade group. 
Last year, 3 million part-time and full-time employees worked in as many as 50,000 health and fitness clubs in the United States, she said.
In New York City alone, some 2,111 gyms employ 86,551 workers.
""We estimate the industry lost $700 million per week during the height of the shutdown, and $7 billion lost through July 1,"" Poppler said.
Tempers flared over gym shutdowns among those who regularly pump iron to boost health and happiness and shed gained weight, often called the ""quarantine 15"". In Bellmawr, New Jersey, two owners of Atilis Gym were arrested last month for defying state shutdown orders and their business license was revoked.
At the enormous exercise center located on a Manhattan pier jutting into the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River, Chelsea Piers member Faye Stenning, founder of Grit Coaching, said she was thrilled the gym would be reopening.

""Fitness is a huge part of people's lives,"" Stenning said.

The president's demand came after a photocopy of a 63-page declaration by Emilio Lozoya, a former chief executive of national oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), began circulating in Mexican media on Wednesday.
In the document, which was seen by Reuters, Lozoya accused ex-presidents Felipe Calderon and Carlos Salinas of corruption, along with former president Enrique Pena Nieto, his ex-finance minister, Luis Videgaray, and more than a dozen others.
""They have to return the money,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters during a regular morning press conference, without specifiying to whom he was referring.
Lozoya was extradited from Spain last month to face trial for taking bribes and money laundering, which he denies.
Lopez Obrador described the leaked testimony as ""very serious"" while maintaining that its accusations need to be properly investigated by the Attorney General's office.
Lozoya's case has become the centerpiece of Lopez Obrador's drive to expose corruption that he says was rampant in past governments before he took office in late 2018.
Former president Calderon called the accusations against him ""ridiculous"" on Twitter. Neither Pena Nieto nor Videgaray has commented publicly since Lozoya's allegations surfaced, but previously they have denied any wrongdoing. 

Salinas could not be immediately reached for comment.

Mexico has been blighted by gang violence for many years, with successive governments failing to tackle the problem. According to the latest data available, more than 34,600 murders were registered last year, a record.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised to reduce the violence with a new strategy after taking power in December 2018, but homicides have continued to tick up.
After three months of falling murder figures, Mexico in July recorded a 3.9% rise in homicides compared to the previous month, as 2,980 people were killed, official data showed. Compared to July 2019, murders rose 0.3%.
Mexico's Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said the uptick in violence was partly due to violence surrounding the hunt and high-profile arrest of Jose Antonio Yepez, a cartel leader who was one of the government's biggest targets. [nL1N2F4046]
""July was a very tense month derived mainly from all the public security actions in the state of Guanajuato that concluded with the arrest of the leader of the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel,"" Durazo told a news conference.
Overall murders in Mexico are up 1.6% in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period in 2019, the bloodiest year in Mexico's recorded history.
Murders of women because of their gender, categorized as femicides, are up 5.4% in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period in 2019. Another 74 women were killed in July, data showed.
Other serious crimes, including kidnappings and robbery, have fallen during the coronavirus pandemic.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The defense team for former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, who is under investigation for alleged witness tampering, has asked for the handling of the case to pass from the Supreme Court to the attorney general's office.
Uribe, who says he is innocent, resigned his Senate seat this week after being placed under house arrest at his country home earlier this month.
The Supreme Court handles criminal proceedings involving lawmakers and high-ranking officials, but may face jurisdictional issues now Uribe is no longer a legislator. 
Uribe's critics have alleged his Senate resignation is a ploy to place the case with a potentially less-rigorous legal body.
A court source and a member of Uribe's team both confirmed the request was presented by the defense team to the court on Wednesday afternoon. The court has five days to respond.
The Supreme Court cited the potential for obstruction of justice when it unanimously ordered the detention of Uribe, perhaps the South American country's most divisive politician. One of Uribe's sons has characterized the measure as a kidnapping.
It is the first time ever a Colombian court has detained a former president.
Uribe said in his Senate resignation that eight procedural guarantees had been violated and wiretaps which form part of the case were illegal. 
Uribe's seat is expected to be taken up by whichever remaining candidate on his party's list from the 2018 elections got the highest number of votes.
The former president and several allies stand accused of engaging in witness tampering in an attempt to discredit allegations Uribe had ties to right-wing paramilitaries.
Kingmaker Uribe has shepherded two successors to power since the end of his second term in 2010, including current President Ivan Duque, who has repeatedly said he believes his mentor is innocent.

PARIS (Reuters) - Germany and France offered on Thursday to provide medical care on their soil for Russian opposition leader Alexander Navalny, who is gravely ill after aides said he was poisoned.
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said they were deeply concerned at what was happening to Navalny, one of the fiercest critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Macron, who hosted Merkel for talks at his summer residence in a medieval island fortress in the Mediterranean, said he had discussed Navalny's illness at length with the German leader.
""The news we have at this hour is extremely troubling. We will continue to follow the situation very closely,"" he told a joint news conference with Merkel after their talks.
""We are clearly ready to provide all necessary assistance to Alexander Navalny and those close to him in terms of healthcare, in terms of asylum, and protection, that is clear,"" said Macron. 
""I hope he can be saved.""
Navalny began feeling ill on a plane to Moscow on Thursday morning after drinking tea at an airport cafe in the Siberian city of Tomsk.
His condition became so serious that the plane made an emergency landing at the city of Omsk, en route to Moscow, where he was carried off on a stretcher.
Kira Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, said he was in intensive care in a serious but stable condition, and on an artificial lung ventilator in a hospital in Omsk, about 2,200 km (1,400 miles) east of the Russian capital. 
Merkel said Germany stood ready to treat Navalny in its hospitals, but it had yet to receive such a request from Navalny's entourage. 

""What is particularly important is that the circumstances behind this are cleared up very quickly,"" she added. ""We insist on this, because what we have heard so far is very unfavourable. It must be done very transparently,"" Merkel said.

The United States has sold the F-35 to allies, including Turkey, South Korea, Japan and Israel, but sales to the Gulf require a deeper review due to U.S. policy for Israel to maintain a military advantage in the Middle East.
""We have legitimate requests that are there. We ought to get them ... the whole idea of a state of belligerency or war with Israel no longer exists,"" Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said in an online interview with the Atlantic Council.
However, he said the UAE had not made any new requests to the Americans since the deal with Israel. 
The Gulf state, one of Washington's closest Middle Eastern allies, has long expressed interest in acquiring the fighter jet made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), which Israel has used in combat. 
An industry insider has told Reuters the United States is eyeing the sale of F-35s to the UAE in a side agreement to the UAE-Israel deal.
However, any F-35 sale could take years to negotiate and deliver, while Israel's prime minister has said his country would oppose any sale, citing a need to maintain Israeli military superiority in the region.
Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's undersecretary of defence for acquisition and sustainment and a leader in the U.S. weapons export process, told reporters on Thursday that in general, the United States aims to reach a letter of agreement for new F-35 sales in about 6 months. She referred questions on the UAE deal to the State Department.
A State Department spokesman deferred to Trump's comments from a news conference on Wednesday in which he said, ""They'd like to buy F-35s, we'll see what happens, it's under review.""
Poland, the most recent F-35 customer, purchased 32 of the jets in January, but will not receive its first delivery until 2024. Any sale would also need congressional approval.
Washington guarantees that Israel receives more advanced American weapons than Arab states, giving it what is labelled a “Qualitative Military Edge” over its neighbours.

""The UAE expects that its requirements will be accepted and we feel that with the signing of this peace treaty in the coming weeks or months ... that any hurdle towards this should no longer be there,"" Gargash said.

(Reuters) - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday doubled down on his commitment to reopen schools for in-person learning next month, a day after the city's teachers union said his reopening protocol was insufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
The mayor and schools chancellor Richard Carranza released a ""Back to School pledge"" outlining the features of their reopening plan, including that all schools will have a 30-day supply of personal protective equipment at all times and schools will close if the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests in the city is 3% or more on a 7-day average.
New York City schools, which make up the largest school district in the U.S., are slated to open Sept. 10 for a blend of in-person and remote learning.
""We are going to make sure these schools are safe and ready. And if we don't think they're safe and ready, they won't reopen,"" de Blasio said on Thursday.
Compared to De Blasio's threshold of a 3% COVID-19 infection rate for schools to shut down again, the city's positive test rate on Thursday was 0.88%.
New York City teachers on Wednesday threatened to strike or bring legal action unless the city government addresses specific safety demands like a more rigorous COVID-19 testing plan and protocols for isolating students who show symptoms of the virus.
""The minute we feel that the mayor is trying to force people in to a situation that is unsafe... we go to court, we take a job action,"" said Michael Mulgrew, president of the union representing the city's 133,000 teachers, adding that a ""job action"" could include a strike.
The union did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the mayor's pledge on Thursday.
""Now it's time to say, public servants, rise to the occasion and answer the call,"" de Blasio said of the teachers. 
The mayor's school reopening plan ""encourages"" teachers to get tested for COVID-19 monthly and promises that the city's testing sites will expedite results for city school staff.
If at least two COVID-19 cases are confirmed in different classrooms at a school, the mayor's plan calls for the school to be closed for 14 days. If 1 or 2 linked cases are recorded in the same classroom, then only that classroom must close for 14 days.

""Schools will communicate to all families and students at school once a case is laboratory confirmed,"" the NYC Department of Education website states.

SIRTE, Libya (Reuters) - In Sirte's municipal offices, walls are adorned with pictures of Khalifa Haftar, commander of the eastern-based Libyan National Army. Out in the desert, troops keep watch from behind sandbanks.
Already scarred by Libya's 2011 uprising and an Islamic State takeover, Sirte now finds itself not only at the centre of a civil war but also a focus of geopolitical enmities that span the region.
Since Turkish intervention helped drive Haftar's LNA back in early June from its 14-month offensive on the capital, Tripoli, the front lines have settled around Sirte, in the middle of Libya's Mediterranean coast and close to major oil terminals.
""The city has seen wars and crises that have made people afraid,"" said Adel Mohamed, a 43-year-old resident shopping in a local supermarket in the city of 90,000. ""There is always anxiety about what is to come.""
Libya's civil conflict pits the LNA and its allies against forces aligned with the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, in the west.
As the GNA and Turkey looked ready to make further advances, Egypt declared Sirte a red line and pushed through parliamentary approval for possible military intervention. 
In recent weeks Libyan factions and their foreign backers have been mobilising as diplomats try to avert a military escalation and secure a ceasefire.
On a rare tour of LNA military positions, Reuters reporters saw troops stationed at positions southwest of Sirte, some sheltering under awnings or in tents, others manning watchpoints.
""Our armed forces are stationed around Sirte, even beyond Sirte. We are prepared,"" said Mohamed Shaqlouf, head of the LNA's operations centre in the area. 
""Our fingers must remain on the trigger until Libya is purified from mercenaries and colonizers, and from everyone who has greedily sought our land and its riches.""
During a visit to Tripoli this week, Germany's foreign minister echoed a U.S. call for a demilitarized zone around Sirte and Jufra, a military base to the south. He also warned of a ""deceptive calm"", with both sides and their allies continuing to arm themselves ""on a massive scale"".
FOREIGN MEDDLING
Foreign powers have been involved in Libya since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that ended Muammar Gaddafi's four decades in power. But in recent months the meddling has reached new levels. 
While Turkey has considered using military bases in western Libya, the U.S. has accused Russia of sending fighter jets and military supplies to help Russian private contractors.
Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC), has said the deployment of mercenaries has turned oil installations into ""military posts"", and accused the United Arab Emirates - one of Haftar's main backers - of upholding a blockade that for the last eight months has all but halted the oil production Libya depends on. 
Russia has rejected U.S. statements about its alleged military intervention, and the LNA denies it uses mercenaries. 
""We have no one with us. No Russians ... nothing,"" said Shaqlouf, the LNA commander. 
The UAE says it supports a diplomatic solution to the conflict and wants to see a return of Libya's oil production as soon as possible but with safeguards in place.
UAE authorities did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Thursday.
Major oil terminals in Libya's Oil Crescent east of Sirte, repeatedly fought over and damaged in recent years, remain blockaded under LNA control. 
Sirte itself is still partly in ruins from the battles of 2016 when GNA forces pushed Islamic State from the city where the jihadist group had set up its North African stronghold. 
The seaside neighbourhood that saw the heaviest fighting lies in ruins, abandoned. Elsewhere, shops and cafes are open, and the city does not suffer the crippling power cuts of other regions thanks to a power station nearby. 
Abdelaziz Abdelrahim, a 27-year-old butcher's shop employee, said there were still cash shortages, but fewer than before the LNA took control of Sirte in January. 

""More attacks on Sirte? We say God willing, no.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's highest court has rejected an appeal by the ex-wife of a Russian billionaire to seize a £350 million ($460 million)superyacht in one of the world's costliest divorce battles, a court ruling last week said. 
The Dubai Court of Cassation rejected an appeal by Tatiana Akhmedova, ex-wife of oil and gas billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, to seize the yacht as part of a 453 million pound divorce bill imposed by London's High Court. 
The vessel, the M.V. Luna, was built for Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich before Akhmedov bought it in 2014. It has at least nine decks, space for 50 crew, two helipads, a vast swimming pool and a mini submarine. 
The yacht is at the centre of one of the largest divorce settlements in legal history. London's High Court in 2016 ordered Akhmedov to pay about 40% of his fortune to former wife Akhmedova. 
But Akhmedov failed to pay and the London court granted a worldwide freezing order, under which the Luna was impounded in Dubai in 2018.
This appeals process has ended in Dubai, but the battle for control of the yacht continues in the Marshall Islands, whose flag the ship sails under, and regarding the Liechtenstein entity which owns the yacht, publicly available British and Marshall Islands court documents show. 
The Dubai Court of Cassation upheld a previous Dubai court ruling that London's 453 million pound divorce bill payout is unenforceable in Dubai, English and Arabic copies of the Aug. 13 Cassation ruling provided to Reuters by Akhmedov's spokesman show.
The spokesman said the court upheld that the London ruling is ""contrary to Islamic sharia, United Arab Emirates personal status law and public policy, and is therefore unenforceable in Dubai"".
Forbes has estimated Akhmedov's net worth around $1.4 billion. The U.S. Treasury Department has put him on a list of sanctioned Russian state-owned companies and so-called ""oligarchs"", identified as close to President Vladimir Putin.
Akhmedova is represented by London-listed litigation funder Burford Capital. Burford declined to comment on the development.

The Czech Republic was among the first countries outside Asia to order citizens to cover their faces in public in March.
It was also among the first to drop that requirement in the summer, after recording only a few hundred deaths from the respiratory disease.
The government, fearing a jump in case numbers when children return to schools and people to work from their summer breaks, said on Monday that people would have to wear face masks on public transport, in public buildings, medical and social care facilities, shops and restaurants, at public events, and in school corridors.
But after a wave of criticism that the order was excessive and hard to enforce, Health Minister Adam Vojtech said on Thursday the government's team of experts had decided to drop the requirement for schools, shops and restaurants.
The order will still take effect in public buildings, on public transport and at events with more than 100 people.
""We perceive opposing opinions. We have to look for a compromise - we are not deaf and blind,"" Vojtech told reporters.
""It is a question of what is ideal from the epidemiological point of view and what is the reality, the impact on individual groups and so on,"" he said.
Vojtech said the government would evaluate the situation according to its regional ""traffic light"" system and impose tougher requirements in places where cases surge.
He said there was little visibility over the likely severity of the pandemic in the autumn, saying he saw a 50-50 chance that the situation would get serious.
The Czech Republic, with a population of 10.7 million, hasso far reported around 20,798 COVID-19 cases in total and 404 deaths - very low compared with many European countries. 
It currently has 4,778 active cases and only 112 people in hospital as of Wednesday.

Mancuso, who is accused of war crimes and violating human rights, is in custody in the United States, where he was convicted of drug trafficking following his extradition along with other paramilitary leaders in 2008. 
The former paramilitary boss' lawyers are seeking his deportation to Italy, where he also has citizenship and faces additional drug-trafficking charges. 
""Salvatore Mancuso owes serious debts to the Colombian justice system, for which I have requested his extradition. If he is deported to Italy, we will follow the principles of universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity. His crimes will not go unpunished,"" Duque said via his Twitter account.
Mancuso, 56, is accused of being involved in thousands of crimes that took place during Colombia's internal armed conflict and was one of the main leaders of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, the country's main paramilitary group. 
Far-right paramilitary units surged in the 1980s with support from farmers, land owners and others who sought to defend themselves from attacks by leftist guerrillas amid state absence. 
The groups were taken over by powerful drug traffickers and converted into feared organizations responsible for hundreds of assassinations and massacres.
Although Mancuso has promised to confess what happened during his involvement in Colombia's conflict, which has left more than 260,000 dead, his lawyer in the United States recently said he should not be locked up because he took part in a 2005 peace deal that allowed paramilitary groups to demobilize.

477,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>",Explainer: What is the U.S. threat to trigger 'snapback' of U.N. sanctions on Iran?,"By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is expected on Thursday to trigger a process aimed at restoring all U.N. sanctions on Iran after the U.N. Security Council rejected a U.S. bid to extend a conventional arms embargo on the country. 
Here is a look at the events leading to this showdown and an explanation of what could happen next. 
WHY IS THE ARMS EMBARGO ON IRAN EXPIRING? 
The Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Iran in 2007. 
The embargo is due to expire in mid-October, as agreed to under the 2015 nuclear deal among Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States that seeks to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in return for economic sanctions relief. That accord is enshrined in a 2015 Security Council resolution. 
In 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump quit the accord reached under his predecessor Barack Obama, calling it ""the worst deal ever."" 
The United States failed on Friday in a bid to extend the Iran embargo at the Security Council. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE 2015 NUCLEAR DEAL? 
Even though the United States has withdrawn from the nuclear deal, Washington has threatened to use a provision in the agreement to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran if the Security Council does not extend the arms embargo.
While diplomats have predicted that the so-called sanctions snapback process at the Security Council would be messy - with the remaining parties to the nuclear deal opposed to such a move - it could ultimately kill the nuclear deal because Iran would lose a major incentive for limiting its nuclear activities. 
After the United States quit the deal, it imposed strong unilateral sanctions. In response, Iran has breached parts of the nuclear pact.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has described the next few weeks and months as critical.
WHAT SANCTIONS WOULD SNAP BACK? 
A snapback of U.N. sanctions would require Iran to suspend all nuclear enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development, and ban imports of anything that could contribute to those activities or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems. 
It would reimpose the arms embargo, ban Iran from developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and bring back targeted sanctions on dozens of individuals and entities. Countries also would be urged to inspect shipments to and from Iran and authorized to seize any banned cargo.
HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES TRIGGER A SANCTIONS SNAPBACK? 
The United States would have to submit a complaint about Iran breaching the nuclear deal to the Security Council.
The council would then have to vote within 30 days on a resolution to continue Iran's sanctions relief. If such a resolution is not adopted by the deadline, all U.N. sanctions in place before the 2015 nuclear deal would be automatically reimposed.
Trump said the United States was likely to submit its complaint this week.
CAN THE U.S. EFFORT BE STOPPED? 
It was not immediately clear how Russia, China or any other Security Council members might try to stop the United States from triggering a sanctions snapback or if procedurally there is any way they can.
Diplomats have said several countries are likely to argue that the United States legally could not activate a return of U.N. sanctions and therefore they simply would not reimpose the measures on Iran themselves.
HOW MIGHT A BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HANDLE IRAN?
Three senior Iranian officials told Reuters this week Iran's leadership is determined to remain committed to the nuclear deal, hoping that a victory by Trump's political rival Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 presidential election will salvage the pact.

Democrat Biden has said he would rejoin the nuclear deal, but only if Iran first returned to compliance. The accord was agreed by former U.S. President Barack Obama's administration, when Biden was vice president.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Libya's humanitarian crisis is worsening, compounded by the halt of oil operations, blockade of ports, and spread of COVID-19, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Thursday.
ICRC President Peter Maurer voiced hope that a flurry of diplomatic activity, including a visit earlier this week by German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, would restart a political peace process. 
Maurer spoke on return from the divided North African country where he held separate talks with Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, head of the internationally-recognised government, and General Khalifa Haftar, whose eastern-based forces launched an assault on Tripoli last year. 
The ICRC provides clean water to hundreds of thousands of people in the eastern city of Benghazi, evacuates bodies from the battlefield, and delivers medicines and protective equipment to health facilities across Libya.
""We have seen reserves depleted, family incomes are used to survive, it has been accentuated by the offensive on Tripoli, it has been further accentuated by COVID, by oil limitations and stops,"" Maurer told reporters.
Forces loyal to Haftar began the blockade of oil terminals and fields on Jan. 18, gradually reducing output.
Asked about prospects for a ceasefire around the central town of Sirte, Maurer said: ""The assets of the National Bank, the oil situation, the ceasefire or not around Sirte are highly political issues which need to be negotiated politically.""
Libya has been split since 2014 between factions based in the east and west, and regional powers have aligned themselves with the competing sides.
While Turkey and its regional ally Qatar support the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord, Haftar's forces have backing from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia.
Maurer said he won pledges from Serraj and Haftar for the ICRC to increase visits to detention centres in Misrata and Tripoli, and Benghazi, respectively, that hold people detained in the conflict.

""In terms of political commitment, it was very clear that there is a readiness now to let ICRC into more places of detention,"" he said.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>","Greenland's ice sheet saw record mass loss in 2019, study finds","By Cassandra Garrison
(Reuters) - Greenland's ice sheet lost a record amount of mass last year, according to a study published on Thursday, a finding that could prompt scientists to redefine their worst-case scenario as they assess the effects of climate change. 
The rate of ice loss had slowed for a two-year period amid cooler summers and higher snowfall in western Greenland through 2018. But last year, as warm air flowed northward from lower latitudes, the frozen island experienced a record loss in its ice mass, geoscientist and glaciologist Ingo Sasgen of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany said. 
That loss of 532 gigatons of ice - equivalent to about 66 tons of ice for each person on Earth - was 15% more than the previous record in 2012. 
Greenland's ice melt is of particular concern, as the ancient ice sheet holds enough water to raise sea levels by at least 20 feet (6 meters) if it were to melt away entirely. 
The study adds to evidence that Greenland's icy bulk is melting more quickly than anticipated amid climate warming. Another study last week indicated the island was no longer getting enough annual snowfall to replace ice lost to melting and calving at the glaciers' edges.
""We are likely on the path of accelerated sea level rise,"" Sasgen told Reuters. ""More melting of the ice sheet is not compensated by periods when we have extreme snowfall."" 
The study, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, used data collected by satellites to the gravitational force of the ice mass, which scientists can use to calculate how much snow and ice is locked within. 
Other research has shown the melting is being helped by water pooling atop the ice and at meltwater streaming between the ice sheet and the bedrock beneath. 
These studies are helping scientists refine their projections of how climate change will impact the Arctic, and how quickly. Sasgen compared the sobering process to getting difficult news from a doctor. 
""It's always depressing to see a new record,"" Sasgen said.
But the studies offer insight into ""where the problem is, and you also know to some extent what the treatment is,"" Sasgen added. 
""It is hard to tell if these (weather) patterns will be the new normal, and which pattern will occur with which frequency,"" Sasgen said.
The Arctic already has been warming at least twice as quickly as the rest of the world for the past 30 years, as the amount of greenhouse gases accumulated in the atmosphere continues to rise. That warming has also affected the Arctic sea ice, which shrank to its lowest extent this July in 40 years of record keeping. 
In terms of Greenland's fate, ""I would argue that we've been in a new normal for the past couple decades of accelerating mass loss,"" said Laura Andrews, a glaciologist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center not involved in the new study. ""Greenland is going to continue to lose mass."" 
If the rate of ice loss experienced in 2019 were to continue, the annual impact on sea levels could cause increasing coastal flooding that affects up to 30 million more people each year by the end of the century, said Andrew Shepherd, a polar scientist at University of Leeds who specializes in ice sheet observation. Shepherd was not involved in the new research. 

The new findings underline that ""we need to prepare for an extra 10 centimeters (4 inches) of global sea level rise by 2100 from Greenland alone,"" Shepherd said. ""We have to invent a new worst-case climate warming scenario, because Greenland is already tracking the current one.""

480,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 11:06AM ET</span>",Fate of migrants entwined in Brexit talks as EU holds out on deal,"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has so far rebuffed British calls for talks on a deal to allow London to send unwanted migrants back to Europe from 2021, and could use the issue as potential leverage in wider Brexit negotiations, diplomats and officials said.
The agenda for this week's EU-UK talks on their future relationship after a post-Brexit transition period runs out at the end of 2020 did not include specific talks on returning migrants, though London has long pressed for such a deal.
Brussels diplomats and officials following discussions on Britain's departure from the bloc told Reuters the EU was playing hard to get, believing an agreement on migrants was more important to Britain than the bloc's 27 member states.
Hundreds of people, including some children, have tried to cross the English Channel to southern England from makeshift camps in northern France this month - many navigating one of the world's busiest shipping routes in overloaded rubber dinghies.
Britain's Home Office said this week the uptick in the numbers attempting the perilous crossing was frustrating.
""That is why the (government) is committed ... to ensuring we have legislation ready following the end of the transition period,"" it said. ""This legislation will build on our continuing work with the French government to stop these crossings.""
Britain wants to be able to ship such migrants back to France or Belgium, where they embarked. 
But without a new deal with the EU, once its current arrangements with the bloc end it would be obliged under international humanitarian law to take responsibility for anyone landing on its coast, being fished from the water by its ships or brought to its ports by other vessels. 
Unlike with Turkey, where the EU needed a migration pact to ensure Ankara keeps on its soil the millions of Middle Eastern refugees it hosts - the 27 EU countries are in no rush. 
""The UK has interest in this. We can wait,"" said an EU diplomat dealing with migration. ""The 27 are not that worried. Of that, 25 do not really care at all. France and Belgium can be to some extent preoccupied, but far less than the UK is.""
Authorities on Wednesday found a dead Sudanese boy on a beach in northern France, as Paris and London said they would shut down the migrant route across the Channel.
SECURITY TRADE-OFF
Sources in Brussels hope a final Brexit agreement will be ready for an Oct.15-16 EU leaders' summit, allowing time for ratification by year-end, though some have warned it might come later.
EU sources said migration would not ultimately be a deal maker or breaker in the negotiations, where fisheries and state aid arrangements are the biggest lingering hurdles.
But a second EU diplomat said migration could play a role, suggesting a trade-off for talks on a new security and defence pact, which the bloc wants but London has refused to engage in so far.
""If they don't get the overall deal - they don't have a migration deal either,"" said the person, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""If they do go for a deal - they may get something on migration as well."" 
The U.N. migration agency expressed concern this week about Britain's plans to deploy its navy to intercept people and return them to mainland Europe.
""Our collective response should be... from saving lives to combating smuggling rings, expanding legal options, and ensuring that all those who are in need of protection can effectively access it,"" said the International Organization for Migration.

It called on London to ensure vulnerable migrants, such as unaccompanied minors, can continue reuniting with families in Britain after Brexit.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday urged the country's lower house to bar a public sector pay rise in a vote session scheduled for later in the day.
On Wednesday, the Senate decided to overturn a presidential veto blocking higher spending with civil servants' salaries, in a move that could increase public expenditure in billions of reais.
""I cannot govern this country if the lower house keeps the decision to overturn the veto. It would be impossible to govern Brazil,"" Bolsonaro said outside the Alvorada Palace, the president's official residence, estimating a loss of 120 billion reais ($21.17 billion) for the country.
Bolsonaro decided to veto the pay rises in return for disbursing 60 billion reais of aid to states and local authorities.
Economy Minister Paulo Guedes called the Senate decision a ""disaster"" and a ""crime"" against the population on Wednesday.
Amid fiscal concerns, the Brazilian real continued a downward trend against the U.S. dollar in morning trade, weakening roughly 2%. The stock exchange index was down 0.8%.

The number of new daily cases in Germany has been rising steadily since early July and has accelerated in recent weeks, driven by partying and people returning from holiday in countries where there is a high risk of catching the virus.
On Thursday, the number of confirmed cases climbed by 1,707 to 228,621, marking the biggest daily increase since April 26.
""At the moment, the numbers are rising a little slower than in spring - that's good - but as long as they are rising this is of course not a pleasant development,"" RKI deputy director Lars Schaade told Reuters television.
""The growth is still there and we hope of course that the growth will start to slow down in the next few days. Everyone can help,"" he said, urging people not to travel to high-risk countries and to stick to social-distancing and hygiene rules.
He said Germany's health authorities were currently in a good position to carry out contact tracing, despite the growing number of infections, but said at a certain level they might need to concentrate on just large outbreaks.
Almost half of the cases registered by the RKI were coming from people returning from holiday, Schaade said. Earlier on Thursday, Germany issued a warning against travel to parts of Croatia.
Schaade also rejected calls to consider relaxing restrictions for large events. ""I think at the very least the number of cases needs to be stable again and not rising further, or at best falling again.""

Health Minister Jens Spahn told lawmakers the next ""carnival season"" - a series of public celebrations and other events which start on Nov. 11 and end in mid-February, should be cancelled due to the pandemic, parliamentary sources told Reuters.

PESHAWAR (Reuters) - Police have arrested a man believed to have helped a teenage murder suspect to bring a gun into a courtroom and kill an American who was on trial for blasphemy in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, police said on Thursday.
The victim, Tahir Naseem, 57, from Chicago, was appearing for a bail hearing last month when Faisal Khan, 15, allegedly pulled out a gun and shot him in the courtroom, telling bystanders he was killing him for insulting the Prophet Muhammad.
Investigators now believe Khan was given the gun by a man named Tufail Zia, who was able to smuggle the weapon past security checkpoints because he was associated with the legal fraternity, the Peshawar police chief's office told Reuters.
Zia, who was arrested on Tuesday, was exempt from a pat-down search by court security, police said. The head of the city's bar council told Reuters Zia was an apprentice to one of the prosecuting lawyers.
Since his arrest, Khan has been lionized as a ""holy warrior"" by supporters in Pakistan. He has posed for selfies with his police escort and thousands have rallied in Peshawar calling for his release.
Blasphemy is a capital crime in Pakistan, and those even accused of it have often faced vigilantism.
The U.S. State Department has called on Pakistan to prosecute those responsible for the killing.
Khan's lawyer, Inamullah Yusufzai, told Reuters his client had not yet entered a plea, but he had asked the court to conduct the trial in the prison where he was being held, given the sensitive nature of the case. 
Yusufzai said the trial could begin as early as next week.

During a 90-minute conversation in the chancellery, Merkel explained her climate policy priorities for Germany's European Union presidency, the goal of achieving EU climate neutrality by 2050 and interim targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, a government spokesman said.
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Thunberg said Merkel had been nice and very friendly, but that the chancellor had a great responsibility and huge opportunity to become a world leader in the fight against climate change.
""What it comes down to is that we all start to treat the climate crisis like we treat any other crisis,"" Thunberg said, adding that she and her fellow activists had asked Merkel to tackle climate change with more urgency.
""What we want is leaders. We want people to step up, to dare to step out of their comfort zones, to prioritize the future ahead of us now and to be brave enough to think long-term,"" she said.
Thunberg was joined by fellow members of the Fridays for Future campaign group, among them Luisa Neubauer.
""She at least confirmed that she is willing to get stuff done during the presidency,"" Neubauer said. ""Yet eventually, at the end of the day, it's about common budgets, it's about very clear targets, it's about numbers and figures and that we need action, more than really nice and big words."" 
The government spokesman said Merkel and the activists agreed that global warming posed a challenge for the world and that industrialized countries had a special responsibility to tackle it.
""The basis for this is the consistent implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement,"" the spokesman said.

The German government admitted earlier this week that it would have missed its climate target for 2020 if the economic havoc wrought by the coronavirus pandemic had not caused a large drop in greenhouse gas emissions. [nL4N2FL36A]

MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus launched a criminal case on Thursday against a new opposition body, accusing it of an illegal attempt to seize power, a day after President Alexander Lukashenko threatened to sweep the streets of protesters who reject his re-election.
Belarus has been facing its biggest political crisis since the breakup of the Soviet Union, with tens of thousands of demonstrators rejecting Lukashenko's victory in an Aug. 9 vote his opponents say was rigged.
Opponents of Lukashenko, a gruff former collective farm boss in power for 26 years, unveiled the Coordination Council on Tuesday with the stated aim of negotiating a transfer of power.
Its dozens of members include a Nobel Prize-winning author and the ousted head of Minsk's main drama theatre, as well as exiled presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, whose followers say she won the election.
The general prosecutor's office described the body as designed to seize power, calling the act of setting it up a threat to national security, Russia's RIA news agency reported. No individuals were named as suspects in the case.
The council issued a statement rejecting the accusations and saying its efforts were lawful.
""The accusation is completely baseless and without foundation. Our goal is to resolve the crisis without conflict. We are not calling for the seizure of power,"" council member Syarhei Dyleuski, leader of a committee of striking workers at the Minsk Tractor Factory, told Reuters.
After days of huge rallies drawing tens of thousands of demonstrators, protests were diminished on Thursday but not halted.
Lukashenko announced on Wednesday he had ordered police to clear the streets of the capital, although no action was taken against hundreds of protesters who staged a rally in front of the police headquarters later that day. By lunchtime on Thursday there was still no sign of a decisive security operation.
Bigger rallies are expected again over the weekend.
Tsikhanouskaya, a 37-year-old political novice who emerged as the consensus opposition candidate after better-known figures were barred from standing, including her jailed activist husband, has fled to neighbouring Lithuania.
Lithuania's Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis met her at his office in Vilnius on Thursday.
He ""assured her that the government, together with its partners in Poland, Latvia and Estonia, are doing and will do everything so that there are free and fair elections in Belarus, and so that her children could as soon as possible hug their dad in freedom,"" he wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
That drew a thinly veiled rebuke from the Kremlin, which said Moscow would view any contact between foreign officials and the Belarus opposition as interference in Belarusian affairs.
The crisis in Belarus, Russia's most loyal neighbour, is a test for the Kremlin, which has to decide whether to stick with Lukashenko or try to manage a transfer of power.
It also poses a challenge to Western leaders trying to avert violence six years after a popular uprising in neighbouring Ukraine drew Russian military intervention and triggered Europe's deadliest ongoing conflict.
Of all Russia's former Soviet neighbours, Belarus has the closest political, economic and cultural relationship to Moscow, and its heavily fortified borders with Latvia, Lithuania and Poland are major frontiers of NATO.
The European Union has rejected Lukashenko's re-election and announced sanctions on Wednesday against some Belarus officials it blames for election fraud and abuse of protesters.

EU members bordering on Belarus have called for a tough line towards Lukashenko, but European officials are wary of strong action that might provoke Moscow into a military response.

The weather office on Thursday warned of ""very heavy rainfall"" over northern parts of India, including New Delhi and neighbouring cities, which could make the Gurugram floods worse. 
After torrential rains, residents used Twitter to post pictures of floating cars, floodwaters inundating upscale apartment blocks, and large sinkholes on roads that connect the city to New Delhi. 
TV footage showed miles-long traffic jams, overflowing sewage and three men rowing an inflatable lifeboat. 
Local traffic authorities in Gurugram tweeted pictures of waterlogged areas to help commuters avoid long jams.
Reuters partner ANI said local police had evacuated residents from a four-storey building after it leaned over to one side. 
""Hello Gurugram, nice rivers - why don't you ever change! Stay safe, people!,"" Twitter user Nidhi Arora said, posting pictures of flooded roads. 
Many Twitter users said they were stranded for hours in their cars on flooded roads. 

Federal civic authorities have asked local municipal officials to file a report.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",Ballot drop boxes are latest battleground in U.S. election fight,"By Andy Sullivan and Jarrett Renshaw
(Reuters) - Welcome to the latest partisan flash point in the U.S. presidential election: the ballot drop box.
As U.S. election officials gird for a dramatic expansion of mail voting in the Nov. 3 election, Democrats across the country are promoting drop boxes as a convenient and reliable option for voters who don't want to entrust their ballots to the U.S. Postal Service.
President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, meanwhile, has sued to prevent their use in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, alleging that the receptacles could enable voting fraud. 
Republican officials in other states have prevented their use. Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett told a U.S. Senate committee in July that drop boxes could enable people to violate a state law against collecting ballots.
In Missouri, Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft decided not to distribute 80 drop boxes he had purchased because state law requires those ballots to be returned by mail. 
""We didn't want to cause confusion with voters,"" spokeswoman Maura Browning said.
Drop boxes have taken on new urgency after cost-cutting measures at the U.S. Postal Service slowed mail delivery nationwide and Trump has repeatedly attacked the legitimacy of mail ballots. Polls show the Republican president trailing Democratic challenger Joe Biden in a race that some experts say could see half of all votes cast absentee.
Some say the drop box battle is a lot of fuss over a piece of civic furniture -- typically a heavily constructed metal box placed in a public location, often monitored by video.
In Connecticut, Secretary of State Denise Merrill is recommending that voters return their ballots via drop box rather than through the mail for the November election, after receiving reports that some ballots mailed a week before the state's Aug. 11 nominating contests arrived too late to be counted. 
Three-quarters of ballots in that August primary were cast absentee, she said, up from roughly 4% in prior years. Merrill, a Democrat, said the state's 200 newly installed drop boxes had proven a safe and popular option. 
""I do not understand why people think they're such a problem,"" Merrill said. ""They're more secure than mailboxes.""
Republicans in Pennsylvania don't share that sentiment. Trump won that competitive state by less than 1 percentage point in 2016. Winning there again could prove pivotal in his quest to secure a second term in office. 
The Trump campaign is suing to force the state to pull all drop boxes used in the June primary. It argues that people could drop off multiple ballots in boxes that are unstaffed, which is an illegal practice in Pennsylvania. State officials ""have exponentially enhanced the threat that fraudulent or otherwise ineligible ballots will be cast and counted,"" the lawsuit states.
The Trump campaign said in a court filing on Saturday that it had complied with a judge's order to provide evidence of alleged fraud to the defendants. That evidence has not been made public. Trump lawyers did not respond to a request by Reuters to see it.
Bruce Marks, a former Republican state senator in Pennsylvania, said drop boxes do not provide a clear chain of custody for the ballots deposited inside. 
""There's no one watching or tracking,"" he said.
Proponents say stuffing a ballot into a locked drop box is no different from dropping one into a Postal Service letter box. Pennsylvania Republicans oppose drop boxes because Democrats have had much more success in getting their voters to sign up for mail ballots this year, greater than a two-to-on margin, said Brendan Welch, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party.
""(Republicans) know the easier it is for everyday people to vote, the more likely it is that they will lose,"" Welch said. ""Maybe they should spend their energy trying to match Pennsylvania Democrats’ organizing efforts in the Keystone State instead.”
Democratic Governor Tom Wolf has defended Pennsylvania's use of drop boxes, arguing they are legal and essential, particularly in the age of the coronavirus. 
ONE BOX, 864,000 VOTERS
In neighboring Ohio, Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose said last week that he did not want to risk a similar lawsuit as he announced that he would authorize one drop box for each of the state's 88 counties. He said the Republican-controlled legislature had not given him the authority to provide more.
Democrats are pressing LaRose to revise his decision, pointing out that it leaves the 864,000 registered voters of Cleveland's Cuyahoga County, a Democratic stronghold, with the same number of drop boxes as the 8,400 registered voters of Republican Vinton County. 
""You can't have a one-size-fits-all approach with our counties,"" said Kathleen Clyde, a senior adviser for the Biden campaign in Ohio. ""One drop box doesn't cut it.""
LaRose in the meantime is trying to secure prepaid postage for mail ballots, spokeswoman Maggie Sheehan said, ""effectively making every mailbox its own drop box."" 
Michigan, another battleground state, has added drop boxes this year. 
Wisconsin's five largest cities, including Milwaukee, are setting up drop boxes as part of a secure-voting plan funded by the Center for Tech and Civic Life, a nonprofit group.
In hotly contested Florida, Democrats in Miami-Dade County, the state's largest, are seeking to remove some procedural hurdles to make it easier for voters to use drop boxes.
Unlike other counties in the state, Miami-Dade voters must provide election officials with valid identification when dropping off a ballot at a drop box. Election workers also manually record a 14-digit number printed on the voter's envelope into a log.
The whole process can take up to three minutes, the Democratic Party said in a letter to local election officials seeking to allow voters to drop their ballots quickly without the processing requirements.
“Trump has sabotaged the post office deliberately and we have to find ways around that. We think making it easier to use a drop box, and avoid the post office, is part of the solution,” said Steve Simeonidis, chairman of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party.
The White House has said Trump never told the Postal Service to change its operations.
NOT TENSE EVERYWHERE
Security measures required for ballot drop boxes vary by state. In Montana, these receptacles must be staffed by at least two election officials, while in New Mexico they must be monitored by video, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Before 2020, eight states -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington -- had laws detailing how and where drop boxes could be used. 
Returning ballots this way proved popular: In Colorado, Oregon and Washington, more than half of mail ballots were returned either to a drop box or to an election office in the 2016 presidential election, according to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology survey. 
Drop boxes haven't been controversial in those states. 
""Both parties use it at a really high rate, so a lot of those tensions don't exist here,"" said Murphy Bannerman of Election Protection Arizona, a nonpartisan voting-rights group.

A military spokeswoman said members of a ""terrorist squad"" were hit by the gunfire but she had no details on their condition.
Palestinian health and municipal officials said Mohammad Hamdan, 16, was killed by Israeli forces and two other Palestinians were wounded. The Hamas Islamist militant group issued a statement mourning his death.
Imrad Zahran, chairman of the local council of Hamdan's village, said the three youths were near a road used by Jewish settlers when the soldiers shot them.
The military spokeswoman said the soldiers opened fire after spotting Palestinians carrying flammable material and preparing tyres which they planned to ignite and use to attack passing Israeli vehicles. 
Zahran said two of the Palestinians shot by the troops were treated in Palestinian hospitals and that the military, which had taken Hamdan away, later informed him that he had died of his wounds. A Palestinian health official also said Hamdan was killed.
The military spokeswoman said the shooting occurred at a spot where similar attacks against Israeli vehicles have been carried out in the past. 
Palestinians regard Jewish settlements, seen as illegal by most countries in the world, as a bid by Israel to exert permanent control over the West Bank and destroy their aspirations for statehood.
Israel has pledged to annex parts of the West Bank but suspended implementation at the United States' request as part of a normalisation deal with the United Arab Emirates last week. 
Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East War. Palestinians seek the territory for a future state that would include the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.

The Jazz Lounge En Counter bar reopened in late June, having shut down for several weeks after the government declared a nationwide state of emergency in April. 
But with revenues down 70% to 80% compared with pre-pandemic levels, the bar decided to step up efforts to ensure customers feel safer.

The conical, clear acrylic screens - which were demonstrated to Reuters by bar staff on a recent visit - hang from the ceiling and envelop the customers' head and shoulders, acting as a barrier between them and other drinkers, as well as servers. Employees said they, too, felt more protected.

Junta members met government ministry officials late on Wednesday to map out a return to stability, a day after detaining President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita in a coup that has rocked a country already in the grip of a jihadist insurgency and civil unrest.
It has also been condemned by international powers and regional organisations.
""I am Colonel Assimi Goita, president of the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP),"" Assimi, dressed in military fatigues, told reporters after the meeting.
""Following yesterday's event which led to the change of power we believed that it was our duty to state our position to the (ministries') general secretaries, so they may be able to work immediately.""

Crowds had poured into the streets of the capital on Tuesday to celebrate the coup. 
Little is known about the backgrounds of the junta's leadership, which includes several other colonels.
Wague read the statement early Wednesday morning that announced the military takeover, promising to organise national elections within a ""reasonable"" time. 
Late on Wednesday he said civil servants should also return to work from Thursday, and that the junta was taking ""all measures .. to protect the personnel and their belongings as well as their place of work.""
Condemnation of the coup has been widespread abroad, amid concerns it could disrupt a military campaign against jihadists linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State operating in northern and central Mali and West Africa's wider Sahel region. 
Heads of state from the 15 members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which suspended Mali and shut off its borders on Tuesday, are due to hold an extraordinary virtual session on Thursday to address the situation.

495,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","North Korean leader's sister is 'de facto second-in-command', South Korean lawmaker says","By Sangmi Cha and Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's intelligence agency believes that Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, is serving as his ""de facto second-in-command"" but has not necessarily been designated his successor, a South Korean lawmaker said on Thursday.
Believed to be in her early 30s, Kim Yo Jong is the leader's only close relative with a public role in politics, recently spearheading a new, tougher campaign to put pressure on South Korea.
Ha Tae-keung, an opposition party lawmaker on parliament's intelligence committee, told reporters that Kim was helping to run the regime with mandated authority from her brother.
""The bottom line is that Kim Jong Un still holds absolute power, but has turned over a bit more of his authority compared to the past,"" Ha said, following a closed-door briefing by the South's National Intelligence Service.
""Kim Yo Jong is a de facto second-in-command,"" Ha added in a transcript of remarks seen by Reuters.
More authority on economic and military policy has also been delegated to several other senior officials, although at a lower level, possibly to reduce strain on Kim Jong Un as well as help him avoid blame for any failures, Ha said.
Kim Yo Jong won fame ahead of her brother's 2019 summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Vietnam, when her efforts to ensure everything went well included holding an ashtray for the North Korean leader at a train station on his journey. 
Her prominence in the campaign against South Korea this year highlighted a substantive policy role that goes beyond being merely Kim's assistant, analysts say. 
She issued her first public statements to spray criticism at the neighbouring nation, and the North's state media portrayed her as playing a decision-making role. 
In July, she offered personal views on diplomacy with the United States in an unusual statement in state media, saying her brother had given her special permission to watch recordings of that country's Independence Day celebrations.
When rumours and speculation arose in April about Kim Jong Un's health, his sister was seen a possible placeholder to take over the family dynasty until one of Kim's children is old enough.
Kim Yo Jong has been absent, however, from several recent high-level meetings, such as a plenary gathering of the ruling Workers' Party on Wednesday, said NK News, a Seoul-based website that tracks North Korea.

That has stirred some speculation about a possible demotion.

Joseph James DeAngelo, 74, will be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole following three days of emotional hearings in which victims or their family members confronted him in open court. 
“What a gut punch it was that I had been brutally raped by a full-time police officer,” victim Gay Hardwick said, according to the Sacramento Bee newspaper. She was attacked in her San Stockton home in 1978 by an intruder who forced her to tie up her then-boyfriend first. 
""To learn that DeAngelo, who was sworn to serve and protect, used his skill set to terrorize and rape. Yes, that was staggering,"" Hardwick said.
The Golden State Killer remained a mystery, his crimes unsolved for decades until DeAngelo's arrest in Sacramento County on April 24, 2018.
Investigators tied DeAngelo to the crimes using a then-novel technique of tracing him using family DNA from commercial genealogy websites.
In June, DeAngelo admitted to 13 murders and 13 related rape charges between 1975 and 1986 as part of a plea deal with prosecutors sparing him from a potential death sentence. 
Prosecutors said the deal ensured that aging survivors and victims' relatives lived to see the case resolved, sparing them further legal proceedings likely to have dragged on for a decade. 
Besides the 13 murders, and 13 rape-related charges DeAngelo publicly admitted to dozens more rape cases for which the statute of limitations had expired. Prosecutors said he invaded 120 homes across 11 counties during his crime spree.

The serial killer, also known as the ""East Area Rapist"" and the ""Original Night Stalker,"" typically crept into his victims' bedrooms at night, tying them up, raping them, and stealing valuables.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 06:26AM ET</span>",Haiti's schools re-open but many parents now can't afford them,"By Andre Paultre and Sarah Marsh
PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti's school children missed class this year first due to months of violent unrest, then the coronavirus pandemic. Now, as schools are finally reopening, many parents can no longer afford it, raising the prospect hard-won gains in education could be lost.
""The deadline to pay is next Monday. Without paying, I won't be able to attend the class,"" said Nickerla Etienne, 16, through streams of tears, after being sent home from her private school in the capital, Port-au-Prince, for failing to pay up.
While the pandemic has disrupted education worldwide, the situation is especially acute in Haiti, where just an estimated two-thirds of adults can read and write.
""We've never seen a crisis quite on this scale before,"" said Beatrice Malebranche at United Nations children's agency UNICEF in Haiti.
Virtual schooling has been impossible for most in the Caribbean country where more than half the population lives on less than $3 per day and has little internet and television access.
Meanwhile, given the weakness of the Haitian state, suffering from years of unrest and mismanagement, and still struggling to recover from a devastating 2010 earthquake, four out of five schools in the Caribbean nation are private. 
And while fees are typically low, they have become unaffordable for many as the pandemic has worsened Haiti's already dire economic plight.
Even families whose children have scored coveted places at public schools are struggling just to buy them stationery or decent shoes. 
Outside of schooling, children risk entering the informal jobs sector, or worse, being drafted into Haiti's gangs. 
The education ministry has little firepower to tackle the problem, with it receiving 11% of the total budget down from 16%. The global average is 20% of total spending. 
Spokesman Miloody Vincent told Reuters it would provide financial aid to at least 50,000 of the most vulnerable families, which will not go far in the country of 11 million.
The situation is a setback after Haiti hiked its primary school attendance rate to 84% from 76% over the last decade, said Malebranche.
NO MONEY FOR TEACHERS
While coronavirus has left Haiti relatively unscathed healthwise, the education ministry has mandated that staff and pupils wear masks. Schools must provide hand washing, even if it is just a bucket of water.
The government has also ordered the most overcrowded schools divide up classes to ensure physical distancing and rotate each in shifts of two to three days a week, raising concerns over the fact they would provide fewer lessons per child.
Yet directors of five private schools in low-income areas visited by Reuters said only around half of their pupils had returned so far. Overcrowding is no longer a problem - school finances are.
""I haven't been able to pay teachers since March,"" said Leonard Turenne, director of the Pierre Fermat secondary school. ""The state promised us some financial aid but we haven't received anything yet.""
TRADING CHALK FOR FIREARMS
Some already underfinanced schools will likely close, with teachers switching to other professions, experts say.
Etienne's father, Jackson Dorceus, 53, used to be a teacher himself but in the 1990s switched to working as a bodyguard because his school had not paid him for a year. 
Yet although he ""traded chalk for firearms"", and his wife runs a parapharmacy, the economic situation is so bad they still cannot pay their daughter's fees.
The unrest last year financially ruined many businesses which were unable to get back on their feet before coronavirus hit, while double-digit inflation is ravaging household incomes and remittances are falling.
""Most our clients owe us money,"" said Dorceus, standing outside their corrugated iron one-room house. Like many parents, he said he would seek to negotiate the fees with the school, or failing that ask for church alms. 
Some parents who cannot afford to send their children to school now might send them next year - a practise that explains why so many Haitians are well into their twenties before they graduate high school. 
The risk though is the parents might never afford it.

Etienne, an eager student, dreams of becoming an air stewardess. For the time being though, she must content herself with selling popcorn from the front porch of her parents' shop.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran displayed a surface-to-surface ballistic missile on Thursday that Defence Minister Amir Hatami said had a range of 1,400 kilometres and a new cruise missile, ignoring U.S. demands that Tehran halt its missile programme.
""The surface-to-surface missile, called martyr Qassem Soleimani, has a range of 1,400 km and the cruise missile, called martyr Abu Mahdi, has a range of over 1,000 km,"" Hatami said in a televised speech.
Pictures of the missiles were shown on state TV, which it said was ""the newest Iranian cruise missile that will further strengthen Iran's deterrence power"". 
Soleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed in January in a U.S. strike on their convoy in Baghdad airport.
""Missiles and particularly cruise missiles are very important for us ... the fact that we have increased the range from 300 to 1,000 in less than two years is a great achievement,"" said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.
""Our military might and missile programmes are defensive.""
The announcement comes as Washington is pushing to extend a U.N.-imposed arms embargo against Iran, which is due to expire in October under Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. 
Tensions have been high between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when President Donald Trump pulled out the United States from the deal and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran. 
Washington says its aim is to force Tehran to agree a broader deal that puts stricter limits on its nuclear work, curbs its ballistic missile program and ends its regional proxy wars. Iran has rejected talks as long as U.S. sanctions remain in place.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday Trump has directed him to trigger 'snapback' - a return of all U.S. sanctions on Iran - at the U.N. Security Council in New York on Thursday, after the council rejected Washington's bid to extend Tehran's arms embargo.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has been accused of overseeing a fiasco over how grades have been awarded to teenagers who were unable to take their exams because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Exam board Pearson announced late on Wednesday that it would recalculate grades for BTECs, specialist work-related qualifications, just hours before students were due to receive their results.
Its decision came days after the government bowed to pressure from angry pupils, teachers and lawmakers and ditched an algorithm that had downgraded A-level results for almost 40% of school leavers last week, with those in disadvantaged areas more adversely affected. 
Students were told on Monday they would now be awarded the grade that their teachers had predicted for them based on past performance, and that process is also being adopted for younger pupils receiving their GCSE results on Thursday.
However, Pearson said that change meant it was now having to change its BTEC grades.
""We have become concerned about unfairness, including consistency with the approaches now being used for GCSE and A Levels,"" it said in a statement. 
Williamson has been accused of ignoring warnings that the grading system would lead to unfair results and both he and Johnson have been lampooned by the media for their handling of the issue. 
""Every step of this way there are problems you have to encounter and deal with, and we are dealing with them swiftly,"" schools minister Nick Gibb told BBC television. ""We're working, as I said, night and day to get these issues right.""
He echoed Williamson's apology for the uncertainty and confusion caused.
""Gavin Williamson was warned again and again about the problems with the grading algorithm, and each time, he did nothing,"" said Kate Green, the opposition Labour Party's education spokeswoman. ""This endless pattern of incompetence is no way to run a country.""

China's ambassador, Tang Songgen, was taking part in a traditional welcome ceremony ""at the cordial request of the local government and people, and out of respect for the culture and traditions of Kiribati"", Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing. 
Some people have tried to slander China over this incident, but their attempts to damage China's relationship with island nations will not succeed, Zhao said.
The grainy photograph that appeared on social media showed a man in a white shirt and grey trousers stepping on the backs of about 30 people lined up on the ground.
Tang said on social media he had made a trip to Kiribati's outer islands this month, after taking up his post when China resumed diplomatic relations late last year.
The photograph stirred controversy in the Pacific where China has been trying to expand its influence to the consternation of the United States and its old ally, Australia.
Kiribati's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. defence attaché in neighbouring Fiji took the opportunity to questioned Tang's behaviour.
""I simply cannot imagine any scenario in which walking on the backs of children is acceptable behaviour by an ambassador of any country (or any adult for that matter!),"" the diplomat, Commander Constantine Panayiotou, said on Twitter.
""Yet here we are thanks to China's ambassador to Kiribati."" 
In Taiwan, which lost Kiribati as a diplomatic ally to China last year, the foreign ministry said they were as shocked as everyone else at the picture.
""This is not the Kiribati we know, and we didn't know Kiribati had this kind of welcoming ceremony. Taiwan would not treat our allies and their people like this,"" said spokeswoman Joanne Ou.
China's nationalistic Global Times said the ""misrepresentation"" of the picture was aimed at damaging China's image.
Katerina Teaiwa, associate professor at Australian National University, said the picture reflected a traditional welcoming ceremony.
""Everyone should be less hysterical about this & more respectful towards the diversity of Pacific ways, islanders should have cultural self-determination,"" Teaiwa said on Twitter.

Supreme court judges are members of political parties and rely on them to be elected and re-elected, potentially exposing them to political pressure. A referendum campaign, led by entrepreneur Adrian Gasser, seeks to reform the system.
But, ahead of a binding referendum on the issue required under the Swiss system of direct democracy, some legal experts and now the government have criticised the campaign's idea of drawing lots from a pool of suitable candidates.
""(The appointment by lottery) is based on chance rather than a democratic election and would thus be an outlier in the Swiss legal system,"" the government said in a statement, asking parliament to reject the initiative.
The government said the current system, in which both houses of parliament elect judges for the court based in Lausanne, had proved its worth and also broadly mirrored the parties' relative strength in parliament.
Legal experts, including the Swiss judges' association, have long called for an overhaul of the way supreme court judges are appointed. 
The issue came to the fore last year when the supreme court ruled in favour of releasing client data from Swiss bank UBS to the French tax authorities, something the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) had strongly opposed.

The SVP was furious because the judge who tipped the scales in the 3-2 vote was one of its paid-up members. It threatened not to back his re-election.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Central European nations should unite to preserve their Christian roots as western Europe experiments with same-sex families, immigration and atheism, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Thursday.
Orban, a nationalist who has been in power for more than a decade, was speaking at an event to inaugurate a monument commemorating the Treaty of Trianon, which was signed after World War One and led to Europe's maps being re-drawn.
""Western Europe had given up on ... a Christian Europe, and instead experiments with a godless cosmos, rainbow families, migration and open societies,"" Orban said in a speech. 
He said the monument, a 100-metre long and 4-metre wide ramp carved into a street near Budapest's parliament building, was a call to central European nations to strengthen their alliance and rally around what he called the ""Polish flagship"".
In Poland, Hungary's main ally in central Europe, the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has pursued a socially conservative platform since coming to power in 2015 and made opposing ""LGBT ideology"" a key plank of its electoral strategy.
In Hungary, rights groups say hostility to LGBT+ people has increased since Orban won a third term in 2018. 
Orban himself had rarely criticised rainbow, or same-sex families, but Parliament's speaker - a long-time ally of Orban - had equated gay adoption with paedophilia.
Last weekend, two rainbow flags were torn down from municipals buildings in Budapest, prompting a warning from the U.S. Embassy that neo-Nazi groups should not be tolerated.
Many Hungarians still view the Treaty of Trianon as a national trauma because it took away two-thirds of the country's territory and left millions of ethnic Hungarians living in what are now Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, Austria and Ukraine.
On the walls of the monument, visitors can read the names of more than 12,000 villages and towns that were part of Hungary before the treaty. A granite block split into several parts encloses a flame.

Orban has granted citizenship to ethnic Hungarians living beyond the country's borders and also the right to vote in elections as part of his efforts to restore a battered sense of national pride. Their votes helped Orban secure a strong majority in parliamentary elections.

Taiwan has been urging its people to be alert for what officials call ""omnipresent infiltration"" from China, ranging from Beijing-backed media campaigns to cyberattacks, against the island that China considers its territory.
This week, Taiwan said hacking groups connected to the Chinese government had attacked at least 10 government agencies and some 6,000 email accounts of government officials in an ""infiltration"" to steal important data. 
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian poured scorn on the allegation.
""The criticisms from the Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) authorities are malicious slander, pure and simple,"" Zhao told reporters, referring to Taiwan's ruling party. ""China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity, and is one of the victims of hacking attacks.""
The Chinese government routinely denies involvement in hacking and says it punishes those who do it.
The hacking allegations come during a period of growing strains between the island and China.

China has stepped up its military activity near Taiwan and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Hafsa was married off at 13 by her father to a man who paid $100. She and her mother say she was beaten and raped for two years before they convinced him to divorce her. 
""The man just slept with me, beating me always,"" she said, sitting by her mother, who clutches her daughter tightly. ""I regretted I was born.""
There is no law mandating a minimum age for marriage in Somalia. A bill introduced in parliament this month by a presidential ally caused a storm of criticism from lawmakers when they realised it would legalise marriage at puberty - as early as 10 for some girls. 
Data from a government survey this year shows that nearly a third of girls are married before their 18th birthday - just under half of those before the age of 15.  
""Some families marry off their daughters to reduce their economic burden or earn income. Others may do so because they believe it will secure their daughters’ futures or protect them,"" said Dheepa Pandian, a spokeswoman from UNICEF, the United Nations' Children's Fund. 
Political turmoil in Somalia - the prime minister was sacked last month and elections due this year will likely be delayed - means it is unclear when parliament might vote on the bill. The Horn of Africa nation is also battling an Islamist insurgency. 
Many lawmakers, like legislator and human rights activist Sahra Omar Malin (OTC:MLLNF), reject the bill.
""Our constitution is based on Islam. It says the age of maturity is 18, this is the right age for voting or for a girl to marry,"" she said. 
Deputy speaker Abdiweli Mudeey, who presented the bill, did not return calls seeking comment but told lawmakers that it had been reviewed by clerics and ""this bill ... is the correct one based on Islam."" 
Nadifa Hussein, who runs three camps in the capital for families fleeing violence, shelters many abused and abandoned child brides. 
""Most women here were married at 13 and are divorced by the time they are 20,"" Hussein said. ""They have no one to feed them."" 
Among them is Sirad, a shy 16-year-old with two children. Her husband has left, but if he comes back she must welcome him, she said sadly.

""Who else wants me?"" she asked, covering her face. ""If you are thrown into a well and can't come out, the only option is to try to swim.""

The U.S. State Department notified Hong Kong on Wednesday that Washington had suspended or terminated three bilateral agreements with the semi-autonomous city following China's imposition of a sweeping national security law.
""China urges the U.S. to immediately correct its mistakes,"" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a news briefing on Thursday as he announced the suspension of the agreement on legal assistance.
The agreement, signed in 1997 before Britain returned Hong Kong to China, specified that the United States and Hong Kong governments would help each other in criminal matters such as transferring people in custody or searching and confiscating proceeds of crime. 
The U.S. State Department said earlier the three agreements the United States ended covered ""the surrender of fugitive offenders, the transfer of sentenced persons, and reciprocal tax exemptions on income derived from the international operation of ships"".
The U.S. decision followed President Donald Trump's order last month to end Hong Kong’s special status under U.S. law to punish China for what he called “oppressive actions” against the former British colony.
Trump signed an executive order that he said would end the preferential economic treatment for the city following the imposition of the draconian new security law.
The national security law punishes anything China considers secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison and has drawn criticism from Western countries that worry the law will end the freedoms promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule.
Beijing and the Hong Kong government have defended the law as necessary to restore order and preserve prosperity after months of at times violent anti-government protests last year.
Hong Kong has become another contentious issue between China and the United States, whose relations were already strained by differences over trade, China's claims in the South China Sea and its treatment of its Muslim Uighur minority.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai police said on Thursday they have arrested four anti-government activists over a July 18 protest that triggered a wave of student-led demonstrations demanding a new constitution and elections.
Three of the activists were arrested late on Wednesday and a rapper who performed at the protest was detained early on Thursday, as police step a crackdown on a countrywide movement behind the biggest rallies seen in Thailand since a 2014 military coup.
Demonstrators are seeking the resignation of the military-backed government, an end to the harassment of its critics and a new constitution and parliamentary elections, in a rejection of polls held last year that saw coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha remain prime minister. 
Among other offences, the four activists are charged with breaching internal security laws and for defying an emergency decree that banned public gatherings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
The authorities have already issued arrest warrants for 15 people in connection with the July 18 rally, police said.
""The arrests that are taking place is based on the warrants,"" deputy police spokesman Krisana Pattanacharoen told reporters.
He said the arrests had been made at certain times ""so there would be no chaos"".
A small group of supporters of the detainees gathered overnight at a Bangkok police station where the activists were held.
The Assembly for the Poor, a non-governmental organisation whose secretary-general is among those detained, issued a statement on Thursday demanding the immediate and unconditional release of all activists.
It threatened a lengthy protest in Bangkok if their demands were not met.

Their arrests come after police detained human rights lawyer Anon Nampa on Wednesday for a speech he made at another protest calling for the reform of the powerful monarchy. It was the second time he has been arrested this month.

(Reuters) - Police declared a riot on Wednesday for a second night in the U.S. city of Portland after demanding the breakup of a protest near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) building, calling it an unlawful assembly.
Federal officers fired pepper balls to disperse a crowd of about 200 protesters in the city's south, and set off a few smoke devices, the Oregonian newspaper said, adding that a rock was thrown and a window of the building broken. 
The protest began in the Elizabeth Caruthers Park before demonstrators marched towards the ICE building, media said.
""All persons near SW Bancroft St and SW Bond Ave must disperse,"" police had said on Twitter, warning the marchers that they faced arrest and the use of tear gas, crowd control agents and impact weapons if they did not comply. 
Police had also declared a riot on Tuesday after protesters lit fires, threw rocks and smashed windows at county government offices in another location, in violence that led to two arrests and a minor injury for an officer.
Protests against racism and police brutality have swept the United States since the death on May 25 of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The Portland protests are among those that have erupted in arson and violence, with federal officers sent into the northwestern city repeatedly clashing with crowds targeting its federal courthouse.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr drew fire from Democratic lawmakers this month for sending federal officers to disperse protesters in the city.

511,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>","Ex-chief of Mexico's Pemex accuses former presidents, officials of graft","By Adriana Barrera
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An ex-chief executive of Petroleos Mexicanos accused former presidents, ministers, lawmakers, political aides and a journalist of corruption in testimony leaked on Wednesday that is aimed at proving he is innocent of graft charges.
Emilio Lozoya, one-time boss of the state-run oil company known as Pemex, has become the centerpiece of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's drive to expose corruption he says was rampant in past governments before he took office in 2018.
Lozoya, who was extradited from Spain last month to face trial for taking bribes and money laundering, has sought to deflect blame by accusing former president Enrique Pena Nieto and his ex-finance minister, Luis Videgaray, of instructing him to pay bribes for electoral ends and buy votes in Congress.
Set out in a written statement by Lozoya, those accusations were relayed by Attorney General Alejandro Gertz last week. 
A photocopy of Lozoya's statement began circulating widely among the media in Mexico on Wednesday, prompting the attorney general's office to say it had not leaked what it described as ""the copy of his denunciation"".
In a statement, Lozoya's lawyers said they took no responsibility for the document attributed to him. Barred from leaving Mexico, Lozoya is awaiting trial at an undisclosed location under the auspices of authorities.
In the 63-page declaration, which was seen by Reuters, Lozoya denounced former presidents Felipe Calderon and Carlos Salinas for ""acts possibly constituting crimes"" alongside Pena Nieto, Videgaray and more than a dozen others.
With varying degrees of detail, Lozoya alleged officials and lawmakers had taken bribes, received illicit payments and otherwise engaged in corruption over several years, some of which were before he took the reins at Pemex in 2012.
Many have already publicly rejected the accusations.
Those he accused include ex-senators, two of whom are now serving as state governors, three more former finance ministers, and congressional aides.
Calderon, Lozoya said, oversaw corruption in his 2006-2012 administration, pointing to an ethane supply deal struck between Pemex and a consortium led by Brazilian firm Braskem that Lopez Obrador has condemned as a rip-off for the state.
Braskem has denied any wrongdoing.
Salinas, who was president from 1988 to 1994, had engaged in lobbying to get lucrative business for his son, Lozoya alleged.
Among the ex-finance ministers was Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, who in 2016 initially succeeded Lozoya at Pemex.
Gonzalez on Twitter rejected the accusations, calling them a bid for vengeance against him because he had in 2017 denounced irregularities at Pemex under Lozoya's stewardship.
Jose Antonio Meade, another former finance minister who was the 2018 presidential candidate for Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party, also firmly rejected Lozoya's allegations on Twitter, as did the third, Ernesto Cordero.
Lourdes Mendoza, a journalist whom Lozoya accused of belonging to a corrupt section of the press providing favorable coverage for the last government in exchange for payments, also denounced his claims and said on Twitter she would sue him. 
Neither Pena Nieto or Videgaray has commented publicly on the allegations but previously they denied any wrongdoing. Calderon has dismissed the claims and challenged Lozoya to produce evidence. 

Salinas could not be immediately reached for comment.

VACAVILLE, Calif. (Reuters) - A firefighting helicopter pilot was killed in a crash, and dozens of homes burned in California on Wednesday as hundreds of lightning-sparked blazes forced tens of thousands of people to flee their dwellings.
Nearly 11,000 lightning strikes were documented during a 72-hour stretch this week in the heaviest spate of thunderstorms to hit California in over a decade, igniting 367 individual fires. Almost two dozen of them have grown into major conflagrations, authorities said.
Multiple fires raced through northern California's drought-parched wine country, shutting down Interstate 80 at Fairfield, about 35 miles (56 km) southwest of Sacramento, as flames leapt across the highway, trapping motorists caught in a hectic evacuation. 
Four residents whose communities were overrun by flames hours earlier in the same area suffered burns but survived, though the severity of their injuries was not immediately known, said Will Powers a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire).
He said thousands of residents were under mandatory evacuation orders in four-county area stricken by a cluster of nine wind-driven fires collectively dubbed the LNU Complex, which were triggered by lightning on Monday.
In central California, a helicopter was on a water-dropping mission in Fresno County about 160 miles (258 km) south of San Francisco when the aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, a private contractor, CalFire said. 
The LNU complex of fires burned largely unchecked across some 46,000 acres (18,615 hectares) of hills and mountains around Fairfield and the neighboring town of Vacaville late Tuesday and early Wednesday. At least 50 homes and other structures were destroyed and another 50 damaged, CalFire said.
Wearing a singed nightgown, Diane Bustos said her husband abandoned their car as it caught fire and then blew up on the west side of Vacaville early Wednesday. She lost both her shoes while she and her family ran for their lives. 
""I made it, God saved me,"" Bustos told local television station KPIX.
There were social media accounts of people trapped in the blaze, but CalFire's Powers said authorities had no reports of missing persons.
A Reuters reporter saw dozens of burned-out homesteads and houses in the Vacaville-Fairfield area, dead livestock among torched properties and some animals wandering loose.
""We are experiencing fires the like of which we haven't seen in many, many years,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom told a news conference, adding he had requested 375 fire engines from out of state to assist in battling the blazes. He declared a statewide fire emergency on Tuesday.
The last time California experienced dry lightning storms of such devastating proportions was in 2008, said CalFire spokesman Scott Maclean.
Fanned by ""red-flag"" high winds, the fires are racing through vegetation parched by a record-breaking heat wave that began on Friday. Meteorologists have said the extreme heat and lightning storms were both linked to the same atmospheric weather pattern - an enormous high-pressure area hovering over America's desert Southwest. 

The largest group of fires, called the SCU Lightning Complex, had scorched at least 85,000 acres some 20 miles east of Palo Alto, while a third cluster, the CZU August Lightning Complex, grew to more than 10,000 acres and forced evacuations around 13 miles south of Palo Alto.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is eyeing the sale of stealthy F-35 fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates in a side agreement to the UAE's overtures to Israel, an industry insider who was part of the dialogue with government officials said on Wednesday.
A sale, which could reduce Israel's military advantage in the Middle East, would come after Israel and the UAE said last week they would normalize diplomatic ties and forge a broad new relationship under an accord that U.S. President Donald Trump helped broker. 
At a news conference on Wednesday, Trump said the UAE was interested in buying F-35 fighter jets made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), which Israel has used in combat.
""They'd like to buy F-35's, we'll see what happens, it's under review.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, citing a need to maintain Israeli military superiority in the region, said on Tuesday his country would oppose any U.S. F-35 sales to the UAE.
Any F-35 sale could take years to negotiate and deliver, giving a new U.S. presidential administration ample time to halt the deal. Poland, the most recent F-35 customer, purchased 32 of the jets, but will not receive its first delivery until 2024. Any sale would also need congressional approval. 
The industry source said the prospective jet sale was arranged with the help of Trump senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner. 
The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The potential F-35 deal was first reported by Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
The United States guarantees that Israel receives more advanced American weapons than Arab states, giving it what is labeled a ""Qualitative Military Edge"" over its neighbors.
Under the accord with the UAE, Israel agreed to suspend its planned annexation of areas of the occupied West Bank. The agreement also firms up opposition to regional power Iran, which the UAE, Israel and the United States view as the main threat in the Middle East.

President Jair Bolsonaro's veto, barring pay rises for civil servants in return for disbursing 60 billion reais ($11 billion) of aid to states and local authorities, will now be voted on in the lower house on Thursday.
Speaking to reporters in Brasilia, Guedes said overturning the veto could see local governments take funds away from health spending and channel them towards public sector salaries. As much as 20 billion reais could be ""lost"", Guedes said.
""To take money from health and allow it to be turned into a salary increase for civil servants is a crime against the country,"" Guedes told reporters in Brasilia, according to footage on news website G1.
A visibly irate Guedes repeatedly called the ruling ""terrible"", a ""disaster"" and an ""extremely bad signal"" from the Senate just as Brazil is trying to get both the health crisis and the public finances under control.
""Let's hope the Chamber (of Deputies) saves the day,"" he said.
Brazilian financial markets have become increasingly rattled in recent weeks over growing fiscal concerns, fearing the government will struggle next year to rein in the record budget deficit and debt accrued this year due to the coronavirus crisis.

The Brazilian real this week hit its lowest against the dollar in three months, and market-based interest rates and spreads widened to their highest in three months.

Another story in the Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, cited Wuhan residents as saying the pool party reflected the city's success in its virus-control efforts.
While the coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, strict lockdown measures that paralysed the Chinese economy earlier this year have kept its spread in check.
China on Thursday reported its fourth straight day of zero locally transmitted coronavirus infections. 
The stories come after a World Health Organization epidemiologist warned earlier this week that people, especially the young, are not invincible to the pandemic, despite their wishes to live normal lives.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Russia and China not to disregard the reimposition of all United Nations sanctions on Iran, which President Donald Trump has directed him to trigger at the U.N. Security Council in New York on Thursday.
Pompeo will meet with Indonesia's U.N. Ambassador Dian Triansyah Djani - council president for August - to submit a complaint about Iran's non-compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal, even though Washington quit the accord in 2018.
The nuclear deal between Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States aimed to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief. That accord is enshrined in a 2015 Security Council resolution.
In response to what the United States calls its ""maximum pressure"" campaign of unilateral sanctions - a bid to get Iran to negotiate a new deal - Tehran has breached central limits of the 2015 pact, including on its stock of enriched uranium.
Diplomats say the so-called sanctions snapback process will be messy as Russia, China and other countries question the legality of the U.S. move given that Washington itself is no longer complying with what Trump called the ""worst deal ever.""
Given questions over the U.S. move, diplomats said Russia, China and other countries are likely to simply ignore it and not reimpose the sanctions on Iran. 
When asked if the United States would target Russia and China with sanctions if they refuse to reimpose the U.N. measures on Iran, Pompeo told Fox News on Wednesday: ""Absolutely.""
""We have already done that, where we have seen any country violate ... the current American sanctions, we've held every nation accountable for that. We'll do the same thing with respect to the broader U.N. Security Council sanctions as well,"" he said. 
The United States had threatened to use the sanctions snapback provision in the nuclear deal after it lost a bid in the Security Council on Friday to extend an arms embargo on Tehran, which is due to expire in October.
Pompeo said it was unfortunate that the European members of the council abstained on the U.S. attempt to extend the arms embargo and that the move ""makes the European people less safe.""
""They just are wedded to this crazy nuclear deal, they're trying to hang on to it,"" he said. 
Once Pompeo submits the complaint about Iran to the Security Council, the body has 30 days to adopt a resolution to extend sanctions relief for Tehran or else the measures will automatically snap back. Any attempt to extend the sanctions relief would be vetoed by the United States.

Pompeo will also meet with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday.

Under the accord, which Trump helped broker, Israel agreed to suspend its planned annexation of areas of the occupied West Bank. The agreement also firms up opposition to regional power Iran, which the UAE, Israel and the United States view as the main threat in the Middle East.
In Saudi Arabia's first official comment since the agreement was announced, its foreign minister said on Wednesday the Sunni kingdom remained committed to peace with Israel on the basis of a 2002 Arab Peace Initiative.
Saudi Arabia, which does not recognize Israel, drew up the initiative by which Arab nations offered to normalize ties with Israel in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in 1967.
Earlier in the news conference, Trump called the UAE-Israel accord a good deal and said ""countries that you wouldn't even believe want to come into that deal."" He did not name any other countries besides Saudi Arabia.
Trump also said the UAE was interested in buying F-35 jets made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co, which Israel has used in combat.

""They have the money and they would like to order quite a few F-35s,"" Trump said.

DENVER (Reuters) - The mother of a young Black man who died after being placed in a chokehold by police in Aurora, Colorado, has canceled a planned march to commemorate the one-year anniversary of his death, saying she will not be “celebrating” the tragedy.
Sheneen McClain wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that she could no longer bear hearing protest chants of ""I can't breathe"" - words her son, Elijah, 23, repeatedly uttered during his fatal struggle with police. She said that slogan has become so painful to her it amounted to ""emotional abuse.""
“It’s not okay to repeat my son’s dying words because it’s all you think you can do ... that hurts me,” the mother said in the posting calling off a march that had been set for Sunday. 
A separate rally honoring Elijah McClain and other African-Americans slain by law enforcement will go on as scheduled on Saturday at the state capitol in nearby Denver, organizers said.
Last week, the McClain family filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court against Aurora police officers who applied a carotid chokehold on Elijah McClain, and paramedics who injected him with the powerful sedative ketamine.
Elijah McClain was approached and subdued by three policemen on Aug. 24, 2019, responding to a report he was acting suspiciously, though he had committed no crime. He went into cardiac arrest after the encounter and died at a hospital days later.
Local prosecutors declined to file charges against police or paramedics, citing an autopsy listing the cause of death as undetermined.
The autopsy said that combined with the chokehold, ketamine could have contributed to his death. The family's lawsuit disputes that he met criteria for injection with the drug. 
Following a public outcry, Colorado’s attorney general launched two investigations, and the U.S. Justice Department has initiated a civil rights inquiry.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican officials and border town residents criticized U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday for threatening to levy a tax on cars crossing into the United States to fund his signature border wall.
    The mayor of Ciudad Juarez, Armando Cabada, slammed Trump's proposed car tax as a political stunt aimed at garnering support ahead of the U.S. election in November.
    ""It was an issue that gave him votes in the last election, and now he's using it again, in a desperate manner, to try to secure these same votes,"" said Cabada, whose city lies across from the Texas city of El Paso.
    About 73 million personal vehicles crossed from Mexico into the United States last year, according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, an average of 200,000 cars every day.
    Trump made the suggestion during a speech in Yuma, Arizona, on Tuesday, in which he vowed Mexico is ""100 percent"" paying for the wall. 
    ""They going to pay at the border...cars going through. We're going to do a toll,"" he said.
    Cuidad Juarez resident Hector Escobado accused Trump of misrepresenting the plan, saying that instead of forcing Mexico to pay, the toll would tax U.S. citizens like himself.
    ""Many of us are U.S. citizens who live here in Mexico and cross back and forth almost every day. He would be charging us,"" he said.
    The thousands of Mexicans and dual citizens who cross into the United States daily include essential workers who help keep U.S. hospitals running amid the pandemic.
    During his speech Tuesday, Trump also reiterated his previous threats to tax the remittances sent by millions Mexicans living in the United States to their family members at home. 

    Mexico received $3.54 billion in remittances in June, the second-highest level since records began in 1995.

In a change from previous forecasts, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said a hurricane warning was in effect in an area including the resorts of Los Cabos and the town of Todos Santos.
""The center of Genevieve is forecast to pass near or just west of the Baja California peninsula ... hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane warning area beginning tonight and continuing into Thursday,"" the NHC said.
A tropical storm warning is in effect for the west coast of the Baja California peninsula from north of Todos Santos to Cabo San Lazaro.
The NHC warned that heavy rainfall from Genevieve may lead to life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides across portions of the far southern end of Baja California Sur through Thursday.
The storm is also expected to produce swells that are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Baja California Sur's civil protection authority said a lifeguard and a woman drowned in heavy seas at Cabo San Lucas and added it was concerned about the forecasts for downpours.
The civil protection agency said the state was prepared for power outages and ready to keep attending to coronavirus patients hooked up to hospital ventilators.
Currently a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, Genevieve is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches with isolated totals of 10 inches across portions of the southern end of Baja California Sur state.

Genevieve is forecast to gradually weaken over the next couple of days but is still expected to remain a strong hurricane while it passes west of the southern Baja California peninsula, the NHC said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There is no more foreign money for a Lebanese leadership that enriches itself and spurns the popular will, a top U.S. official said on Wednesday, saying Lebanon had hit ""rock bottom"" with its Aug. 4 port explosion and must now enact profound reforms.
Undersecretary of State David Hale made the comments a week after visiting Lebanon following the blast that killed more than 172 people, injured 6,000, left 300,000 homeless and destroyed swathes of Beirut https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-security-blast-skyline/gazing-over-wasteland-beirutis-mourn-lost-lady-of-the-world-idUSKCN25F1LZ, compounding a deep financial crisis.
""They (the Lebanese people) see rulers who use the system in order to enrich themselves and to ignore popular demands,"" Hale said. ""That era is over. There is no more money for that. They are at rock bottom and sooner or later, I believe, that the leadership will appreciate the fact that it is time to change.""
""And if not, I am convinced that the public will increase the pressure on them,"" Hale added in a conference call in which he laid out a long list of needed policy changes, including carrying out fiscal and economic reforms, ending endemic corruption, improving transparency, addressing an inadequate electrical system and carrying out an audit of the central bank.
Western officials have conveyed to Lebanese leaders that Western donors would not bail out Lebanon without fundamental reforms but that message had been largely met with disappointing responses, a U.N. official said earlier this week.
""What happened at the port (is) bad enough, but in many ways it's symptomatic of larger problems in Lebanon,"" Hale said and added: ""We can't fix that from the outside. Lebanese leaders have to demonstrate the political will and the commitment to do that and that was my main message.""
Asked about Hezbollah's role in any potential government, Hale said Washington has in the past dealt with Lebanese governments with a Hezbollah component in it and that it would examine the circumstances if that would again be the case.
""Reforms are contrary to the interests of all the status quo leaders and that very much includes Hezbollah, which today is perceived as a big part of the problem,"" he said.
Hezbollah has faced growing criticism for its perceived failure to deliver on promised reforms since winning a parliamentary majority with its allies in 2018. It is seen as protecting a corrupt political class that has driven Lebanon into the ground https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-tribunal-hezbollah-analysis/lebanons-hezbollah-got-power-but-lost-the-country-idUSKCN25F1P4.

The government - nominated by Hezbollah and its allies after the previous administration led by Saad al-Hariri, son of the slain PM, was toppled by a civic uprising last October - resigned over the Aug. 4 blast.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The new chief whip in Congress for Brazil's president said on Wednesday he is confident President Jair Bolsonaro's increased popularity in recent polls will help him push through tax reform and advance bills on bankruptcies and the autonomy of the central bank.
Congressman Ricardo Barros added the far-right leader's support for opening of the economy will benefit Brazil in the future despite the current rise in the country's reported COVID-19 cases and deaths.
""He has behaved adequately in the pandemic. His position will be proven correct with time,"" he said in an interview.
A poll last week showed Bolsonaro's government had its highest approval rating since he took office last year, with a plurality of 37 percent of those surveyed viewing his government as great or good. The findings come amid more than 100,000 reported deaths from COVID-19 in Brazil, which is now the world's second-worst coronavirus outbreak. [nL1N2FG0P0]
Bolsonaro has faced criticism from health experts for rejecting social distancing to curb the pandemic.
Barros, a former health minister of the center-right Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, was picked by Bolsonaro as the government's leader in Congress in an effort to build a stronger coalition to help him govern.
Providing funds to fight coronavirus, including emergency payments for the country's poorest to reduce the impact of the economic crisis the pandemic brought, was fundamental in gaining support for Bolsonaro's government, Barros said.
But those payments are temporary, and Bolsonaro will not be able to count on them to help him get re-elected in 2022, Barros said. To win another term he has to convince Brazilians he can govern well, meeting fiscal goals and delivering social services.
""The president will not be re-elected based on the emergency relief payments. There aren't enough resources for that,"" he said.
Bolsonaro plans to unify Brazil's social programs into one initiative called Renda Brasil (Income Brazil), a program that officials say will prevent people from getting more than one payment and others none. Barros expects this to be enacted before the end of this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations has been accused by some of its staff of racism after it issued a survey that included a question asking how they identify themselves, and offered 'yellow' among the possible responses.
The 'U.N. Survey on Racism' was sent to thousands of staff on Wednesday. An email accompanying the survey said it was being carried out as part of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' ""campaign to eradicate racism and promote dignity.""
But the first question, on how staff identify themselves, itself reflected an historic Western racist view of Asians by listing 'yellow' as an option, several U.N. staffers told Reuters. Other categories offered were black, brown, white, mixed/multi-racial and any other. 
""The first question is insane, deeply offensive and hard to fathom how in an organization as diverse as the United Nations this question was approved for release in a system-wide survey,"" said one U.N. staff member, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the survey would be ""taken off-line and revised appropriately taking into account the legitimate concerns"" that had been expressed.
""We acknowledge the need to formulate these categories with greater sensitivity and will take immediate steps to rectify this,"" Dujarric said. 
Erica Foldy, an associate professor at the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, said the use of the term was not acceptable.
""The term 'yellow' to refer to people of Asian descent is a slur. It should not be used, period. At the same time, it is useful to remember that language related to race is complex and always in flux,"" she said.
""Recently Brown, which had been considered something of a slur (though perhaps never as problematic as yellow) has come into broad use. But I don't see that happening with 'yellow',"" Foldy said. 

Organizations and companies have been under increasing pressure to address racism in the wake of global protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a Black American who died in May after a white police officer knelt on his neck.

A rarely used status red wind warning is in place for the southern county of Cork from 9 p.m. until midnight on Wednesday, with an orange wind warning in place for the other counties in the south and west of the country.
A red warning means there is the potential for widespread gusts of wind in excess of 130 km per hour (80 miles per hour).
The areas likely to be hit hardest are popular with holidaymakers, whose numbers have increased this year as people avoid foreign travel because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The authorities have urged people in mobile holiday homes or on campsites in parts of southwest Cork to seek shelter or find alternative accommodation.
""People should take Storm Ellen seriously - if you're in a campsite or caravan park, go home or prepare appropriately,"" Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney said on Twitter.
The unseasonal storm comes as the country's businesses struggle with the fallout from a surge in coronavirus cases, which led the government to significantly tighten its nationwide restrictions on activity on Tuesday.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - One of Mali's most influential power brokers, Mahmoud Dicko, will withdraw from politics, his spokesman said, after a meeting on Wednesday with leaders of a military coup who have promised to oversee elections within a ""reasonable"" time.
President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita resigned and dissolved parliament on Tuesday after the mutineers detained him at gunpoint, further rocking a country that is in the grip of a jihadist insurgency and civil unrest.
Fearing Keita's fall after nearly seven years in power could destabilise the Sahel region, the African Union and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) both suspended Mali.
As investors ditched shares in Mali-based gold mining companies, the mood in the capital Bamako was calm throughout the day and junta leaders urged people and officials to return to life as normal.
They met Dicko, a Salafist preacher who electrified protesters during anti-Keita demonstrations in recent weeks that drew tens of thousands of people.
After the meeting, a spokesman for Dicko said he had decided to withdraw from politics.
Although no further details were shared, the move suggests at least part of the opposition movement is satisfied with the coup orchestrators' promise to return to democratic practices.
A spokesman for the mutineers, which call themselves the National Committee for the Salvation of the People, earlier said they were not seeking power.
""We are keen on the stability of the country, which will allow us to organise general elections ... within a reasonable time limit,"" Colonel Ismael Wague said on state television.
The mutineers have denied reports of casualties from Tuesday's unrest, but human rights group Amnesty International said it had documented the death of four people, while 15 more were wounded by bullets.
A Malian security source identified three of the other junta leaders who appeared alongside Wague as Colonels Sadio Camara, Malick Diaw and Modibo Kone. 
Wague described neighbouring armies, France's anti-jihadist Barkhane force and a U.N. peacekeeping mission as ""partners for stability and restoring security"".
STARK CHOICES
On Wednesday, the United Nations Security Council condemned the mutiny and urged the soldiers to release all government officials and return to their barracks.
The 15-member council had earlier been briefed by U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix, who told them the U.N.'s Mali mission ""remains committed to playing its mandated role ... but the country must swiftly regain a measure of institutional stability and Constitutional order.""
Michael Shurkin, a former CIA officer now with the Rand Corporation, said the upheaval risked distracting Malian forces from their fight against jihadists linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State and that international partners faced a stark choice. 
""The U.N., EUTM (European Union Training Mission) and French have spent billions. What now? Is the answer just to walk away?"" he asked.
Mali has struggled to regain stability since a Tuareg uprising in 2012 that was hijacked by Islamist militants. 
Keita, 75, was elected in 2013 following a coup the previous year, promising to bring peace and stability and fight corruption. He won a second five-year term in 2018.
Following months of protests over corruption allegations, at least 14 people were killed in July in demonstrations called by the M5-RFP opposition coalition. 
ECOWAS, which had sought to mediate between Keita and his opponents, said it planned to deploy a fresh mission to Mali to ensure a return to democracy and scheduled an extraordinary virtual session of heads of state for Thursday.
'HIS OWN FAULT'
Anti-government protesters had poured into Bamako late on Tuesday to cheer the mutineers.
""I am against coups, but they become necessary if leaders are inflexible. What happened to IBK (Keita) was his own fault,"" said 43-year-old motorcycle mechanic Namory Konate.
People and traffic circulated as normal on Wednesday, although many shops, banks and public buildings remained closed following looting.
Videos on social media had shown Malians running unchecked through luxury compounds in the city, including properties belonging to the justice minister and Keita's son.

Gold mining firms, including Mali's largest miner Barrick Gold (TO:ABX), said they were operating as usual and staff were safe, but traders sold shares because of the increased political risk.

Ambassador David Friedman's remarks to the newspaper followed a report on Tuesday in another Israeli daily, Yedioth Ahronoth, that Washington planned to sell F-35s to the UAE as part of the Gulf country's U.S.-brokered deal last week to normalise ties with Israel.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel would oppose any such sales to the UAE, citing a need to preserve Israeli military superiority in the region.
On Israel's Channel 13 TV, Israeli Education Minister Yoav Galant accused Netanyahu's political rivals of spreading false allegations that UAE purchase of F-35s, aircraft already in Israel's arsenal, was part of the normalisation deal.
The Jerusalem Post quoted Friedman as saying that while it was hypothetically possible the UAE would one day receive permission to buy F-35s, their manufacture and procurement ""would take many years"".
Friedman said that as the UAE seeks more advanced weaponry ""the QME process will kick in as it has before"", according to the newspaper.
He was referring to decades-old understandings under which Washington has refrained from Middle East arms sales that could blunt Israel’s ""qualitative military edge"". This has applied to the F-35, so far denied to Arab states.
In the Channel 13 interview, Galant said Israel and the United States had differed in the past over U.S. arms sales in the region.
""They sold the F-15 (fighter jet) to the Saudis years ago. We also didn't like that at the time,"" Galant said. 

""But all these years, the United States maintained our qualitative edge. That means, when others had the F-15e, we had the F-15i - a grade above,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will not seek the death penalty for two British members of an Islamic State execution squad nicknamed the ""Beatles,"" whose extradition the Justice Department is seeking, Attorney General William Barr said on Wednesday.
In a letter to Priti Patel, Britain's interior minister this week Barr said if Britain grants an extradition request for Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, U.S. prosecutors will not seek the death penalty and would not carry out executions if they were to be imposed. 
Barr said Kotey and Elsheikh are being held by the U.S. military in an unidentified overseas location after they were captured in 2019 but that it was becoming untenable to continue to hold them.
The pair were members of a four-strong group in Islamic State that was known as the Beatles because they were English speakers. The group is alleged to have detained or killed Western hostages in Syria, including U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. 
The Justice Department is asking British authorities to turn over evidence on Kotey and Elsheikh to allow them to be tried in the United States. 

Barr said if Britain did not turn over evidence by Oct. 15, the United States would turn over the men for prosecution in the Iraqi justice system.

The country's opposition-controlled National Assembly last week opened an investigation to determine the causes and consequences of the oil slicks that began washing up on the Caribbean coast of western Falcon state in early August.
""We project that the negative consequences on ecosystems and their components could last for 50 years or more,"" Julia Alvarez, a biologist with Venezuela's SVE ecological society, told reporters. 
Alvarez added that the area was also home to mollusks that likely would have died instantly on contact with the oil, threatening the livelihood of fishermen in the area at a time of severe economic contraction in Venezuela. 
Independent researchers and opposition lawmakers have said the spill likely originated from the El Palito oil refinery in nearby Carabobo state, citing satellite images showing slicks near the refinery in late July, days before oil began washing up on the coasts of Morrocoy national park. 
A report published by the SVE and Venezuela's Simon Bolivar University cited satellite images showing that the slick first appeared on July 22 near the refinery. Given its length of 5.6 km (3.5 miles) and width of 1.5 km, the researchers calculated it contained around 26,700 barrels of oil. 

Venezuela's environment ministry, known as the Ministry of Ecosocialism, has said it has managed to contain the spill and is working to clean up the affected area. But authorities have not commented on the spill's cause, nor on the quantity or type of hydrocarbon leaked.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Supporters of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi won all but a handful of declared seats in a newly created second chamber of parliament, official first round results and media reports showed on Wednesday.
Only about eight million of the more than 62 million registered voters turned up on Aug. 11-12 to cast their ballots in the election for the Senate, giving a voter turnout of 14.23%, Lasheen Ibrahim, head of the National Election Authority, said in a televised news conference.
Results also showed that the strongly pro-government Mostaqbal Watan Party was set to be the biggest party in the Senate, an advisory body without legislative powers established through a constitutional amendment approved last year,
The Senate will include 200 elected members and 100 presidential appointees.
One hundred members will be elected as individual candidates and 100 more from a closed-list system, where people vote for parties rather than individuals. 
A 100-member closed electoral list dominated by supporters of Sisi and led by Mostaqbal Watan won a third of the seats, Ibrahim said.
It was the only closed list submitted, although it included six members of two parties from an opposition coalition that opposed last year's constitutional changes.
The list got the support of more than 5% of voters across the country, the legal percentage needed to declare that it had won by acclamation, Ibrahim said.
Ibrahim on Wednesday announced the names of 74 candidates who won individual seats and said a runoff vote would take place on Sept. 8-9 to determine the winners of the remaining 26 individual seats.
Local media cited an election authority document showing that Mostaqbal Watan won 68 of the 74 determined individual seats. The party confirmed the number on its official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
The Republican People's Party, another pro-government party, secured five individual seats and only one seat went to an independent candidate, the document said.
Egypt's House of Representatives, the main parliamentary chamber, is also dominated by Sisi supporters.

Officials say the Senate will enhance political participation. But the build-up to the election was low key, which commentators attributed to the coronavirus pandemic, a lack of awareness about the new chamber, and voter apathy.

The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), in a statement disclosing Monday's accident, called for stepping up search and rescue capacity to respond to distress calls.
""Some 37 survivors, mainly from Senegal, Mali, Chad and Ghana, were rescued by local fishermen and later detained upon disembarkation,"" the statement said.
""They reported to IOM staff that 45 others, including five children, lost their lives when the vessel’s engine exploded off the coast of Zwara (Zuwahra),"" it said.
War-ravaged Libya is a major route for migrants seeking to reach Europe and now hosts an estimated 654,000 of them, often living in cramped conditions with little access to health care.
The latest shipwreck brings the death toll to at least 302 on the route so far this year, the U.N. agencies' statement said.
In recent months, hundreds of migrants have been stopped at sea and their vessels sent back to Libya despite the risk of violence there.
With Libyan state vessels taking responsibility for rescues in the absence of a European Union programme, more than 7,000 people have been returned to Libya this year, the statement said.
The IOM and UNHCR say Libya should not be classified as a safe port for migrants and that they should not have to disembark there. They want an alternative scheme to take people rescued or intercepted at sea to safe ports.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's Chrystia Freeland will no longer be in charge of spearheading diplomatic relations with the United States now that she is the new finance minister, three government sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had made Freeland his main U.S. go-between when he named her deputy prime minister after last year's election, with Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne handling all the other diplomatic files.
Now Champagne will also handle U.S. ties, sources said. 
""We're back in more of a traditional setup in terms of the relationship,"" said one of the sources. ""Obviously with any relationship as complex as the Canadian-U.S. one, by necessity, different ministers will be speaking to their counterparts.""
As foreign minister in Trudeau's previous government, Freeland had led Canada's hard-nosed renegotiation of a new North American trade deal, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Because of the long shared border and close economic ties, the United States is by far Canada's most crucial ally, and the relationship was often strained during the trade negotiations and a dispute over aluminum tariffs.
In September of 2018, President Donald Trump hinted he did not like Freeland, without naming her.
""We're very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada. We don't like their representative very much,"" Trump said.
Freeland will continue to support the prime minister in managing the U.S. relationship, a third government official said, ""particularly in the fight against the unfair and unjust U.S. aluminum tariffs"". 
Tensions erupted again earlier this month when Trump moved to reimpose 10% tariffs on some aluminum products, prompting Freeland to respond the next day with retaliatory tariffs.
Canada has not yet officially informed the United States of the change in Freeland's responsibilities, a source familiar with the matter said. 

""The most significant relationship we have with the United States is an economic one ... so she's still going to very much be there"" as finance minister, said Stephanie Carvin, an assistant professor of international relations Ottawa's Carleton University.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on two United Arab Emirates-based companies, the U.S. Treasury Department said, accusing them of providing material support to Iranian airline Mahan Air.
The Treasury in a statement said Parthia Cargo and Delta Parts Supply FZC provided key parts and logistics services for Mahan Air, which is blacklisted under U.S. measures to fight terrorism and proliferators of weapons of mass destruction.
The Treasury also slapped sanctions on Amin Mahdavi, a UAE-based Iranian national, for owning or controlling Parthia Cargo.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump plans this week to push for a reimposition of all United Nations sanctions on Iran, after the U.N. Security Council rejected Washington's earlier bid to extend an arms embargo on the country.
""The Iranian regime uses Mahan Air as a tool to spread its destabilizing agenda around the world, including to the corrupt regimes in Syria and Venezuela,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. 
""The United States will continue to take action against those supporting this airline,"" he added.
Wednesday's action freezes any U.S. assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. 
The Treasury said services provided by the two blacklisted companies help Mahan Air sustain its fleet and allow it to carry out activities in support of Tehran. These include transporting ""terrorists and lethal cargo to Syria"" in support of President Bashar al-Assad and recently transporting Iranian technicians and technical equipment to Venezuela, the department said.
Separately, criminal charges were filed against Parthia Cargo and Mahdavi on Monday by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. The charges relate to the alleged unlicensed re-export of U.S.-export controlled aircraft parts to Iran, the Treasury said.
An affidavit filed in court by an FBI agent to support the criminal charges alleges that Mahdavi, managing director of Parthia Cargo, in 2017 acknowledged to U.S. officials that he knew a U.S. government license was needed to ship U.S. aircraft parts to Iran. 
But Mahdavi went ahead and shipped an aircraft part to an Iranian air transport company without obtaining a license, the Justice Department said. It accused Mahdavi and Parthia Cargo of criminally conspiring with companies and individuals outside the United States, and falsely telling a U.S. parts supplier goods would not be shipped to Iran without U.S. government permission.

Tensions between Washington and Tehran have spiked since Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and began reimposing sanctions that had been eased under the accord.

The incident occurred on Aug. 14 but only came to light this week, amid a deluge of criticism on social media that the body was not removed and that the store did not close. 
Carrefour Brasil apologized on Wednesday, telling Reuters in a statement that its handling of the incident was inappropriate.
""The company erred in not closing the store immediately after what happened to await the funeral service, as well as in not finding the correct way to look after the body,"" it said.
According to Carrefour, the man was a sales manager who fell ill inside the store. First aid was given and an ambulance was called. After the man died, Carrefour said it ""followed guidelines to not remove the body from its place.""
The local subsidiary of France's Carrefour SA (OTC:CRRFY), one of the largest retail chains in Brazil, said it has now changed its guidelines to include the mandatory closure of the store in future.
""We apologize to the family and stand ready to support them in whatever way necessary,"" Carrefour said in its statement.
This is not the first controversy surrounding the way Carrefour handles incidents in its stores in Brazil. In 2018, a security guard at a store in the state of Sao Paulo killed a street dog after striking it with a metal bar, a case that caused revulsion on social media and with animal welfare groups.

It was the third incident this week in which gunmen targeted an anti-government political activist, after one activist was killed and four others had their car fired upon in a separate incident.
Reham Yacoub was gunned down on Wednesday by assault rifle brandishing gunmen on the back of a motorcycle, the sources told Reuters. She was activist in the local protest movement since 2018 and had led several women's marches.
The recent wave of violence begun when activist Tahseen Osama was assassinated on Friday, prompting a return of street demonstrations for three days in which security forces opened live fire on protesters who lobbed the governor's house with rocks and petrol bombs and blocked several main roads.
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi subsequently sacked the Basra police and national security chiefs on Monday and ordered an investigation into the violence which calmed protesters down.
Kadhimi took office in April, becoming the third Iraqi head of government in a chaotic 10-week period that followed months of deadly protests in the country, which has been exhausted by decades of sanctions, war, corruption and economic challenges.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is weighing sweeping changes to the country's social welfare system and a series of economic measures that will align Canada with ambitious climate goals, according to people familiar with the matter.
The plan to bolster the social safety net will especially help those hurt most by the pandemic and come after Trudeau replaced a fiscally cautious finance minister. 
""The prime minister wants to go big,"" said a government source, adding that Trudeau, 48, sees the moves as part of his legacy.
Trudeau replaced former Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who resigned on Monday, with close ally Chrystia Freeland. 
Trudeau said the pandemic had unmasked ""fundamental gaps"" in society and the country needed a long-term recovery plan that addressed issues head on.
""This is our chance to build a more resilient Canada, a Canada that is healthier and safer, greener and more competitive, a Canada that is more welcoming and more fair,"" he said after the cabinet shuffle. 
Trudeau said he would seek a confidence vote in parliament over his plan when the body reconvenes in September.
Cabinet minister and close Trudeau ally Dominic LeBlanc said the plan ""will contain a number of positive ideas that opposition parties have been talking about.""
These include measures on childcare, access to quality housing and an expanded employment insurance program,"" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp on Wednesday.
Trudeau took office in 2015 and was re-elected last year, with a minority government. The son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Trudeau has focused on boosting social programs, raising taxes on the highest earners and stressing the need to fight climate change. 
Canada's economy has been crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Trudeau's government has spent billions on support and other measures to alleviate the worst of the pandemic lockdown. But Ottawa has so far not mapped out a sweeping economic strategy.
""The taps are really going to be turned on,"" said a fiscally conservative Liberal concerned that spending could get out of hand. ""That's the biggest risk.""
Freeland said on Tuesday she wanted a green, fair and inclusive restart plan.
""She is a social interventionist activist, so she believes in the power of government and also believes in the redirection of funds to those who need it most,"" said one Liberal who has worked closely with Freeland. 
Canada's budget deficit this fiscal year is forecast to hit C$343.2 billion ($253.4 billion), the largest since World War Two.

Trudeau said he would not abandon fiscal sense even as he tries to balance economic inequities ""because we know government needs to be responsible in building the future.""

Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi described a pastoral letter written by the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops Conference last weekend as ""inappropriately prescriptive and grossly disrespectful"". 
The bishops' strongly worded letter said the country had a multi-layered crisis, including economic collapse, deepening poverty, corruption and human rights abuses.
Inflation running at more than 800% is the clearest sign of the worst economic crisis in over a decade and has evoked memories of hyperinflation under former president Robert Mugabe, whose 37-year rule was ended by an army coup in 2017.
Ziyambi said Harare authorities took offence to the bishop's description of the government, headed by Mugabe's replacement, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, as lacking the knowledge, skill or emotional stability to resolve Zimbabwe's political and economic problems.
""The statement constitutes an outright insult on the person of President E.D. Mnangagwa and his entire government, and is couched in language decidedly unbecoming of an institution such as the Catholic Church,"" said Ziyambi.
""Government is compelled to engage the Vatican in order to ascertain whether or not such statements reflect the official attitude of the Holy See towards Zimbabwe's leadership or whether these are merely the views of the various individuals concerned.""
Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo would meet the local Vatican representative, said Ziyambi.
Ziyambi denied there was a political crisis in Zimbabwe and said it was all social media hype.
But critics say several activists have been arrested, abducted or tortured for speaking against the government and accuse Mnangagwa of using the COVID-19 pandemic to stifle dissent.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a report in May, documented a drop in child vaccination rates since lockdowns were imposed, raising concern about outbreaks of other diseases such as measles.

The Central African oil producer is suffering a double economic shock linked to the coronavirus pandemic and a drop in the price of crude, which provides around three-quarters of state revenues.
Last Friday, Asue and his government tendered their resignation to Obiang, who said they had not done enough to help the country at a time of crisis. [nL8N2FH0CX]
At his swearing-in ceremony, Asue said he would form a new government that would fight impunity, the authorities said in an online statement.
Obiang, 78, has ruled the former Spanish colony since overthrowing his uncle in a 1979 coup, relying on repression of political opponents and the country's offshore oil riches.
This is Asue's third consecutive stint as premier since his first appointment in 2016.

The country's economy has struggled to recover from a recession caused by a 2014 slump in oil prices and is expected to contract by a further 5.5% in 2020, according to International Monetary Fund figures.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith pleaded guilty on Wednesday in federal court to falsifying a document as part of the bureau's early-stage probe into whether President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with the Russian government.
Clinesmith is the first person criminally charged in an investigation by John Durham, a federal prosecutor tapped to probe mistakes the FBI made when it sought a warrant to conduct surveillance on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
During a virtual hearing in the U.S. District Court in Washington, Clinesmith admitted to doctoring a CIA email the FBI used in 2017 when it applied to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to renew its application for a secret wiretap to monitor Page.
""At the time I believed that the information I was providing in the email was accurate, but I am agreeing that the information I inserted into the email was not originally there, and I inserted that information,"" Clinesmith said during the hearing.
In an August 2016 email, the CIA advised that Page, who is referenced in court documents as ""Individual #1,"" had been approved as an ""operational contact"" from 2008 to 2013.
When Clinesmith was later asked to confirm this information, he doctored a follow-up email from the CIA to make it appear as though Page was not an agency source, according to the charging documents.
Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz uncovered the doctored email and in December released a scathing report documenting 17 ""basic and fundamental"" errors and omissions in FBI surveillance warrant applications.
Trump's Republican allies have repeatedly pointed to that report as evidence of a wider conspiracy by ""deep state"" government actors to undermine Trump. There was no indication of a broad conspiracy in the charging documents filed against Clinesmith. 
U.S. District Judge James Boasberg set a sentencing date for Dec. 10.

While Clinesmith could face a statutory maximum of five years in prison, the U.S. sentencing guidelines in his case call for a range of zero to six months in prison, Boasberg said.

The agreement, signed by representatives of the two countries on July 21 and which became effective on July 30, concerns an area of land and sea near Syria's northern Latakia province, where the Russian-controlled Hmeimim air base is located. 
The territory will be used for a ""medical treatment and rehabilitation centre"" for Russian air force staff, the document said. 
The territory, comprising eight hectares of land and a further eight hectares of coastal waters, will be granted to Russia on a temporary basis and at no cost, the document said. 
Russia launched air strikes in Syria in 2015 and began cementing its permanent military presence in 2017, following a deal with the government in Damascus. 
Alongside the Hmeimim base, from which Russia launches air strikes in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Moscow also controls the Tartus naval facility in Syria, its only naval foothold in the Mediterranean, in use since the days of the Soviet Union.

To try to prevent a domestic resurgence of the coronavirus, Norway quarantines all travellers from countries with more than 20 confirmed new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population during the past two weeks.
The Nordic country earlier this month put on hold a plan to remove more coronavirus restrictions and urged its citizens to refrain from foreign travel.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A Maersk oil tanker has been anchored off the coast of Malta for two weeks after rescuing 27 migrants, including a child and a pregnant woman, with authorities in Malta and Tunisia denying the vessel entry, the company said on Wednesday.
The crew of Maersk Etienne, an oil tanker owned by Denmark's Maersk Tankers, rescued the migrants following a request from Maltese officials on August 4, the company said.
The migrants' wooden dinghy that had been at sea for days sank immediately after the rescue operation, according to Maersk Tankers.
The migrants have slept on blankets on the deck of the oil tanker, sheltered from the sun and wind, the company said. 
""The merchant fleet is neither designed nor equipped to care for additional people, and we are quickly depleting the supplies onboard,"" Tommy Thomassen, chief technical officer at Maersk Tankers, said in an email.
The NGO group Alarm (NASDAQ:ALRM) Phone said it received an emergency call from the migrant boat in Maltese waters on August 3. It said the boat had set sail from Libya the previous day. 
The number of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean to land on European shores from countries like Tunisia and Libya has spiked in the past year.
""We call on authorities and governments for humanitarian assistance and to urgently find a solution to safely disembark the rescued people,"" Thomassen said.
Maersk Tankers said the vessel had been denied entry by both Maltese and Tunisian authorities.
Neither the Maltese government nor the Tunisian interior ministry were immediately available for comment.
Danish authorities are currently in contact with Malta and Tunisia trying to resolve the issue, according to Maersk Tankers.

Danish shipping group Maersk sold Maersk Tankers to its controlling shareholder and Japan's Mitsui & Co in 2017.

The ending of the agreements follows U.S. President Donald Trump's order last month to end Hong Kong’s special status under U.S. law to punish China for what he called “oppressive actions” against the former British colony.
The State Department said in a statement the agreements ended covered ""the surrender of fugitive offenders, the transfer of sentenced persons, and reciprocal tax exemptions on income derived from the international operation of ships.""
""These steps underscore our deep concern regarding Beijing's decision to impose the National Security Law, which has crushed the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong,"" State Department Spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.
Trump signed an executive order last month that he said would end the preferential economic treatment for the city following the imposition of the draconian new national security law.
The legislation punishes anything China considers secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison and has drawn criticism from Western countries that worry the law will end the freedoms promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Analysts have said U.S.-China ties have deteriorated to their worst level in decades.
Washington this month imposed sanctions on Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and other current and former Hong Kong and mainland officials whom Washington accuses of curtailing political freedom in the financial hub.
The U.S. government has also required goods made in the former British colony for export to the United States to be labelled as made in China after Sept. 25.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",Lebanon's Hezbollah 'got power but lost the country',"By Samia Nakhoul and Tom Perry
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Fifteen years after the assassination of Lebanon's former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri, Hezbollah has risen to become the overarching power in a country that is now collapsing under its feet amid a series of devastating crises.
A U.N.-backed tribunal on Tuesday convicted a member of the Iranian-backed group of conspiring to kill Hariri in a 2005 bombing and acquitted three others.
The verdict came at a time when Lebanon's economy has collapsed. Institutions from the security services to the presidency, occupied by a Hezbollah ally, have been found wanting, and people are struggling with the aftermath of the massive explosion that shredded central Beirut this month.
Added to this, there is no functioning government and there is a spike in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has denied that the group has ever controlled Lebanese governments or that it has a majority that would allow it to act on its own.
But Lebanon is slipping from Hezbollah's hands, said a political source familiar with the thinking among the group's Christian allies.
""By getting the majority (in parliamentary elections) and a president on their side, they thought they controlled the country, but what happened now with Hezbollah and its allies is that they got power but they lost the country and the people.""
Hezbollah has faced growing criticism for its perceived failure to deliver on promised reforms since winning a parliamentary majority with its allies in 2018. 
The government - nominated by Hezbollah and its allies after the previous administration led by Saad al-Hariri, son of the slain PM, was toppled by a civic uprising last October - resigned over the Aug. 4 blast.
It had tried to negotiate a rescue package with the International Monetary Fund, but was blocked by the very powerbrokers who appointed it.
""There are so many problems internally apart from the port explosion,"" says Magnus Ranstorp, a Hezbollah expert. ""The country is breaking under their feet.""
Fawaz Gerges, Middle East expert at the London School of Economics, adds: ""This is one of the most fundamental challenges facing Lebanon since its independence from (France) in 1943 as you have now multiple crises facing Lebanon and Hezbollah."" 
""I fear this (the tribunal verdict) could provide a trigger. The country, which is already divided, will become more polarised along sectarian lines as opposed to political and ideological lines.""
Western donors say they will not bail out Lebanon without fundamental reforms to a corrupt system.
Mohanad Hage Ali, fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said Hezbollah had ""failed miserably"" to keep its election promise to fight corruption. ""They literally delivered nothing on this promise. In fact, their anti-corruption campaign is now a popular joke.""
""As is the case with most of this political class, Hezbollah hasn't been in a weaker position than they are right now,"" he said.
The Shi'ite movement, which has acted as a spearhead for Tehran in Syria's civil war and across the region, is also facing public anger over the explosion in the Beirut port that has traumatised the country.
The detonation of what authorities say was 2,700 tonnes of unsafely stored ammonium nitrate fuelled outrage over government negligence, incompetence and inaction. 
Hezbollah is not only the predominant power in Lebanon but is seen as protecting a corrupt political class that has driven Lebanon into the ground.
""What Hezbollah doesn't understand about the port explosion, the outcry, the protests, is that people view it as the latest manifestation of the corrupt elite and they hold Hezbollah responsible for safeguarding this elite,"" said Gerges.
""Hezbollah is losing the narrative inside Lebanon,"" he said.
Many Lebanese, including some Christians who once supported Hezbollah, have turned against the group even though it is not responsible for an economic crisis that had piled up for years under previous governments.
DIFFERENT PRIORITIES
The mood changed after Nasrallah gave a televised address denying responsibility for the blast and warning protesters that any more attacks on the system and its leaders would meet a robust response.
""You would have expected him to have reached out to the public by saying he would do anything to find out what has happened, that 'we are with the people',"" Gerges said.
But Hezbollah's priorities are geo-strategic rather than Lebanon-centric.
It fears change in Lebanon might undermine its ability to influence a political system that allows it to maintain its weapons and fighters, analysts say.
As a result, Hezbollah has become bogged down in Lebanon.
""They want to maintain their powerful position in the country, they want to maintain their weapons, they want to maintain a veto in the decision-making process while at the same time they want to tell people they are against corruption and they are different from the corrupt ruling elite. These contradictions have caught up with Hezbollah,"" Gerges said.
Khalil Gebara, Senior Policy Fellow at Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs, said: ""After the blast, it is clear that the political system is also close to collapse ... Hezbollah's objective today is to extend the life of the Lebanese political system.""
Although the court found no evidence of direct involvement by the leadership of Hezbollah, the judges said Hariri's killing was clearly a politically motivated act of terrorism.
The verdict, analysts say, is likely to exacerbate the difficulties of Hezbollah, already designated by the United States and several others as a terrorist group. 
""More and more countries will likely view Hezbollah as a paramilitary terrorist organisation,"" Gerges said.
Ranstorp says even before the Hariri verdict the mood in Europe and Washington had swung against a Hezbollah-dominated Lebanon, because of the axis of Shi'ite power Iran has built across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
The challenge to Hezbollah comes as it and its forces in Syria are being regularly attacked by Israeli warplanes, and powerful allied militias in Iraq are under pressure.
Most analysts say Hezbollah will sit tight, hoping that time will work in its favour, either through a new U.S. president or a possible new understanding between Tehran and the Trump administration ahead of the November election.
""They want to preserve the (Lebanese) state as it stands today. They don't want a strong state. But they don't want a fragmented weak one because that means more headaches, more challenges for them,"" Hage Ali said.

Such heritage houses were once commonplace, but many were razed during the 1975-1990 civil war and then decades of high-rise redevelopment. 
Now the 42-year-old is doing what he can to ensure the spirit of those damaged or destroyed on Aug. 4 lives on.
“This is my love, this is what I love, the ornaments of the house. Look at the balcony, the iron, it’s still as it is,” he said. 
Loussian has spent years salvaging items from houses before they were bulldozed and then building a home, an hour outside Beirut, to accommodate the pieces and become a showroom of treasures from the city's past.
Since the huge explosion that left 300,000 people homeless, injured thousands and killed 178, he has been offering help and advice to those whose traditional homes were damaged.
“There were a few (listed) homes, now they’re gone. We were proud of ourselves, that we were able to protect these homes before the explosion. Now they’re gone, they’re exploded, it’s unbelievable,” said Loussian, a collector and jewellery shop owner.
A mixture of Mediterranean, Ottoman and French-mandate era elements made the city’s traditional houses unique. Features include red tile roofs, high painted ceilings, marble columns and stained glass.
He and wife Rita hope eventually to open their home as a museum to show others the beauty of the city's history.
“I’m definitely proud to be living in this house, first of all because it reflects Lebanon’s true heritage, secondly, because it encompasses many homes in Beirut that are now gone, thirdly, it now stands as tribute to the homes that were damaged,"" she said.
Loussian added: “Beirut has always faced wars, explosions, political stuff that change the face of Beirut. The most important thing however is for us not to forget Beirut, that it is not forgotten. I love this city, it makes me proud, proud to be Lebanese, Beiruti.”

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The political crisis rocking Belarus presents a foreign policy challenge for President Vladimir Putin, who wants to keep the country firmly in Moscow's orbit, and there are early signs that it might also cause problems for him at home.
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko ordered police on Wednesday to end 10 days of protests in the capital Minsk following his claim of a landslide victory in an Aug. 9 election. The opposition say the vote was rigged.
Events in Belarus are seeping into Russian politics.
Some anti-Kremlin protesters in Russia's far east, who have demonstrated for six straight weeks against what they regard as Putin's mishandling of a local political crisis there, have started chanting ""Long live Belarus!"" in support of the protesters in Minsk, 9,000 km (5,590 miles) to the west.
The protests in the far eastern city of Khabarovsk are unusual by Russian standards for their longevity and scale.
One hand-drawn placard said: ""Khabarovsk is with you, Belarus.""
The man holding it, who did not give his name, said Belarusians and Russians had both run out of patience with what he called unfair political systems.
""I see parallels between Belarus and Khabarovsk,"" the man told Current Time TV. ""Not because we're all protesters, but because we are united by the same thing: the right to vote and take part in honest elections."" 
Supporters of leading Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny in Moscow say they are also closely watching the developments in Minsk and trying to learn lessons for what they expect eventually to unfold in Russia.
Culturally, politically and economically, Belarus is the ex-Soviet republic with the closest ties to Russia, including a treaty that proclaims a ""union state"" of the two countries with a Soviet-style red flag.
Putin is not Lukashenko, however, and there are no serious threats to his rule on the horizon. But that closeness and the fact that the two countries share a common language -- Russian -- mean that events in Belarus are starting to influence Russia's own political landscape.
Russia's much greater size and its more socially divided society make a repeat of the Belarusian scenario unlikely for now, said Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center. 
""UNCOMFORTABLE"" FOR PUTIN
But the spectacle of tens of thousands of Russian-speakers demonstrating against an autocratic leader who, like Putin, has been in power for over two decades would be unsettling for the Russian leader, he said.
""Here (in Belarus) is an example for Russian civil society,"" said Kolesenikov. ""So it's of direct interest to Putin. For him, the Belarusian protests must be unsuccessful as it would be uncomfortable for him to see a protest success story in a neighbouring 'brotherly' state.""
Putin has spoken to Lukashenko several times since the crisis begun and told him Russia will help militarily if necessary, a moment the Kremlin believes has not yet come. 
Putin's opponents have struggled for years to make an impact in Russia's tightly-controlled system, but are now drawing inspiration from the protests in Belarus. 
Ahead of regional elections involving 40 million voters next month, veteran anti-Kremlin activist Navalny is using Belarus to try to persuade Russians to back candidates he supports.
In an Aug. 14 appearance on his YouTube channel, Navalny spoke excitedly of how successful strikes by key workers in Belarus had forced authorities to start engaging with protesters.
Video clips of Belarusian workers declaring they had voted for the opposition accompanying his commentary were labelled ""Russia of the future"". 
One of his aides, Leonid Volkov, said he and fellow activists were monitoring the Belarusian authorities' tactics.
""We're carefully watching Lukashenko's attempts to switch off the internet,"" Volkov wrote on Twitter. ""It's really important because without doubt the same things await us in Russia."" 
Activists believe they may face a Belarusian scenario when Putin comes up for re-election in 2024 after he successfully got the constitution changed to allow him to run again for president twice.
""In today's Belarus we can see ourselves in the near future,"" said opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov.
""The opposition candidate gets 80% and the dictator is struggling to get 10%, but the election commission simply swaps the results."" 
There are signs that the Kremlin is alive to the potential threat.
State-backed media, after initially depicting the Belarusian opposition in a sympathetic light, have begun to change tack, talking of foreign meddling, a purported long-standing Polish interest in dominating the region, and 'coloured revolutions' - a reference to previous uprisings in Georgia and Ukraine. 

The spectacle of hundreds of Belarusians picketing their country's embassy in central Moscow was also too much for the Russian authorities, who cleared them off the streets and threw their placards and protest materials into nearby bins.

MINSK/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko ordered his police on Wednesday to put down protests in the capital Minsk, signalling an escalation after a week and a half of mass demonstrations against his rule.
Lukashenko's order came as European Union leaders held an emergency summit over the political crisis in Belarus, long Russia's most loyal neighbour, which has heavily militarised borders with EU member states Poland and Lithuania. 
EU leaders were expected to endorse sanctions on Belarusian officials they blame for election fraud following a disputed Aug. 9 election that the opposition said it won.
""There should no longer be any disorder in Minsk of any kind,"" Lukashenko said in remarks reported by the official Belta news agency. ""People are tired. People demand peace and quiet.""
Facing the biggest challenge of his 26-year rule, he ordered border controls to be tightened to prevent an influx of ""fighters and arms"". Workers at state media who quit in protest against government policies will not be rehired, he said.
Lukashenko, 65, also ordered intelligence agencies to continue searching for organisers of the street protests, Belta reported.
The EU leaders are treading a fine diplomatic line, trying to support democratic forces in Belarus without provoking Moscow's wrath.
""Violence has to stop and a peaceful and inclusive dialogue has to be launched. The leadership of #Belarus must reflect the will of the people,"" Charles Michel, the EU summit chairman, wrote in a tweet announcing the start of a video meeting.
""BELARUS IS NOT EUROPE""
The EU wants to avoid a repeat of what happened in neighbouring Ukraine six years ago, when a pro-Russian leader was ousted in a popular uprising, triggering a Russian military intervention and Europe's deadliest ongoing conflict.
""Belarus is not Europe,"" EU Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton said, comparing it to pro-Western Ukraine and Georgia, both targets of Russian military operations. ""Belarus is really strongly connected with Russia and the majority of the population is favourable to close links with Russia.""
Russia has consistently warned the West against steps it would characterise as meddling. On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused unidentified foreign powers of interfering, which he called unacceptable.
Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has urged the EU to reject Lukashenko's election victory. A 37-year-old political novice, she stood as his main challenger in the election after better-known opposition figures were jailed or banned from standing.
""I call on you not to recognise these fraudulent elections,"" Tsikhanouskaya said, speaking in English in a video address from exile in neighbouring Lithuania, where she fled after the vote her followers say she won.
""Mr. Lukashenko has lost all legitimacy in the eyes of our nation and the world,"" she said.
Lukashenko, a former collective farm boss, appears to have underestimated the public anger in his country after official results gave him victory with 80 percent of the vote.
Large state-owned factories have gone on strike in sympathy with the protesters, and the authorities have acknowledged some police officers have quit their posts.
""UNION STATE"" WITH RUSSIA
Speaking to his security council on Wednesday, Lukashenko repeated accusations that the protesters were funded from abroad.
Russia is likely to play a decisive role in how the crisis plays out. Of all the former Soviet republics, Belarus has by far the closest economic, cultural and political ties to Russia, and its territory is central to Russia's defence strategy. Since the 1990s, the two countries have proclaimed themselves part of a ""union state"", complete with a Soviet-style red flag.
Flight tracking data showed a Russian government plane used in the past to carry senior officials including the head of the FSB security service had flown to Belarus and back. Russian and Belarus officials did not publicly comment on the flight.
Despite close bilateral ties, Russian President Vladimir Putin has had a difficult personal relationship with Lukashenko. The Kremlin now faces the choice of sticking with him to see if he cling on or trying to manage a transition to a new leader who would still keep Minsk in Moscow's orbit.
Belarusian opposition figures set up a council on Tuesday to negotiate a transition, a move denounced by Lukashenko as an attempt to seize power.
The protests have spread to some of Belarus's major industrial plants that underpin Lukashenko's Soviet-style economic model. Police dispersed a demonstration and detained two people at the Minsk Tractor Works (MTZ) plant on Wednesday. 

Police also took control of the main state drama theatre in Minsk. It became a flashpoint for protests when its director, a former Belarusian diplomat, was fired after speaking out in favour of the opposition rallies.

The figure is likely to add to pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa and the ruling African National Congress, who have struggled to deflect criticism from alliance partners and opposition parties as allegations of corruption implicated senior ANC politicians. 
Ramaphosa, who replaced his scandal-prone predecessor Jacob Zuma in 2017 with promises to eradicate corruption, has battled to root out criminality linked to the fight against COVID-19 in South Africa, which has the world's fifth highest number of coronavirus infections at 592,144.
In a presentation to a parliamentary committee, Andy Mothibi, head of the SIU, which investigates allegations against public sector figures or institutions, said it was working on 658 cases nationwide involving just over 5 billion rand - the first time a number has been put on the alleged graft. 
The provincial health department of the central Gauteng province, an economic hub and home to Johannesburg, alone accounted for just under half of the total, at 2.2 billion rand, Mothibi added. 
""The allegations reported to the SIU involved the procurement of PPEs (personal protective equipment), hospital and quarantine sites, catering services (food parcels), ventilators, disinfecting equipment and motorised wheelchairs,"" he said.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 09:06AM ET</span>",West Bank settlers say Netanyahu duped them with annexation backtrack,"By Eli Berlzon
MASSUA SETTLEMENT, West Bank (Reuters) - Israel’s settler leaders say Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defrauded them of their long-held dream of annexing the occupied West Bank as part of the country's normalisation deal with the United Arab Emirates.
Their anger could be a problem for right-wing Netanyahu, whom they accuse of repeatedly floating the idea of annexation only to cave in to international pressure when the terms of the UAE deal required him to walk back his promises. 
""He deceived us, defrauded us, duped us,"" said David Elhayani, head of the Yesha Council, the settlers' main umbrella organisation.
""It's a major disappointment. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity, a golden opportunity that the prime minister missed because he lacked the courage,"" said Elhayani. ""He's lost it. He needs to go.""
Israel’s West Bank settlements - which range in size from a few hilltop caravans to sprawling commuter towns - were built by successive governments on land captured in a 1967 war. 
Around 450,000 Jewish settlers now live among 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank, with a further 200,000 settlers in East Jerusalem. Most countries view the settlements as illegal, a view that Israel and the United States dispute.
When Netanyahu promised during recent elections to apply Israeli sovereignty to areas of the West Bank, including Jewish settlements, he said he first needed a green light from Washington.
That green light appeared to have been given by President Donald Trump's Mideast plan released in January, which envisaged Israel applying sovereignty - de facto annexation - to its 120 settlements in almost a third of the West Bank.
But when Trump announced the UAE deal this month, he said annexation was now ""off the table"". 
SOVEREIGNTY
Polls have shown wide support in Israel for the UAE deal. But the ideological settler leadership has significant political clout, and has long been a bastion of Netanyahu's support.
Aware that he might lose their backing to parties even more hawkish than his own, Netanyahu sought to keep settler hopes alive. 
""Sovereignty is not off the agenda, I was the one who brought it to the Trump plan with American consent. We will apply sovereignty,"" he told Israel Army Radio, saying the White House had merely asked for a suspension. 
But many settler leaders are unconvinced. Bezalel Smotrich, a settler with the ultranationalist opposition Yemina party, said Netanyahu ""has been deceiving right-wing voters for many years with great success"".
Palestinians, who seek a state of their own in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, have vigorously opposed the policies of Trump and his senior adviser Jared Kushner, including their Middle East plan and UAE deal.
They accuse Trump, Kushner and Netanyahu of drawing up blueprints that would leave them only an unviable Palestinian state of separate enclaves scattered across the West Bank.
But the Trump vision of limited Palestinian statehood has created strange bedfellows. 
The Palestinians say it gives them too little. But for the most hardline Israeli settlers it gives the Palestinians too much. For these settlers, any Palestinian state is anathema.
In the hilltop settlement of Kedumim, veteran settler leader Daniella Weiss said: ""I don't think the Jewish nation needs to give up any of its treasures, any part ... of our homeland, for a peace treaty."" 

""I am a pioneer that established an outpost, then my children did it, now my grandchildren are doing it. This is the dream and this is the plan and this is what our movement does.""

558,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",Mali president Keita vowed to end coups. Now he's been toppled too,"By Aaron Ross
DAKAR (Reuters) - A month after becoming president of Mali in 2013, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita declared that the days of mutinous soldiers undermining the power of government in the capital Bamako were over.
""Kati will no longer scare Bamako,"" he said, referring to the Kati military base outside the capital where a mutiny the previous year had toppled then-President Amadou Toumani Toure.
Seven years later, Keita, 75, has suffered a similar fate.
He was overthrown on Tuesday by a military coup that began with a mutiny in Kati. Within hours, the putschists, firing shots in the air, drove into town, detained Keita, took him to Kati and forced him to resign and dissolve parliament.
Despite lofty promises to root out the problems that led to his predecessor's demise - a security crisis caused by insurgents in the north and public perceptions of high-level corruption - those same factors proved Keita's undoing.
Disputed legislative elections in April and an anaemic economy further fuelled public anger, drawing tens of thousands of people on to the streets of Bamako in recent weeks to demand his resignation.
Keita, widely known by his initials IBK, won re-election two years ago and his ruling coalition enjoyed a healthy majority in parliament.
But that masked the depth of popular dissatisfaction, said Ibrahim Maiga, a Mali-based researcher at the Institute for Security Studies.
""He wasn't able to understand quickly enough the anger that cut across the entire society,"" said Maiga. ""He didn't fully appreciate the strong demand for change in the country.""
Keita came to office with a reputation for firmness forged as a prime minister in the 1990s when he took a hard line with striking trade unions. But from the start he was unable to get a handle on the security crisis in northern Mali.
French forces had intervened in January 2013 to drive back al Qaeda-linked jihadists who had hijacked an ethnic Tuareg rebellion to seize the northern two-thirds of the country. 
Keita's government struggled to assert control over Tuareg militias that continued to push for autonomy.
The jihadists regrouped, inflicting heavy losses on Malian soldiers and civilians while extending their presence into central Mali and neighbouring countries.
Attacks by the jihadists - some with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State - stoked tit-for-tat clashes between rival herding and farming communities that have eclipsed the violence by militants, claiming hundreds of lives this year alone.
CORRUPTION
Keita, who usually wears white flowing robes and has a tendency to slur his words, won a crushing election victory in August, 2013, with over 77% of the vote, and vowed to take on corruption.
Junior military officers said widespread anger over graft under Toure was one of the triggers of their March 2012 coup.
""Let me be clear. There is no question of sharing out the cake. I have not promised that and it will not happen,"" Keita said, vowing to put an end to political patronage.
Keita enjoyed strong international support, especially from former colonial master France, who poured money and troops into Mali.
But his government quickly found itself mired in allegations of fraud and waste related to the purchase of a $40 million presidential jet and inflated spending on military supplies that led the International Monetary Fund to briefly delay aid.
""In time of massive foreign military presence, there are opportunities for massive corruption,"" said Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, a Mauritanian diplomat and former U.N. special representative in West Africa.
Accusations of cronyism focused on Keita's son, Karim, over his lavish lifestyle and position as chairman of parliament's powerful defence and security committee.
In a televised statement early on Wednesday, a spokesman for the putschists denounced the ""political clientelism and family management of state affairs"" under Keita.
Videos shared on social media after Keita was detained show revellers splashing in the pool in Karim's Bamako residence.
Keita and his son always denied allegations of impropriety.
The mass protests began in early June, spearheaded by a charismatic Muslim cleric, Mahmoud Dicko, who had supported Keita in the 2013 election but quickly soured on him.
During demonstrations in July, security forces opened fire, killing at least 14 people and hardening opposition demands that Keita resign.
He offered a series of concessions to the coalition of political opponents, religious leaders and civil society activists leading the protests, but they were rejected. 
As word of Keita's detention spread in Bamako on Tuesday, thousands of people filled the streets, cheering soldiers as they sped through in military vehicles, firing rounds of celebratory gunfire into the air.

""IBK did not want to listen to his people,"" said Nouhoum Togo, a spokesman for the M5-RFP coalition that has led the protests. ""He thought that France ... or the international community could save him.""

The U.S. guided-missile destroyer USS Mustin sailed through the narrow and sensitive Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, the U.S. navy said, in what have become relatively routine trips in recent months, though they always anger China.
The Eastern Theatre Command of China's People's Liberation Army said its air and naval forces followed and monitored the U.S. ship throughout its voyage.
""Any words or deeds that ... cause trouble in the Taiwan Strait are not in line with the fundamental interests of China and the United States, harm the well-being of compatriots on both sides of the strait, pose real threats to peace and stability in the region and are extremely dangerous"", it said.
Chinese forces will remain on high alert at all times to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, it added.
Taiwan's defence ministry said the U.S. ship was on an ""ordinary mission"" and passed through the Taiwan Strait in a southerly direction.
The sailing comes a week after U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar visited Taiwan, the highest level U.S. official to travel to the island since Washington broke off diplomatic ties with Taipei in favour of Beijing in 1979.
China responded by sending fighter jets close to Taiwan.

China considers Taiwan a purely domestic matter, and routinely calls it the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with the United States.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has put on the backburner President Joko Widodo's ambitious $33-billion project to relocate the capital city to the island of Borneo as it grapples to rein in the coronavirus pandemic, the planning minister said.
Planned construction of government buildings for the new city will be shelved until Indonesia sees ""the light at the end of the tunnel"" on the outbreak, said Suharso Monoarfa, who is overseeing a masterplan for the new city.
""We're putting as our number one priority the recovery of the economy and overcoming the pandemic,"" Monoarfa told Reuters in a streamed interview on Tuesday. 
""When the situation improves, only then will we decide what we will do"" with the capital relocation, he added. 
Making a frank admission of the obstacles to the project, he said groundbreaking could be delayed until 2022 or 2023, as the government focuses efforts on finding, and then distributing, a COVID-19 vaccine to the population of nearly 270 million.
Construction of a state palace and other buildings was initially set to start by 2021, along with upgrades of airports, sea ports and the building of access roads in the forested area earmarked for transformation into a new smart city. 
Civil servants were due to start moving by 2024, which should mark the final year of Widodo's second term in office.
Widodo unveiled the project last year to reduce the burden on Jakarta, a teeming city of 10 million on Java island that suffers traffic gridlock, regular floods and is sinking because of the overextraction of ground water. 
SoftBank's chief executive Masayoshi Son, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed al Nahyan have been enlisted as advisers for the project.
As authorities struggle to reopen Southeast Asia's biggest economy, their energies have increasingly been consumed in battling the spiralling epidemic, which has caused more than 6,200 deaths, the region's highest tally.
Normally, such a big project should bring considerable positive ripple effects for the economy, but disbursing the government's coronavirus stimulus response appeared more urgent now, said Wellian Wiranto, an economist at OCBC Bank.
Nor could Indonesia now afford to move its capital, as the pandemic's strain on the national budget leads to a ballooning fiscal deficit, another economist said.
The downturn could last longer than the government anticipates, running until the second half of 2021, said Enny Sri Hartati of the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance. 
""Anyone who talks about the new capital city project during the pandemic has lost their senses,"" she added.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - J's cousin promised her a well paid job in India as a housekeeper. Instead, she found herself in a brothel until the United Nations brought her home to Kenya when it was alerted to the human trafficking route.
""When I heard there were job vacancies in India, I was so happy,"" said J, asking that only her initial be used to protect her privacy.
When she got there, her passport was confiscated and she was forced into sex work to pay off $9,000 her traffickers, fellow East Africans, told her she owed them for her travel and lodging, she said.
In the past year, the International Organization of Migration (IOM) repatriated 12 Kenyan women who had been trafficked to India, the first time it said it had been asked to help Kenyans there.
Most Kenyans who have been trafficked end up in the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia, according to Kenya's National Crime Research Center, which did not have a more specific country-by-country breakdown available. 
Now IOM worries that the economic fallout of the coronavirus lockdown in East Africa will make people more vulnerable to exploitation, at home or abroad.
Nearly a third of low-income Nairobi residents lost their jobs in the past month, and another 15% who had been self-employed are without work, a July survey from Nairobi-based market research firm Tifa Research showed.
It flew J home weeks before Kenya's closure of its borders against the spread of the coronavirus. The borders reopened on August 1.
""With the economic losses that we are experiencing as a result of the pandemic we are potentially going to see more cases (of people) being trafficked or re-trafficked,"" said Sharon Dimanche, head of the IOM in Kenya.
J, who had been diagnosed with cancer and had leapt at the chance to save money for treatment, said her experience shows that Kenyans should be wary of job offers abroad.
""I never thought I would get back to my kids,"" she said. ""When they took me to the embassy, I could not believe I am going to see family again and not return in a coffin.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has played down differences with longtime ally Saudi Arabia after his army chief visited Riyadh in a bid to ease a row over policy towards the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. 
The dispute, brought on by Pakistani demands for Saudi Arabia to take a firmer line against India for what Pakistan says are its human rights violations in Kashmir, has threatened Riyadh's financial support for Islamabad.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia had no differences, Khan said in a late Tuesday interview, backing away from criticism by his foreign minister this month who suggested Saudi Arabia was indifferent on Kashmir.
""The rumours that our relations with Saudi Arabia have soured are totally false,"" Khan said in the interview with the Dunya News television channel.
""Our relations are very good. We are constantly in touch.""
Pakistan's army chief travelled to Saudi Arabia on Monday for a one-day visit that was ""primarily military-affairs oriented"", the army said.
But top military and government officials said the visit was aimed at calming the simmering standoff that could badly hurt cash-strapped Pakistan's foreign reserves. [L8N2FJ1WV]
Saudi Arabia gave Pakistan a $3 billion loan and $3.2 billion oil credit facility to help its balance of payments crisis in late 2018.
Pakistan's demands for Saudi Arabia to support it against India over Kashmir led to Saudi Arabia forcing Pakistanto pay back $1 billion early, military and finance ministry officials have told Reuters.
Saudi Arabia is also demanding repayment of another $1 billion of the loan and has not responded to Pakistani requests to extend the oil facility, they said.
The Saudi government has not commented on the matter.
The Saudi-led Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) hasonly held low-level meetings on Kashmir, to the frustration of some who want to see a more robust position.
""On the Kashmir issue, there is a view that OIC should have stepped forward,"" Khan said.
""Saudi has its own foreign policy. We shouldn't think that because we want something Saudi will do just that,"" he added.
Analysts say Saudi Arabia does not want to risk its business interests in India for supporting Pakistan over Kashmir.
Pakistan and India both claim the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir in full but rule it in part.

(Reuters) - Protesters lit fires, threw rocks and smashed windows at county government offices in the U.S. city of Portland on Tuesday, prompting police to declare a riot, after weeks of mostly peaceful anti-racism demonstrations.
The protesters lit fires in dumpsters and flames were seen inside the building, media said. TV footage https:// showed people throwing stones at the building and debris on the street in flames.
Black Lives Matter protests have been held across the United States in recent months after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
Protests, including in Portland, have at times erupted into arson and violence, and federal officers sent into the Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) city have repeatedly clashed with crowds targeting the federal courthouse there.
Police said some officers were targeted a night earlier with a ""powerful green laser"" capable of causing permanent eye damage when some protesters marched on the Portland Police Association building.
""Portland Police has declared the gathering near the Multnomah Building a riot after individuals vandalized, repeatedly smashed first floor windows with rocks and threw burning material into an office,"" the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office said on Twitter.
The Multnomah Building houses county government operations. 
Police said that failure to comply with its order to disperse could lead to arrests and use of tear gas, crowd control munitions and impact weapons.
Multnomah County Chair Deborah Kafoury released a statement at midnight, saying a small group of protesters had set fire to the ""Office of Community Involvement"".
""This is the heart of our county, where people in our community come to get married, get their passports, and celebrate their cultural traditions and diversity,” the Oregonian website quoted her as saying, adding the space is dedicated to community members “marginalized by the traditional political process.”
Media reported that fire in the building was put out by the police.
There were no immediate reports of any injuries or deaths, but the Oregonian reported that there were two arrests.
A crowd of about 200 gathered in the city's Colonel Summers Park late on Tuesday before marching through Southeast Portland streets, eventually arriving at the Multnomah Building, the Oregonian reported.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr came under fire from Democratic lawmakers earlier this month for sending federal officers to disperse protesters in the city.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) on Tuesday called for the Department of Justice to prosecute a group of people caught on videotape beating and kicking a man who crashed his truck near protests in Portland.

PONGOLA, South Africa (Reuters) - South Africa's luxury game lodges are empty and safari vehicles gather dust, with borders closed and airlines struggling due to the coronavirus crisis.
For Somkhanda, a community-owned ""Big 5"" game reserve, selling game meat has thrown it a lifeline as Africa's multi-billion-dollar safari industry unravels.
The reserve normally gives away or sells at low cost the meat from grazers such as impala and nyala, a spiral-horned antelope, that it culls each year to manage stocks, depending on the weather conditions and available grassland.
Now, faced with a loss of up to 90% of its revenue, is it more actively marketing the meat - often seen as a delicacy bought by restaurants and foreign tourists - to bring in between 50,000 rand to 100,000 rand ($2,875 to $5,730) per month, according to the reserve's management.
""The tourism industry has collapsed. There has been no one coming to visit,"" said Roelie Kloppers, chief executive at the Wildlands, which co-manages the reserve in the heart of northern Zululand.
""Instead of culling and just giving that meat away or selling it at a very low price locally, we tried to market it,"" said Kloppers, adding ""we would rather have the doors open"".
Before the pandemic, local and international tourists would watch animals from lions to wild dogs - as well as the impala and nyala - on guided bush walks and game drives on the 12,000 hectare reserve. 
Rising costs from safety procedures such as hand sanitiser stations, temperature checks and protective equipment for staff have added to the reserve's burden since South Africa imposed its lockdown at the end of March. Eight jobs have been cut.
The meat is sold online through a partnership with KZN Game Meat, at farmers' markets and at some Pick n Pay stores. 
""Bills are pilling up ... so we decided to cull the animals that breed in numbers so we can sell the meat to supplement income during this time,"" said leader of the Emvokweni Community Trust, which owns the reserve, Fana Gumbi.
The African Union estimates that African countries have lost almost $55 billion in travel and tourism revenues in just three months due to the pandemic.
""Through the meat sales market we were able to keep the ship afloat,"" reserve manager Meiring Prinsloo said.

The charges against the six were not over the demands made at the protest by thousands of people at Thammasat University on Aug. 10, but for breaching internal security and measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus as well as computer crimes.
The six include Panusaya Sithijirawattankul, 21, the student who read out a manifesto demanding reform of the monarchy. They also include Anon Nampa, who made the first public call for royal reform and has also been charged over earlier protests.
""They can hand themselves in today or whenever but shouldn't bring a crowd,"" Police Lieutenant General Amphol Buarabporn told Reuters.
""If they don't hand themselves in, we can arrest them when they're spotted."" 
Student-led protests have taken place almost daily for more than a month to demand the departure of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, a new constitution and an end to the harassment of activists.
Some students have also called for reforms to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn over the constitution, the armed forces and the palace fortune - touching a subject that had long been taboo in Thailand.
Insulting the monarchy can lead to a 15-year jail sentence, but Prayuth has said the king had requested no prosecutions under the lese majeste laws for now.
The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society will file a complaint against exiled academic Pavin Chachavalpongpun for creating a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group deemed critical of the monarchy, ministry spokesman Putchapong Nodthaisong told Reuters. 
The group, called Royalist Marketplace, has more than one million members.
""We have filed a request to Facebook to delete the entire group, but the platform hasn't been cooperative,"" Putchapong said. ""So the ministry is now going to use the Computer Crime Act."" 
The ministry has been ramping up efforts to curb online content it deems critical of the monarchy.
It has filed thousands requests this year to restrict or remove content deemed illegal, including perceived insults to the monarchy, on social media platform Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s video service YouTube. 
""The ministry's action is the crudest form of information censorship. It goes against the freedom of expression that we are all entitled to,"" Pavin told Reuters. 
""We protest against the ministry's action and urge Facebook to ignore its call for the sake of democracy and the support for freedom of speech. 
Two of the six activists wanted over the Aug. 10 rally are among three who have already been arrested once and bailed for the organisation of earlier protests.
Prayuth has said that young people have the right to protest, but that the rally at which the calls for royal reform was made ""went too far"".
Prominent right-wing activists plan to meet on Wednesday in Bangkok to discuss way to counter the student-led protests.

High school students are also planning to rally at the Ministry Education on Wednesday following a string of pro-democracy demonstrations at schools across the country.

Nagashiki issued a statement on Wednesday after the arrest overnight in Mauritius of the captain and of the bulk carrier, MV Wakashio, and another of the ship's officers on charges of endangering safe navigation. It did not provide further details on the situation in Mauritius beyond saying it would support the crew and their families.
""We sincerely apologise for causing a great deal of inconvenience to everyone involved, including everyone in Mauritius, due to this grounding accident and oil spill,"" the statement said. 
The MV Wakashio struck a coral reef off the Indian Ocean island on July 25 and began spilling oil on Aug. 6, prompting the government to announce a state of environmental emergency. 
The spill spread over a vast area of endangered corals, affecting fish and other marine life in what some scientists have called the country's worst ecological disaster. Emergency crews removed most of the ship's remaining oil before it split apart on Saturday.
The other person arrested was the ship's deputy captain, a maritime official in Mauritius with knowledge of the incident, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
Removing the ship is likely to take months.

Staff, police and volunteers used sandbags to try to protect the 71-metre (233-foot) Leshan Giant Buddha, a UNESCO World Heritage site in southwestern Sichuan province, as muddy flood water rose over its toes for the first time since 1949, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Sichuan, through which the Yangtze river flows, raised its emergency response to the maximum level on Tuesday to cope with a new round of torrential rainfall. 
The Yangtze Water Resources Commission, the government body that oversees the river, declared a red alert late on Tuesday, saying water at some monitoring stations was expected to exceed ""guaranteed"" flood protection levels by over 5 metres. 
The Three Gorges Project, a massive hydroelectric facility designed in part to tame floods on the Yangtze, is expected to see water inflows rise to 74,000 cubic metres per second on Wednesday, the highest since it was built, the Ministry of Water Resources said.
The project restricts the amount of water flowing downstream by storing it in its reservoir, which has been over 10 metres higher than its official warning level for more than a month. 
The facility was forced to raise water discharge volumes on Tuesday in order to ""reduce flood control pressures"", the water ministry said. 
Authorities have been at pains to show that the cascade of giant dams and reservoirs built along the Yangtze's upper reaches have shielded the region from the worst of the floods this year, though critics say they might be making things worse.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The head of a Mexico-based evangelical church that claims more than 1 million followers worldwide was ordered on Tuesday to remain in jail and stand trial on charges of rape, human trafficking and child pornography.
The ruling clears a major hurdle for the California attorney general's office in a case originally brought in June 2019 against Naason Joaquin Garcia, leader and self-styled apostle of the Guadalajara-based church La Luz del Mundo (Light of the World).
The decision capped a preliminary hearing that began Aug. 11, in which prosecutors had to show they had probable cause to bring their case against Garcia and two co-defendants to a jury.
""For the purposes of this hearing, I do find sufficient evidence that all the charges and enhancements in the complaint have been proven by the standard I have before me,” Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen said.
Garcia, 51, was ordered to remain in custody in lieu of $90 million bond. An arraignment was set for Sept. 1.
An appeals court dismissed the original criminal complaint in April on procedural grounds. But the attorney general's office filed a new complaint this month, charging Garcia and two co-defendants with 36 felony offenses, 10 more than they previously faced, including additional rape counts.
No pleas have been entered to the newly filed case. Garcia and the others have maintained their innocence, as has the church, which in a statement issued on Tuesday said the charges stem from ""unsubstantiated anonymous allegations"" and ""blatant hearsay.""
One of Garcia's accusers, Sochil Martin, said through her attorney after Tuesday's ruling: ""I am happy to see this process moving forward and that we are one step closer to justice.""
According to prosecutors, five victims, some of them minors, have alleged that they were raped or otherwise sexually abused by Garcia. Prosecutors have also cited an ""orgy"" video in which Garcia is seen watching while a young boy has sex with a member of his own family.
An accused accomplice, Alondra Ocampo, remains jailed on $10 million bond, while a third defendant, Susana Medina Oaxaca, is free on bail. A fourth, Azalea Rangel Melendez, was still at large.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Mali President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita resigned on Tuesday and dissolved parliament hours after mutinying soldiers detained him at gunpoint, plunging a country already facing a jihadist insurgency and mass protests deeper into crisis.
Looking tired and wearing a surgical mask, Keita resigned in a brief address broadcast on state television after troops seized him along with Prime Minister Boubou Cisse and other top officials.
""If today, certain elements of our armed forces want this to end through their intervention, do I really have a choice?"" he said from a military base in Kati outside the capital Bamako where he had been detained earlier in the day. 
It was not immediately clear who was leading the revolt, who would govern in Keita's absence or what the mutineers wanted.
Images posted earlier on social media said to be taken at the Kati garrison showed Keita and Cisse surrounded by armed soldiers. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the videos. 
Mali has seen months of protests against alleged corruption and worsening security in the West African country where Islamist militants are active, and there have been calls for Keita to resign. 
The M5-RFP coalition behind the protests signalled support for the mutineers' action, with spokesman Nouhoum Togo telling Reuters it was ""not a military coup but a popular insurrection"".
Hundreds of anti-government protesters poured into a central square in Bamako to celebrate and cheer the mutineers as they drove through in military vehicles and fired rounds of celebratory gunfire.
A mutiny in 2012 at the same Kati base led to a military coup that toppled then-President Amadou Toumani Toure and hastened the fall of Mali's north to jihadist militants. 
French forces intervened the following year to beat them back. But the militants have since regrouped and expanded their influence into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger, attacking soldiers, civilians and Western tourists. 
INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION
France and other international powers as well as the African Union denounced the mutiny, fearful that Keita's fall could further destabilise the former French colony and West Africa's entire Sahel region.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the immediate release of Keita and the other detainees. 
""I energetically condemn the arrest of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, the prime minister and other members of the Malian government and call for their immediate liberation,"" African Union Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat said on Twitter. 
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said France ""condemns in the strongest terms this grave event"". 
The U.S. envoy to the Sahel, J. Peter Pham, said on Twitter that ""the U.S. is opposed to all extra-constitutional changes of government"".
The Economic Community of West African States condemned ""the overthrow by putschist soldiers of the democratically elected government"".
In a statement, it ordered the closing of regional borders with Mali and suspension of all financial flows between Mali and its 15 members states. 
At least 14 people were killed in July in the demonstrations that were called for by a coalition of Keita's political opponents, religious leaders and civil society activists. 
Keita had hoped concessions to opponents and recommendations from a mediating delegation of regional leaders would help stem the tide of dissatisfaction, but the protest leaders have rejected proposals to join a power-sharing government. 

""Whether he's been arrested or not, what is certain is that his end is near. God is granting our prayers. IBK is finished,"" Haidara Assetou Cisse, a teacher, said earlier in the day, referring to Keita by his initials.

577,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 10:15PM ET</span>",California's heat wave and lightning storms rooted in same weather pattern,"By Steve Gorman
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The atmospheric pattern stoking California's record-breaking heat wave this week has also played a role in causing extreme lightning storms that have sparked scores of wildfires, weather and fire officials said on Tuesday.
The surge in lightning strikes - the most widespread burst of such storms in California since 2008 - has come with very little rain, ratcheting up an already volatile wildfire season. 
As of Tuesday afternoon, nearly 6,000 lightning strikes were recorded during a single 24-hour stretch, igniting more than 200 wildfires from the San Francisco Bay area north to California's Gold Country, said Lynette Round, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire).
Lightning also triggered a major blaze north of the famed Lake Tahoe resort city on Friday that has since charred more than 44,000 acres - an area about one tenth the size of Los Angeles - and unleashed a rare cyclone of flames called a fire tornado, or ""firenado,"" on Saturday.
Hundreds of miles to the south, a lightning-caused blaze that started on Saturday has scorched another 44,000-plus acres of dry grass and desert scrub on the floor of the Mojave National Preserve, which encompasses the world's largest Joshua tree forest and habitat of the threatened desert tortoise.
Governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency on Tuesday to ensure resources are available to combat the fires. 
The heat wave was complicating those efforts by adding to the desiccated condition of vegetation fueling the flames, while posing a greater physical challenge to the firefighters.
""They're wearing a lot of gear, carrying equipment, hiking to remote locations, so it's a stress on the body,"" CalFire's Round said.
Abnormally high temperatures that began roasting California on Friday, straining the state's power grid and leading to rolling blackouts, are due to an enormous dome of high pressure hovering over America's desert Southwest, weather officials said.
The same high-pressure ridge was siphoning off moisture from remnants of a now-dissipated tropical storm off the coast of Mexico, creating conditions rife for thunderstorms and lightning strikes over central and northern California, meteorologists said.
Daytime highs have shattered records across the state, with the hottest air temperature recorded anywhere on Earth during the last century reached in Death Valley National Park on Sunday afternoon, where the mercury soared to 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4 Celsius).
Rolling blackouts - short-term power cutoffs to prevent a larger collapse of the electrical grid - briefly left over 400,000 homes and businesses without air conditioning over the weekend, the first such blackouts imposed since 2001.

The insurgents raided 30 police posts and an army base in Rakhine State. At least 12 members of the security forces were killed, the army and government said at the time.
The Myanmar military responded immediately with a sweeping crackdown in Rohingya areas that forced the 730,000 villagers to flee to Bangladesh where they remain in camps.
U.N. investigators later concluded the Myanmar military campaign was executed with ""genocidal intent"". Myanmar denies that, saying the army was battling the insurgency.
The new arrivals in Bangladesh joined more than 200,000 Rohingya already there, who fled earlier violence, most living camps, straining resources in one of Asia’s poorest regions.
Here are some facts about the camps in Bangladesh's southeastern coastal district of Cox's Bazar, based on information from the U.N. refugee agency, Bangladesh government and the International Organization for Migration.
-- Most of the 1 million or so Rohingya in Bangladesh live in five camps that cover an area equivalent to one third of Manhattan. About half of the refugees are children, and there are more women in the camps than men.
-- More than 700,000 live in the world's largest and most densely populated refugee camp, Kutupalong, an area of just 13 square kilometres.
-- About 131,000 people live in the Teknaf camp, south of Kutupalong; more than 22,000 people are in the Unchiprang camp; about 22,000 are in Shamlapur and nearly 13,000 in the smallest camp, Chakmarkul.
-- Most of the refugees live in shelters made of bamboo and plastic sheets.
-- U.N. agencies, international and national aid groups and the Bangladesh government provide them with food, healthcare and basic facilities like communal toilets and drinking water.
-- Refugees are not allowed to work and cannot leave the camps without the permission of the government.
-- Bangladesh late last year restricted access to high-speed internet in the camps, citing national security.
-- In January, Bangladesh allowed Rohingya children to formally study up to the age of 14 following the Myanmar curriculum. Those older than 14 will get skills training.
-- The first novel coronavirus case was detected in the camps on May 14. As of Aug. 17, a total of 79 cases had been confirmed among the refugees, with six deaths.

-- Bangladesh and Myanmar have agreed to complete the return of the refugees but attempts to get a repatriation process going have failed as refugees refuse to go back, fearing more violence.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia used Republican political operative Paul Manafort and the WikiLeaks website to try to help now-U.S. President Donald Trump win the 2016 election, a Republican-led Senate committee said in its final review of the matter on Tuesday.
WikiLeaks played a key role in Russia's effort to assist Republican Trump's campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton and likely knew it was helping Russian intelligence, said the 966-page report, which is likely to be the most definitive public account of the 2016 election controversy.
The report found President Vladimir Putin personally directed the Russian efforts to hack computer networks and accounts affiliated with the Democratic Party and leak information damaging to Clinton.
Asked about the report at an event in Yuma, Arizona, Trump said: ""I don't know anything about it. I didn't read it.""
""It's all a hoax,"" Trump told reporters.
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence alleged Manafort collaborated with Russians, including oligarch Oleg Deripaska and ""Russian intelligence officer"" Konstantin Kilimnik, before, during, and after the election.
The panel found Manafort's role and proximity to Trump created opportunities for Russian intelligence, saying his ""high-level access and willingness to share information with individuals closely affiliated with the Russian intelligence services... represented a grave counterintelligence threat.""
A lawyer for Manafort did not respond to a request for comment. WikiLeaks did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
It was not clear what effect, if any, the report might have on the current presidential campaign. Trump will face Democratic candidate Joe Biden on Nov. 3.
Russia's alleged election interference, which Moscow denies, sparked a two-year-long U.S. investigation headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
In a report released last year, Mueller found no conclusive evidence of coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. He cited 10 instances in which Trump may have tried to impede his probe but did not say if this constituted obstruction of justice.
COLLUSION?
Trump and his supporters have consistently bristled at suggestions foreign interference helped his upset 2016 victory. They have sought to discredit the intelligence agencies' findings as the politically charged work of a ""deep state.""
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh on Tuesday said the report vindicated his stance that there was no ""collusion"" between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.
Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said Trump had welcomed Russian assistance in 2016 ""with open arms.""
""Donald Trump may believe that the Russian government should have a say in our elections, but it is for the American people to decide,"" Bates said.
Founded by Julian Assange, WikiLeaks published thousands of emails hacked from Clinton's campaign and a top campaign aide in the weeks before the 2016 election, yielding a drumbeat of negative coverage about the Democrat.
As Russian military intelligence and WikiLeaks released the hacked documents, the report said Trump's campaign sought advance notice, devised messaging strategies to amplify them ""and encouraged further theft of information and ... leaks.""
""The Trump campaign publicly undermined the attribution of the hack-and-leak campaign to Russia and was indifferent to whether it and WikiLeaks were furthering a Russian election interference effort,"" the report added.
The report said Trump's campaign tried to get advance information about WikiLeaks' planned releases from his adviser Roger Stone, but the committee could not establish the extent to which Stone had inside access to WikiLeaks materials.

The panel said it had referred ""potential criminal activity"" it uncovered to law enforcement. An annex on the matter was fully redacted.

The quake was at a depth of 10 km (6.21 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said.
Indonesia's meteorology, climatology and geophysical agency said the quake was felt in cities in the area including Bengkulu, which was the nearest to the epicentre, and Padang.
""Up to now, there have been no reports of damage yet following the earthquake,"" the agency said in a statement

Indonesia sits on the Pacific's seismically active ""Ring of Fire"" and has suffered deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in the past. 
The most devastating in recent Indonesian history was on Dec. 26 in 2004, when a magnitude 9.5 quake off Sumatra triggered a massive tsunami that killed around 226,000 people along the shorelines of the Indian Ocean, including more than 126,000 in Indonesia.

GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (Reuters) - Ecuador's armed forces said on Tuesday that dozens of vessels from a predominantly Chinese fishing fleet that is operating near the Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG) Islands have turned off tracking systems to prevent monitoring of their activities.
Of around 325 ships still fishing in the waters near the ecologically sensitive Galapagos, 149 have at some point in recent months cut off communications, Navy Commander, Rear Admiral Darwin Jarrin told reporters. 
Some had also changed the vessels' names to avoid supervision, he said.
""In this period, 149 ships have turned off their satellite systems ... we know the name of the ships,"" Jarrin said during a press conference. He declined to identify the vessels.
The complaint comes as the South American nation is seeking to prevent unsustainable fishing off its coast while also avoiding a confrontation with China, its largest financier and a major market for its shrimp export business.
A representative of the Chinese embassy declined to comment. 
Ecuador says the fleet has not entered its territorial waters. But environmentalists say this type of fishing allows vessels to take advantage of the abundant marine wildlife that travels in the waters between the Galapagos and the mainland.
""It is a breach (of protocol) on the high seas, because they do not want us to know what they are doing and the activities they carry out,"" said Defense Minister Oswaldo Jarrin.
He said turning off satellite equipment violated rules created by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs), a group of international agencies that promote sustainable fishing.
The New Zealand-based South Pacific RFMO, one of the organizations that provides guidance on fishing practices in the area, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 
Since 2017, the Chinese fishing fleet has arrived in the summer months to the outskirts of the Galapagos protected area, attracted by marine species such as the giant squid or the hammerhead shark, the latter of which is threatened species.
China has promised a ""zero tolerance"" policy toward illegal fishing, and it has authorized the Andean country to supervise the vessels. 

It has also proposed a fishing moratorium in the area near the Galapagos between September and November, though the fleets usually leave the area before that period begins.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean indigenous leader who has spent more than 100 days on hunger strike over his detention during the coronavirus pandemic has agreed to end it after negotiations with the government, the justice minister said on Tuesday.
Celestino Cordova, a member of the Mapuche people who have fought for decades against landowners and the wood pulp industry, was jailed for 18 years in 2014 for his participation in a fatal arson attack on an elderly landowning couple.
His hunger strike sparked protests and brought attention from international human rights groups including the United Nations. 
Justice Minister Hernan Larrain said he had spoken to Cordova who had agreed to end his strike in return for guarantees, including being allowed to return home for 30 hours to conduct a totem blessing ceremony important to the Mapuche people he represents. 
The government was also negotiating an improvement in conditions for other jailed Mapuche people in Chile's Araucania region, a rural, forested zone 400 miles (645 km) south of the capital, Larrain said. 
""This solution shows that in the most difficult situations, dialogue is the best way, especially in an area like Araucania, where there is so much complexity and historical conflict,"" he told a press conference in Santiago.
A spokeswoman for Cordova did not respond to a request for confirmation of the deal. 
The Cordova case - and an associated strike by more than 20 other Mapuche prisoners - has generated another headache for the centre-right government of embattled President Sebastian Pinera. 
Last October saw several months of widespread social protests over inequality and more recently the government has been criticised by opposition groups for a patchy response to the economic hardship brought about by the pandemic. 
The Mapuche are famous for their fierce resistance to the Spanish conquest of Chile and have struggled to claim what they deem as their ancestral land.
Cordova's hunger strike also generated debate between legal experts about whether the hospital treating him could ethically force feed him, following a court order that doctors intervene including against his will.

The Supreme Court placed Uribe, perhaps the South American country's most divisive politician, under detention in a unanimous decision that cited potential for obstruction of justice. He has said he is innocent.
In a resignation letter to the Senate president posted on Twitter, Uribe listed a variety of reasons that he said had prompted him to ""annul any expectation that I can return to the Senate.""
Along with his house arrest, Uribe said eight procedural guarantees had been violated and that wiretaps which form part of the case were illegal. He also said his ""political and journalistic adversaries"" had received selective leaks of case documents.
The whole of a more than 1,500-page court document regarding the house arrest ruling became public a few days after the decision.
In his letter, Uribe expressed his support for a judicial reform proposed by his Democratic Center party that has gained steam amid his court case.
""I vote for a justice reform that de-politicizes by changing the system of electing magistrates,"" the letter said. ""The fight to defend the freedom of Colombia is an unrenounceable imperative.""
Uribe's seat is expected to be taken up by whichever remaining candidate on his party's list from the 2018 elections got the highest number of votes. 
The former president and several allies stand accused of engaging in witness tampering in an attempt to discredit allegations Uribe had ties to right-wing paramilitaries.
It is the first time ever a Colombian court has detained a former president.

Considered a kingmaker, Uribe has shepherded two successors to power since the end of his second term in 2010, including current President Ivan Duque, who has repeatedly said he believes his mentor is innocent.

Prime Minister Keith Rowley already claimed victory for the ruling People’s National Movement (PNM) on Aug. 10 after official results showed it won 22 out of the 41 electoral seats in the energy-rich Caribbean country while the UNC won 19 seats.
But the UNC called for a recount of five electoral seats, which nonetheless confirmed they had been won by its rival.
""After some days of reflection and monitoring of the progress of the election recount process, I am satisfied that the people have spoken and that Dr. Rowley and his party shall form the new government of Trinidad and Tobago,"" UNC political leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar said in a statement.
Rowley faces an uphill challenge containing the coronavirus outbreak in the twin-island nation. His government also faces challenges in boosting an economy flailing in the wake of lower energy prices and stemming illegal immigration from Venezuela.

The video, which went viral on YouTube on Monday, shows plastic bags filled with cash bundles apparently being given to two then senior Senate staffers who worked for the opposition National Action Party (PAN).
The source of the video remains unclear, as does the date and location it was recorded. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xA1hCymFqs 
In his daily news conference on Tuesday, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador showed the full video, and said he wondered if it may have been given to prosecutors by the former chief of state-run oil company Pemex, Emilio Lozoya, who faces bribery charges in a corruption trial that has shaken Mexican politics.
""This video that has come to light is quite strong. It shows the filth of the regime of corruption,"" Lopez Obrador said. He said he had no wider knowledge of the video.
Lopez Obrador, who swept to power in 2018 on an anti-corruption platform, has sought to paint former administrations as part of a political elite beholden to the interests of the wealthy business groups.
A leftist who favors state firms to lead energy production, he has also sought to roll back sweeping reforms that were enacted in 2013-2014 to give the private sector a larger role in Mexico's energy sector. 
Lopez Obrador on Monday said the public should see all evidence linked to bribes that he says were paid to lawmakers to aid the passage of those reforms.

Lozoya last week filed a complaint accusing former President Enrique Pena Nieto and a senior aide of ordering a wide-ranging bribery scheme.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will likely travel to New York on Thursday to seek a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran and meet with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, diplomats and a U.N. official said. 
To trigger a return of the sanctions, the United States will submit a complaint to the 15-member U.N. Security Council about Iran's non-compliance with the nuclear deal, even though Washington quit the accord in 2018. 
Pompeo will likely meet with Indonesia's U.N. Ambassador Dian Triansyah Djani, the Security Council president for August, to submit the complaint, diplomats said. Pompeo is also due to meet with Guterres, a U.N. official said. 
In response to what the United States calls its ""maximum pressure"" campaign - a bid to get Iran to negotiate a new deal - Tehran has breached several central limits of the 2015 deal, including on its stock of enriched uranium.
But diplomats say the sanctions snapback process will be tough and messy as Russia, China and other countries on the Security Council challenge the legality of the U.S. move given that Washington itself is no longer complying with what Trump called the ""worst deal ever"" and has imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran.
The United States had threatened to use the sanctions snapback provision in the nuclear deal after it lost a bid in the Security Council on Friday to extend an arms embargo on Tehran, which is due to expire in October.
Once Washington submits its complaint about Iran to the Security Council, the body has 30 days to adopt a resolution to extend sanctions relief for Tehran or else the measures will automatically snapback. Any attempt to extend the sanctions relief would be vetoed by the United States. 

The U.S. mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The measure was proposed by the government after a rare public debate about sex crimes, which followed a social media campaign that led to the arrest of a suspected sex offender.
A new article added to the Criminal Procedure Law would ban investigative authorities from disclosing information about victims in such crimes, except to defendants or their lawyers. It will take effect once approved by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
""When we observed that there is a reluctance to report specific crimes... and that some of the victims feared for their reputation from being named in such crimes, the government submitted a bill to encourage citizens to report these crimes,"" Justice Minister Omar Marwan told parliament on Sunday.
Last month the public prosecutor charged Ahmed Bassam Zaki, a university student, with indecent assault of at least three women. He had been the target of a campaign on Instagram from an account that included postings by women accusing him of sex crimes. He is being held pending investigation. 
The case drew widespread attention from media, religious figures and women's groups.
Campaigners say a deep-rooted bias in the conservative, Muslim-majority nation means women often face more blame for behaviour deemed provocative than men face for sex crimes.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A stranger disguised as Batman is prowling the streets of Santiago delivering food to the homeless, providing sustenance and light-hearted solace to those in need following months of lockdown in the Chilean capital. 
The man, who wears a shiny batman suit complete with a coronavirus-ready sanitary facemask, delivers a few dozen plates of hot food to homeless people throughout the South American capital on a regular basis.
He said he prefers not to be identified.
""Look around you, see if you can dedicate a little time, a little food, a little shelter, a word sometimes of encouragement to those who need it"", he said, adding the disguise was meant to bring good cheer and unite.
Restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of coronavirus have devastated Chile's economy. Unemployment has sky rocketed to over 12% in Chile, breaking a decade-long record, and much of the capital Santiago continues to operate at half mast.
And despite the Batman suit, Simon Salvador, one of the recipients, said the true sentiment was clear.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Tuesday that Palestinians were not concerned about the normalisation deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, referring to the accord as ""nonsense"". 
In his first public remarks since the U.S.-sponsored deal was announced last week, Abbas accused the Gulf Arab state of turning its back on Palestinians living under occupation in the West Bank and an Israeli-led blockade in Gaza.
However, Abbas said: ""We aren't worried about the nonsense that happens here and there and especially in recent days, when a trilateral agreement between the Emirates, Israel and America was announced."" 
Israel, long shunned by most Arab and Muslim countries in the region, on Thursday agreed with the UAE to forge full relations, angering Palestinians who have long looked to oil-rich Gulf states for support in their quest for statehood. 
""They (the UAE) have turned their backs on everything: the rights of the Palestinian people, the Palestinian state, the two-state solution, and the holy city of Jerusalem,"" Abbas said during a meeting of factions in the West Bank city of Ramallah. 
Abbas, 84, accused the UAE of trying to justify the deal by arguing it helped stop Israeli annexations in the West Bank, a move which the United States says it will not consent to for ""some time"" in order to focus on implementing the agreement. [nL8N2FJ3Z8]
In a rare sign of unity, Abbas's meeting at his presidential compound was attended by rival groups including the Islamist group Hamas, which rules Gaza and from which Abbas's Fatah party, which dominates the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, has long been estranged. 
Although senior Palestinian officials have called for an urgent meeting of the Arab League over the deal, few countries have come to the Palestinians' defence in wake of the agreement.
Kuwait said its position towards Israel is unchanged, while Saudi Arabia and Qatar have remained silent. 
Others, like Bahrain and Oman, have welcomed the deal, stirring speculation that the two Gulf states could follow in formalising ties with Israel. [nL8N2FI0GR]

The Palestinians seek a state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

DUBAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The fate of a fragile 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers hinges on the result of the U.S. presidential election in November, not a planned U.S. bid this week to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Tehran, said several Iranian officials. 
When Iran agreed to sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program, Tehran warned that it would no longer stick to the deal if any of the parties sparked a so-called snapback of sanctions at the U.N. Security Council, a backstop included in the accord in case Iran stopped complying. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration plans this week to use that snapback provision, even though it quit the deal in 2018 and the move is opposed by the remaining parties to the accord - Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and Iran. 
But despite Tehran's declaration five years ago, three senior Iranian officials told Reuters that Iran's leadership is determined to remain committed to the nuclear deal, hoping that a victory by Trump's political rival Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 presidential election will salvage the pact. 
""Right now the decision is to remain in the deal even if Americans make their biggest mistake of triggering the snapback mechanism,"" said a senior official, on condition of anonymity, who is involved in the discussions about Iran's nuclear policy. 
""We will be still here, but Trump might not be at the White House in a few months,"" the official said. 
Biden has said he would rejoin the nuclear deal, but only if Iran first returned to compliance. The accord was agreed by former U.S. President Barack Obama's administration, when Biden was vice president. 
A second Iranian official - a former nuclear negotiator - said Iran was ""technically and politically"" ready to quit.
""But we have to be smart and not to fall in the U.S. trap which wants to push Iran out of the deal,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
'ENORMOUS LEVERAGE'
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has described the next few weeks and months as critical for the nuclear deal. 
To trigger a return if all U.N. sanctions on Iran the United States will submit a complaint to the 15-member Security Council about Iran's non-compliance with the nuclear deal.
In response to what Washington calls its ""maximum pressure"" campaign - a bid to get Iran to negotiate a new deal - Tehran has breached several central limits of the 2015 deal, including on its stock of enriched uranium.
But diplomats say the snapback process will be tough and messy as Russia, China and other countries on the Security Council challenge the legality of the U.S. move given Washington itself is no longer complying with what Trump called ""worst deal ever"" and has imposed strong unilateral sanctions on Iran.
A European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the U.S. move to spark a return of all U.N. sanctions would risk ""destroying"" the nuclear deal, but ""it will be a completely contested procedure so the snapback will have no effect, it will not be recognized by others.""
The United States argues it can trigger the return of the sanctions because it is still named as a participant to the nuclear deal in a 2015 U.N. Security Council resolution that enshrines the agreement. 
A second European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said ""the overwhelming majority of the international community"" believe the United States cannot trigger snapback. 
Outgoing U.S. Iran envoy Brian Hook said on Tuesday that the nuclear deal, while well intentioned, had failed to deter Iran.

""We have put in place enormous leverage for a (Trump) second term to get the kind of outcomes that we're going to need,"" he told a United Against Nuclear Iran think tank event.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Flames are tearing through Brazil's Pantanal, the world's largest wetland, coming close to the region's main highway and threatening endangered species, as the area records the most fires in 15 years for the month of August so far.
Brazil's national space research agency Inpe has registered 3,121 fires in the first 15 days of August, nearly five times higher than the same period a year ago. At the current pace, fires could approach the all-time record for any month since records began in 1998.
""It is extremely difficult to combat, control and combat again a fire with the dimensions that we have seen here in the Pantanal,"" said Paulo Barroso, president of the local firefighting committee.
Firefighters in the area worked to douse smoldering earth that was charred black as clouds of smoke billowed hundreds of feet into the air.
Roughly 8,500 square kilometers, or nearly 6% of the Pantanal, has already burned in January to July, according to government data.
The Pantanal is 10 times the size of the Everglades wetlands in the U.S. state of Florida. The region is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet with more than 4,700 plant and animal species, including threatened ones like the jaguar, according to advocacy group WWF.
Most of the largest sanctuary for the blue Hyacinthine Macaw parrots has gone up in flames this year, Brazil's Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported.
The region has been suffering from below-average rainfall and higher-than-average temperatures in the past 30 days, according to data provider Refinitiv.

The blazes in the Pantanal come amid rising concerns about fires in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), its much larger neighbor to the north. Fires spiked in the first few days of August in the Amazon, but were down by 17% for Aug. 1-15, compared with the same period a year ago.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - In the latest wave of panic-buying triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, South African smokers on Tuesday snapped up all the cigarettes they could lay their hands on after the lifting of a five-month ban designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
As part of a broader easing of restrictions, President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday announced the end of a ban on sales of tobacco products and alcohol, effective from midnight on Monday.
Customers, wary of shortages or future bans, bought whatever they could on Tuesday, in scenes reminiscent of panic-buying of groceries at the start of the country's lockdown in March.
""People are not buying packets, they are buying cartons,"" said an executive at a Pick N Pay Express store, who did not want to be named.
""I have a feeling that we may go back to level 3 (higher alert level), that is why I am buying a few packs,"" a customer queuing at a tobacco store in Johannesburg's Melville suburb said, again asking not to be named. 
Many shoppers faced empty shelves as companies struggled to fulfil restocking orders. 
In April, Ramaphosa said tobacco sales would be allowed but later changed his mind, citing concerns the sharing of cigarettes could spread the virus.
This attracted court cases from local tobacco manufacturers association FITA and international company British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) South Africa.
""If the government goes back to a higher alert level, cigarettes could be banned again and we don't want that to happen,"" said Sinenhlanhla Mnguni, Chairman of Fair-Trade Independent Tobacco Association (FITA), adding that FITA will pursue its case the ban was unlawful. 
BATSA, which sells brands such as Dunhill and Lucky Strike, and Phillip Morris International, seller of Marlboro and Chesterfield, did not respond to emails seeking comment. 
In a statement on Monday, BATSA urged the government to crack down on a black market in cigarettes that emerged during the lockdown.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan on Tuesday confirmed having contacts with Israel, saying the United Arab Emirates' decision to normalise relations with Israel is ""a brave and bold step"", according to its foreign ministry spokesman. 
Under the U.S.-brokered deal announced last week, the UAE becomes the just third Arab country to forge full relations with Israel in more than 70 years. The pact could reshape Middle East politics from the Palestinian issue to the fight against Iran.
In February, Israeli officials said Israel and Sudan had agreed to move towards forging normal relations for the first time during a meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of Sudan's military-led, transitional sovereign council, in Uganda. 
""The Emirates' move is a brave and bold step and contributes to putting the Arab world on the right track to build peace in the region and to build sustainable peace,"" Sudanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Haydar Sadig told Reuters by phone on Tuesday, confirming remarks made earlier to regional media.
""I cannot deny that there are contacts between Sudan and Israel,"" he added.
Netanyahu welcomed the remarks, saying on Twitter: ""Israel, Sudan and the entire region will benefit from the peace agreement (with the UAE), and together can build a better future for all people in the region. We will do whatever is necessary to turn this vision into a reality.""
Back in February, Burhan confirmed the meeting with Netanyahu but cast doubt on any rapid normalisation of ties, saying Sudan's stance on the Palestinian issue remains unchanged, and that relations between the two countries was the responsibility of the civilian cabinet in Khartoum. 
Scores of Sudanese protesters condemned Burhan's meeting with Netanyahu in February. Under the long rule of Islamist strongman Omar al-Bashir until his fall in a popular uprising in 2019, Khartoum counted among hardline Muslim foes of Israel.
Sadig said any normalisation of relations with Israel would not be at the expense of ""Sudan's moral values and independence"" and be ""according to Sudan's interests"".
""We will not accept unequal relations with Israel.""
Israel says it expects other Gulf Arab countries and Muslim nations in Africa to follow in normalising ties after its breakthrough with the UAE.

Soldiers from the NDC-R, a rebel group seen as having close ties with the national army, sang and danced before handing over an assortment of small arms at a ceremony on Monday in the village of Kashuga, about 75 km (46 miles) north of Goma.
Fighting has raged between two groups of the NDC-R since July 9 when a section loyal to deputy leader Gilbert Bwira Shuo attempted to oust their leader Shimiray Guidon, who is the target of U.N. sanctions, accusing him of human rights abuses.
""As you have just consented to become a government soldier, each of you come and lay down your weapon,"" Bwira told the group of fighters, who wore a hodge-podge of camouflage, European football shirts and rubber boots.
The surrender does not necessarily mean an end to their involvement in rebel fighting, said Christoph Vogel, a researcher at Ghent University in Belgium.
There was a big risk that the combatants might take up arms again after a year or two, he said.
""That's been happening many, many times across eastern Congo over the past 20 years,"" Vogel said.
Before the split, the NDC-R controlled vast areas of North Kivu province near the border of Rwanda and Uganda. 
It earned money from the illicit gold trade and was frequently accused of being used by the army as a proxy force against other armed groups.
""Today we think it's time for us to surrender, lay down our arms and take part in the pacification of the country,"" said spokesman Desire Ngabo Kisuba.
Kade Wabo, a Kashuga resident who watched the ceremony, said he remained wary of the group but was glad to see them lay down their weapons.

The court found Alexander Shabarchin, a political activist in Perm, some 1,150 kilometres (715 miles) east of Moscow, guilty of hooliganism, a charge he denied. 
The incident in 2018 involved a mannequin with a cardboard Putin mask wearing a white plastic jumpsuit with black stripes. It bore the words ""war criminal"" on its chest and ""liar"" on its forehead, social media pictures showed. 
Political activists and human rights advocates said Shabarchin's jail sentence was a violation of his freedom of speech and a sign of growing state repression. 
""It has been made clear: you can only say good things about Putin, nothing else. Laughing at him is also forbidden,"" said Sergei Ukhov, a Perm activist who supports opposition politician Alexei Navalny.

Greece and Cyprus are locked in a dispute with Turkey over overlapping claims to areas thought to be rich in natural gas. Two Turkish survey vessels are in areas claimed by Greece and Cyprus. Turkey says it has rights over the areas in question. 
While not referring to Turkey directly, Cypriot Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides said the island had maritime deals with Egypt, Israel and Lebanon ""and was ready to discuss with other neighbouring states on establishing sea zones"".
Turkey is its closest neighbour and the only country it does not have a deal with, bar war-ravaged Syria.
""This would be on the basis of international law and the 1982 Law of the Sea,"" Christodoulides said, referring to a United Nations treaty.
Turkey does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, so any take-up of Nicosia's offer would be unlikely.
Christodoulides was speaking in Nicosia following talks with Nikos Dendias, his Greek counterpart. Dendias said he expected EU foreign ministers to discuss a list of sanctions against Turkey next week.
""This escalation of Turkish aggression is directed against the European Union, and consequently, there should be an escalation of the European reaction to counter it,"" Dendias said. 
Cyprus was split after a 1974 Turkish invasion spurred by a brief coup engineered by the military then ruling Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in north Cyprus is recognised only by Ankara.
Turkey questions Cyprus's right to explore in the seas around the island because it maintains that the Nicosia administration does not represent the interests of Turkish Cypriots - an argument dismissed by Cyprus.

In Turkey's dispute with Greece, the two countries are at odds over the delimitation of their continental shelves.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jets believed to be Russian bombed several towns in rebel-held northwestern Syria in a new flare-up of violence since a Turkish-Russian deal that halted major fighting nearly six months ago, witnesses said.
War planes flying at high altitude, which tracking centres said were Russian Sukhoi jets, dropped bombs on the Harbanoush and Sheikh Bahr Nahr areas where makeshift camps house tens of thousands of displaced families.
""There were over 20 raids we have monitored by Russian jets stationed in Hmeimim air base,"" said Abdullah Sawan, a volunteer plane spotter whose network covers the Russian air base in the western coastal province of Latakia. 
Russian jets this month bombed mountainous areas in Latakia where rebel fighters are dug in and civil defence witnesses said jets struck a camp for displaced people near the town of Binish in Idlib province that killed at least three civilians. 
Russian jets in June made the first air strikes since the deal brokered in March between Russia, which backs Syrian President Bashar al Assad’s forces, and Turkey, which supports opposition fighters. [L8N2DL52B]
Rebels say the Syrian army and its allied militias were amassing troops on front lines. 
There was no immediate comment from Moscow nor the Syrian army who accuse militant groups of wrecking the deal and deny any indiscriminate attacks on civilians.
Russia said last week the joint military patrols in Idlib, carried out along the M4 highway linking Syria's east and west, had been suspended over increasing militant attacks in the area. 
The March deal ended a Russian-backed bombing campaign that had displaced over a million people in the region which borders Turkey after months of fighting that killed hundreds.
Residents also said the jet strikes coincided with heavy artillery shelling by the Syrian army of several villages in Jabal al Zawya in southern Idlib.
Moscow has established a major presence in Syria where its airforce and military bases across the country have allowed Syrian President Bashar al Assad in recent years to defeat rebels who rose up against his authoritarian rule.

Lemma was replaced by Kenea Yadeta, the former security chief of Oromiya region, Abiy's office said on Twitter. Nine other top officials were also replaced, including the attorney general, his deputy and the mining minister. 
Abiy has promised to hold the first free and fair elections in Africa's second most populous nation next year, but his democratic reforms have also unleashed ethnic divisions that frequently spill into violence. 
Lemma was once a trusted ally of Abiy but relations soured in November after he publicly criticised Abiy's decision to consolidate the ethnically based-parties in the ruling coalition into one political party, the Prosperity Party. Last week, Prosperity Party suspended Lemma's membership. 
Abiy's father and Lemma both come from Oromiya, the most populous of Ethiopia's 10 regions. Oromiya is a political weathervane: the region spearheaded the bloody street protests that propelled Abiy to power in 2018. 
But Abiy's support there is being eroded. Bloody protests sparked by assassination of a popular singer killed more than 178 people there last month, triggering mass arrests.
International rights groups have also criticised the military for abuses during operations against an insurgency in western Oromiya.
Lemma's removal may further whittle away support for Abiy, said political analyst Mohamed Olad. 
""Lemma enjoys wider support and approval in Oromia than Abiy,"" he said. ""Whether he will activate that reservoir of goodwill depends on two things. First, whether he will be free to exercise his political rights ...(and) whether he is willing to play an active role in politics.""
Lemma's criticism joined a growing swell of voices - some from Oromiya - who accuse Abiy of trying to centralise power and of rolling back his democratic reforms.
Kjetil Tronvoll, professor of peace and conflict studies at Bjørknes University in Oslo, told Reuters that the debate whether to centralise or devolve power was at the heart of Ethiopia's fractious politics.
""This is the key controversy in all federal arrangements - the power balance between the federal and regional states,"" he said. 
If the Oromo youth who helped Abiy to power turn against him, it could pose a problem during the elections, Tronvoll said.

Unrest in Oromiya not Abiy's only worry. The northern Tigray region, whose people dominated the last administration, has announced it will hold regional elections this month in defiance of a government decision to postpone polls across the nation due to the outbreak of the coronavirus.

Those terms include addressing what Washington says is Moscow's build-up of shorter-range nuclear weapons that are not covered by the treaty, and making the verification system more robust, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Arms Control Marshall Billingslea told reporters in a telephone briefing.
""Russia understands our position. And what remains to be seen is if there is the political will in Moscow to get this deal done. The ball is now in Russia's court,"" Billingslea said after the latest round of talks in Vienna with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov.
Washington has insisted that any deal to replace the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) must include China, but Billingslea appeared to soften that stance, saying a framework would be built that ""can include China in due course"".
Last year Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, with senior officials saying Moscow had deployed a cruise missile across Russia in violation of the INF pact. Russia said the missile's range puts it outside the treaty. Washington now wants a deal covering all warheads.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Dozens of doctors in at least two of Kenya's 47 counties have gone on strike over delayed salaries, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for handling COVID-19 patients and lack of medical insurance, a union official told Reuters.
Kenya has a total 30,636 confirmed infections, with 487 deaths, according to health ministry data.
Healthcare workers say they have not been given adequate PPE, but the government has said it has distributed enough to go round.
Doctors in western Homa Bay and central Embu had gone on strike over delayed or missing salary payments, lack of promotion, missing medical insurance and no hazard bonus, Allan Ochanji, vice chairman of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union, told Reuters.
Doctors who contracted COVID-19 had been forced to pay out of pocket for their own treatment, he told Reuters in an interview.
""We have colleagues who have contracted COVID, they have been in isolation, they have had to foot the bills, despite the fact that they contracted COVID while on duty,"" Ochanji said.
Doctors in Nairobi, the nation's capital, warned on Friday they would go on strike within a week if their demands were not met. Nairobi has by far the largest number of coronavirus cases. 
Richard Muga, Homa Bay County health executive, confirmed that health workers' July pay had been delayed due to a dispute on how to allocate revenues to counties. He said the strike was illegal.
""We have tried to engage the health workers,"" he said. ""They have not heeded our pleas.""
A nurse in one Homa Bay hospital who did not want to be identified said patients were no longer visiting public health facilities due to the strike.
""Many patients are now going to private hospitals, or doing over-the-counter medication,"" he said.
Health officials from Nairobi and Embu counties did not return calls seeking to comment. The health ministry said on Friday that Nairobi County officials were in talks with the doctors.
The ministry of health said eight healthcare workers had died from COVID-19. Ochanji said 558 healthcare workers had tested positive.
Nairobi-based Doreen Lugaliki became the first doctor to die of COVID-19 in July. This month nurse Marian Awuor, from Homa Bay, died from COVID-19 days after giving birth.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's clerical and military elite is turning up the volume of its rhetoric against a surprise agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Tehran's arch-foe Israel to normalise ties. But the bark appears to be worse than the bite.
Iranian authorities have harshly criticised last week's U.S.- brokered deal, with some officials warning that the UAE and Israel cosying up to one another risks conflagration in the Middle East. Others made veiled threats against the Gulf state.
But so far, that is it. Tehran did not recall its charge d'affaires or cut ties with the UAE, as some other countries have done.
""Iran's leadership has always favoured peace and not tension, particularly with its neighbours,"" said a senior official who is close to Iran's top decision-makers. 
""We always act based on Iran's national interests. Tehran will not take any aggressive measure as long as its interests are not endangered.""
With business ties to Iran stretching back over a century, the emirate of Dubai, 150 km (100 miles) across the Gulf, has long been one of Iran's main links to the outside world.
Analysts said Tehran can ill afford to lose Dubai as a trade route, particularly since heavy U.S. sanctions have drastically reduced its oil exports and made doing international business increasingly complicated.
""Iran's leaders will never cut the branch they are sitting on,"" said Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leylaz, recalling that Dubai remains one of Iran's main links to the outside world. 
Iran's state news agency IRNA in June cited Iranian authorities as saying that the UAE, Iran's second trade partner after China, would continue to process a huge part of Tehran’s imports and exports.
To avoid worsening Iran's isolation, its clerical rulers decided to refrain from taking an aggressive approach to the region's changing geopolitics, said another Iranian official.
""Tehran will not benefit from any hasty measure because other countries like Oman, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia might normalise ties with Israel as well,"" said the official, who also asked not to be named because of sensitivity of the matter. 
""FLYING ISRAELI FLAG""
Israel and the UAE have long maintained a not-so-secret relationship over mutual interests, but the deal firms up opposition to Iran, a regional power seen as a threat by the UAE, Israel and the United States.
""The potential of the Israeli flag flying in the UAE, which is a very, very important trading partner of Iran, is a major setback for Iranian leverage in the region,"" said Meir Javedanefar, a lecturer at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya in Israel. 
Some Iranian insiders worry that exercising restraint over the UAE could make the Islamic Republic look weak among the political and paramilitary allies in the region who have expanded Iran’s reach in the past 20 years.
For this reason, the possibility that Iran's proxies might signal displeasure with the Israel-UAE accord by staging low-level incidents cannot be ruled out, said a regional official.
""Don't be surprised if you witness small-scale explosions, bomb, drone or missile attacks in the region in the coming weeks,"" he said. 
Some of the more militant of Iran's hardliners might see as a provocation the fact that the UAE-Israel deal means official Israeli interests will openly be stationed closer to Iran's borders in the Gulf, the former Iranian diplomat said.
After all, since its 1979 Islamic revolution, confrontation with Israel has been one of Iran's foreign policy pillars and Iranian officials have repeatedly called for an end to Israel.
REGIONAL AMBITIONS
Opposition to Israel is also part of the glue that unites Iran with a regional web of allied militias and groups that help push Iranian interests, from Iraq to Lebanon and Yemen to Syria.
Israel is particularly concerned about suspected Iranian efforts to develop nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies. 
But despite tough rhetoric in past crises, Iranian and Israeli officials have never indicated any interest in all-out war. 
And with its economy squeezed hard by U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus crisis, mobilising proxies will impose huge financial and political costs on Iran, where many Iranians already resent the establishment's regional ambitions. 
As frustration simmers, analysts say Iran is in the throes of popular unrest over the country's economic grievances. Iran's deteriorating economy has prompted widespread protests since late 2017.

""I don't care about the Palestinian cause, I don't care about regional politics. I care about my family,"" said Masoumeh Saburi, 36, a single mother of two in Tehran whose husband is jobless. ""I am struggling to provide food for my children.""

(Reuters) - Mauritius has arrested the captain of a Japanese bulk carrier that ran aground off its coast, causing a devastating oil spill in one of the world's most pristine maritime environments, police said on Tuesday.
""We have arrested the captain of the vessel and another member of the crew. After having been heard by the court they have been denied bail and are still in detention,"" Inspector Siva Coothen told Reuters.
The MV Wakashio struck a coral reef off the Indian Ocean island nation on July 25 and began spilling oil on Aug. 6, prompting the government to announced a state of ""environmental emergency"" the next day.
The oil spill spread over a vast area of endangered corals, fish and other marine life in what some scientists called the country's worst ecological disaster. Emergency crews managed to remove most of the remaining oil before the carrier split in two on Saturday.
The Mauritius coastguard had repeatedly tried to reach the ship to warn that its course was dangerous but had received no reply, a maritime official with knowledge of the incident who asked not to be named told Reuters.
""The route set five days before the crash was wrong and the boat navigation system should have signaled that to the crew and it seems the crew ignored it. The boat did also fail to send out an SOS (when it ran aground), and did not respond to attempts by the coast guard to get in touch,"" the official said. 
Local media have reported that the crew were having a birthday party on board. Coothen and the official declined to comment on the reports but the official said an examination of the ship's black box might reveal whether that was true. 

Scientists say the full impact of the spill is still unfolding, but the damage could affect Mauritius and its tourism-dependent economy for decades. Removing the ship is likely to take months.

Laschet, premier of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, is one of the leading candidates to run as the chancellor candidate of the conservative bloc. His main rival is Markus Soeder, premier of Bavaria.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Pupils at more than a dozen Thai high schools raised three-finger ""Hunger Games"" salutes during the national anthem on Tuesday in a sign of spreading support for student-led anti-government protests.
Demonstrations that began on university campuses have taken place almost daily since mid-July in an increasing challenge to the ruling establishment in the Southeast Asian country that has long been dominated by the army and the monarchy.
High school protests during morning assemblies began in at least eight schools on Monday. The three-finger salute has been a symbol of calls for democracy since Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha first took power in a 2014 coup.
Some students also wore white ribbons to show their support for protesters, who seek Prayuth's departure, a new constitution and an end to the harassment of activists. Some students have also called for reforms to the monarchy, once a taboo subject. 
""I want to show that I don't like dictatorship and want true democracy,"" said one 17-year-old student who joined the protest at a government school on Monday and said she did not want to be named for fear of reprisals after pressure from teachers.
The school did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan said at an educational fair in Bangkok on Monday that the students had the right to express themselves and should not be punished, but also warned that there was a limit to how far they should go.
Prayuth told reporters he was willing to listen to the students but questioned the motives of some.
""I heard from some students that those that don't want to take part in these actions gets bullied into doing it,"" he said.
Protesters accuse Prayuth of holding on to power unfairly after elections last year under rules drawn up his junta. He says the elections were fair.
Apart from the political demands, some pupils complain of a school system which emphasises obedience and tradition, from lining up daily for the national anthem to strict rules on uniforms, haircuts and behaviour.
""Students see politics through the lens of school life that lacks democracy and has many highly authoritarian elements,"" said Prajak Kongkirati, a political scientist at Thammasat University in Bangkok. 
""What we are witnessing is the beginning of a social revolution.""
A hashtag that translates as #WhiteRibbonAgainstDictatorship was used nearly 1 million times on Twitter while others trending included #ThreeFingersForNationalAnthem.
Videos shared on social media show some teachers trying to stop students from giving the salutes, but in other schools teachers have joined in raising their hands.
Increasing support for the protest movement was evident in Bangkok on Sunday when more than 10,000 people joined the biggest demonstration for years.

High school students said they were planning further protests on Wednesday, including one at the Ministry of Education.

CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - Clint Parry ransacked every kitchen cupboard and scoured all corners of his fridge during lockdown in Detroit, hunting for lost ingredients and leftovers to whip up meals.
The 33-year-old is one of many people across the world to have embraced thriftiness and cut down on food waste during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to experts. They say the new habits, if maintained, will provide a major boost in tackling another global crisis: climate change.
""We are using virtually all of our leftovers, where we used to waste food because we would forget to pack it and just pick up fast food on a lunch break,"" said Parry, who is married and works as a master model builder at Legoland in Michigan. 
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that a third of the world's food is wasted every year. Forests are cleared, fuel is burnt and packaging in produced just to provide food which is thrown away. Meanwhile, rotting food in landfills releases more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
As a result, food waste is responsible for around 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a similar amount to road transportation.
""The next crisis will be the climate crisis and the best thing you can do as a consumer is reduce food waste,"" said Toine Timmermans, program manager for sustainable food chains at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
Household food waste in Britain, to take one country, fell significantly in the early phase of the lockdown in April with just 14% of four key items - bread, chicken, milk and potatoes - thrown away, according to research by environmental group WRAP, which conducted thousands of interviews.
Pre-lockdown, an average of 24% had been wasted.
Waste had begun to rebound by June, with a second WRAP survey putting waste of those products at 18%, but remained significantly below pre-lockdown levels.
""Although people are reporting wasting more food as restrictions lift ... the positive news is that 70% of people want to maintain their new-found food management behaviors in the long term,"" said Richard Swannell, director at WRAP Global which works with governments to reduce food waste.
""This is an encouraging sign that people are taking this opportunity to adopt less wasteful habits in life after lockdown.""
PLAN MORE, COOK MORE
Food security has been a major concern during the pandemic as consumers panic-bought basic goods, migrant workers struggled to get to the fields, meat-packing plants shut, and farm goods produced for shuttered restaurants rotted. 
But the lower household food waste has been one bright spot.
Out of necessity, consumers have become more organized in planning menus, developed new cooking skills, checked their cupboards and fridges more before they shop and found better ways to use up leftovers, according to food waste experts. 
""What people have been forced to do during the pandemic is plan ahead because they're now shopping less frequently,"" said Dana Gunders, executive director at ReFED, a nonprofit dedicated to reducing wasted food across the United States.
""They're being forced to cook more and build those cooking skills.""
Laura Brooks, a stay-at-home mother of five in Weymouth, Massachusetts, said she had developed useful habits during the lockdown that she would keep.
""I think as things go back to normal, I may continue with less frequent shopping trips. When I go more often, I find that the new produce pushes the old produce out of sight and things get wasted more easily,"" she added. 
Increased frugality could prove a valuable habit in the economic and unemployment crisis caused by the pandemic; Gunders said a family of four in the United States was estimated to throw out food worth about $1,800 a year. 
TOO GOOD FOR THE BIN
A survey from Germany's Food and Agriculture Ministry also showed consumers had started to show more concern about wasting food during the coronavirus crisis.
The government had launched an anti-food waste campaign called ""Too good for the bin"" before the crisis, urging the public not to automatically throw food away after the sell-by date but to smell and taste it to see if it was still in good condition.
The ministry's survey, undertaken during the pandemic, found that 91% of German consumers questioned were now checking food after its sell-by date and not automatically throwing it away.
This compared to only 76% in a similar survey in 2016.
Food waste is not restricted to the home but it is the biggest source in many countries.
The European Union has published a study estimating that 53% of food waste was in households and 11% in production, with the balance in areas such as processing and retailing.
China's President Xi Jingping said this month that the amount of food wasted in China was ""shocking"", prompting many local governments to launch related campaigns. 
For Parry in Detroit, and many others, thrift is here to stay.

""Our food costs have definitely gone way down, since we are not buying out when we have perfectly consumable leftovers in the fridge at home,"" he said.

The ruling nationalists' position against gay rights has become a flash-point in a culture war pitting the religious right against more liberal-minded Poles.
Critics, including the European Union, have accused the Law and Justice (PiS) government of backtracking on womens' and LGBT rights and running a campaign laced with homophobic rhetoric in the run-up to last month's presidential election. 
""We are supporting a municipality that has a pro-family agenda, promotes support for well-functioning families, and fights against the imposed ideology of LGBT and gender, which is being pushed by the European Commission,"" Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro told a news conference.
The town of Tuchow in southern Poland will now receive 250,000 zlotys ($67,800) from the ministry's Justice Fund. 
Tuchow had its application for a European twinning programme rejected after it passed a motion rejecting ""LGBT ideology"". Under the programme the town could have applied for a grant of up to 25,000 euros.
EU Equality Commissioner Helena Dalli had said six town-twinning applications involving Polish authorities that adopted ""LGBTI free zones"" or ""family rights"" resolutions were rejected.
""We tried find out if there are any other municipalities mentioned by Commissioner Dalli. If we find any, we will reach out to them,"" Ziobro said.
Since the European Parliament elections last year, about d 100 municipalities across Poland have signed declarations saying they are free of ""LGBT ideology"". These have fuelled concern in Brussels, although they appear not to have been followed by legislation to discriminate against gay residents.
On Monday, figures from the arts including Nobel Prize-winning author Olga Tokarczuk, director Pedro Almodovar and writer Margaret Atwood signed a letter to the European Union calling on Poland's government to stop targeting the LGBT community.

The labour ministry said on Tuesday the new arrangement would apply to all shared spaces in offices and factories, but would not extend to individual offices where only one employee is present. 
It also said that working from home would remain its recommended option for employees. A government official said masks at work would become mandatory from Sept. 1. 
He further said there would be talks with employers and unions about borderline cases, such as when only two people are present in one large open-space and sitting well apart. 
Details will also be worked out for special work environments such as frozen food warehouses, where masks are not practical as they would freeze.
Mask-wearing is also compulsory nationwide on all public transport and in most indoor public spaces such as shops and museums, as well as in crowded outdoor areas in some cities.
France imposed some of Europe's toughest lockdown restrictions earlier this year, greatly reducing the rate of coronavirus infections. But in the past few weeks the numbers of new COVID-19 cases have climbed, and public health officials have warned that contagion could spin out of control.
The government has been under pressure from trade unions to step up protective measures in time for September, when people return to work after long summer holidays, and when children are due back at school.
""The best thing we can do to prepare for the return from vacations is to reassure employees that, together, we are taking the precautions to avoid spreading the virus,"" Elisabeth Borne, the labour minister, was quoted as saying by the ministry.

MINSK (Reuters) - Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, awarded medals ""for impeccable service"" on Tuesday to law enforcement officials who have helped him crack down on protesters demanding he step down in the 10 days since an election they say was stolen.
In an effort to clamp down on strikes that have hit some of the country's most important factories, the government also issued a message to managers of state-run plants telling them to ensure workers fulfil their duties or be disciplined. 
Lukashenko is under the biggest pressure of his 26-year-rule, with no sign of an end to the protests and strikes over the election, which the president says he won with 80 percent of the vote but protesters say was blatantly rigged.
At least two protesters have been killed and thousands detained in the post-election crackdown. Many of those detained have complained of punishment beatings, cramped conditions and starvation rations.
Opposition politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya says she was the rightful winner.
Tsikhanouskaya, who emerged as the consensus opposition candidate only after a number of others, including her husband, were jailed or barred from standing, has fled abroad, issuing calls via the internet to her followers to rise up.
Hundreds of protesters chanting ""shame"" gathered at a theatre in Minsk on Tuesday in solidarity with its director, who was fired for speaking out in support of the opposition. 
They were due later to converge on a prison where Tsikhanouskaya's husband has been detained since the end of May. Tuesday is his birthday. 
""ROTTEN SYSTEM""
""All of this outrageous, unfair lawlessness shows us how this rotten system works, where one person controls everything,"" Tsikhanouskaya said in a video on Tuesday.
""One man has kept the country in fear for 26 years. One man stole the choice of Belarusians,"" she said.
Attention is firmly focused on how Russia will respond to the biggest political crisis facing an ex-Soviet neighbour since 2014 in Ukraine, when Moscow intervened militarily after an allied leader was toppled by public protests.
Of all former Soviet republics, Belarus is the closest to Russia culturally, politically and economically, with a treaty that proclaims the two countries part of a ""union state"" with a Soviet-style red flag. But President Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko have had a difficult personal relationship.
European officials privately say the situation in Belarus is different from that in Ukraine six years ago, in part because the Belarus opposition is not necessarily seeking to loosen ties with Russia, merely to get rid of Lukashenko.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron both spoke to Putin by telephone on Tuesday. The Kremlin said Putin warned both of them against foreign meddling in the affairs of Belarus.
The European Union is gearing up to impose new sanctions on Balrus officials over the crackdown, while also searching for ways to promote a negotiated solution.
Sweden's foreign minister Ann Linde (NYSE:LIN) spoke by telephone with the Belarus minister of foreign affairs, Vladimir Makei. Linde offered to visit Minsk in her role as incoming chair of the OSCE, a security body that includes both Western countries and former Soviet states, and often mediates in the region. 
The protests over the election have been further fuelled by public anger over Lukashenko's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which he has dismissed as a 'psychosis', and economic grievances affecting swathes of Belarusian society.
The president was heckled by factory workers on Monday and has faced opposition from people normally seen as loyal. The Belarusian ambassador to Slovakia and four other diplomats have resigned in support for the demonstrators. 

A coordination council pushed by Tsikhanouskaya to facilitate a transition of power was due to meet in Minsk later on Tuesday for the first time.

MINSK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - When protests erupted after the disputed election in Belarus, Anna Koval transformed the office of the travel agency she runs in central Minsk into the headquarters of a volunteer operation helping casualties of a police crackdown.
Her group of around 10 people, some of them doctors able to provide first aid, coordinated on social media as best they could amid an internet blackout to tip each other off about the location of protesters in need and risks on the ground.
""They (the police) were really arresting ambulance staff, doctors, seizing medicine...,"" the 39-year-old said by phone from the Belarus capital, describing the first three nights after the Aug. 9 presidential election as ""terrifying.""
Alexander Lukashenko, the veteran leader who is the target of the protests, on Tuesday praised law enforcement officials for their ""impeccable service"".
One night, Koval helped treat five injured protesters. Some demonstrators were too scared to go to hospital fearing police retribution, she said. In several cases, Koval had doctors sent to protesters' homes. 
""They stitched them up at home.""
Police detained more than 6,000 people in the first few days of protests and fired rubber bullets and tear gas. Dozens of protesters and police officers were injured in the clashes and two people died.
Reuters spoke to several volunteers from similar groups that sprang up amid a groundswell of public anger against Lukashenko.
There has been a lull in violence between police and protesters, but tensions are high as the opposition demands Lukashenko cedes power while the leader of 26 years remains in his post.
Koval's group is now collecting food and personal hygiene products and distributing them to people in hospital and, with the help of the Red Cross, to those in jail, she said.
""My volunteering isn't about helping the new politics. My volunteer work is about helping people.
""I broke down when the first shot rang out. When the first shot sounded, it hit me and literally the very next day this headquarters was organised,"" she said.
Koval wants what she described as the climate of fear in Belarus to end.

""I'm not scared, I'm a free person. I want to live in a country that is just as free, and to openly show my face,"" she said. ""And maybe other people will see me and my guys, and will act like me.""

The statement followed a report in Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that the Trump administration planned a ""giant"" F-35 deal with the UAE as part of the Gulf country's U.S.-brokered move last week to normalise ties with Israel.
The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem and representatives of the UAE government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Under understandings dating back decades, Washington has refrained from Middle East arms sales that could blunt Israel's ""qualitative military edge"" (QME). This has applied to the F-35, denied to Arab states, while Israel has bought and deployed it.
""In the talks (on the UAE normalisation deal), Israel did not change its consistent positions against the sale to any country in the Middle East of weapons and defence technologies that could tip the (military) balance,"" Netanyahu's office said.
This opposition includes any proposed F-35 sale, it added.
The Trump administration has signalled that the UAE could clinch unspecified new U.S. arms sales after last Thursday's normalisation announcement. 
Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, an observer in Netanyahu's security cabinet, noted that past U.S. administrations had ""against our wishes"" sold the UAE more advanced F-16 warplanes than Israel possesses as well as F-15 warplanes to Saudi Arabia.
Even were Washington to sell F-35s to the UAE, Steinitz told public radio station Kan that they would be unlikely to pose a danger to Israel as the distance between the countries is more than twice the jet's range without refuelling.

""I would like to offer us reassurance. Any F-35 that ends up, ultimately, in the United Arab Emirates - not that we would be happy with this, as we always want to be the only ones (with such arms) in the region - threatens Iran far more than it does us,"" he said, citing a foe common to Israel and many Gulf Arabs.

Most other Western nations which have diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, including Germany, Britain and France, have already pulled staff out temporarily, citing the difficulty of rotating staff and bringing in supplies during the pandemic.
Sweden acts as the consular representative of the United States, Australia and Canada, among others, in North Korea. The Swedish foreign ministry said its embassy in Pyongyang remains open and staffed by local employees.
""What has happened is that we have relocated our diplomats, either as a result of holidays or rotation,"" a ministry spokesman said, adding that the situation was temporary.
""But naturally, the situation has become more difficult... as a result, among other things, of COVID 19,"" he said, without elaborating.
North Korea says it has zero confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but has taken significant measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
In January the reclusive state shut its borders completely, cancelled most flights and train services, and ordered foreign residents into more than a month of quarantine.

As part of their ""Blue Wings 2020"" manoeuvres, German and Israeli pilots flew over the Fuerstenfeldbruck military airfield near Munich to commemorate the attack which left 11 Israelis, a German policeman and five Palestinian gunmen dead.
A gunfight erupted at the airfield after Palestinians from the Black September group took members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage at the poorly secured athletes village on Sept. 5, 1972.
Later on Tuesday, the jets will fly over the site of the Dachau concentration camp where some 200,000 people, many of them Jews, were imprisoned and 41,500 murdered under Adolf Hitler's Nazis. Set up in 1933, it was meant as a model for other concentration camps.
Senior officials, including a relative of a camp survivor and German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer will take part in a ceremony there. 
Since 1945, Berlin has felt a special responsibility towards Israel and the joint manoeuvres are the first time Israeli fighter planes have trained in Germany. 
A rise in anti-Semitism, in particular an attack on a synagogue in Halle last year which left two people dead, has caused alarm in Germany. 
Luftwaffe chief of staff Ingo Gerhartz said the programme was a sign of friendship. The darkest chapter of German history handed the country the ""task to resolutely fight anti-Semitism today,"" he was quoted by broadcaster BR24 as saying.

LEIDSCHENDAM, Netherlands (Reuters) - A U.N.-backed tribunal on Tuesday said there was no evidence the leadership of Hezbollah or the Syrian government were involved in the 2005 killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri.
Four members of the Iran-backed Shi'ite movement Hezbollah are charged with conspiracy to carry out the massive bomb attack that killed Hariri and 21 other people.
Hariri, a Sunni Muslim billionaire, had close ties with the United States, Western and Sunni Gulf Arab allies, and was seen as a threat to Iranian and Syrian influence in Lebanon. He led efforts to rebuild Beirut following the 1975-1990 civil war.
""The trial chamber is of the view that Syria and Hezbollah may have had motives to eliminate Mr Hariri and his political allies, however, there is no evidence that the Hezbollah leadership had any involvement in Mr. Hariri's murder and there is no direct evidence of Syrian involvement,"" said Judge David Re, reading a summary of the court's decision.
Hezbollah has denied any involvement in the Feb. 14, 2005 bombing.
The reading of the verdict by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which began on Tuesday is expected to take several hours, comes as Lebanese are still reeling from the aftermath of a huge explosion that killed 178 people this month and from an economic meltdown that has shattered their lives.
Hariri's assassination plunged Lebanon into what was then its worst crisis since the war, setting the stage for years of confrontation between rival political forces.
Even before judges began reading their 2,600 page verdict into the Hariri's killing, Lebanon's an-Nahar daily ran a headline: 'International Justice Defeats Intimidation'.
The paper published a caricature of Hariri's face looking at a mushroom cloud over the devastated city, with a caption: ""May you also (get justice)"", referring to an investigation that could unveil the cause of the blast.
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Friday he was not concerned with the trial and that if any members of the group were convicted, it would stand by their innocence.
Hezbollah's Al Manar TV and the pro-Damascus Al Mayadeen channel did not cover the trial, which other broadcasters in Lebanon were airing live.
Beirut tour guide Nada Nammour, 54, speaking before the reading of the verdict began, said the 2005 bombing was a crime that should be punished. ""Lebanon needs to see law and justice.""
The verdict in The Hague may further polarise the already divided country and complicate an already tumultuous situation after the Aug. 4 blast at Beirut port, where authorities say ammonium nitrate stored unsafely detonated, fuelling public outrage and leading to the government's resignation.
Harri's killing removed a powerful Sunni leader and allowed the further political expansion of Shi'ite power led by Hezbollah and its allies in Lebanon.
JUSTICE 15 YEARS ON 
The judgment had initially been expected earlier this month, but was delayed after the port explosion.
The investigation and trial in absentia of the four Hezbollah members has taken 15 years and cost roughly $1 billion. It could result in a guilty verdict and later sentencing of up to life imprisonment, or acquittal.
DNA evidence showed that the blast that killed Hariri was carried out by a male suicide bomber who was never identified.
Prosecutors used cell phone records to argue the men on trial, Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hassan Habib Merhi, Assad Hassan Sabra and Hussein Hassan Oneissi, carefully monitored Hariri's movements in the months leading up to the attack to time it and to put forward a fake claim of responsibility as a diversion.
Court-appointed lawyers said there is no physical evidence linking the four to the crime and they should be acquitted. 
Hariri's son Saad, who took his father's mantle and has served as premier three times, has said he was not seeking revenge, but that justice must prevail.
Some Lebanese say they are now more concerned with finding out the truth behind the Beirut port blast.

""I do want to know what the verdict is ... but what matters now is who did this (port blast) to us because this touched more people,"" said Francois, a volunteer helping victims in a ruined district.

JUBA (Reuters) - Sudan and a major rebel group signed an agreement on Monday to integrate the rebels into the army within 39 months, signatories said, the latest in a slew of agreements between the Sudanese government and long-running insurgencies. 
Sudan's ruling council and rebel groups restarted peace talks in October 2019 to end the conflicts after widespread protests toppled autocrat Omar al-Bashir after a rule of 30 years and a transitional government took power. 
The government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) held talks in neighbouring South Sudan and reached an agreement that covers the southern Nuba Mountains and the Blue Nile states, said Tut Gatluak, the South Sudanese chief mediator, late on Monday.
""The armed forces will remain intact, and with the joining of the SPLM-North, our national army will be more coherent, strong and ready to deal with any threats to homeland security,"" Sudanese defence minister Major General Yassin Ibrahim said. 
Yasir Arman, deputy head of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), described the security agreement as ""historic"".
“We will participate in developing, reforming and building of strong and effective armed forces that reflect the diversity and have a new Sudan military doctrine that is far from politicisation,"" he said. 
Sudanese authorities say they are aiming for a comprehensive peace settlement that covers the country’s multiple civil conflicts.
However, a rebel group from the western region of Darfur and a major SPLM-N faction led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu have held back from peace negotiations.
SPLM-N rebels have been active in Sudan’s southern regions of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, where communities that remained within Sudan when South Sudan seceded in 2011 complain of being marginalised by the government in Khartoum. 
Under the agreement with Arman’s SPLM-N, the rebel fighters will initially remain in the Nuba Mountains and the Blue Nile under the command of the Sudanese army for 14 months before redeploying to other parts of the country for 13 months.

At the end of the 39-month transition period, all the rebel units will be dismantled.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Connecticut to unveil results of inquiry into virus-hit nursing homes,"By Nathan Layne
WILTON, Conn. (Reuters) - Connecticut on Tuesday will release the results of an independent review of its early approach to nursing homes ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, tackling the source of most of its deaths and the main blight on its COVID-19 response.
The review comes as Connecticut and other northeastern states like New York appear to have gained control over the virus, with infection rates among the lowest in the country and below thresholds for opening of schools.
But these states -- the hardest hit early in the pandemic -- are still coming to terms with their failure to prevent the virus from infiltrating nursing homes and other assisted living facilities in February, March and April, and are looking to create a playbook for a potential second wave in the fall.
The inquiry could also hold lessons for sunbelt states which have seen a surge in nursing home cases in recent weeks.
Unique in some ways, Connecticut's experience could prove especially instructive. It adopted a novel approach to keeping discharged COVID-19 hospital patients from re-entering nursing homes and ousted its health commissioner in May, exposing bureaucratic infighting that may have hindered its response.
""By no means do we get the A grade,"" said Sten H. Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health. ""I think most of us wished that we had been more aggressive and more savvy in predicting the inevitability of the wave through our state.""
More than 3,200 residents of Connecticut nursing homes and assisted living facilities have died from COVID-19, accounting for nearly three quarters of all virus-related deaths in the state. 
Connecticut has the fourth highest per-capita coronavirus death rate for nursing homes, after Rhode Island, New Jersey and Massachusetts - all northeastern states, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
But the death toll has in recent weeks slowed to a trickle, helped by nearly 2,000 onsite inspections and expansive testing of staff, Deidre Gifford, the state's acting health commissioner, told Reuters. She also believes a move in April to set up facilities to exclusively take in discharged COVID-19 patients helped prevent re-introducing the virus in nursing homes.
Gifford said Connecticut was nevertheless encouraging the stockpiling of personal protective equipment in preparation for a second wave, which it aims to sidestep in part by getting travelers from hot spots to quarantine under threat of fines.
""There is a lot of COVID still in the country,"" she said. ""That's obviously a concern that we are working hard to avoid.""
The review by Mathematica Policy Research, a Princeton, New Jersey-based firm commissioned by Connecticut, is the second independent probe by a state after New Jersey disclosed the results of its third-party inquiry into nursing homes in June.
The report to be unveiled on Tuesday is considered interim and will likely be supplemented by Mathematica next month.
New Jersey has enacted 19 proposals from its inquiry, including mandating that nursing homes have a senior level infection control specialist reporting to the chief executive and requiring them to report on staff taking sick leave or quarantined, a spokeswoman for the state's health department said.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who came under fire for mandating that nursing homes take back coronavirus patients discharged from a hospital as long as they could provide adequate care, has eschewed the idea of a independent review, saying such a probe would be political in nature.

Cuomo's health department published its own report last month asserting that the policy was not to blame for the more than 6,000 nursing home deaths in the state. The report argued that staff had spread the virus in the facilities.

The eatery is the latest business to join a campaign against food waste, which began nationwide last week in earnest after Chinese President Xi Jinping said such practices were ""shameful"" while the country battles a pandemic. 
Local governments and catering associations have been urging restaurants to offer smaller portions while some eateries have rolled out penalties for wasting food. One restaurant even started weighing diners to decide how much they can order, but later backtracked after coming under heavy online criticism. 
""We reacted proactively,"" said Wang Xiaoshan, the general manager of the Quanjude outlet in Beijing's Qianmen district. 
Servers at Quanjude, known for a Beijing delicacy of crispy slices of roast duck wrapped in a thin pancake, now tell customers to order according to their guest numbers and even urge them to order one less dish than their total head count, he said. They also ask them to pack up any leftovers to bring home. 
""We're lucky we have enough food, and we shouldn't waste it,"" said a diner, a 54-year-old Beijing resident surnamed Liu. ""I'm very supportive of this call."" 
China's catering industry wastes between 17 to 18 million tonnes of food a year, enough to feed a population of 30 to 50 million, state media has reported. 
The anti-food waste campaign, known as ""Clear Your Plate"", comes after Beijing has raised concerns about ensuring food security due to disruptions caused to the agriculture supply chains from the global pandemic.
Livestreaming stars known for their ability to eat large amounts of food were warned last week against encouraging food wastage on platforms such as Kuaishou and Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, which said they could be banned or face penalties if found to do so.

GAZA (Reuters) - Gaza's lone power plant shut down on Tuesday, less than a week after Israel suspended fuel shipments to the Palestinian enclave over the launching of incendiary balloons that have caused brush fires in southern Israel.
Gaza, run by Hamas Islamists, relies on Israel for most of its energy needs. Its population of two million currently receives around six hours of electricity followed by a 10-hour power cut.
""The power feed may now decline to only four hours (per day),"" said Mohammad Thabet, an official at Gaza's main power distribution company, after fuel ran out at the plant.
Gaza homes and businesses rely on generators to make up for the lengthy power cuts, increasing the financial pressure on its largely impoverished people.
Officials in Gaza said the power plant's closure would cause disruptions at vital facilities such as hospitals, which are also equipped with generators.
Dozens of helium balloons carrying incendiary material have been launched from Gaza in recent days, in what political sources described as a bid to pressure Israel to ease its blockade and allow more Arab and international investment.
Israel cites security concerns in imposing restrictions.
The political sources said the balloons were part of efforts to persuade Qatar to increase its cash aid to Hamas as the Gulf state attempts to lower Gaza border tensions.
Israel has carried out air strikes over the past week against positions held by Hamas and other factions, saying it would not tolerate the balloon incidents.
Anticipating Israeli attacks after balloon or rocket launchings, Hamas routinely evacuates personnel from outposts.
With tensions high, Israel has closed its lone commercial crossing with Gaza and banned sea access, effectively shutting down commercial fishing. 
Egyptian mediators on Monday held talks in Israel and Gaza on restoring calm.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea tightened social distancing rules on Tuesday as it reported a three-digit increase in novel coronavirus cases for a fifth day and authorities scrambled to trace hundreds of members of a church congregation.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 246 new cases as of midnight on Monday, bringing its total infections to 15,761, with 306 deaths.
South Korea has been one of the world's coronavirus mitigation success stories but it has suffered repeated spikes in cases.
Two days after re-imposing stricter social distancing in Seoul, the government expanded the curbs to include the port city of Incheon, while ordering the closure of nightclubs, karaoke bars, buffets and cyber cafes.
It also banned all in-person church services and indoor gatherings of 50 people or more and outdoor ones of 100 or more.
""If we can't get the virus under control now we'll have to notch up social distancing to higher levels, and that would have a big impact on our economy and people's livelihoods,"" Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a news conference after an emergency meeting.
At least 457 infections have been linked to the Sarang Jeil Church, 10 of whom were confirmed to have attended anti-government demonstrations on the past two weekends in Seoul, Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing.
Authorities were trying to trace some 500 other members of the congregation to tell them to self-quarantine and get tested as they posed the highest transmission risk, Kim said.
This was the second time a church was at the centre of a serious outbreak in South Korea.
'GRAVE CROSSROADS'
In February, authorities struggled with an outbreak that emerged in a secretive Christian sect in the city of Daegu, which turned into the country's deadliest cluster.
The KCDC has warned that the new cases posed a greater crisis than the earlier church outbreak and could swamp the health system.
""If we fail to contain the spread in the Seoul metropolitan area of 25 million population this week, it can not only halt the daily routine of everyone but also put the safety of the elderly and the weak at risk,"" KCDC deputy director Kwon Jun-wook told a briefing.
Another cluster has been traced to a  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) outlet outside Seoul with seven new cases taking the tally there to 49.
Two new cases were reported in the military, bringing the total number of infections on bases to 88, the defence ministry said.
Some 461 military personnel were in quarantine, and all troops have been confined to base, with leave cancelled and visits halted. 
Authorities have set out social distancing rules in three stages, with stage 1 the least strict and stage 3 the toughest, when schools are shut, businesses are advised to work from home and gatherings limited to 10 people.
Seoul is at stage 2 but Kwon said the effort was at a ""grave crossroads"" and stage 3 might be inevitable.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - It felt like an eternity rather than just a few minutes as haute couture fashion designer Elie Saab scrambled to make sure his 200 staff members, including his son, were safe when this month's massive explosion shook Beirut.
Like many Lebanese on Aug. 4 when chemicals at the port detonated, the 56-year-old felt the blast was on his doorstep.
""I saw my son covered in blood, I could not believe it. I said okay, he is wounded, but it was okay, it was just cuts to his head and arms,"" Saab said. 
""But it was 15 minutes that felt like two days long. It was not just because it is a father and son thing, it was because we all work together like one family under one roof.""
The explosion killed 178, injured 6,000 and damaged whole neighbourhoods.
Saab said his main office and headquarters were badly damaged. His home a few hundred metres from the port, was gutted.
The blast destroyed the shops and ateliers of at least two other designers, Zuhair Murad and Rabih Keyrouz, himself badly injured.
Saab is no stranger to devastation. He started his label in 1982, at the height of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. 
The Aug. 4 blast revived those memories.
""It was the same smell, the same dust, the broken glass. Honestly, we did not want to relive this and it was not necessary,"" he said.
""This is a  huge setback but we have to be like Beirut - every time dusting itself off and returning to the way it was,"" Saab said.
Saab's team plan to go back to their offices from Aug. 20 to meet a deadline for the September Paris couture show. 
He also plans to rebuild his residence, with its high ceilings and arches, marble columns and Arabesque tiles. For now, rubble and dust were everywhere.
""We must go on ... It does not become us as Lebanese to give up,"" Saab said. ""That is the doable part. But the biggest loss is the people you can't bring back.""

On a table lay a record by singer Fairouz, ""Lebanon Forever"". It was broken in two.

BANGKOK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - As Hong Kong pro-democracy advocates voiced support for Thai anti-government protests at the weekend, they used the hashtag #MilkTeaAlliance.
In Bangkok, flags representing Hong Kong and independence for Taiwan appeared on a sign bearing the tag at the biggest demonstrations in years.
And in Taipei, dozens of people gathered to back the Thai protests and give weight to a nascent community of cross-border youth movements pushing for democracy at home and uneasy with China's growing regional power.
""This is the first physical expression of the Milk Tea Alliance,"" said Thai student Akrawat Siripattanachok, 27, who helped organise the show of solidarity in Taipei joined by Hong Kong activists, a Chinese dissident and Taiwan students. 
""We don't want to just talk about it online. We want a pan-Asian alliance for democracy.""
A hashtag that began in April as a backlash to Chinese nationalist attacks on a Thai celebrity for a perceived slight to China shows signs of turning into a bigger movement uniting like-minded activists. 
Why milk tea? The light-hearted name represents a shared passion for sweet tea drinks in Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
""The innovative idea of Milk Tea Alliance will enhance more students to push forward global solidarity which might confront hardline crackdown,"" prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong told Reuters.
Wong tweeted support for the Thai protesters, while users on LIHKG, a social media forum used by Hong Kong demonstrators, also called on people to highlight the call of the Thai protesters for greater democracy and the departure of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader.
""The show of solidarity between different pro-democracy groups in Asia reflects a greater intensity and camaraderie,"" Parit 'Penguin' Chiwarak, 22, one of the Thai protest leaders, told Reuters. 
'UNDER PRESSURE'
Help flows both ways.
Some Thai students have shown support for Hong Kong activists as Beijing has tightened its grip and for the Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) in the face of increased Chinese rhetoric over what China views as a breakaway province.
""The situation in Thailand isn't so different from Hong Kong or Taiwan, which are under pressure from the authoritarian government of China,"" said Rathasat Plenwong, 24, a student protester with a Milk Tea Alliance sign.
The Thai, Hong Kong, and Taiwan governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the alliance of activists and whether they were concerned about its impact. 
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, dismissed the activists' cooperation.
""People who are pro-Hong Kong independence or pro-Taiwan independence often collude online, this is nothing new. Their conspiracy will never succeed,"" Zhao said.
While the groups' bonds may not concern China now, they were a clear sign of the challenge facing its influence in the region, Wasana Wongsurawat, a Chinese history professor at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University, told Reuters.
""It's amazing that the Hong Kong and Taiwan bond expanded into the Milk Tea Alliance with Thailand, a sovereign country that doesn't even list Chinese as a national language,"" she said.
Use of the hashtag peaked in April when Chinese internet users hit back against attacks on the Thai celebrities who had appeared to suggest that Hong Kong was a state and that Taiwan was not part of China. 
While a few people have promoted it almost daily since then, the Thai protests saw a big increase in its use - mostly on Twitter, but also Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), TikTok and other platforms. 
Data from a Twitter analytic tool showed the hashtag was used in more than 100,000 tweets on Sunday alone and nearly 200,000 times over the past eight days. 
There have also been shows of interest from the Philippines, because of a dispute with China over the South China Sea, and India after border skirmishes with China since May.
Singaporean blogger and activist Roy Ngerng, who was found guilty of defaming Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a 2014 blog post, was also in the crowd in Taipei.
""The Milk Tea Alliance became the common ground from which we can express our solidarity in humorous and safe spaces,"" Ngerng told Reuters.

638,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",Under-fire UK minister defends government over exams fiasco,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's education minister tried on Tuesday to defend a U-turn over a school exam grading system used to replace cancelled tests, which opponents said was another example of the government's incompetent handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
On Monday, the government ditched a mathematical model used to assess grade predictions made by teachers which had lowered results for almost 40% of students taking their main school-leaving exams.
University places depend on the results but many students found their grades had been downgraded, meaning they failed to meet their provisional offers. 
The action only came after days of criticism of the algorithm from distraught students, angry teachers and disgruntled lawmakers from Prime Minister Boris Johnson's own ruling Conservative Party as well as the opposition.
Opponents said the exams U-turn was the latest failing by Johnson's government in its response to the pandemic, following criticism it was slow to impose a lockdown, failed to provide enough protective equipment to healthcare staff and bungled a plan to get pupils back to school. 
More than 41,000 Britons have died in the pandemic, tens of thousands of jobs have been lost, and life is far from returning to normal. 
""The Tories' (Conservatives) handling of these results sums up their handling of this pandemic: incompetent,"" opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Twitter.
Johnson and education minister Gavin Williamson were lampooned on the front pages of British newspapers on Tuesday after what the papers described as a ""humiliating"" U-turn, which days earlier the government had ruled out.
Facing the media on Tuesday, Williamson said the government had acted after realising there were ""too many anomalies"", suggesting the blame lay with officials behind the algorithm. 
""The right thing to do...when it was clear that the system wasn't delivering what we believed, and what we'd been assured that it would do, and the fairness that we all expect it to deliver...then further action had to be taken, that's what I did,"" Williamson told Sky News.
A snap opinion poll published on Monday showed 75% of respondents thought the government had handled the situation badly and 40% thought Williamson should resign. He said he would not quit.
The change also puts pressure on universities, as more students have obtained the grades needed to get into their first choice institution. Williamson said the government was working on how to boost their capacity.
""This will cause challenges at this late stage in the admissions process – capacity, staffing, placements and facilities – particularly with the social distance measures in place,"" Universities UK, the body which represents the sector, said.
The government's decision refers only to England. Scotland faced a similar situation and changed its policy last week, and Wales and Northern Ireland have also dropped the algorithm method, which factored in the past performance of the schools as a whole.

Critics of the system said this disproportionately hit students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Four Western business lobbies joined in protesting Japan's travel ban to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, saying the policy is out of step with measures in other major economies and will harm investment.
Many countries have imposed travel curbs to battle the pandemic but Japan's are among the most strict, effectively banning entry of tourists and visa holders from more than 140 countries.
""This policy is contrary to the treatment Japan receives from other G7 and other leading countries who treat long-term foreign residents equally to citizens on health matters,"" the groups said in a statement released on Tuesday.
The joint letter was signed by business lobbies from the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Europe. The U.S. and European groups had issued previous complaints about the policy.
Japan allows its citizens to return to the country if they take a coronavirus test at the port of entry and observe a period of self-quarantine. Foreigners living in Japan face much higher hurdles for re-entry.
These measures ""can only discourage foreign nationals, and the companies they work for, from investing in Japan,"" the business groups said.
Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The government announced last month it would start ""phased measures"" to restore travel depending on infection conditions, starting with 12 Asian countries.
Restrictions to contain the spread of the virus have devastated Japan's economy, which posted its biggest contraction on record in the second quarter.

Lebanese authorities are probing what caused massive amounts of ammonium nitrate warehoused unsafely for years at the port to denotate in a mushroom cloud on Aug. 4, killing 178 people, injuring 6,000 and destroying swathes of the city. 
Aoun, an ally of the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera in an interview published on Tuesday that the group did not store weapons at the port, echoing comments by Hezbollah's leader earlier this month.
""Impossible, but serious events like these light up spirits and imagination,"" Aoun said when asked about people advancing the hypothesis, but added that ""even this lead will be investigated"". 
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has denied accusations that his heavily armed movement had weaponry warehoused at Beirut port. He has said that the group would wait for results of the investigation but if it turns out to be an act of sabotage by Israel then it would ""pay an equal price"".
Hezbollah, which exercises sway over government in Lebanon, has fought several wars with Israel and is classified by the United States as a terrorist group.
Israel has denied any involvement in the blast. 
Aoun has said the probe is looking into whether neglect, an accident or ""external interference"" caused the blast.
""Although it seems that (it) has been an accident, I want to avoid being accused of not having listened to every voice,"" Aoun told the Italian daily.

He said that many people claimed seeing airplanes fly by the port just before the blast and, although ""not very credible"", they should be listened to.

KABUL (Reuters) - Several rockets struck Afghanistan's capital of Kabul on Tuesday, shaking the main diplomatic district and sending foreign embassies into lockdown, officials and sources said.
It was not immediately clear if there were casualties or who was behind the attack on Afghanistan's independence day at a time when the United States is withdrawing troops and encouraging peace talks to end almost 19 years of war. 
""Several rockets were fired from two vehicles,"" said Tariq Arian, an interior ministry spokesman.
Sources told Reuters the diplomatic area was quickly placed under lockdown after the blasts, as workers in embassies took cover in safe rooms.
Smoke billowed, alarms shrilled and shrapnel flew, said Reuters witnesses who heard at least four rockets landing near the Green Zone area, home to many foreign embassies and NATO headquarters. 
""The warning alarm sounded two to three seconds before impact and then there was the sound of the first rocket, then, soon afterwards, another much louder one with a huge boom and shrapnel and bits of concrete fell,"" added one of them.
A diplomatic source told Reuters one rocket had landed near a mosque just outside the tightly-guarded diplomatic enclave.

The United States this month imposed sanctions on Lam and other current and former Hong Kong and mainland officials whom Washington accuses of curtailing political freedom in the financial hub.
""Despite some inconvenience in my personal affairs, it is nothing I would take to heart,"" Lam told a weekly news conference.
""We will continue to do what is right for the country and for Hong Kong.""
The sanctions came in response to China's imposition of a sweeping national security law on the semi-autonomous city after prolonged anti-China, pro-democracy protests last year.
The legislation punishes anything China considers secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison and has drawn criticism from Western countries that worry the law will end the freedoms promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets of the officials targeted and bar Americans from doing business with them.
Lam said that while she could not travel to the United States herself, her government would continue to promote Hong Kong to U.S. businesses.
The U.S. government has also required goods made in the former British colony for export to the United States to be labelled as made in China after Sept. 25. 
Lam said Hong Kong and China were separate WTO members and Hong Kong would lodge a complaint against the U.S. decision.
The Hong Kong government initially denounced the U.S. sanctions as ""shameless and despicable"" and ""blatant and barbaric"" interference in China's internal affairs. 
Beijing and Lam's government have defended the national security law as necessary for the city's stability and prosperity, and they said imposing it was China's legitimate right.
Asked about the international community's criticism of last week's arrest of pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai, and the search of his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newsroom by some 200 police officers, Lam said she could not comment on individual cases, but warned of ""double standards"" in concerns expressed by other countries.

She said the government's decision to postpone elections for the city's legislature for a year amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases was criticised by countries that did not level similar criticism of other governments that postponed votes.

China has seen unusually high levels of rain this flood season, with southwest and central regions in the Yangtze river basin bearing the brunt of flooding.
The Ministry of Water Resources said on Monday that 38 tributaries on the upper reaches of the Yangtze were now higher than their warning levels, 19 dangerously so.
The southwestern province of Sichuan, which includes a major upstream section of the Yangtze, has raised its flood emergency response to its highest level, the first time it has ever done so, with its rivers overflowing and villages and farmland inundated.
The Qingyi river, an upper Yangtze tributary, had seen its worst flooding in a century, Sichuan's flood control authority said, with the city of Yaan forced to evacuate more than 36,000 people as the river burst its banks on Monday. 
The Yangtze and Huai river basins have seen the highest level of rainfall since records began in 1961, officials have said. As many as 634 rivers throughout the country have exceeded their official flood warning levels.
By last week, 63 million people had been affected by floods, 12.7% higher than the average over the past five years, said Zhou Xuewen, vice-minister at the Ministry of Emergency Management. 
The cost of direct economic damage reached 179 billion yuan ($25.82 billion), 15.5% higher than the five-year average, he added.

After a brief summer hiatus, face-to-face discussions will resume in Brussels on Tuesday. Over dinner, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s top negotiator, David Frost, will discuss a path to a deal with Michel Barnier, his EU counterpart. Then, about 50 officials from either side will thrash out the technicalities on Wednesday and Thursday before the two chiefs reconvene Friday morning.
Britain and the bloc want to reach an agreement before the negotiations are scheduled to conclude Oct. 2 -- but, so far, neither has made adequate concessions for the other. Each is waiting for the other to blink first, according to officials in both camps. Given that, there is little prospect of a breakthrough this week, said one EU official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are held in private.
“Our assessment is that a deal can still be reached in September,” Johnson’s spokesman Jamie Davies told reporters in London on Monday.
The two biggest sticking points remain what access EU vessels will have to U.K. fishing waters and how closely Britain will have to stick to the bloc’s rules to ensure a level competitive playing field. The EU has made agreement on both subjects a precondition of any wider trade accord. The topics have each been allotted four two-hour sessions this week, and discussions will continue when officials meet in London next month.
Effective Deadline
Unless a deal is reached by the end of the post-Brexit transition period on Dec. 31, consumers will face the return of tariffs and quotas for the first time in a generation. But after five months of tortuous negotiations, time is running out. EU officials say the bloc needs at least 11 weeks to ratify any agreement, making an Oct. 15 summit of European leaders the effective deadline.
The EU has made some concessions from its opening positions, including accepting that the European Court of Justice won’t have a role in policing any accord -- a key demand of Brexiters in Johnson’s Conservative Party. For its part, the U.K. has backed away from its attempt to structure any agreement as a series of mini-deals with their own dispute-resolution mechanisms -- something that irked the EU.
Negotiators are still waiting for a joint legal text, a key document setting out the areas of agreement that allows the two sides to narrow down their differences. Without it, both sides are working blind and remain some way from a deal, the EU official said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An unverified video showing piles of cash being handed to Mexican congressional staffers went viral on Monday, fueling a corruption scandal that is already convulsing the country even as the clip's source and context remain unclear. 
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has made combating graft his top issue, earlier in the day said the public should see all evidence linked to bribes allegedly paid to lawmakers that led to the passage of reforms he opposed. 
During his regular morning news conference, he specifically referenced a video introduced as part of sworn testimony in a corruption case in which the former head of Mexico's state-run oil company Pemex has accused Lopez Obrador's predecessor of ordering bribe payments. 
Hours later a shaky four-minute clip appeared on YouTube showing plastic bags filled with neatly bundled stacks of cash apparently being turned over to two senior Senate staffers who then worked for the opposition National Action Party, or PAN.
The source of the video remains unclear, as does the date and location it was recorded. 
An official with the attorney general's office told Reuters the video was not part of evidence obtained from ex-Pemex CEO Emilio Lozoya, who last week filed a complaint accusing his boss, former President Enrique Pena Nieto, and another senior aide of ordering a wide-ranging bribery scheme.
One of the Senate staffers in the video, Guillermo Gutierrez, was promptly fired by tweet from his post as personal secretary to the PAN governor of Queretaro state after the video was released. 
The other staffer, Rafael Caraveo, denied on Twitter the cash was a bribe, but offered no further explanation.
The video was posted to a YouTube page created on Sunday under the name of Lozoya's brother, Juan Jesus. 
A public relations firm representing Emilio Lozoya said in a statement, though, that their client's brother does not have a YouTube page, and that a criminal complaint would be filed for the appropriation of his identity. 
Last week, the attorney general said Lozoya had testified he received more than 100 million pesos ($4.5 million) from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht that was in part used to buy votes in Congress. 
Odebrecht has admitted to paying bribes in Mexico.
The signature reform passed by Congress during Pena Nieto's term was an energy overhaul that ended Pemex's monopoly and was bitterly opposed by Lopez Obrador.

Relations between Canberra and Beijing, which have close economic ties, have grown increasingly frayed in recent months.

“As for myself, of course it will have a little bit of inconvenience here and there, because we have to use some financial services and we don’t know whether that will relate back to an agency that has some American business -- and the use of credit cards is sort of hampered,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in an interview with Chinese state broadcaster CGTN posted late Monday. “But those are really meaningless as far as I’m concerned.”
Lam was one of 11 officials sanctioned earlier this month by President Donald Trump for their roles in curtailing political freedoms in Hong Kong, amid the implementation of new national security legislation imposed on the city by China in June.
“The most important thing is we feel honorable that we are, at this historic moment, being trusted by the central people’s government to enforce a piece of national law to safeguard national security,” Lam said. “The more that this attracts the critics of China to attack us, the more effective this piece of legislation is to achieve its intended objective.“
Spokespeople for Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) didn’t immediately reply to messages requesting comment outside of business hours.
China’s largest state-run banks operating in Hong Kong are taking tentative steps to comply with U.S. sanctions imposed on officials in the city, Bloomberg reported last week, as they seek to safeguard their access to crucial dollar funding and overseas networks. Major lenders with operations in the U.S. including Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp., and China Merchants Bank Co. have turned cautious on opening new accounts for the 11 sanctioned officials, people familiar said.
China Banks Act to Comply With Trump Sanctions on Hong Kong
Lam on Tuesday is scheduled to hold her first weekly briefing following a summer recess for Hong Kong’s advisory Executive Council.
The press briefing comes after Hong Kong extended all existing Covid-19 related social distancing measures for a week -- to August 25 -- as it continues to battle a third wave surge of virus cases. It will be the first time she has faced local media since the arrest last Monday of media tycoon Jimmy Lai under the national security legislation.
Lam is one of the most visible Chinese leaders in the struggle over Hong Kong’s future. Her attempt last year to pass a bill that would have allowed extraditions to the mainland prompted months of pro-democracy protests, and she’s defended Beijing’s legal right to bypass Hong Kong’s legislature and implement the security law.
The national security measures have fueled concerns about the state of Hong Kong’s autonomy from China, including freedoms of the press and the independence of its judicial system. Both have helped underpin Hong Kong’s reputation as a global financial hub.
Lai’s arrest has only further fueled rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. Other flash points include the trade war, Taiwan and Trump’s moves to ban popular Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat.

NOVO PROGRESSO, Brazil (Reuters) - A Brazilian federal judge on Monday ordered protesters to clear the BR-163 highway, a main route for exporting grains from Mato Grosso state to northern ports, according to a copy of the ruling seen by Reuters.
Members of the Kayapó indigenous tribe had blocked the route in center-west Brazil on Monday, protesting against a lack of government protection from the coronavirus pandemic that has killed several of their elders.
Kayapó wearing warrior body paint and headdresses used tires and wood to block trucks carrying corn on the BR-163 highway, a Reuters witness said.
They were also protesting against the so-called Ferrogrão railway, set to cross part of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to connect grain-producing Mato Grosso state to river ports for soy and corn. 
Brazil's highway police recommended that grain trucks heading to Miritituba port in Pará state on the Tapajós River pause their journey because of the demonstrations.
""The recommendation is that trucks wait in Matupá and Guarantã do Norte until the situation is resolved,"" said Leonardo Ramos, chief of police in the town of Sorriso. He said traffic was backed up Monday morning for about 3 km (1.8 miles) on the key grains transport route due to the protests.
The tribe had not been consulted about the railroad, which the government hopes to license early next year, the protesters said. It will link Sinop in Mato Grosso to the port of Miritituba, providing a more efficient transport route.
The railway will run parallel to the BR-163 highway, which has become an important route for exporting grains to the river ports for transshipment onto larger ships on the Amazon river.
The BR-163 was built in the 1970s and for years was a treacherously muddy road that became impassable in the rainy season, until it was fully paved this year.

The Kayapo, who live on the adjacent Menkragnoti e Baú indigenous reservations, claim the road has brought illness to their villages and are also seeking reparation money.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Canada has released as much information as it legally can about the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, the government's lawyers said on Monday, as she sought more confidential documents relating to her 2018 detention.
Meng, 48, was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a U.S. warrant charging her with bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.
She has said she is innocent, and is fighting extradition to the United States while under house arrest in Vancouver.
On the first day of hearings expected to last up to three days, Meng's lawyer said a ""flurry of emails"" between Canadian and American officials around the time of Meng's arrest should not all be covered by privilege, as Canadian prosecutors have argued.
Meng's lawyers have pushed for the release of more documents to support their assertion that Canadian and American authorities committed abuses of process while questioning Meng before her arrest, including the improper sharing of identifying details about her electronic devices.
Crown lawyer John Gibb-Carsley said his team is committed to making the trial ""as open as possible without divulging the privileges which need to be protected.""
However, Meng’s lawyers argued that abuse of process is an exception to litigation privilege.
""We see a flurry of emails around the subject matter,"" Scott Fenton, a lawyer for Meng, said. ""We would be easily guilty of being wrong that all these emails are about that subject matter because we can't see them, so it's a matter for the closed hearing to determine what these are about.""
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have denied any abuses relating to their conduct during Meng's arrest.
Several of the privilege claims were litigated in a federal court in Ottawa in late July, because they were made on the basis of national security.
The hearings will continue in a closed session on Tuesday, potentially stretching into Wednesday. Meng will not be present.

A schedule proposed jointly by lawyers for the prosecution and defense said that a decision on the issue by Oct. 2 would allow the rest of the trial to proceed as planned, with hearings wrapping up in April 2021.

Morneau made the announcement at a press conference in Ottawa on Monday evening, saying he told the prime minister earlier that day he doesn’t intend to run in the next election. The government did not immediately name a replacement. Mark Carney, the former Bank of England and the Bank of Canada chief, and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland are names that have being circulated as potential replacements in recent days.
The resignation comes at a critical moment for Trudeau as his government develops an agenda for the economic recovery amid historically high unemployment. The government is expected to introduce significant changes to the country’s social programs, including employment insurance and childcare.
“It’s the right time for a new finance minister to deliver on that plan for the long and challenging road ahead,” Morneau said. “We know that now, the next step is going to be a long and uncertain recovery, and we need a finance minister that’s going to be there for the long term.”
He said he would put his name forward to be secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The Trudeau-Morneau rift burst into full view after Bloomberg News reported on Aug. 10 that Carney is advising the prime minister on an economic recovery plan. Trudeau released an extraordinary statement the following afternoon stating his “full confidence” in Morneau, as speculation grew over whether he’d be replaced in an expected cabinet shuffle. The two men met on Monday.
Multiple officials told Bloomberg a rift between the prime minister’s office and Morneau’s finance department has grown over disagreements on how to direct C$240 billion ($181 billion) in Covid-19 emergency spending. Points of debate have included how much unemployed workers should receive under the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, the government’s flagship Covid-19 income support program, and whether to increase a wage subsidy for businesses impacted by the pandemic.
The controversy surrounding a C$43.5 million government student grant contract has also strained the relationship. Trudeau and Morneau are both under investigation by the ethics watchdog over potential conflict of interest in the awarding of the contract to the WE Charity, which has used Trudeau’s mother, brother and wife as paid speakers at events and employed Morneau’s daughter. Both men appeared before parliamentary committees over the matter.
Trudeau and Morneau’s chief spokespeople had denied the tensions were anything beyond what is typical between the prime minister’s office and the finance department.
“Every step of the way, Bill and I have worked closely together, along with our team of cabinet ministers and caucus members to help Canadians navigate this challenging time,” Trudeau said in a statement. “Our number one priority has been supporting Canadian families and businesses the best and fastest way possible.”

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's Economy Minister Paulo Guedes has no intention of resigning, two sources from the economic team told Reuters, in an attempt to quash rising speculation that political pressure for more public spending could force him to quit.
Doubts about Guedes' future have grown since two more of his special secretaries left the ministry last week and local media reported at the weekend that central bank president Roberto Campos Neto is being lined up to replace him.
The two sources, who are close to both Guedes and Campos Neto and spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the two men agree on the need to control spending so that Brazil can start to reduce its debt burden following a surge in emergency spending to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
Both sources stated that Guedes' departure is not being considered internally either at the ministry or the central bank. One of them said that even if Guedes were to leave at the behest of President Jair Bolsonaro, his successor would likely be someone determined to spend, so Campos Neto seems an unlikely candidate.
Speculation surrounding Guedes dominated currency market trading on Monday, driving volatility higher and the real lower, analysts said.
The second source noted that Guedes is still involved in trying to reduce mandatory expenses and put in place controls against the creation of new expenses.
""There has always been this conflict between the areas that want a budget to spend and those that need to control it. In the past, the fight was between Planning and Finance (ministries). The focus here is on one point: Economy,"" the second source said.
""And the peripheral ministries are there, at the edge of the lake, which is a little dry, wanting to take a drink of water,"" he added.

The sources said that Guedes will present his draft annual budget later this month, laying bare a dire outlook for public finances next year, and making it clear there will be very little room to make investments.

657,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 07:11PM ET</span>",Trump-appointed Postal Service chief to testify amid fears about U.S. election,"By David Shepardson and Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's appointed postmaster general on Monday agreed to testify before Congress next week on cuts in service that lawmakers fear could hamper the Postal Service's ability to handle a flood of mail-in ballots in November's election.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major Trump political donor, agreed to testify next Monday before the Democratic-led House of Representatives Oversight and Reform Committee, which is investigating whether service changes adopted in recent weeks have slowed mail deliveries.
The committee called DeJoy's appearance voluntary. Robert Duncan, who chairs the Postal Service board of governors and is a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, will testify along with DeJoy, the Postal Service confirmed.
Congressional Democrats have raised concerns that, amid a coronavirus pandemic that is expected to result in about twice as many Americans voting by mail as did so in 2016, cost cuts at the Postal Service could lead to missed or delayed ballots. 
They have pointed to reductions in overtime, restrictions on extra mail transportation trips and new mail sorting and delivery policies as changes that threaten to slow mail delivery.
Trump has repeatedly and without evidence claimed that mail balloting is vulnerable to fraud. Voting by mail is nothing new in the United States, and one in four voters cast ballots that way in 2016. 
Separately, House Democratic Conference Chairman Hakeem Jeffries and Representative Ted Lieu called on the FBI to open a criminal probe into DeJoy.
""There is evidence that making mail-in balloting more difficult may be one of the motivations for the changes instituted at the Post Office,"" Jeffries and Lieu wrote in a Monday letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray.
""There is also evidence that the Postmaster General has a financial stake in multiple financial entities that are either competitors to or contractors for the Post Office,"" the lawmakers said. 
'NOT TAMPERING'
""No, we're not tampering,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News amid an outcry from Democrats and other critics who accuse him of trying to hamstring the Postal Service to suppress mail-in voting as he trails Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden in polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election. 
""We want to make it run efficiently, run good,"" Trump said of the Postal Service. 
Later on Monday at an event in Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK), Wisconsin, Trump said: ""We can't play games, get out and vote through those beautiful absentee ballots or just make sure your vote gets counted.
""Make sure, because the only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged. Remember that. The only way we're going to lose this election. So we have to be very careful,"" he said.
Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a close Trump ally, accused Democrats of promoting ""conspiracy"" theories, a charge echoed by House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy.
Trump, who himself plans to cast an absentee ballot by mail in Florida, and many other Republicans have opposed an expansion of mail-in voting to accommodate people concerned about going to the polls to vote in-person due to fears amid the pandemic. 
Trump said in March that with mail-in voting at levels that Democrats were seeking ""you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.""
The Democratic-controlled House will meet on Saturday to consider legislation prohibiting changes to Postal Service levels that were in place on Jan. 1, 2020, said the chamber's No. 2 Democrat, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.
A Democratic congressional aide said the legislation will also include $25 billion in funding for the Postal Service. Congressional Democrats had sought that amount in talks on coronavirus relief legislation that broke down over a week ago. 

While Trump has voiced opposition to such funding, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Monday the administration could agree to Postal Service funding as part of a bill to deliver coronavirus aid .

The agreement set up a precarious alliance of civilian technocrats and military officials following the April 2019 ouster of long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir, with elections due to be held after 39 months.
The government says it is pushing ahead with reforms, but many people want swifter and deeper change.
Protesters from neighbourhood-based ""resistance committees"" gathered outside Cabinet headquarters in downtown Khartoum to voice their demands amid a heavy security presence.
The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which spearheaded anti-Bashir protests and helped strike the deal with the military, said on Twitter that security forces violently dispersed protesters after they demanded to meet Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok and refused an envoy sent in his place.
A Reuters witness saw tear gas being fired.
The police said in a statement late on Monday that officers' use of tear gas during the demonstration was lawful and according to their evaluation of the situation on the ground but has lead to ""some random injuries"" among protesters and security forces.
Khartoum's governor Ayman Khalid expressed his ""deepest apologies"" and called the force used on Monday ""excessive"" and ""contradictory to [our approach] in the era of freedom, peace and justice.""
Khalid also called on the general prosecutor to investigate.
The neighbourhood committees say they want to see the long-delayed formation of a transitional legislature, the reorganisation of the civilian Forces of Freedom and Change coalition and a civilian takeover of military-run companies.
Hamdok on Monday called for political and popular support for reform.

""The state apparatus needs to be rebuilt, the legacy of (the old regime) needs to be dismantled and the civil service needs to be modernized and developed to become unbiased between citizens, as well as effective,"" he said in a statement.

660,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 04:27PM ET</span>",Bank of Japan Refuses Trader Requests to Work From Home,"(Bloomberg) -- The new normal of remote work has yet to reach the traders who deal with the Bank of Japan.
Japan’s central bank doesn’t allow home computers to connect to its network for conducting asset purchases and other market transactions, raising concerns at financial firms as coronavirus cases in Tokyo surge. At least three have asked the BOJ whether traders can participate in its operations from outside the office, only to be met with a refusal, people familiar with the matter said.
The so-called BOJ-Net infrastructure, used for trillions of yen in transactions daily, is connected via dedicated cables to computers at dozens of financial firms so they can trade assets with the central bank or buy bonds from the government. The monetary authority is concerned that allowing access from home would risk cybersecurity, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. By contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have allowed trading with counterparties at home.
Requiring traders to be on site is hampering the efforts that financial firms have been making to accommodate remote work in a country where long hours in the office were the norm before the crisis. Outmoded workplace practices such as a reliance on physical paperwork have come under the spotlight during the outbreak, prompting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to call for a review.
The BOJ’s asset purchases are “basically impossible” for financial firms to skip because they represent a rare revenue source in an economy where interest rates are kept around zero or below, said Hideyasu Ban, a Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst. Clients’ orders to sell their Japanese government bonds to the central bank may add to pressure to keep people in the office, he said.
Traders at 56 registered financial institutions use BOJ-Net, or the Bank of Japan Financial Network System, from designated office computers to sell bonds to the central bank. Of them, 21 are also primary dealers, using the network to bid at the finance ministry’s debt auctions.
The central bank buys the securities as part of its efforts to pump money into Japan’s ailing economy, usually generating a profit for the sellers. More than 200 trillion yen ($1.9 trillion) of funds and government bonds were transacted daily over BOJ-Net in 2018, the latest figures show.
The pandemic has prompted the BOJ to make some concessions. It has started to allow financial firms to use designated computers in their backup offices, the people familiar with the matter said. It also offers an option for traders to fax their orders, though the participants viewed that as unrealistic for fast-paced market transactions, the people added.
The BOJ declined to comment.
Financial firms need at least two employees in the office if they want to sell government bonds to the central bank: one to enter the amounts at the assigned computers and the other to check their accuracy, the people said. In July, the BOJ conducted operations to buy 17.9 trillion yen of short- or long-term government debt on 14 out of 21 business days.
The primary dealers also needed staff in the office on another five business days last month to take part in the government’s debt auctions.
The central bank’s security concerns are reasonable, according to former BOJ policy board member Takahide Kiuchi. Japan’s economy would face “chaos” if hackers were to interfere with interbank transactions, the Nomura Research Institute Ltd. economist said.
“But it could eventually face criticism if it keeps giving the cold shoulder to requests from financial firms,” he added. “So I expect it will take a flexible stance to signal it will do what it can.”

661,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 03:56PM ET</span>",'I'm not a saint': Lukashenko offers to hand over power after referendum,"By Andrei Makhovsky
MINSK (Reuters) - Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, said on Monday he would be ready to hold new elections and hand over power after a constitutional referendum, an attempt to pacify mass protests and strikes that pose the biggest challenge yet to his rule. 
He made the offer, which he insisted would not be delivered on while he was under pressure from protesters, after exiled opposition politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said she was willing to lead the country.
In a sign of his growing vulnerability, Lukashenko faced heckling and chants of ""step down"" during a speech to workers at one of the large state-run factories that are the pride of his Soviet-style economic model and core support base.
He faces the threat of European Union sanctions after a bloody crackdown on protests following what demonstrators say was his rigged re-election victory last week. He cites official results that gave him just over 80% of the vote.
Officials in Washington and the EU want Russia not to meddle in what President Donald Trump called a ""terrible situation"", after Moscow told Lukashenko it was ready to provide military help against an external threat. 
Russia is watching closely as Belarus hosts pipelines that carry Russian energy exports to the West and is viewed by Moscow as a buffer zone against NATO. Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke twice this weekend.
A burly former Soviet collective farm manager, Lukashenko used blunt language while speaking to workers on Monday. 
""We've held elections,"" he said. ""Until you've killed me there won't be any new elections."" 
But he offered to change the constitution, an apparent concession that seems unlikely to satisfy protesters who say it's something he has spoken about before.
""We'll put the changes to a referendum, and I'll hand over my constitutional powers. But not under pressure or because of the street,"" Lukashenko said, in remarks quoted by the official Belta news agency. 
""Yes, I'm not a saint. You know my harsh side. I'm not eternal. But if you drag down the first president you'll drag down neighbouring countries and all the rest.""
He also said people could hold parliamentary and presidential elections after the referendum if that was what they wanted.
VIDEO ADDRESS
Speaking in a video address from Lithuania, opposition politician Tsikhanouskaya urged security and law enforcement officers to switch sides. 
""I am ready to take responsibility and act as a national leader during this period,"" Tsikhanouskaya said.
The first leader of independent Belarus Stanislav Shushkevich told Reuters the military and Lukashenko's inner circle could stay loyal and were ""handsomely paid"".
Tsikhanouskaya's video was released as hundreds of employees from the state broadcaster BT went on strike, as several presenters and staff publicly resigned in solidarity with the protesters.
The strike came as protests spread to those normally seen as loyal to the 65-year-old president. Some police, a sitting ambassador, prominent athletes and a former prime minister have also voiced solidarity with the protesters. 
The state broadcaster showed re-runs on Monday morning before issuing a fresh news bulletin. Videos on social media suggested BT had at one point aired footage of an empty studio with white sofas, and music playing. 
Reuters could not independently confirm that and the broadcaster could not immediately be reached for comment.
Factory workers waving flags and posters joined protesters to rally outside the building, which was being guarded by security forces. 
""We want to work honestly, we do not want to be forced to lie,"" TV host Oleg Titkov told Reuters. 
Thousands of protesters had earlier marched to a factory where Lukashenko flew by helicopter to speak to striking workers. He got a rough reception. 
""Thanks, I've said everything. You can (continue to) shout 'step down,'"" he said, struggling to be heard. 
He then walked away as the crowd chanted ""Step down"".
Media outlet Tut.By showed footage of Lukashenko confronting one worker, saying ""I will not beat you up"" before adding ""if somebody provokes something here, we will sort it out in a hard way. So, man up.""
Strike action hit Belaruskali, one of the world's largest potash producers, partly shutting production, Russia's TASS news agency cited a local trade union as saying. The state-owned firm, a key source of dollar revenue for Belarus, said its plant was still working.
In the evening, thousands marched to the Okrestina detention facility where protesters were kept last week and complained of beatings, cramped conditions and starvation rations. The government denies abuse.

Lukashenko said he had received a phone call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel: ""Yesterday Merkel called, 'I want to talk,'"" Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. However, the German government said no conversation had taken place between the two leaders since the Aug. 9 election.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 03:46PM ET</span>",'Definitely awkward': University freshmen get online welcome,"By Rachel Parsons (NYSE:PSN)
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Sarah Showich, an 18-year-old theater major, was looking forward to joining tens of thousands of other students on Monday for a first day of classes on the campus of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
Instead, she is starting classes online from her home in Beverly Hills, Michigan, on the outskirts of Detroit. Instead of getting to know a roommate, she is sharing space with her younger brother and her parents, who are also studying or working from home. Instead of making friends with classmates in person, she is meeting them via Zoom. 
“It’s definitely awkward,” said Showich by telephone. “I’m not going to lie, like making friends online is very awkward because it’s so hard to get past the small talk virtually.”
Welcome Week, held last week, in normal years has a carnival-like atmosphere. Hundreds of events are engineered to get students past the small talk. This year, all the receptions, movie nights, trivia meet-ups, concerts and the pomp and circumstance of the convocation ceremony for incoming students were held online. 
The urban campus in Los Angeles’ University Park neighborhood adjacent to downtown is known for its red-brick buildings spanning over a century’s worth of architecture. Nationally, it is known as a college football powerhouse, and this week would normally unfold to the sound of the renowned Trojan marching band practicing in the track and field stadium on warm afternoons. 
USC was one of the first universities in the country to start the fall semester on Monday and among the 32% conducting classes either primarily or fully online, according to data collected by the College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College, which tracks how colleges are changing amid the pandemic. 
Nearly a quarter of American universities will have classes either fully or primarily in person this fall, another quarter have not yet determined what they will do, while 15 percent will have a hybrid of in-person and online course work, and the rest plan some alternative form of instruction.
USC has not gotten permission from Los Angeles County health authorities to allow students into housing facilities because of the county’s high rate of COVID-19 infections. Last year, USC had nearly 50,000 students. 
DIFFERENT KIND OF BONDING
Senior Delani Wolf, a student worker in the Campus Activities department, co-hosted one of the week’s trivia game sessions from her family home in Moorpark, California. The game would usually be held in one of the campus pubs. About a dozen students logged on from across the United States. Wolf said a typical group during Welcome Week on campus would have around 50 students show up, but she was happy just to see friends on screen. 
“As a senior,” she said, “I’m not relying on these Welcome Week events to get to know people. I do feel much worse for the freshmen than I do for myself.”
USC President Carol L. Folt called this fall “a semester like no other,” adding in an online video to students, ""but I’m certain you’ll settle in like students who came before you.” 
In a nod to the stressors students may face studying and working from home, Folt highlighted the university’s online yoga and meditation classes in the video.
Showich, who joined the theater program’s virtual reception last week, said it turned out better than she expected. “For a minute there it was almost like, this is normal. We’re all just starting to accept it.”
For USC’s thousands of international students, the time difference was a formidable obstacle. In Hong Kong, junior Ronny Hu said she was preparing to wake up at 5 a.m. to join classes in real time. 
She said she is thankful the classes will be recorded in case she oversleeps, but “not being able to interact with profs and classmates is like subscribing (to) the most expensive streaming service.” 
International students pay full tuition, and the university is facing backlash for increasing that price by 3.5% this year to $59,260 a year. 
Showich said she tries not to dwell on the milestones that the class of 2024 is missing right now, and is instead focused on “soaking it all in.” 

“I think in some ways you know,” she said, “when we get to campus, we’ll all be bonded in a different way than past classes because this is such a weird situation.”

663,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 03:27PM ET</span>","Mystery no more: Spain's ex-king, Juan Carlos, has been in UAE since Aug. 3","MADRID (Reuters) - Former Spanish king Juan Carlos, who left Spain under a cloud of scandal, has been in the United Arab Emirates since Aug. 3, a royal household spokesman said on Monday, putting an end to an international guessing game over the 82-year-old's whereabouts.
Juan Carlos had said on Aug. 3 he would leave Spain after controversial aspects of his past private life came to light, but did not say where he was going.
""King Juan Carlos has told the royal household that he went to the Emirates on Aug. 3, and he remains there now,"" the spokesman said.
The once-popular king abdicated in favour of his son Felipe in 2014 after a tax fraud case involving members of the royal family, as well as an ill-judged elephant hunting trip at a time when Spaniards were struggling with a deep recession.
After leaving the throne, he took a step back from public life. But controversy mounted, culminating with a move by Spain's Supreme Court in June to open a preliminary investigation into his involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia.
Switzerland's La Tribune de Geneve newspaper reported Juan Carlos had received $100 million from the late Saudi king. Switzerland has also opened an investigation.
The former monarch is not formally under investigation and has repeatedly declined to comment on the subject. His lawyer has said he remains at the Spanish prosecutor's disposal.
While he was King, Juan Carlos benefited from full judicial immunity, though he can be prosecuted for any wrongdoing done since he abdicated. 
Justice Minister Juan Carlos Campo said the former king would return to Spain to respond to judges if required.
""I'm convinced that when justice calls him, he will attend,"" Campo said.

Spanish daily ABC reported 10 days ago that Juan Carlos had travelled on a private plane to Abu Dhabi from the Spanish city of Vigo. Some media had speculated he was in the Dominican Republic or Portugal.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government bowed to public pressure over its school exam grading system, ditching an algorithm that downgraded the results awarded to students in England after their tests were cancelled due to COVID-19. 
The government had faced days of criticism after the mathematical model used to assess grade predictions made by teachers lowered those grades for almost 40% of students taking their main school-leaving exams.
Students will now be awarded the grade that their teachers had predicted for them based on past performance, Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government said on Monday.
""I am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents, but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve,"" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said.
He promised last week there would be no U-turn.
A snap opinion poll by YouGov showed 75% of respondents thought the government had handled the situation badly, and 40% thought Williamson should resign. Some students have been protesting against the initial results.
Asked if he would resign, Williamson said: ""I think what those youngsters wanted to see was action being taken.""
The chaotic handling of the grades has been felt as far afield as Egypt and Pakistan as some schools there rely on British assessments to secure internationally recognised qualifications. 
The algorithm will also be dropped for results for separate exams taken mostly by 15- and 16-year-old students. 
The dispute has damaged Johnson's core message to voters - that he wanted to get rid of barriers to achievement and help those from poorer backgrounds and areas fulfil their potential.
It marks a fresh embarrassment for a government which has changed course several times - including over meals vouchers for school children after a campaign led by soccer star Marcus Rashford.
Some students missed out on university places after they were downgraded several levels by the regulator's initial model.
""These were problems that were staring the government in the face for months and the government has been slow and incompetent,"" opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said.
Williamson said he was lifting a cap on the number of students that universities can accept, but it is unclear how universities will handle the unprecedented revision of grades.
The Russell Group of leading British universities said it needed urgent clarification on additional government support.
The central British government's decision, which applies to England, mirrors those made by devolved administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland on Monday, and in Scotland last week.
Analysis of the algorithm showed it had resulted in ""manifest injustice"" of favouring students in fee-paying private schools, said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank, writing for the Times.

Localities must inspect every gym before it opens or within two weeks of it opening to ensure compliance with health guidelines, Cuomo told a news conference.
As part of the state's reopening plan for gyms, air ventilation systems must meet certain guidelines and people must sign in and out so that the gym maintains a ready contact-tracing list, Cuomo said.
""Localities can also determine whether or not the gym has classes inside it,"" he said.
The planned reopening of gyms, indoor businesses where health experts say there is a greater risk of viral spread, comes as New York's COVID-19 infection rate continues to decline below 1%.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Warnings by Western officials over the need for reforms in Lebanon had often been met with disappointing responses by the country's political leaders, a senior United Nations official said on Monday following this month's Beirut port explosion.
U.S. and French officials visiting the city after the Aug. 4 blast that killed 178 people said they had made clear they would not extend a financial lifeline to the country if its leaders did not tackle corruption and mismanagement.
The officials were representing the International Support Group (ISG) for Lebanon which includes the United Nations, the United States, France and Britain.
""With grave concerns ISG Ambassadors today discussed the deepening overall crisis in Lebanon,"" tweeted Jan Kubis, U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon.
He said tough warnings had been delivered to the authorities and political leaders and their responses had often been rather disappointing.
""Expectations of the international community are well known - without urgent reforms that require broad political support Lebanon cannot count on any bailout,"" he tweeted.
The call echoes others from Western powers, including French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. Undersecretary for Political Affairs David Hale, who both visited Beirut. Hale said Lebanon needed ""economic and fiscal reforms, an end to dysfunctional governance and to empty promises"".
The detonation of highly-explosive material stored unsafely for years at the port injured 6,000, left 300,000 homeless and destroyed whole neighbourhoods.
The now-caretaker cabinet on Monday extended a state of emergency in the capital until Sept. 18.
The government resigned amid renewed protests against ruling politicians blamed for a financial crisis that developed even before the blast, that ravaged the currency, saw banks freeze depositors out of their savings and sent unemployment soaring. 
Analysts estimate that after the explosion that wrecked the port, a main trade artery, Lebanon's external financing needs swelled to more than $30 billion from $24 billion.
The outgoing government, which took office in January with the backing of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group and its allies, had not made progress in talks with the International Monetary Fund launched after Lebanon defaulted on foreign currency debt.

Forming a new government is likely to be complicated due to factional rifts in the country's sectarian power-sharing system.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on four Ugandans on Monday, including two judges, accusing them of participating in a fraudulent adoption scam, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.
The Treasury accused Ugandan judges Moses Mukiibi and Wilson Musalu Musene, lawyer Dorah Mirembe and her husband, Patrick Ecobu, of participating in a scheme that removed Ugandan children from their families under a promise of ""special education"" programs and study in the United States, and instead offered them to American families for adoption.
""Deceiving innocent Ugandan families into giving up their children for adoption has caused great suffering,"" Deputy Treasury Secretary Justin Muzinich said in a statement. ""The individuals involved in this corrupt scam deliberately exploited the good faith of Ugandans and Americans to enrich themselves.""
Monday's action freezes any U.S. assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. The State Department also barred Mukiibi and Musene from traveling to the United States.
The Treasury said Mirembe's law firm promised vulnerable families in remote villages that their children would be moved to Kampala for education, where American prospective adoptive parents then traveled to adopt children from an unlicensed children's home.
The Treasury also accused Mirembe, with help from Ecobu, of facilitating multiple bribes to judges Mukiibi and Musene. 
In a separate action, the Department of Justice on Monday said it had charged Mirembe and an American, Debra Parris of Lake Dallas, Texas, in an indictment filed last week with money laundering and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the alleged Ugandan scheme.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",Shock at German policeman's knee-on-neck arrest,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has begun an investigation after video emerged of police detaining a minor by kneeling on his neck, recalling the arrest of African-American George Floyd whose death prompted mass protests over police racism and brutality in the United States.
Footage on social media showed two officers, one with his knee first on a prone suspect's head before it shifted to his neck, as indignant passersby loudly protested. The incident occurred in the western German city of Duesseldorf on Saturday.
Herbert Reul, the interior minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, of which Duesseldorf is the capital, told broadcaster WDR on Monday he was shocked when he saw the footage, and had ordered an investigation.
In a statement, Duesseldorf police said the youth had attacked officers when they were called to deal with a group of hooligans at a nearby restaurant, leading them to arrest him in order to identify him and return him to his legal guardians.
""The video is being closely examined in respect of the way in which the police intervention took place,"" the statement said, adding that the investigation was being led by officers from a neighbouring city to ensure impartiality.
Floyd died after a white police officer arresting him in Minneapolis on May 25 held him prone on the ground with his knee upon his neck for around 9-1/2 minutes. 
In the German case, the youth's identity was not known and it was unclear whether it played any part in the way he was treated by the police. It was also not known whether the youth had suffered physical harm from the incident.
Rules permit German police to restrain a suspect by kneeling on their head, but not their neck or throats, a spokesman for the German police union told media outlet WDR.
""It's completely incomprehensible that when this young man is already pinned to the ground why the officer still has his knee on his head and throat,"" said Verena Schaeffer of the state's Green Party. ""This has to be cleared up.""
German police have faced severe criticism for failing to weed out extremism in their ranks in recent months after it emerged that a retired officer was the main suspect behind a series of racist letters sent to prominent ethnic minority Germans, threatening them with violence.

673,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",The bookish Thai rights lawyer who challenged the king,"By Panu Wongcha-um
BANGKOK (Reuters) - The deafening cheer for Anon Nampa at Thailand's biggest demonstration in years underlined the bookish human rights lawyer's emergence at the forefront of a youth protest movement with his taboo-breaking call for reforms to the monarchy.
""He looks quite harmless,"" Rangsiman Rome, a former activist who is now an opposition member of parliament, told Reuters.
""But once he gets the microphone and gets on stage or starts working, he becomes a different, serious person.""
Although the protest movement has no single leader, Anon's Aug. 3 call for curbs on the power of the monarchy shook Thai politics in a way not known in living memory and made him a hero for some and a hate figure for others.
His open challenge put Anon at risk of arrest under ""lese majeste"" charges, which can mean 15 years in jail.
""I think there is a need for everyone to be able to talk about the monarchy openly and constructively,"" Anon told Reuters. ""I think society is becoming more open about this.""
The Royal Palace did not comment on Anon or on the protesters' demands for change when contacted by Reuters. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said the king requested that nobody be prosecuted for lese majeste for now.
Anon was arrested within days of his call for reform of the monarchy, though on unrelated charges linked to earlier demonstrations, fuelling the protest movement as supporters rallied at the police station before he was freed on bail.
Other student groups, meanwhile, followed up with a 10-point demand for reforms to King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy as the topic has gone from something discussed only in whispers to a regular theme at protests.
""We dream of a monarchy that coexists with democracy,"" Anon said to cheers from a crowd of more than 10,000 people in Bangkok on Sunday, Thailand's biggest protest in years.
""We must achieve this within our generation.""
Such comments infuriate royalists.
""His action breaches good morals and degraded the honour and prestige of the profession,"" said Apiwat Kantong, an adviser in the prime minister's office who has filed legal complaints against Anon in a private capacity.
""His name should be removed from the bar registration as soon as possible,"" he said. Thailand's Lawyers Council did not comment on Apiwat's request to take this action.
At 35, Anon is older than most of the student protesters he advises. He draws on his experience of an earlier round of protests and years of court appearances to defend government critics.
FARMING FAMILY
Anon grew up in a farming family in the poor, rice-growing northeastern province of Roi Et, where opposition to the Bangkok-based establishment runs deep.
His activism began in high school and he started working in human rights in 2006, the year that elected populist leader Thaksin Shinawatra was overthrown in a military coup. 
Once Anon qualified as a lawyer in Bangkok, he saw his mission as defending society's weakest.
""Many cases he took are victims of harassment who nobody knows,"" said Krisadang Nutcharat, another human rights lawyer.
In 2010, Anon set up a legal practice to help those affected by bloody clashes between Thaksin's supporters and the authorities.
After the then army chief Prayuth seized power in a 2014 coup, Anon took on cases of political activists - including those who had been charged with lese majeste offences against the monarchy.
""In many cases, the accused spoke truthfully but the things they said are unacceptable for society at large ... The court still ruled that they are guilty,"" Anon said. ""This is why I became interested in the monarchy.""
The reforms Anon seeks to the monarchy include reducing the king's constitutional powers, which were expanded after he succeeded his late father in 2016, and dropping the lese majeste laws. 
As Anon stepped up his political activism after the 2014 coup, so the arrests began. In 2015, he was charged with organising a banned political gathering.
Including the most recent arrest, he has been charged 13 times. Of the six cases that have concluded, three were thrown out and he faced fines totalling 2,200 baht ($70) over the others. Seven cases are pending, including some for protests in 2018 to demand fair elections.
Critics accuse Prayuth of keeping power in elections last year by benefiting from electoral rules shaped by the army that helped him win. He has said the vote was fair.
With a passion for history and literature, some of Anon's inspiration - and the picture on his Twitter profile - is from 1950s-era Marxist historian and activist Chit Phumisak, whose publications include ""The Real Face of Thai Feudalism"".

In his spare time, Anon writes poetry - much of it politically inspired. One line he wrote in the aftermath of the bloodshed in 2010 reads: ""With red flag raised and bravely challenging, come comrades, revolt and topple this thievish state.""

MONTREAL/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Airlines and airports will ask a UN-led task force meeting on Tuesday to recommend countries accept a negative COVID-19 test within 48 hours of travel as an alternative to quarantines that have decimated demand for travel, according to a document seen by Reuters. 
The industry wants the task force to make the recommendation for passengers traveling from countries with high COVID-19 infection rates when it meets on Tuesday to review guidelines for international travel amid the pandemic. 
""A test prior to departure could reduce the risk of importation by up to 90%, enabling air travel to be opened up between a large number of countries without a quarantine requirement,"" said the proposal from Airports Council International (ACI) and airline trade group International Air Transport Association (IATA).
The push for testing comes as the industry's hopes for a recovery were dealt a blow last week when Britain reintroduced quarantines on travelers from France and the Netherlands.
Airlines are forecasting a 55% decline in 2020 air traffic, according to IATA, which reported 85% of surveyed travelers expressed concerns about quarantine.
""We don't support across-the-board mandatory testing,"" IATA medical adviser Dr. David Powell told Reuters. ""But if there are situations where there is a higher risk in the country of origin and it can avoid the need for quarantine, then we certainly support that and advocate for that concept.""
The proposal calls for the use of PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) tests conducted outside of airports.
The task force did not raise testing as an alternative to quarantines in May when it recommended a uniform approach toward reviving flights, but it could do so after Tuesday's meeting.
The International Civil Aviation Organization was not immediately available to comment. 
Powell said the 48-hour period recommended by IATA and ACI was up for discussion and said it could make sense for some travelers to take a second test upon arrival at their destination.
While task force recommendations are voluntary, ICAO guidelines are typically adopted by its 193-member countries. 
Requiring testing raises cost issues for travelers, given airlines are unlikely to bear the approximate $200 expense. The sector faces up to $314 billion in lost revenue in 2020, according to ICAO forecasts.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The U.S. Embassy in Budapest warned on Monday that neo-Nazi groups should not be tolerated after two rainbow flags were torn down from municipals buildings in the latest anti-LGBT incidents in Hungary.
On Friday, a hardline soccer fan was detained by police on suspicion of tearing down a flag and burning it. 
And on Sunday, Elod Novak, vice president of the far-right fringe ""Our Homeland Movement"" removed the rainbow flag installed to mark Pride celebrations from the Budapest city hall, and threw it into a rubbish bin. Police detained Novak.
The embassy said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the incidents.
""Freedom of expression is a fundamental right that should be able to be exercised without intimidation. Neo-Nazi or other hate groups should not be tolerated in any society,"" it said.
The comments were echoed in a statement by a group of embassies from around the world to mark 25th anniversary of Budapest Pride - being marked by a series of events and displays throughout the city this month as the traditional solidarity march was cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak.
A government spokesman said authorities were doing their job as Hungary is a state where laws were respected.
Rights groups say hostility to LGBT+ people has increased since nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban won a third term in 2018.
According to ILGA, an international lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex advocacy group, Hungary slipped the most in Europe in terms of rights in 2019, although it is still ahead of nearly all eastern European countries. Poland ranks last in the EU.
In Poland, where homophobia has been part of the ruling PiS party's ideology and election strategy, nationalists and defenders of LGBT rights faced off against each other in Warsaw on Sunday. Nationalists burnt a rainbow flag. 
""Those forces who fight against the biological dead end of homosexuality should team up internationally,"" Novak told Reuters, saying his group was watching developments in Poland.
Tamas Dombos, a board member of the Hungarian LGBT Alliance, expressed concern about far-right groups working together.
""For an incident like this you only need a few people, this doesn't mean that the majority of society are behind them ... this is why it is important that the local (Budapest) councils are supporting our cause,"" he said.

The blazes, that occur every year in the dry season, sent clouds of smokes billowing into the sky that could be seen and smelt from the capital of Rondonia state 24 miles (38 km) away.
Experts say the fires that threaten the world's largest rainforest are rarely a natural phenomenon and are mostly set deliberately by speculators to clear land for pasture. 
""Every year I suffer from this. Nobody knows who does this. They come and burn everything and run away,"" said bricklayer Rosalino de Oliveira as he watched a firefighter hose flames that came dangerously close to his clap-board home.
""We are poor. I can barely feed my family on my salary. The fire comes to destroy everything in a matter of seconds,"" he said, shielding his face from the suffocating smoke.
His sister Miraceli, in tears, said she feared losing the few possessions they had.
Last week, Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro denied there were any fires in the Amazon, calling it a ""lie"" and blaming the media for spreading it.
According to government data, the first 15 days of August have seen about a 17% decrease in the number of fires as this time last year, when a sharp increase in blazes across the Amazon attracted international condemnation amid alarm over the deforestation of a region crucial to the fight against global warming. 
Deforestation rose 34.5% in the 12 months through July, compared to a year earlier. 
Bolsonaro has dispatched the military to fight fires and deforestation since May, but environmental experts question whether these deployments are working.

GAZA (Reuters) - Gaza rapper Abdel-Rahman Al-Shantti may only be 11 years old but his rhymes on war and hardship in the Palestinian enclave have reached thousands of people, conveying in English what he calls ""a message of peace and humanity"".
A video of Shantti rapping outside of his school in Gaza City, surrounded by classmates wearing matching uniforms, has garnered hundreds of thousands of views on social media and was even shared by the popular British rapper Lowkey. 
""I am here to tell you our lives are hard. We got broken streets and bombs in the yard,"" go the lyrics of his song ""Gaza messenger"", alluding to three devastating wars fought between Israel and Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas. 
Though Arabic is his first language, Shantti raps in fluent, unaccented English - a skill he says he honed by listening to American rappers including Eminem, Tupac and DJ Khaled.
""I want to be like Eminem - not to copy his style, I have my own style. But he is my favourite rapper, my idol,"" he told Reuters in English as he wrote lyrics and composed rap beats through an app on his cellphone.
In another one of his songs, ""Peace"", Shantti evokes moments from a war with Israel in 2008-2009. ""I was born in Gaza City, and the first thing I heard was a gunshot. In my first breath, I tasted gunpowder,"" the lyrics say. 
Shantti says he hopes to shine a light on the challenges wrought on Gaza by an Israeli-led blockade, which economists blame for soaring poverty in the coastal territory. Israel cites threats from Hamas for the restrictions. 
""My message talks about peace, and I want to convey it to the largest number of people,"" he said. 
""I want to show (life) in Gaza to the outside.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's president on Monday invited the United Arab Emirates' de facto leader to visit Jerusalem, praising his role in achieving a ""noble and courageous"" deal to normalise relations between Israel and the UAE.
Both countries announced on Thursday they would forge formal ties under a U.S.-sponsored deal whose implementation could recast Middle East politics ranging from the Palestinian issue to dealing with Iran, the common foe of Israel and Gulf Arabs.
The deal drew anger and dismay in much of the Arab world and Iran but a quiet welcome in the Gulf.
""In these fateful days, leadership is measured by its courage and ability to be groundbreaking and far-sighted,"" Israeli President Reuven Rivlin wrote in a letter to Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi.
""I have no doubt that future generations will appreciate the way you, the brave and wise leaders, have restarted the discourse on peace, trust, dialogue between peoples and religions, cooperation and a promising future,"" Rivlin wrote.
""On behalf of the people of Israel and (me) personally, I take this opportunity to extend an invitation to Your Highness to visit Israel and Jerusalem and be our honoured guest,"" Rivlin said in the letter, which his spokesman released publicly.
The Palestinians have called the deal a ""betrayal"" by an Arab country that they have long looked to for support in establishing a state in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, lands Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. 
""I am hopeful,"" Rivlin's letter went on, ""that this step will help build and strengthen the trust between us and the peoples of the region, a trust that will promote understanding between us all.
""Such trust, as demonstrated in the noble and courageous act, will set our region forward, bring economic well-being and provide prosperity and stability to the people of the Middle East as a whole.""
Palestine Liberation Organization official Wassel Abu Youssef condemned Rivlin's invitation, saying ""the visit of any Arab official to Jerusalem through the gate of normalisation is rejected.""
Any such top-level Arab visit could be politically explosive given Jerusalem's internationally disputed status.
Israel seized the eastern part of the city in 1967 and annexed it in a move that has not won world recognition. It considers all of Jerusalem its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of the state they seek.

JERUSALEM/DUBAI (Reuters) - The United States will not consent to Israeli annexations in the occupied West Bank for ""some time,"" preferring to focus on the Israel-UAE normalisation deal and wider regional peacemaking, senior White House adviser Jared Kushner said on Monday.
The United Arab Emirates has said that its move to formalise relations with Israel, announced on Thursday, put paid to an annexation plan that angered Palestinians - who want the West Bank for a future state - and worried some world powers.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu casts the annexation plan - already dogged by disputes within his governing coalition - as temporarily on hold. But he has also said he wants approval from Israel's main ally first.
""Israel has agreed with us that they will not move forward without our consent. We do not plan to give our consent for some time,"" Kushner told reporters in a telephone briefing.
""Right now the focus has to be on, you know, getting this new peace agreement implemented. 
""We really want to get as much interchange between Israel and the United Arab Emirates as possible and we want Israel to focus on creating new relationships and new alliances.""
The U.S.-UAE-Israel joint statement on the normalisation deal said Israel had agreed to ""suspend"" the annexation plan.
""What you’re saying as suspension, we're seeing as stopping,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told reporters shortly after the deal was announced.
Palestinians, feeling sidelined six years after their own peace talks with Israel stalled, have condemned the Gulf power. 
Dismissing such censure as ""noise"", Kushner said the onus was on the Palestinians, who are boycotting U.S. President Donald Trump's administration for perceived pro-Israel bias, to come around to a new peace proposal it unveiled in January. 
Kushner said Washington was not pressuring other Gulf Arab states to recognise Israel. Kuwait, he said, was ""out there taking a very radical view on the conflict to date in favour of the Palestinians and obviously that hasn't been very constructive"".
After the 1991 Gulf war, Kuwait deported Palestinians for their leadership's siding with Iraq. Eli Avidar, a former Israeli diplomatic emissary in the Gulf turned opposition lawmaker, invoked such a scenario for Palestinians in the UAE.

""Emirati citizens are different to Israelis and Americans. They won't forget,"" he said in an Arabic speech. ""Your brothers who reside in the UAE will be expelled due to your attitudes.""

680,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 11:41AM ET</span>",Pandemic starts to surge in conflict-hit Libya,"TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - As coronavirus cases surge in Libya, medics and officials working with a health system wrecked by years of division and war are warning that the pandemic could be slipping out of their control. 
The conflict has also restricted movement within Libya, and confirmed cases remained low during the first months of the outbreak. Now, infections are jumping by up to several hundred per day to reach a total of nearly 8,200, including more than 150 deaths.
Hotspots include the capital Tripoli and the large port city of Misrata in the west, and the city of Sabha in the south.
Medics say the virus is spreading because people have carried on attending large gatherings including weddings and funerals, and are not practising physical distancing.
Ahmed al-Hasi, spokesman for the state medical committee responsible for countering the virus in eastern Libya, said the public needed to take precautions, or else medical staff with limited resources would become overwhelmed.
""They need to know that the virus is real, the casualties are real, the deaths are real,"" Hasi said. 
In Hay al-Andalus, an upscale suburb of Tripoli, Mayor Mohamed al-Fataisi told reporters the situation had become ""dangerous"", adding: ""We are unable to contain the disease.""
Night-time curfews across the country are often not respected, and there is a requirement to wear face masks in public spaces in western Libya but not in the east. The two parts of the country are run by separate administrations. 
A sharp fall in living standards has anyway left many struggling to afford even minor expenses, including masks.
""People are asked to wear masks and use (santitising) alcohol, but no one knows that they have not been paid salaries,"" said Abduladeem Mohamed, a Tripoli taxi driver. ""I prefer to buy bread for my children.""
Libya's National Centre for Disease Control, which operates across the country, could not be reached for comment.
CONFLICT'S TOLL
Libya's health facilities have long been weak. But a stop-start conflict that has split the country into rival camps has destroyed or damaged some medical facilities and left others struggling to function. Frequent power cuts during summer months add to the challenges.
Rick Brennan, the World Health Organization's regional emergency director in the Middle East, said the agency had faced serious logistical constraints in Libya, including ""major challenges bringing the PPE in, the testing kits"". 
""I think there's a reasonable understanding of what's needed, it's just having the capacities to deliver that's the problem,"" he said.
Marwa Abdulkader Alhudhairy, a resident of Sabha, said her 70-year-old father started developing coronavirus symptoms on July 8, but was only able to find a PCR swab test on July 23.
Despite suffering from heart problems, he self-treated at home because ""he is well aware of the lack of protective equipment and means available to deal with coronavirus"", she said.
Though he eventually recovered, ""we went through very difficult moments as we almost lost him"", Alhudhairy said. 
In eastern Libya, controlled by rival authorities to the internationally recognised government in Tripoli, officials fear they will be unable to cope with a surge in serious cases.

""We worry that there will come a time, and that time is not far away, when the healthcare system is unable to receive patients that need ventilators,"" said Fadi Farag al-Fortas, a doctor at the Benghazi Medical Centre.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Health workers responding to an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo have gone on strike over unpaid salaries, hurting the country's ability to identify and treat patients, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday. 
The Ebola epidemic in western Congo has spread steadily into remote villages across Equateur province since the first case was identified on June 1, infecting 88 people and killing 36.
On Saturday, local laboratory technicians, case management teams and contact tracers blocked access to the Ebola testing laboratory in the city of Mbandaka, the provincial capital, said Mory Keita, the WHO's Ebola incident manager.
They were protesting the health ministry's recent publication of their pay scales, which they thought were too low, and the government's failure to pay them since the start of the epidemic, Keita said.
""We have now some samples collected two days ago that are not tested,"" he said. ""It means we are not very effective in terms of efficiency to the response.""
Congo's health minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In June, Congo celebrated the end of a separate Ebola outbreak in the east of the country, the second-worst on record, which killed more than 2,200 people over two years. 
The virus strain responsible for the more recent outbreak in Equateur is genetically distinct from the strain in the previous outbreak, and is believed to have originated from an animal source, according to the WHO.
Congo's health system has been crippled by decades of mismanagement, underfunding and war. Some health workers responding to the coronavirus outbreak cut back their services in July to protest against unpaid bonuses.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - More than 15 years since Lebanon's Rafik al-Hariri was killed by a massive bomb blast in Beirut, the verdict of a U.N.-backed tribunal into his assassination is due on Tuesday as the country reels from the aftermath of an even bigger explosion.
The Aug. 4 port blast, which killed 178 people, has overshadowed the long-awaited verdict. It was the biggest explosion in Lebanon's history and more powerful than the bomb that killed Hariri and 21 others on Beirut's seafront corniche in 2005.
Hariri, a Sunni billionaire seen as a threat to Iranian and Syrian influence in Lebanon, had close ties with the United States, Western and Sunni Gulf Arab allies opposed to Iran's expanding role in Lebanon and the region.
Four members of the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah have been on trial in absentia over the killing of Saudi-backed Hariri, Lebanon's main Sunni Muslim leader. Hezbollah denies any role in the killing, which set the stage for years of confrontation, culminating in a brief civil war in 2008.
The verdict comes as new divisions emerge over demands for an international inquiry and political accountability for the port blast, caused by a huge amount of unsafely stored chemicals.
It may further complicate an already tumultuous situation following the explosion and the resignation of the government backed by Hezbollah and its allies.
""We're scared. The country is unsettled,"" said Ebtisam Salam, a woman in her 60s, from Beirut's Tariq al-Jadida neighbourhood, a political stronghold of the Hariri's Future Movement which has been led by his son Saad son his death.
She plans to watch the verdict on TV. ""Hopefully the truth will come out,"" she said.
The U.N.-backed tribunal was a first for Lebanon. For its supporters, it held out hope that - for once - the truth could be uncovered in one of Lebanon's many assassinations. 
Hezbollah has always dismissed it as a tool in the hands of its adversaries. Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, its leader, said on Friday, the group was not concerned with the verdict and insisted on the innocence of its members.
Hariri's supporters, including his son Saad who like his father served as prime minister, say they are not seeking revenge or confrontation, but that the court verdict must be respected.
""A lot of people are waiting for this decision for closure. This tribunal has cost not only money but blood,"" Basem Shaab, Saad al-Hariri's diplomatic adviser, told Reuters. 
""It will have consequences, I do not expect turmoil in the streets. I think Prime Minister Hariri was wise enough to make sure this does not turn into a sectarian issue,"" he said.
""THEY ASSASSINATED A CITY"" 
But Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said there was the possibility of increased tensions.
""While the Future Movement and Hezbollah seem to be on alert and trying to avoid any repercussions, some other actors might jump in and react given the current level of tensions,"" he said.
The Aug. 4 blast has fuelled anger at ruling politicians who were already facing criticism over a financial meltdown that has sunk the currency and demolished the value of savings.
Many Lebanese doubt the authorities can carry out a proper investigation into the blast. Some want foreign intervention. Others, notably Hezbollah, do not.
Agents with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation arrived over the weekend to help at the authorities' request but have yet to visit the port, Lebanese sources said. 
Hezbollah, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States, opposes the FBI's involvement and any international inquiry, saying this would aim to cover up any involvement by Israel - if it was involved.
Israel has denied any role.
President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, has said a probe will look into whether the blast was caused by negligence, an accident or “external interference”.
Many worry the sectarian elite will escape accountability.
Ziad Sahyouni, 55, questioned the importance of the verdict set against the port blast. ""They assassinated a capital, a city. Let's hope they do something about it.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe underwent a medical check-up in hospital on Monday, a government source said, amid concern voiced by a top official that the premier could be suffering fatigue from handling the coronavirus pandemic.
Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, returned home after about seven-and-a-half hours in hospital, Kyodo news agency said.
The agency quoted a source at Abe's office as saying ""Abe underwent various check-ups since he had the whole day (free) on a weekday"", stressing that nothing was wrong with the prime minister.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato, a close aide, said he understood it was a regular check-up and he was ""not at all"" worried about Abe's health.
""All I know is from media reports. And I understand it was reported as a regular check-up,"" Kato told reporters. 
Abe gets a regular check-up twice a year, with his most recent on June 13, Kyodo said, adding that Monday's visit was a follow-up to the June check-up, citing a hospital source.
The hospital visit follows weekend comments by Akira Amari, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel, that Abe, 65, could be suffering from fatigue because of his continuous work over the response to the virus.
""I want him to take a break,"" Amari told a Fuji TV news programme on Sunday. ""He has a strong sense of responsibility and feels it's wrong to take a break.""
Abe, in office since 2012 in his second stint as prime minister, resigned from his first term in 2007 because of struggles with ulcerative colitis, which he now keeps under control with medication that was not previously available.
Japanese media have speculated about Abe's health this month, including detailed reports on Abe's walking speed. Weekly magazine Flash said Abe had vomited blood at his office on July 6. Reuters was unable to verify the report.
""I see the prime minister every day, and I think he has no (health) problems at all, as he has been carrying out his duties smoothly,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told an Aug. 5 news conference in response to questions following the report.
Abe has discharged regular duties in recent weeks and was last seen in public on Saturday, at a Tokyo ceremony commemorating Japan's World War Two defeat.
He had his check-up at Tokyo's Keio University Hospital, the source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

There are no reports that Abe is unable to perform his duties, but should that ever become the case, Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as finance minister, would take over.

684,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Factbox: The assassination of Lebanon's Hariri and its aftermath,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's Rafik al-Hariri was assassinated in 2005. Here are some details about him, his death, and its impact ahead of a verdict by a U.N. backed tribunal on Tuesday: 
WHO WAS RAFIK AL-HARIRI?
Hariri served as prime minister of Lebanon five times following the 1975-90 civil war. A multi-billionaire who made his fortune in construction in Saudi Arabia, he was the dominant Sunni Muslim politician in Lebanon's sectarian system.
He became prime minister for the first time in 1992, a rare case of a Lebanese leader who had not fought in the war. He led efforts to rebuild Beirut, particularly the downtown area.
A close friend of the late French president Jacques Chirac, Hariri was known for his international contacts. He was a Saudi passport holder and seen as a symbol of Saudi influence in the post-war years during which Lebanon was dominated by Syria.
THE ASSASSINATION
On Feb. 14, 2005, Hariri got into his car after visiting the Café de l'Etoile by parliament, where he served as an MP. As his motorcade passed along the seafront corniche, a truck bomb tore through his vehicle, leaving a massive crater and ripping the facades of the surrounding buildings. 
Twenty-one people were killed in addition to Hariri by the blast outside the St. George Hotel. Those killed included Hariri's bodyguards, pedestrians and the former economy minister Bassil Fleihan. 
TENSIONS AHEAD OF HIS DEATH 
In the year before his assassination, Hariri had been embroiled in a row over the extension of the term of pro-Syria President Emile Lahoud. Under Syrian pressure, the constitution was amended to allow the three-year extension. Hariri had opposed the move but eventually signed the amendment.
In September, 2004, a U.N. Security Council resolution put pressure on Syria over its role in Lebanon. It called for a free and fair presidential election, the withdrawal of all foreign forces, and for the disbandment of armed groups in the country, which included the pro-Damascus Hezbollah. 
In October, Hariri quit as prime minister.
The turmoil in Lebanon was set against a backdrop of upheaval in the region, where the power balance had been turned on its head by the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. 
This set the stage for an escalation of rivalry between Shi'ite Iran and its allies on the one hand, including Syria, and U.S.-allied, Sunni-led Gulf Arab states on the other.
THE IMPACT
His assassination ignited the ""Cedar Revolution"" mass protests against the Syrian presence in Lebanon. Under growing international pressure, Syria withdrew its troops in April.
Lebanon was reshaped.
Hariri's son, Saad, led a coalition of anti-Syrian parties known as March 14, which was backed by Western states and Saudi Arabia. Syria's Lebanese allies, including the Shi'ite Hezbollah, gathered into a rival alliance called March 8. A sectarian divide emerged between Sunnis and Shi'ites.
Lebanon's two main Christian Maronite leaders, Michel Aoun and Samir Geagea, both returned to political life: Aoun returned from exile and Geagea was released from jail.
The March 14 alliance won a parliamentary majority in June.
Several years of political conflict ensued between March 14 and March 8, much of it focused on the issue of Hezbollah's weapons. The tribunal into the Hariri killing was also a point of conflict.
The tension culminated in a brief eruption of civil conflict in 2008 during which Hezbollah took over Beirut.
THE INVESTIGATION
Initially headed by German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis, an international investigation got underway in June, 2005. By October, it had issued a report implicating high-ranking Syrian and Lebanese officials. Syria always denied any involvement.
In August, four Lebanese generals who were pillars of the Syrian-dominated order were arrested at the request of Mehlis. They were released nearly four years later without charge after the tribunal said there was not sufficient evidence to indict them. They always denied any role.
Mehlis was replaced in early 2006. The investigation moved slowly. Several key personnel resigned.
Saad al-Hariri, who had blamed Syria for his father’s death, retracted his accusation against Damascus in 2010.
In 2011, the tribunal named four Hezbollah members wanted over the killing. The indictment said they were linked to the attack largely by circumstantial evidence gleaned from phone records. A fifth member of Hezbollah was indicted in 2012.

Hezbollah dismissed the indictment, saying it contained no proof of what it said were fabricated accusations. One of the original four suspects, senior Hezbollah commander Mustafa Badreddine, was killed in Syria in 2016.

KABUL (Reuters) - Some Western nations including France and Australia have urged Afghanistan not to free all of a final batch of prisoners demanded by Taliban militants, officials said, posing a further possible complication to long-awaited peace talks. 
The Afghan government, under pressure from the United States as it withdraws its troops from a war which started in 2001, agreed last week to begin releasing the final 400 prisoners demanded by the Taliban as a pre-condition to start peace talks in Qatar. 
It was not immediately clear whether the Western objections were delaying the talks, which are set to begin in Doha soon after the remaining 320 prisoners are freed. Eighty have already been released.
Two Western diplomats in Kabul said the full list of prisoners had not been shared with many nations until last week and that France and Australia were strongly opposed to a few prisoners on the list going free. 
French and Australian officials confirmed in recent days they were opposed to certain prisoners being released, without specifying how many.
""France asks the Afghan government not to proceed with the release of several terrorists convicted of killing French citizens in Afghanistan,"" the French Embassy in Kabul said on Twitter.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne told media last week the Australian government had been in touch with Washington and the Afghan government asking them not to free one of the prisoners, Hekmatullah, a former Afghan army sergeant who killed three Australian solders.
One solution proposed, the sources said, was ""house arrest"" under which the prisoners would be placed under supervision outside the prison system. Reuters reported last month the idea had been suggested by U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad during an earlier deadlock.
Afghanistan's acting foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar said on Sunday the government was working to achieve ""consensus"" among the international community. 
""The world has protested... Our work will be to create consensus on it with the world,"" he told journalists.
A peace ministry spokeswoman said on Monday that talks would not be delayed and a date would be announced in coming days.

687,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>","Factbox: The Lebanon Tribunal: the case, suspects and evidence","THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Judges at The Special Tribunal for Lebanon are due to give their verdict on Tuesday in the trial of four men accused over the 2005 Beirut bombing that killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and 21 others.
Hariri, a Sunni Muslim billionaire seen as a threat to Iranian and Syrian influence in Lebanon, had close ties with the United States, Western and Sunni Gulf Arab allies opposed to Iran's expanding role in Lebanon and the region.
Here is a look at the tribunal and the defendants. 
TRIBUNAL
The Special Tribunal for Lebanon is an international court set up jointly by the United Nations and Lebanon to try suspects in the 2005 bombing and other political killings in Lebanon around the same time. Tuesday's verdict will be the first since its creation.
DEFENDANTS
The defendants, being tried in absentia, are Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hassan Habib Merhi, Assad Hassan Sabra and Hussein Hassan Oneissi. All are members of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese Shi'ite group. All are charged with conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack, while Ayyash is charged with committing a terrorist act, the homicide of 22 people, and the attempted homicide of 226. The others are charged as accomplices. Hezbollah denies involvement in killing Hariri, a Sunni.
UNKNOWN WHEREABOUTS
The defendants' whereabouts are not known. They are not in custody and have not participated in their trial, though judges ruled they are aware of the charges against them. The defendants have not appeared or spoken in public since the trial started, nor communicated with the court-appointed lawyers representing them. If they do show up at any time during the case they have the right to a retrial or appeal.
PROSECUTORS
Prosecutors, led by Canadian Norman Farrell, allege that Ayyash was central to the planning and the execution of the assassination. The men are also accused of preparing a false claim of responsibility to deflect blame. Prosecutors say the men, as Hezbollah supporters, may have been motivated by a desire for Syrian involvement in Lebanon to continue, a policy ""which Hariri threatened"".
EVIDENCE
During the 2014-2018 trial judges heard from 297 witness. Prosecutors presented what they call a ""mosaic of evidence"" mostly based on mobile phone records. Prosecutors say the pattern of phone calls shows the men were observing Hariri in the months before his assassination, and that they helped to coordinate and time the attack.
DEFENCE 
Lawyers for the accused men say there is no direct evidence linking their clients to the mobile phones identified by the prosecution. They have asked for acquittal.
VERDICT
Tuesday's ruling will decide only whether the four accused have been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If they are convicted, sentencing hearings would be held later. They could face a maximum sentence of life.
HAGUE COURT

In 2009 the U.N. established the court in Leidschendam, a suburb of The Hague, Netherlands, which houses numerous international courts, to ensure it could operate securely and independently. The ""hybrid"" court's rules are based on Lebanese criminal law and international law, and judges are a mix of Lebanese and international magistrates.

688,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 09:31AM ET</span>",Back to the paddy fields. COVID smashes Indian middle-class dreams,"By Saurabh Sharma and Devjyot Ghoshal
DUTTA NAGAR, India (Reuters) - Until late March, Ashish Kumar was helping to make plastic boxes for Ferrero Rocher praline chocolates and the plastic spoons tucked inside Kinder Joy eggs to scoop out the milky sweet cream inside.
With a diploma in plastic mould technology, the 20-year-old had a foot on his chosen career ladder. His younger brother Aditya chose law, but Ashish had his sights set on plastic.
""I want to start a business of my own,"" he said, explaining how he wants to recycle plastic to make day-to-day products at his own factory.
India's coronavirus lockdown has thrown those plans into disarray. Educated but unemployed, Ashish Kumar is one of countless people across the globe whose social progress has been halted by the new coronavirus that has infected more than two million people in India alone, and thrown the economy into reverse. With it, the aspirations of millions are fading.
For years, people in rural India have been gaining prosperity and moving into what economists call a burgeoning middle class of consumers – those who earn more than $10 a day, by some definitions. This group has been a keystone of plans for economic development in the world's second most populous country. In the COVID-19 pandemic, India's economy is forecast to shrink by 4.5% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. At least 400 million Indian workers are at risk of falling deeper into poverty, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO).
Kumar is one of around 131,000 people who local officials estimate returned from working around India to Gonda, the district in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh that he left last June. Nationwide, about 10 million people made long, hard journeys back to rural villages they'd left. Some have gone back to the cities, but many of those who had been sending back funds are still stuck in the countryside. 
Working in a factory in Baramati in the western state of Maharashtra, Kumar was earning 13,000 rupees ($173) every month, more than twice his father's pay from a job in a grain market near Kumar's home village in Uttar Pradesh, a sprawling agrarian state. Of that, the young man was sending home around 9,000 rupees every month, much of which was helping to fund his younger brother's studies.
No longer. Once a provider for his family, now he has become a financial burden.
Kumar whiles away his time back home in the village of Dutta Nagar, bantering with friends in the muddy courtyard – they jokingly call it their ""office"" – outside the ramshackle primary school where he studied. In Uttar Pradesh, around 60 million of the state's population of more than 200 million lives in poverty, according to the World Bank. 
He said he has applied for several jobs at plastic factories in western Gujarat state and other parts of northern India but hasn't found work.
""No matter what,"" he said, sitting near his parent's single-storey home, surrounded by jade green paddy fields. ""I need a job.""
PLASTIC FOR PRALINES
As a schoolboy, Kumar was obsessed with plastics.
A chance conversation with a cousin who had studied plastic engineering got him hooked, Kumar said, and he started researching. In Dutta Nagar, where there were no internet connections, that often meant asking one of a handful of locals with a smartphone to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) the opportunities.
Kumar's ambitions were a world removed from his father Ashok's early years. The 47-year-old, who assists with weighing and pricing grain harvests, remembers when the family had neither enough food, or proper clothes.
A slight man with a weather-beaten face, he never finished high school.
""I thought that the children shouldn't fall into our rut. They should be pushed ahead,"" he said.
Kumar, who says he has never tasted a Ferrero Rocher praline, finished his diploma in Gujarat last June, and took the train to start work as a technician at an Italian-owned factory 1,500 km (930 miles) away from home. 
The factory that employed him is run by Dream Plast India, a subsidiary of Gruppo Sunino SpA, an Italian plastics maker with 10 plants around the world. ""The factory was first class,"" Kumar said. His contract included a monthly contribution from the company into a retirement fund and a bonus. Workers were served one meal every day, the supervisors were friendly, and the salary came on time, he said.
Six days a week, his work typically involved overseeing two machines and a couple of contract workers. At the end of the day, he would relax with a game of badminton or watch wrestling on YouTube.
His income over the past year helped his parents build a proper four-roomed brick home, after decades of living in a tumble-down mud hut where the roof let in heavy monsoon rains. It helped pay the fees for his brother to go to law school in Bahraich, an hour and a half's drive away from their home village. 
Then COVID-19 struck.
BROKE IN BARAMATI
Kumar first heard of the coronavirus in early March. When India's lockdown forced Dream Plast India to temporarily shut its plant in Baramati on March 21, he had enough cash to wait it out in town. 
As the pandemic swept through India, a survey of some 5,000 workers in April and May found 66% of participants had lost their jobs, and 77% of households were consuming less food than before. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government announced a 20 trillion rupee package promising free rice, wheat and pulses for millions of people and a programme to provide employment in rural areas.
Even for those with work, trade unions and labour experts say conditions are deteriorating, for migrants particularly.  
In May, India's state governments issued health and safety guidelines for factories as they re-opened after lockdown, which included compulsory face masks, thermal screening, social distancing and frequent sanitisation. Union leaders allege many companies did not follow all protocols and cut corners, but they have not identified Kumar's.
Indian states including Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat said in May they were looking to relax workers' rights, including weakening regulations on wages and working hours, to support industry. That proposal drew criticism from workers' unions and the ILO. The amendments have only taken effect in some states.
Kumar's factory, which reopened in early May, did not respond to a question on measures taken there, but Dream Plast India's managing director Nitin Gupta said in an email the ""company takes utmost precautions to adhere to the laws at all times."" He declined to elaborate further.
Even so, Kumar and another worker Reuters spoke to said they didn't feel safe to return. 
Ferrero SpA, the Italian confectioner, said it had audited the plant where Kumar worked in March 2020 and found no irregularities, but would further review subsequent months.
Reuters was unable to independently determine what safety measures the factory took. 
By early June, Kumar's funds had run out. Even buying food became difficult.
His parents grew increasingly worried. ""Whatever little money I had here in the bank, I sent some of that so he could eat,"" said his father, Ashok. ""At that time, I was very scared. The biggest challenge was for him to come home.""
India's railway network re-opened in early May. On June 3, Kumar borrowed money to pay for a 48-hour journey home by train, bus and shared taxi. Then he went into a 14-day quarantine.
On June 25, Dream Plast India sent him an email, which was seen by Reuters, asking him to report to work within four days or face termination. Instead, he resigned on July 20. 
His parents are apprehensive about him leaving home again, although they said they realise that without their elder son's earnings, his younger brother won't be able to finish law school.
Kumar isn't ready to give up on his plastics factory.

""I will do it,"" he said. ""No matter what it takes, I will fulfil my dream.""

The Cypriot comments came after Greece failed to secure a strong commitment from fellow EU nations for sanctions against Turkey for carrying out offshore natural gas surveys in areas where both countries claim jurisdiction.
Two Turkish survey ships are in two areas of the disputed maritime region - one that Greece says is on its continental shelf, and the other claimed by the island state of Cyprus. In both cases, Turkey says it has jurisdiction.
""Unfortunately we are observing a diffidence from the European Union in taking on a substantive role and adopting policies of deterrence,"" Cypriot government spokesman Kyriakos Koushios said in remarks to reporters.
He said Nicosia welcomed expressions of support from EU partners but this was not enough. ""The policy of appeasement and the messages of support are not enough to discourage Turkey from its illegal actions."" 
The EU, he said, needed to have a ""more intense"" presence in the eastern Mediterranean.
Turkey drew another EU rebuke on Sunday when it said its Yavuz energy drill ship would extend operations in disputed Mediterranean waters off Cyprus until mid-September.
Cyprus's internationally-recognised Greek Cypriot government has long been at loggerheads with Turkey. The island was split after a 1974 Turkish invasion spurred by a brief coup engineered by the military then ruling Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in north Cyprus is recognised only by Ankara.
Turkey questions Cyprus's right to explore in the seas around the island because it maintains that the Nicosia administration does not represent the interests of Turkish Cypriots - an argument dismissed by Cyprus, which is legally recognised as representing the entire island. 

In Turkey's dispute with Greece, the two countries are at odds over the delimitation of their continental shelves.

The Czech Republic was among the first countries in Europe to order people to wear masks in most public places in March but had gradually lifted the requirement as infections fell in late spring. But infections have again started to trend higher.
""We consider this to be a preventative measure given that we are probably facing a complicated autumn, especially after Sept 1 when there will be high social interaction,"" Health Minister Adam Vojtech said on Monday, announcing the decision.
Schools are due to reopen on Sept 1 after the summer vacation.
The new rules will require people to wear face masks in shops, common areas of schools and in public buildings, though not in the workplace or in restaurants and bars.
The government has also cut the minimum quarantine requirement to 10 days since meeting an infected person from 14 days.
The Czech Republic, with a population of 10.7 million, has so far reported around 20,000 COVID-19 cases in total, but just 397 deaths, very low compared to many European countries. 

It currently has 5,816 cases, the highest number ever, but the number of people requiring hospital treatment has continued to decline. Only 104 people with COVID-19 were in hospital as of Sunday.

Israel and the UAE announced on Thursday that they will normalise diplomatic relations under a U.S.-sponsored deal whose implementation could reshape Middle East politics from the Palestinian issue to the fight against Iran. The UAE would only be third Arab state in more than 70 years to establish relations with Israel.
Netanyahu, briefed at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport on plans for expanding flight activity curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic, gave no time frame for the opening of an air link with the Gulf Arab country.
""We are currently working on enabling direct flights, over Saudi Arabia, between Tel Aviv and Dubai and Abu Dhabi,"" Netanyahu told reporters, estimating flight time at ""about three hours, just like to Rome"".
Saudi Arabia does not recognise Israel and its air space is closed to Israeli airliners. But in what was seen in Israel as a harbinger of warmer relations with Riyadh, Air India was allowed in 2018 to begin flying over Saudi territory on its New Delhi-Tel Aviv route.
At Ben-Gurion airport, Netanyahu said he saw ""tremendous scope for bilateral tourism and gigantic scope for investment"" with the UAE.
A delegation from Israel is expected to travel to the UAE within weeks to work out the modalities of normalised relations, but any swift opening of a commercial air route could be complicated by coronavirus restrictions.

On Sunday, the UAE opened telephone lines to Israel, a link inaugurated in a conversation between the two countries' foreign ministers.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A retired Chinese professor who called President Xi Jinping a ""mafia boss"" and the ruling Communist Party a ""political zombie"" has been disciplined, according to her former employer, the latest such critic to face punishment in recent months.
Cai Xia, who had taught democratic politics at the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party before retiring, is the third prominent figure in recent months to be disciplined after criticising the party and its leader.
The school, which trains rising officials destined for promotion, announced on Monday that it had rescinded Cai's Communist Party membership and retirement benefits for making remarks that ""had serious political problems and damaged the country's reputation"".
The notice on the school's website did not specify the remarks. 
Two Chinese political watchers, however, pointed to comments she made in a recording leaked online in June arguing that replacing Xi as party chief would be the first step to saving the party from itself.
In the recording heard by Reuters, a woman identified as Cai by fellow academics called Xi a ""mafia boss"" who turned the party into his personal tool, and a ""political zombie"".
""If the Politburo Standing Committee has any sense of responsibility to the people, the country and the party, they should call for a meeting to replace Xi,"" she said.
It was unclear where, when or to whom she was speaking.
Cai could not be reached for comment.
Cai is the grand-daughter of a revolutionary fighter and taught for four decades at the party school, giving her a solid ""red background"".
China has cracked down on dissent in recent years. 
Last month, a law professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University who criticised Xi and the party was detained by police and then fired. The professor, Xu Zhangrun, is seeking to clear his name by overturning a prostitution charge brought against him by police, his lawyer has said.

Turkey provided crucial military support to the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) to help it stave off a 14-month assault from rival forces based in eastern Libya earlier this year.
Libya has been split since 2014 between factions based in the east and west of the country, and regional powers have aligned themselves with the competing sides.
While Turkey and its regional ally Qatar support the GNA, forces in the east led by Khalifa Haftar have received backing from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia.
Turkey signed a military accord with the GNA late last year, as well as a memorandum of understanding on maritime boundaries, that rattled its rivals in the eastern Mediterranean.
Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar and Chief of Staff General Yasar Guler were in Tripoli on Monday to ""observe the operations"" under the military cooperation deal with Libya, Turkey's defence ministry said.
Turkey and Russia have emerged as the main power brokers in Libya's conflict, with military front lines settling in recent weeks around the central towns of Sirte and Jufra. 
Previous attempts to secure a ceasefire and a political deal in Libya, including at an international conference in Berlin in January, have stalled.

Sunday's toll includes 11 victims and five assailants, Ismail Mukhtar Omar said in a tweet late on Sunday, adding: ""Security forces lost one, 18 people were injured."" 
Militants stormed the high-end Elite Hotel in Lido beach, detonated a car bomb and then opened fire with assault rifles, the latest attack by al Shabaab, which has been battling the country's central government since 2008. 
Aamin ambulance services transported to hospitals at least 43 people injured in the attack, its head Abdikadir Abdirahman told Reuters on Monday. 
The hotel is owned by Abdullahi Mohamed Nor, a lawmaker and former finance minister, and is popular with government officials and members of the Somali diaspora.
Al Shabaab wants to topple the central government and establish its own rule based on its own strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law.
On Monday, five soldiers were killed after fighters from the group launched a car bomb and gun assault on a Somali military base in the Goofgaduud area, about 30 kilometres from the town of Baidoa in Somalia's southwest. 
Three soldiers were killed when a suicide car bomber rammed the gate to the base, Major Mohamed Aden, a military officer in Baidoa told Reuters.
Soldiers abandoned the base and al Shabaab fighters entered it, planting a booby-trap bomb on the body of one of the dead men, he said. ""When soldiers came back to carry the dead, (a) bomb went off from the body of the dead soldier, killing two more soldiers,"" Aden added.
Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman Abdiasis Abu Musab told Reuters the attackers had killed eight soldiers, including the base commander. 
Over the years al Shabaab has waged its war through bombings and gun assaults on military and civilian targets like hotels and busy intersections in Mogadishu and across Somalia.
Al Shabaab has also carried out attacks in neighbouring Kenya and Uganda as revenge for their military deployments in Somalia as part of a regional peace keeping mission. 

Somalia has been embroiled in violence since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew leader Mohamed Siad Barre and then turned on each other.

The United States lost a bid on Friday to extend a U.N. arms embargo on Iran.
Russia and China opposed extending the weapons ban, which is due to expire in October under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Eleven members abstained, including France, Germany and Britain, while the United States and the Dominican Republic were the only two votes in favour.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the failure of the U.S. resolution ""again showed that unilateralism has no popular support, and hegemonistic behaviour will not succeed"".
The United States needed to end its unilateral sanctions and adopt a rational attitude, returning to the ""correct path"" of respecting the Iran nuclear agreement and Security Council decisions, Zhao added.
""As for the Russian proposal for a teleconference summit on the Iran nuclear issue, China expresses its welcome and appreciation,"" he said.
""We are willing to continue to maintain close communication and coordination with all parties concerned to jointly promote a political settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.""
U.S. President Donald Trump said he probably would not participate in any such summit.

China, which has close economic and diplomatic ties with Iran, has frequently clashed with the Trump administration over its tough stance against Tehran, becoming another irritant in Sino-U.S. relations.

SRINAGAR (Reuters) - Militants killed three Indian policemen in Kashmir on Monday, as attacks on security forces and village leaders escalate in the disputed Muslim-majority region.
Kashmir Police Chief Vijay Kumar told Reuters that militants attacked a security check-point north of the main city of Srinagar and killed one local policeman and two officers from the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force.
Two policemen were also killed in an attack on Friday. ""We are developing leads and will neutralize the militants involved in the two attacks soon,"" he said.
This month Kashmir, claimed by both India and Pakistan, marked the one year since New Delhi revoked its constitutional autonomy, inflaming religious tensions.
Many people saw the move as another step in the erosion of Muslim rights by India's Hindu-nationalist government. New Delhi rejects that argument and says it will bring the region closer to the rest of the country.
Kumar added that security forces averted a major attack on Monday morning when they recovered an improvised explosive device planted under a bridge in Pulwama district located south of Srinagar.
In recent weeks, militants have also intensified attacks on village council members and other leaders in Kashmir - many of whom belong to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
In the past three months, militants have shot dead five such people, prompting police to move 1,000 village leaders to high-security zones.
Kashmir has been disputed by India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Both countries claim it in full but rule it in part.

Authorities toughened curbs on movement in some parts of the island over the weekend, as new infections emerged after more than three months with no cases. 
In a statement, the government said three Indonesian patients had arrived by special flights last Friday to be treated at private hospitals, two victims of cancer and one in need of immediate treatment.
""The state government deeply regrets that it was not informed of the 'sudden' arrival of the patients,"" Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow said, announcing the ban.
The state did not say if the three had tested positive for the virus. But Penang authorities were told the patients had followed all the standard operating procedures, the chief minister said.
The ban will stay until the healthcare ministry finalises procedures to deal with healthcare tourism, he added.
AirAsia.com, the digital platform of budget airline AirAsia Group Bhd, said it flew its first medical charter flight to Penang from the Indonesian city of Medan on Friday, with another charter from Jakarta scheduled for next Monday.
Penang authorities have also ordered all agencies related to health tourism to provide notifications and information.
The southeast Asian nation has detected a highly infectious mutation of the virus, it said on Sunday, when the tally of cases stood at 9,200.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's prime minister postponed the country's general election on Monday by a month to Oct. 17 as the city of Auckland remains in lockdown due to a growing coronavirus outbreak.
Jacinda Ardern bowed to pressure to delay the polls after some parties complained they could not campaign with nearly a third of New Zealand's 5 million people under lockdown in Auckland.
""Ultimately, the 17th of October ... provides sufficient time for parties to plan around the range of circumstances we will be campaigning under,"" Ardern said at a news conference.
She ruled out delaying the polls any further, as her Labour Party maintains a strong lead over the conservative National Party in opinion polls.
""We are all in the same boat. We are all campaigning in the same environment,"" Ardern said. 
New Zealand on Monday recorded nine new cases of COVID-19, taking the number of active cases to 78. There have now been a total of 1,280 cases in the country, and 22 deaths.
An earlier election would have worked in Ardern's favour, as her success in stifling COVID-19 and keeping the country virus-free for 102 days until the latest outbreak had boosted her popularity. 
The election was scheduled for Sept. 19 and New Zealand law requires it to be held by Nov. 21. Advance voting will now start on Oct. 3.
Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, who had called for a delay, said ""common sense has prevailed"". 
The leader of the populist New Zealand First party delivered government to Labour through a coalition deal after no party won a majority at the 2017 election.
BORDER FAILURE?
Ardern's opponents accuse her of using the pandemic to shore up support as she appears on television nearly every day to reassure New Zealanders, while other party leaders struggle to get attention.
Her rivals are hoping Ardern loses some of her appeal once economic hardships caused by the lockdown begin to bite.
New Zealand has fared far better than most countries during the pandemic but an abrupt resurgence of COVID-19 last week in Auckland prompted Ardern to extend a lockdown for the city's 1.7 million residents until Aug. 26, while social distancing rules are in place in other towns and cities.
The origin of the new outbreak is still unknown. Authorities said previously that it could have been through an Americold cold-storage facility where one of the infected individuals worked. 
Tests of surfaces in the facility are under way to identify the genome sequence. Australian authorities are also investigating if there is any link to an Americold facility in the Australian city of Melbourne, where COVID-19 cases have surged in recent weeks. 
Results are expected later this week.
Another possible source is the quarantine system for New Zealanders returning from overseas. 
""Right now the focus must be on finding out exactly what failed so catastrophically at the border so we can be sure it won’t happen again,"" National Party leader Judith Collins said on Twitter.
New Zealanders celebrated when authorities eliminated community transmission of the coronavirus at the start of the pandemic with a hard lockdown that forced almost everyone to stay at home.

The government extended a wage subsidy scheme and mortgage deferral programme to support businesses and jobs affected by the lockdown.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 12:10AM ET</span>",Taiwan to step up efforts to prevent Chinese spies settling,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan will step up scrutiny of mainland Chinese citizens who are residents of Hong Kong and seek to move to the island to ensure they do not engage in spying or other illegal acts, the government said on Monday.
Taiwan has offered to welcome Hong Kong people who wish to leave the turmoil-hit Chinese-run city for the democratic island, especially after Beijing imposed a new national security law on the former British colony, though Taiwan officials have expressed concern some who come may be spies.
The new measures are aimed at ""strengthening the management"" of people from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau who have residence in either of the two Chinese-ruled cities and seek to settle in Taiwan, the island's Mainland Affairs Council said.
It aims to prevent them from ""carrying out infiltration, united front, disturbance or spying activities"", the council said.
United front refers to the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department, which is in charge of co-opting overseas Chinese and non-communists.
The order targets Hong Kong and Macau residents who are originally from mainland China, or who are current or previous party, government or military officials, the council added.
Applications from such people will be subject to cross-department review to help protect national security, it said.
Communist China claims capitalist Taiwan as its ""sacred"" territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Beijing's control, though most people in Taiwan have shown no interest in being ruled by China.
Taiwan and China have extensive business and people-to-people exchanges but remain deeply suspicious of each other.
Taiwan in July opened an office to help Hong Kong people who wish to move to the island.
Taiwan has long been wary of Chinese efforts to influence its democracy through illicit funding of politicians and the media and other methods like spying. 
Parliament last year passed an anti-infiltration law to improve how Taiwan combats perceived threats from China.

Beijing denounced the move, saying Taiwan was trying to stir up enmity towards China.

The two men met at the inauguration of Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader. 
On Friday, Acting Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs Michael Kozak told reporters that although Washington recognized that there were difficulties in organizing elections in Haiti, the president should move ahead with laying groundwork.

""We're trying to build a little bit of a fire there,"" Kozak said. ""If you're going to have a democracy, that means all three branches of the democracy need to be in place. It can't just be one or two.""

SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - The Dominican Republic's new president, Luis Abinader, warned as he took office on Sunday that the country faced stiff challenges from a flagging economy and a coronavirus pandemic that has caused more than 1,450 deaths in the small Caribbean nation. 
""Recovery will not come quickly or easily,"" the 53-year-old economist said in his first speech to Congress, stressing the damage wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic on tourism, the country's main economic driver, and exports.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Militants stormed a high-end seaside hotel in Mogadishu on Sunday, killing at least seven people and wounding more than 20 as they detonated a car bomb then opened fire with assault rifles in the latest attack in the Somali capital. 
Islamist insurgent group al Shabaab said it was behind the assault on the Elite Hotel in Lido beach, and that its gunmen battled security forces who rushed to the scene. 
At about midnight, state news agency SONNA said the operation was over and that 205 people had been rescued, ""including ministers, lawmakers and civilians,"" citing Farhan Qarole, a security forces commander at the hotel. 
""All the four militants armed with AK-47 were shot dead. They were aboard the car bomb, they got off ... and the four militants went in the hotel to fight,"" SONNA said, adding that full details of casualties will be given later.
The hotel is owned by Abdullahi Mohamed Nor, a lawmaker and former finance minister, and is frequented by many government officials and members of the Somali diaspora. 
""There were officials of (President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo's) government inside the hotel when we attacked,"" said a statement broadcast on al Shabaab's Radio Andalus.
The attack follows an uprising at Mogadishu's central prison on Monday. SONNA said at least 15 prisoners and four guards were killed when security forces beat back the rebellion.
A witness, Ahmed Ali, said on Sunday he had heard ""a huge blast at the hotel, gunfire followed, and then clouds of smoke"". 
""So far we confirmed seven people died, including two attackers, two junior directors and three civilians,"" information ministry spokesman Ismail Mukhtar Omar told Reuters.
""Fifteen people were injured,"" he added. 
Aamin ambulance service head Abdikadir Abdirahman had earlier told Reuters the service had transported 28 injured people from the scene before exchanges of gunfire started.
Hotel owner Nor posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after escaping the building: ""May Allah have mercy on all those who died in the attack by the terrorists on civilians particularly on Elite Hotel in which I was in."" 
Mohamed Nur, a government worker who lives near Lido beach, said the exchange of gunfire was ""terrible"". 
""Stray bullets reached us near the beach,"" he said.
Somalia has been embroiled in violence since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew leader Siad Barre and then turned on each other. 
Since 2008, al Shabaab has been fighting to overthrow the internationally-recognised central government and establish its rule based on its own interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Forty indigenous families have fled their homes in north Guatemala after an armed group set fire to several residences on occupied farmland, a land rights group said on Sunday.
Peasant farmer groups involved in land occupations frequently suffer violence in the Central American nation. Advocacy organization Global Witness in 2019 called Guatemala one of the world's most dangerous places for land rights defenders.
Guatemala's Committee of Peasant Unity (CUC) said the families belong to the Q'eqchi' indigenous group and are former workers of the Cubilgüitz coffee farm in the Alta Verapaz department laid off 15 years ago without full severance. 
Since then, they have demanded land as compensation and occupied part of the farm in protest, CUC representative Maria Josefa Macz said.
""Last night, the 40 families were forced to leave their homes, their belongings and residences were looted, similar to the 1980s,"" the CUC said in a statement, referring to some of the bloodiest years of Guatemala's Civil War when villages often were burned. 
It was not clear who was behind the attack. However, a little over a year ago, another group of people began to occupy the land and intimidate the former workers, the CUC said.
According to the CUC, the former workers live on land belonging to Dorothee Dieseldorff, whose family runs coffee brand Dieseldorff Kaffee. She did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
In comments reported by Guatemalan newspapers last month, Dieseldorff said about 300 people invaded her land in Alta Verapaz last March, destroying crops of rubber trees.
The UN High Commission for Human Rights has raised alarm over an increase in killing of mainly indigenous rights defenders in Guatemala. In a report last year it counted 39 such killings in 2017 and 2018 alone. 
A police report said the armed group threatened officers who attempted to enter the area on Saturday night, and noted that six homes were left ""completely burned.""
Macz said in addition to the six homes that were incinerated, another four were half-burned and nine were looted. 
A spokesman for the president's office said authorities investigating the incident.
Photos posted on Twitter by indigenous rights group Waqib' Kej show several one-story structures in flames.

Israel and the UAE announced on Thursday that they will normalise diplomatic relations, reshaping Middle East politics from the Palestinian issue to the fight against Iran.
""In the wake of this agreement will come additional agreements, both with more Gulf countries and with Muslim countries in Africa,"" Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Army Radio.
""I think that Bahrain and Oman are definitely on the agenda. In addition, in my assessment, there is a chance that already in the coming year there will be a peace deal with additional countries in Africa, chief among them, Sudan,"" he said.
Both Bahrain and Oman praised the U.S.-sponsored accord, but neither have commented on their own prospects for normalised relations or responded to requests for comment on the subject.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met with Omani and Sudanese leaders in the past two years, including a visit to Oman in October 2018. 
""I expect more countries will be joining us in the peace circle,"" Netanyahu told cabinet ministers on Sunday, according to a statement from his office. 
""This is a historic change which advances peace with the Arab world and will eventually advance a real, sober and secure peace with the Palestinians,"" he said.
The UAE-Israel deal firms up opposition to regional power Iran. The Palestinians denounced the deal as a betrayal. 
UAE and Israeli foreign ministers held their first publicly-acknowledged call on Sunday after the Gulf state opened telephone lines to Israel.
Israel signed peace agreements with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. But the UAE, along with most other Arab nations, has had no formal diplomatic or economic relations with it.
Oman maintains friendly ties with both the United States and Iran and has previously been a go-between for the two feuding countries.
A close ally of Saudi Arabia - which has not yet commented on the UAE-Israel accord - Bahrain hosted a senior Israeli official at a security conference in 2019 as well as a U.S-led conference on boosting the Palestinian economy as part U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace initiative.

MINSK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarusians chanting ""Step down!"" filled the centre of the capital Minsk on Sunday in the biggest protest so far against what they said was the fraudulent re-election a week ago of longtime president Alexander Lukashenko.
Russia said it would offer Lukashenko military help if necessary, but there was no visible police presence at the protest, which attracted around 200,000 people, a Reuters reporter estimated. At least two protesters have died and thousands have been detained in a crackdown since the vote.
The atmosphere at the rallies, which wrapped up late into the evening, was celebratory on the whole, with people carrying the red and white flags used in Belarus after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union before Lukashenko restored the Soviet version four years later.
""We all want Lukashenko to step down,"" said a 31-year-old worker who gave his name as Alexei. ""For now we are asking, but we will get sick of asking.""
Opponents of Lukashenko, in power for 26 years, say the vote was rigged to disguise the fact that he has lost public support. He denies losing, citing official results that gave him just over 80% of the vote.
The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had told Lukashenko Moscow was ready to assist Belarus in accordance with a collective military pact if necessary and that external pressure was being applied to the country. 
It did not say where from.
Russia is watching closely as Belarus hosts pipelines that carry Russian energy exports to the West and is viewed by Moscow as a buffer zone against NATO. Lukashenko and Putin have spoken twice this weekend.
Shortly before the opposition protest, there was tight security as Lukashenko's supporters gathered in central Minsk for the first time since the election to watch him give a fiery speech.
Lukashenko, who has alleged a foreign-backed plot to topple him, said NATO tanks and planes had been deployed 15 minutes from the Belarusian border. NATO said it was closely monitoring the situation in Belarus, but that there was no military build-up at the country's western border.
""NATO troops are at our gates. Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and our native Ukraine are ordering us to hold new elections,"" Lukashenko said, adding that Belarus would ""die as a state"" if new polls were held. 
""I have never betrayed you and will never do so.""
The Belarusian army will hold drills in the west of the country from Aug. 17-20, Russia's RIA news agency reported.
'JOIN US'
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's opposition rival in the contested election, fled to neighbouring Lithuania on Tuesday. She had called for the ""March of Freedom"" through Minsk and in other towns and cities on Sunday in support of an election recount and is forming a national council to facilitate a power transfer.
Maria Kolesnikova, an opposition politician who has allied with Tsikhanouskaya, referred to Lukashenko as ""the former president"", said he should quit, and appealed to state officials to abandon him.
""This is your final chance to overcome your fear,"" she said. ""We were all scared too. Join us and we will support you."" 
Thousands of people took part in anti-Lukashenko protests in other towns and cities. Crowds also gathered in Prague and Warsaw.
The Belarus Interior Ministry said there were no arrests at the rallies, although local media reported a few people had been detained.
State employees, including some police officers and state TV staff, have come out in support of the protests and some of the country's biggest state-run plants, the backbone of Lukashenko's Soviet-style economic model, have been hit by protests and walkouts.
Around 5,000 people attended an earlier pro-Lukashenko protest, a Reuters reporter estimated. The Belarusian Interior Ministry put the number at 65,000. 
'MOTHERLAND IN DANGER'
""The motherland is in danger!"" one speaker told the crowd, who chanted: ""We are united, indivisible!""
""I'm for Lukashenko,"" said Alla Georgievna, 68. ""I don't understand why everyone has risen up against him. We get our pensions and salaries on time thanks to him."" 
The first leader of independent Belarus who helped oversee the Soviet breakup told Reuters Lukashenko, a one-time manager of a Soviet-era collective farm, had been badly shaken but could still hang onto power with Kremlin backing.
Stanislav Shushkevich, 85, an old opponent of Lukashenko, dismissed the idea of Russia sending in troops to prop Lukashenko up, saying he had a large, obedient army and well paid loyalists around him.
The Czech prime minister urged his EU counterparts to help, recalling the crushing of Czech protests by a military invasion led by Moscow in 1968 as well as the peaceful overthrow of communism in 1989.
""Belarus must not experience what we had in 1968,"" Andrej Babis tweeted. ""(The) EU must be active, support Belarusians (and) not to be afraid to stage a similar velvet revolution model (as in) 1989.""

The EU is gearing up to impose new sanctions on Belarus in response to the crackdown.

Yavuz will be accompanied by three other Turkish ships according to a maritime notice that added ""all vessels are strongly advised not to enter"" the area. 
A standoff has intensified in recent weeks between Turkey and EU-member Greece over oil and gas exploration rights at sea, and even involved a minor collision between their frigates last week.

""This action runs counter and undermines efforts to resume dialogue and negotiations, and to pursue immediate de-escalation,"" he said in a statement. 
Cairo and Athens signed a territorial zoning deal earlier this month. While Paris has stepped in to criticise what it calls Turkey's provocations, Ankara says it will not back down from defending its legal rights.

President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday ""the language of sanctions and threats"" will not deter Turkey.

The nationalists burnt a rainbow flag, while the LGBT activists painted one on the street. The groups shouted abuse at each other, separated by a line of several police vans and dozens of policemen.
The nationalists' gathering was organised by a far-right movement All-Poland Youth, whose former leader, Krzysztof Bosak, won nearly 7% in the first round of a presidential election in June.
""This is a toxic ideology, dangerous, revolutionary and radical,"" Bosak said in a speech during the gathering. 
Gay rights were part of the most recent election campaign in Poland, a staunchly Catholic country, and the issue is still divisive.
President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, won re-election in July. During the campaign he had compared what he called LGBT ""ideology"" to communist doctrine, sparking criticism at home and abroad.

Since then there have been numerous protests by LGBT activists in Warsaw, including a massive one earlier this month when several thousand people demanded the release of an LGBT activist accused of hanging rainbow banners over statues and damaging an anti-abortion campaigner's van.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - More than 10,000 Thai protesters chanting ""down with dictatorship"" and ""the country belongs to the people"" rallied in Bangkok on Sunday in by far the biggest anti-government demonstration since a 2014 coup.
There were cheers for student calls to curb the monarchy's powers - once a taboo subject - as well as demands for the departure of former junta leader Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a new constitution and an end to the harrasment of opposition activists.
Students have led protests almost daily for the past month, but Sunday's demonstration drew a broader crowd in the Southeast Asian country, which has experienced decades of protests punctuated by military coups.
""We want a new election and a new parliament from the people,"" student activist Patsalawalee Tanakitwiboonpon, 24, told the crowd. “Lastly, our dream is to have a monarchy which is truly under the constitution.” 
Prayuth won elections last year that the opposition says were held under rules to ensure that he kept power. The most vocal opposition party was subsequently banned.
Anger has further been fuelled by accusations of corruption, the arrest of some student leaders over earlier protests and the economic fallout from the coronavirus epidemic.
Organisers of the Free People movement and police said there were over 10,000 people at the protest. The Chana Songkhram police station said there were not more than 12,000.
“The prime minister sends his concern to officials and protesters to avoid violence,"" Traisulee Traisoranakul, a government spokeswoman, told reporters. She said Prayuth had also ordered the cabinet to take steps to build understanding between generations.
There was no immediate comment from the Royal Palace.
MONARCHY DEMANDS
Students have presented 10 reforms they seek to the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn - including curbing his powers over the constitution, the royal fortune and the armed forces.
“Down with feudalism, long live the people,"" protesters chanted. ""We will no longer be dust for anyone.""
Thailand's lese majeste law sets a penalty of up to 15 years for criticising the monarchy, but Prayuth has said the king requested that it not be used for now. 
As the anti-government protest got underway, several dozen royalists also held a demonstration, waving national flags and holding up gold-framed portraits of the king and other royals.
""I don't care if they protest against the government but they cannot touch the monarchy,"" said Sumet Trakulwoonnoo, a leader of the royalist group, Coordination Center of Vocational Students for the Protection of National Institutions (CVPI).
Critics accuse the monarchy of helping extend the army's hold on politics in Thailand, where there have been 13 successful coups since the end of absolute royal rule in 1932.
Before the 2014 coup, Bangkok was roiled by more than a decade of often violent clashes between yellow shirt royalist protesters and rival red shirts loyal to former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. 
The new wave of protests has not been violent so far.
""I am old now and can never achieve my goal,"" said former red shirt Ueng Poontawee, 62. ""Now there are new faces. I am very happy they came out.”
Three student leaders have been charged over accusations of breaching restrictions in organising earlier protests. They have been released on bail, but police say arrest warrants have been issued for a further 12 protest leaders.
In Taipei, a few dozen people demonstrated in support of the Thai campaigners.

“This demonstration is also an act of solidarity and support for those who believe in freedom, liberty and democracy in Asia,” the demonstrators said in a statement.

It deleted the comments instead, the Congress party said.
Facebook said it prohibited hate speech and content that incited violence and enforced these policies globally without regard to anyone’s political position or party affiliation. 
""While we know there is more to do, we're making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits of our process to ensure fairness and accuracy,"" it said.
India's government did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

""Congress party demands the setting up of a joint parliamentary committee to probe the relations of Facebook and WhatsApp employees with the ruling party,"" Ajay Maken, spokesman of the Congress party said at a news briefing.
Maken also urged the company to launch an internal enquiry into its Indian oversight team.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: Thailand's anti-government protests,"By Matthew Tostevin and Panu Wongcha-um
BANGKOK (Reuters) - More than 10,000 people joined the biggest protest in Thailand since a 2014 coup on Sunday to demand that the government step down and bring in a new constitution for fresh elections.
Some protesters are also pushing for reforms to the monarchy -- until recently a taboo subject.
HOW DID THE PROTESTS START?
Anti-government protests first emerged late last year after courts banned Future Forward, the most vocal party opposing the government of former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha and one that drew strong support among Thai youths.
The protests went largely online while curbs were in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but re-emerged in mid-July. Since then, demonstrations organised by student groups have taken place almost daily.
There was strong student representation at the protest on Sunday, but there were also many older people among the crowds.
WHAT ARE THE PROTESTERS DEMANDING?
The are three key demands: For Prayuth's government to step down, for a new constitution to be drawn up and for an end to the harassment of opposition activists.
But some students have also presented 10 demands for reforms to the powerful monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
These include curbs on his constitutional powers as well as his authority over the palace fortune and armed forces. They also want an end to the monarchy's role in politics, but emphasise they are not seeking to abolish it.
Such public demands for change by any group are unprecedented in living memory.
WHAT IS DRIVING THE GRIEVANCES?
Opponents of Prayuth accuse him of maintaining the power he first seized in a 2014 coup through an election last year that was held under rules that favoured him. He disputes this.
Other factors have also emerged, including anger over accusations of government corruption and a feeling that the Thai elite acts with impunity. Meanwhile, poverty has been exacerbated by the collapse of the crucial tourist industry as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The disappearance of a Thai anti-government activist in Cambodia, the latest of nine to go missing in recent years, has fuelled disaffection.
Many young Thais also voice frustration with an establishment that emphasises obedience to authorities and tradition, with the monarchy described by the constitution as ""enthroned in a position of revered worship"".
HOW HAS THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED?
The government has said that people are allowed to show dissent and Prayuth has said he seeks dialogue with the protesters.
But three student protest leaders have already been arrested and released on bail on charges over the earlier protests, and police say there are warrants for the arrest of a further 12.
Prayuth has said the king has requested him not to use the lese majeste laws that provide for up to 15 years in prison for anyone insulting the monarchy.
WHAT OPPOSITION IS THERE TO THE PROTESTERS?
There have been a handful of pro-monarchy demonstrations to counter the anti-government protests, but even the biggest has drawn no more than a few dozen people.
Those have included former members of the strongly royalist yellow shirts, who for more than a decade before the last coup had clashed with red shirt protesters loyal to former populist prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
Some former red shirts have meanwhile appeared at the anti-government protests.
This has stirred concerns in Thailand that there could be a return to the street violence of the past, although so far the protests have been peaceful.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
Protesters have vowed to continue taking action until their demands are met.
The protests, and particularly the criticism of the monarchy, have put the government in a bind.

Political analysts have said that if it acts too harshly, it risks provoking a backlash that will further encourage support for the protests. If it does not take strong action, however, the protesters may be further emboldened to break longstanding taboos.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Two decades of Maya Husseini's work to restore stained glass windows destroyed in the Lebanese civil war was lost in an instant in the seismic port explosion in Beirut.
""I can say that in this blast, 20 years of my professional life was on the ground,"" said Husseini, 60, who has worked on historic landmarks including many of Beirut's churches. 
""Part of me has gone.""
The Aug. 4 detonation of a massive quantity of explosive chemicals stored unsafely at Beirut port killed at least 178 people, injured some 6,000 and damaged buildings across a swathe of Beirut, carpeting streets in broken glass.
Damaged buildings included the Sursock Museum, a modern and contemporary art museum reopened in 2015, whose vibrant stained glass had been painstakingly restored by Husseini.
Its windows, which were particularly eye-catching at night when they were illuminated, were blown out by the blast. 
At least 10 of the projects Husseini has worked on since the 1975-90 civil war have been destroyed. ""Every day I am getting phone calls,"" she said at her workshop on the outskirts of Beirut.
Husseini learnt her craft in France, sent by her father, a church engineer who used to order stained glass from overseas as leaded, stained glass was not common in Beirut prior to the war.
One of the projects in which she took greatest pride was the 19th century St Louis Capuchin Cathedral in the Bab Idriss district of Beirut's historic city centre, an area where she recalls going to drink lemonade with her friends as a child.
The windows of the church, which was destroyed in the war, were restored by Husseini over two years in a project completed around four years ago.
""I had tried, as much as possible, to feel the history of this church,"" she said. ""At that point I broke down, it was as if I was injured, certainly not physically, but emotionally.""
Husseini said she had been thinking about stopping work in two years but her plans had now changed.

""Even if 20 years of my work has gone - and perhaps I won't last in this work for another 20 years ... we will rebuild.""

Cross-border attacks by Iran-aligned Houthi forces have escalated since late May, when a truce prompted by the coronavirus pandemic expired. In late June, missiles reached the Saudi capital Riyadh. The coalition has retaliated with air strikes.
Al Masirah TV, run by the Iran-aligned Houthis, said on Sunday that Saudi-led coalition air strikes had damaged fuel tanks in a factory in Houthi-held territory.
On Thursday the coalition said it had intercepted and downed an armed drone and two ballistic missiles launched towards southern Saudi Arabia. 
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Saudi-led coalition intervened in March 2015 to restore the Yemeni government ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by Houthi forces. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's top Christian cleric called on Sunday for early parliamentary elections and a government formed to rescue the country rather than the ruling ""political class"" after the vast explosion in Beirut's port threw the nation into turmoil.
The now-caretaker cabinet resigned amid protests over the Aug. 4 blast that killed more than 172 people, injured 6,000, left 300,000 homeless and destroyed swathes of the Mediterranean city, compounding a deep financial crisis.
Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, who holds sway in Lebanon as head of the Maronite church from which the head of state must be drawn under sectarian power-sharing, warned that Lebanon was today facing ""its biggest danger"".
""We will not allow for Lebanon to become a compromise card between nations that want to rebuild ties amongst themselves,"" Al-Rai said in a Sunday sermon, without naming any countries.
""We must start immediately with change and quickly hold early parliamentary elections without the distraction of discussing a new election law and to form a new government.""
Several MPs submitted their resignations over the port explosion but not in the number needed to dissolve parliament.
Under the constitution, President Michel Aoun is required to designate a candidate for prime minister with the most support from parliamentary blocs. The presidency has yet to say when consultations will take place.
There has been a flurry of Western and regional diplomacy after the blast, which fuelled public anger at politicians already accused of corruption and mismanagement. A financial meltdown has ravaged the currency and froze depositors out of their savings.
Senior French and U.S. officials have linked any foreign financial aid with implementation of long-demanded reforms, including state control over the port and Lebanese borders.
Iran, seen as a major player in Lebanon through backing the powerful Shi'ite movement Hezbollah that helped form the outgoing cabinet, has said the international community should not take advantage of Lebanon's pain to exert its will.
Al-Rai said Lebanese want a government that would reverse ""national, moral and material"" corruption, enact reforms and ""rescue Lebanon, not the leadership and political class"".
EXPLOSION 'MYSTERY'
Aoun has said the investigation is looking into whether negligence, an accident or ""external interference"" caused the detonation of more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate warehoused for years without safety measures.
Aoun's influential son-in-law Gebran Bassil, who heads the largest Christian political bloc, said probing negligence should be quick as it was ""known and documented"", but that the blast itself ""is a mystery that requires deep investigation"".
Bassil, whose party is allied with Hezbollah, also said in a televised speech on Sunday that threats of further Western sanctions would ""drown Lebanon in chaos and discord"". 
His party would not ""betray or backstab a Lebanese or act with those abroad against domestic interests"", he said.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Hezbollah, which it classifies as a terrorist group. U.S. officials have said those sanctions could be extended beyond direct affiliates of the heavily armed movement to its allies. 

During a visit to Beirut after the blast, French President Emmanuel Macron raised the prospect of sanctions as a last resort to spur Lebanese action on reform.

Lam said the accusations made by Wolfson College were ""groundless"" and said she was ""deeply disappointed by the college smearing a person on the basis of hearsay instead of facts"".
""I cannot persuade myself to continue having any connection with Wolfson College and therefore decided to give back the honorary fellowship,"" Lam said in a statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Saturday.
She accused British politicians - whom she did not name - of being behind the move. 
Relations have deteriorated rapidly between Britain and China after London accused Beijing and its new security law of violating the 1984 Joint Declaration which enshrined Hong Kong's autonomy. 
Introduction of the law prompted London to offer around 3 million residents in the former colony a path to British citizenship. 
China - once courted as a prime source of investment in Britain - has accused London of gross interference and pandering to the United States.
Wolfson College said in July it was deeply concerned by events in Hong Kong and said it would consider Lam's position as an honorary fellow, a role awarded to individuals to honour outstanding contribution in a specific field. 
It said on Sunday: ""The Governing Body raised concerns with Mrs Carrie Lam about her commitment to the protection of human rights and the freedom of expression in Hong Kong following recent events there. 
""In response, Mrs Lam has resigned from her Honorary Fellowship.""

The United States has imposed sanctions on Lam and other officials for what Washington says is their role in curtailing political freedoms in Hong Kong.

With a nationwide lockdown forcing exams to be cancelled, the government used an algorithm to assess grade predictions that had been made by teachers, and lowered those grades for almost 40% of students taking their main school-leaving exam. 
The process led to thousands of students losing places at top universities. To compound the issue for the government, results shows that grades were less likely to be lowered for those students who attended fee-paying private schools.
On Saturday night the exams regulator published guidance on the appeals process, only to pull it hours later because it needed further review.
Robert Halfon, chairman of the cross-party education select committee in parliament and a lawmaker in Boris Johnson's ruling Conservative Party, described the situation as farcical. 
""It sows confusion among pupils, head teachers and school teachers and it's the last thing we need at this time,"" he told the BBC. 
Conservative lawmaker Robert Syms said the government needed to address the issue with a fair appeals process ""or risk (Conservative) Tory MPs going on warpath"".
Johnson's government has been criticised for its handling of the pandemic, with the country recording the highest death toll in Europe, the most severe economic contraction of any major economy so far and multiple occasions where it has been slow to respond to events. 
The opposition Labour Party said the incompetence was unacceptable. 
While France published the methodology for how it would award grades months in advance of results day, Britain announced changes to the process the day before they were released. The issue is likely to surface again this week when grades for 16-year-old students are released on Thursday. 

The government has said pupils would not have to pay to appeal grades and said most students will have received the correct results. Ofqual said some of the predicted grades given by teachers were ""implausibly high"".

A Japanese bulk carrier struck a coral reef off the Indian Ocean island nation on July 25, spilling about 1,000 tonnes of fuel oil and triggering a state of ""environmental emergency"".
The carrier split on Saturday, and the oil spill spread over a vast area of endangered corals, fish and other marine life in what some scientists called the country's worst ecological disaster. 
Scientists say the full impact of the spill is still unfolding, but the damage could affect Mauritius and its tourism-dependent economy for decades. Removing the ship is likely to take months.
Following a government request for assistance, India dispatched over 30 tonnes of technical equipment and material by aircraft to supplement the country's salvage operations, the foreign affairs ministry said in a statement said on Sunday. 
A 10-member team of Indian coast guard personnel trained in oil spill containment measures has also been deployed to Mauritius to provide technical and operational assistance, it said.

BEDMINSTER, N.J. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday all but dismissed Russian President Vladimir Putin's call for a summit of world leaders to discuss Iran, saying he probably would not participate.
During a news conference at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Trump also said he intended to move next week to trigger a ""snapback"" of sanctions on Iran at the United Nations.
""We'll be doing a snapback,"" Trump told reporters one day after the U.N. Security Council rejected a U.S. bid to extend a U.N. arms embargo on Iran. ""You'll be watching it next week.""
The United States has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran using a provision in a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, known as snapback, even though Trump abandoned the accord in 2018. Diplomats have said the United States would face a tough, messy battle in any such move.
The United States lost its bid on Friday to extend the U.N. arms embargo after Putin proposed a summit of world leaders to avoid ""confrontation"" over the American ""snapback"" threat.
""Probably not,"" Trump said when asked whether he would participate in the Putin-backed summit.
In the Security Council vote, Russia and China opposed extending the weapons ban, which is due to expire in October. Eleven members abstained, including France, Germany and Britain, while the United States and the Dominican Republic were the only yes votes.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday the United States suffered a humiliating defeat at the Security Council.
""I don't remember the United States preparing a resolution for months to strike a blow at the Islamic Republic of Iran, and it garners only one vote,"" Rouhani said in a televised speech. ""But the great success was that the United States was defeated in this conspiracy with humiliation.""

Biden's comments to New York Times editors resurfaced in a video that made him the most popular topic on Twitter in Turkey, where Erdogan has governed for 17 years and has good relations with U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Biden, the former U.S. vice president, says in the video he is ""very concerned"" about Erdogan's approach to Kurds in Turkey, his partial military cooperation with Russia, and access to U.S. airfields in the country, a NATO ally.
""What I think we should be doing is taking a very different approach to him now, making it clear that we support opposition leadership,"" Biden said in the video and verified by a transcript published in January by the Times. 
""He has to pay a price,"" Biden said at the time, adding Washington should embolden Turkish opposition leaders ""to be able to take on and defeat Erdogan. Not by a coup, not by a coup, but by the electoral process."" 
In response, the Turkish president's communications director Fahrettin Altun said the comments ""reflect games and an interventionist approach towards Turkey"" and are inconsistent with current diplomatic relations. 
""Nobody can attack our nation's will and democracy or question the legitimacy of our President, who was elected by popular vote,"" Altun said on Twitter, noting the failed coup in Turkey in 2016.
""We believe that these unbecoming statements which have no place in diplomacy by a presidential candidate from our NATO ally, the United States, are unacceptable to the current administration too,"" he added.
There was no immediate response from the Biden campaign.
While Trump and Erdogan speak regularly, diplomatic relations have been strained over Ankara's purchase of Russian air defences, policy in Syria and over U.S. charges against a Turkish state bank for allegedly helping Iran evade sanctions. 
Turkey's main opposition party won a handful of big city elections last year in a stinging defeat for Erdogan and his ruling AK Party, which polls show still has the most support nationwide. 

Biden made the comments on Dec. 16 2019, before he emerged as the Democratic candidate.

The Afghan government has agreed to release 400 ""hard-core"" prisoners as part of moves towards peace talks with the Taliban militants, and an official said on Friday that 80 of these convicts had been freed so far.
""France is particularly concerned by the presence, among the individuals liable to be released, of several terrorists convicted of killing French citizens in Afghanistan,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.
""It firmly opposes the liberation of individuals convicted of crimes against French nationals, in particular soldiers and humanitarian workers,"" it said.
""As a result, we have immediately asked the Afghan authorities not to proceed with the release of these terrorists.""

Disagreement over the release of the prisoners, who include individuals accused in connection with some of Afghanistan's bloodiest attacks, has already delayed peace negotiations for months as the United States withdraws troops under a deal signed with the Taliban in February.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on Saturday that international aid pledged following a massive explosion in Beirut last week that killed 178 people and made 300,000 homeless should go where it is needed.
In an interview with French news channel BFM TV, Aoun said all hypotheses remained open in the investigation into the blast at the port of Beirut that wrecked huge swathes of the capital.
""I have asked that aid sent by foreign countries be given exactly where it is needed,"" he said, adding that he had not considered resigning, after the government quit earlier in the week.
The United Nations has launched a $565 million aid appeal, whose priorities include stabilising the grain supply after the explosion destroyed a huge grain silo at the port.
Six hospitals and more than 20 clinics were damaged and more than 120 schools destroyed, the UN says.
""We would like to be able to rebuild the three hospitals that were completely destroyed,"" U.N. humanitarian coordinator Najat Rochdi said earlier.
The United States called for a transparent and credible investigation into the disaster.
The Aug. 4 blast, which authorities say was caused by more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been unsafely stored at the port for years.
""We can never go back to an era in which anything goes at the port or the borders of Lebanon that had to contribute to this situation,"" said David Hale, U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs, after visiting the port.
He said FBI agents would arrive this weekend, at the invitation of Lebanon, to help investigate what led to the explosion.
ANGER
The blast has fuelled anger at Lebanon's ruling politicians who were already facing criticism over a financial meltdown that has sunk the currency, demolished the value of savings and left depositors unable to withdraw their money.
Some Lebanese doubt the authorities can carry out a proper investigation and say foreign countries should intervene.
""We can't trust this government. They will lie to us. They should form an international committee to investigate this,"" said businessman Jimmy Iskandar.
Aoun has said a probe will look into whether the blast was caused by negligence, an accident or ""external interference"".
He said in his interview that the investigation would not be as quick as he had hoped because it was complex and would involve an independent magistrate.
Asked why he did not want an international investigation, he said foreign experts, including from France and the FBI, were helping with the Lebanese probe.
""They won't do a thing in an investigation and the whole world knows that,"" said painter Mohammed Khodr, as he helped repair a restaurant damaged in the blast. 
The heavily armed, Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which is listed as a terrorist organisation by the United States, said on Friday it would wait for results of the official Lebanese investigation into the blast.
But if it turns out to be an act of sabotage by neighbouring Israel then it would ""pay an equal price"", Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address. Israel has denied any role in the explosion.
Nasrallah said his group was against an international investigation because its first purpose would be to ""distance Israel from any responsibility for this explosion, if it had responsibility"". He said the participation of the FBI in an investigation would serve the same purpose.

The explosion has pitched Lebanon into a political vacuum since the resignation of the government, which had formed in January with backing of Hezbollah and its allies, including Aoun.

More than 21,000 people reached Italy between August 2019 and the end of July, up 148% year-on-year, the minister said, speaking at an annual Aug. 15 press conference. 
Lamorgese said the majority of the arrivals were ""autonomous landings, hard to manage... with small boats and dinghies"", rather than those rescued at sea and brought ashore. Many of them land on Italy's southern Mediterranean island of Lampedusa.
In the 12-month period, just over 5,000 people were rescued, mainly by ships operated by NGOs, according to data from the ministry.
Over 80% of the migrants reaching Italy left from Tunisia and Libya, the data showed, with Tunisia's crisis stoking the numbers attempting the treacherous crossing.
""The numbers aren't very high - they are certainly higher than last year's but we must put them into context: Tunisia is in a deep economic, social and political crisis,"" Lamorgese told reporters.
""We have seen entire families leave to reach Italian territory."" 
For years Italy has been the primary route into Europe for hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and other migrants and Libya's west coast a main departure point for African migrants hoping to reach Europe.
A peak was reached between August 2016 and July 2017, when almost 183,000 migrants reached Italy. 
Numbers started falling due to an Italian-led effort to disrupt smuggling networks and support the Libyan coastguard to intercept boats, but have picked up in 2020.
Lamorgese's predecessor, head of the anti-immigrant League party Matteo Salvini, took a hardline against charity ships that rescued migrants at sea, closing Italian ports and accusing the rescue groups of de facto collaboration with human traffickers.

Lamorgese said that she would meet Tunisian President Kais Saied on Monday to discuss the issue, along with Italy's Foreign Minister Luigi di Maio and EU Commissioners Ylva Johansson and Olivér Várhelyi.

Human Rights team probes spike in tension in Chile`s restive Araucania,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Office of the United Nations' High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed on Saturday that it had sent a fact-finding team to Chile's restive Araucania region where a jailed indigenous Mapuche leader has spent more than 100 days on hunger strike over his detention during the coronavirus pandemic.
The OHCHR said in a communique that its team had visited the hospital in the regional capital Temuco where Celestino Cordova was being treated as well as prisons where at least 20 other Mapuche convicts are on hunger strike. 
It said it had met police, prosecutors and business representatives, and indigenous leaders who laid allegations of forced evictions from council property, excessive or unnecessary use of force by the authorities and racial discrimination. 
The Mapuche are famous for their fierce resistance to the Spanish conquest of Chile and have for decades been fighting for what they deem their ancestral land against landowners and the wood pulp industry.
Cordova was jailed for 18 years in 2014 for his participation in the killing of an elderly landowning couple in an arson attack.
His case has raised tensions in Chile already heightened by several months of social protests over inequality, and deepening economic hardships because of COVID. 
It has sparked protests and arson attacks in southern Araucania and elsewhere in the country. In Santiago's Plaza Italia on Friday night police broke up with water cannons and made several arrests. 
Cordova has been on hunger strike for 104 days over the courts' rejection of his appeal to be transferred to house arrest because of the pandemic. 
In July, after his health deteriorated, Temuco's appeals court ordered a hospital to intervene including against his will. 
On Friday, the government told Cordova he could return home to conduct an important Mapuche blessing ceremony of a totem carved into a tree if he ceased his hunger strike.
""Both the government and various national and international organizations have made every effort to bring positions closer,” the justice ministry said in a statement.
In an audio message circulated on social media purportedly recorded by Cordova, he said he would start a liquids strike, and accused President Sebastian Pinera of lacking the ""wisdom"" to resolve the conflict.

""Because he is not up to the task, he will finally kill me,"" he allegedly said.

European Union foreign ministers on Friday said Ankara's actions were antagonistic and dangerous after a meeting requested by Athens. 
Tensions between NATO members Greece and Turkey have risen in the past week after Turkey sent the Oruc Reis survey vessel, escorted by warships, to map out possible oil and gas drilling in territory over which both countries claim jurisdiction.
""We will never bow to banditry on our continental shelf. We will not back down against the language of sanctions and threats,"" Erdogan said in the northeastern city of Rize. 
The Oruc Reis, which is between Cyprus and the Greek island of Crete, will continue work until Aug. 23, he added. The vessel has been shadowed by Greek frigates and on Wednesday warships from the two sides were involved in a mild collision.
EU foreign ministers met via video conference on Friday and said Turkey's naval movements would lead to a ""heightened risk of dangerous incidents"".
They said a deterioration in the relationship with Turkey was having far-reaching strategic consequences for the entire European Union, well beyond the eastern Mediterranean.

Relations between Greece and Turkey have long been fraught with tension. Disputes have ranged from boundaries of offshore continental shelves and airspace to the ethnically split island of Cyprus. In 1996 they almost went to war over ownership of uninhabited islets in the Aegean Sea.

Speaking in Warsaw, his last stop on a tour of central Europe, Pompeo said Washington was tracking the situation in Belarus and the aim of the contacts with the EU was to ""try to help as best we can the Belarusian people achieve sovereignty and freedom"".
Security forces have clashed with protesters in Minsk and other cities in recent days after President Alexander Lukashenko claimed a landslide re-election victory in a vote on Sunday that his opponents say was rigged.
The EU on Friday took the first step towards imposing new sanctions on Belarus, instructing its foreign policy arm to prepare a blacklist of responsible individuals.
Speaking at a news conference with Pompeo, Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz said potential sanctions on Belarus should only apply to top officials.
Pompeo also met Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and discussed defence cooperation, the COVID-19 pandemic, securing 5G networks and a new bilateral agreement on developing Poland's civil nuclear power program.
Washington and Warsaw signed a defence pact, agreed last month, which sees the number of U.S. troops in Poland rise to at least 5,500. It will cost Poland around 500 million zlotys ($135 million) per year. 
The deal also involves training Polish forces in reconnaissance and command, with the possibility of more U.S. troops coming to Poland in case of an increased threat.
Poland would be able to quickly increase the number of U.S. troops to 20,000 if needed.

Czaputowicz said the presence of American troops is key for Poland's deterrence and defence potential as Poland is ""closer to the potential source of conflict"", a reference to the proximity to Russia and its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

Cawley, a Ryanair director who also served as finance chief and deputy CEO at the airline, faced calls from opposition parties to quit after he confirmed to the Irish Independent newspaper on Saturday that he was holidaying in Italy.
Cawley is the first senior official in Ireland to resign for flouting coronavirus guidance. Scotland's chief medical officer resigned in April after she ignored her own advice to stay at home during its COVID-19 lockdown.
Italy is one of 10 countries on the government's green list, meaning anyone arriving in Ireland can avoid a 14-day quarantine requirement that applies to travellers from anywhere else.
However official travel advice since Ireland's coronavirus outbreak began in February has remained that non-essential travel abroad should be avoided and people have been encouraged to holiday at home to support the hard-hit tourism sector. 
Failte Ireland, the tourism development authority, has been giving extra funding to promote domestic tourism.
Cawley said in a statement that he decided to step down because he did not wish to allow the issue to distract from Failte Ireland's work in rebuilding the Irish tourism industry.

Tourism Minister Catherine Martin said she was disappointed to learn that Cawley was holidaying in Italy and believed his position was untenable.

""I know how much the Germans love Spain ... But unfortunately the infection rates there are rising sharply, too sharply,"" Jens Spahn told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
""Whoever goes to Spain despite the warning should protect themselves and others while on holiday. Party holidays are irresponsible in this pandemic.""
People returning to Germany from designated risk regions face a coronavirus test or two weeks' compulsory quarantine.
Spahn's comments came as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany rose by 1,415 to 222,828, the biggest increase since late April, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday.
Infections in Spain have also spiked in recent days after it ended a tough lockdown seven weeks ago. The German move deals a new blow to hopes for a swift revival of mass tourism after months of lockdown all but wiped out this year's high season.
There are currently around 30,000 Germans on holiday with tour operators in Spain's Balearic islands, the vast majority in Mallorca, plus more independent travellers, the German travel association said.

Oli called Modi on the occasion of India's Independence Day and congratulated him for the country's recent election as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, India's external affairs ministry said in a statement.
On the call, Modi ""recalled the civilizational and cultural links that India and Nepal share,"" the ministry added.

LUBBOCK, Texas (Reuters) - Brandon Vergel stood outside his new student dormitory at Texas Tech University, grappling with the bittersweet nature of yet another American rite of passage warped by the COVID pandemic -parents dropping their kids off at college.
Under a scorching afternoon sun, Vergel lugged his earthly belongings into the Hulen Hall residence he would now call home, nervously excited at the freedom of college life that awaited, but confronting an age-old conundrum: a mom that doesn't want to let go. 
""My parents are being a little overbearing,"" Vergel said in a hushed voice as his father, Arturo, unloaded items from his black pick-up truck, and his mom, Nancy, stood nearby. ""They don't think we can protect ourselves in a pandemic. But we do know how to take care of ourselves and we would like to start. Like, now."" 
How to safely and productively conduct courses is a challenge that university administrators, parents and students are trying to wrap their heads around. 
Nearly a quarter of American universities will have classes either fully or primarily in person this fall, according to data collected by the College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College, which tracks how colleges are changing amid the pandemic.
But another quarter of universities have not yet determined what they will do, while 32% are either primarily or fully online, 15% will have a hybrid of in-person and online course work, and the rest planning some alternative form of instruction. 
At Texas Tech, the course work will be primarily in person, as it will be at most universities in the state. Some freshmen students will be living in dorms - they are required to live on campus their first year - but have a majority of their classes conducted online. 
'BREAKING RULES'
Under a scorching afternoon sun outside the Texas Tech residence halls, students wore carefully chosen outfits, hoping to casually make fantastic first impressions on Friday. 
They lugged suitcases stuffed with clothes, mini refrigerators and new televisions into the sand-colored brick buildings, all the while huffing under their face masks in the 104-degree heat.
In an effort to discourage crowding, families could only arrive at the Texas Tech dorms during pre-scheduled time slots and were given 90 minutes to move in. There was ample space in the parking lots that in a normal year would be scenes of joyous chaos, with hordes of students arriving all at once. 
Everyone was asked to wear face masks both inside and outside the buildings, despite few other people around. Students said the masks were making communication more difficult - and chilling their ability to break the ice with their new neighbors. 
Inside the residence halls it was eerily quiet. A handful of families checked in with residence hall student assistants, got room assignments, and then silently hauled belongings into rooms. 
The same scene is playing out at universities across the United States this weekend, as teenagers' dreams of freedom are slamming up against the realities of college in the time of a pandemic. 
Hopes that many hold out for wild keg parties have been dampened by being the first students in a century - going back to the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918 - to have been ordered to wear masks and stand apart. 
Those safety precautions will be tested in places like Lubbock, a dusty west Texas town where generations of students have maintained a reputation for being the Lone Star state's hardest partying school. 
""This is so weird because I cannot see anyone's face. I cannot meet them properly,"" said Kaitlyn Abercia, 18, from Cypress, Texas, as she moved into Gates Hall at Texas Tech. ""I hope I can make a lot of friends."" 
Kaitlyn's mom, Denise, right then glanced at her daughter sideways and let out a chortle. 

""Come on, you guys will be having parties tonight,"" she said. ""I suspect plenty of students will be breaking rules.""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang (KMT), which traditionally favours close ties with China, was routed in a key mayoral by-election on Saturday, a vote overshadowed by turmoil in Hong Kong and tensions with Beijing.
The KMT, under its youthful new leader, Johnny Chiang, has been trying to reinvent itself since being trounced by the Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) in January's presidential and parliamentary elections.
The by-election in the southern city of Kaohsiung was called after its KMT mayor, Han Kuo-yu, was removed from office by a massive margin in a recall vote in June, his opponents charging he had little interest in the city.
The DPP's Chen Chi-mai, a former vice premier, won 70% of the votes, thrashing KMT candidate Jane Lee, though only about half of electors turned out.
""The election result proves one thing - a victory for democracy,"" Chen told cheering supporters.
Lee, wearing a pink t-shirt with the words ""keep going"" on it, offered her congratulations.
""I know I did not work hard enough,"" she said in her concession speech.
While the campaign focused on domestic issues like Kaohsiung's heavy debt load, China grabbed the domestic spotlight in the run-up, with the arrest in Hong Kong of media tycoon Jimmy Lai and Chinese military drills near Taiwan.
China claims democratic Taiwan as its ""sacred"" territory to be taken by force if necessary, and has repeatedly denounced Taiwanese leaders for supporting anti-Beijing protesters in Hong Kong, a former British colony returned to China in 1997 with promises of a high degree of autonomy that many fear is now being eroded.
Chen had cast the election as a way of showing support for Hong Kong and the value of democracy, while President Tsai Ing-wen told a rally in Kaohsiung on Friday evening that China's military threats were Beijing's way of trying to influence the vote.
The KMT, for its part, complained this week that Tsai's offers of help to Hong Kong's people were all talk and no action.
Lee's campaign was not helped after she became embroiled in a plagiarism scandal a few weeks before the vote, accused of copying much of her master's thesis. She tearfully told reporters last month she was going to give up her degree.
Kaohsiung, at the centre of Taiwan's struggle for democracy in the 1970s and 1980s and home to an important port, is normally firm DPP territory, and the party was taken aback when Han unexpectedly won in 2018.

Han was also the KMT's defeated presidential candidate.

The UAE-Israel agreement announced on Thursday, which U.S. President Donald Trump helped to broker, is seen as aimed at bolstering opposition to regional power Iran.
In his televised speech, Rouhani warned the UAE against allowing Israel a “foothold in the region”.
“They (the UAE) better be mindful. They have committed a huge mistake, a treacherous act. We hope they will realise this and abandon this wrong path,” Rouhani said without elaborating.
He said the deal seemed aimed at ensuring that Trump wins another term in the U.S. presidential election in November and referred to the fact it was announced in Washington.
“Why then did it happen now? If it weren’t a wrong deal, why was it then announced in a third country, in America? So a gentleman in Washington wins votes, you betray your country, your people, Muslims and the Arab world?”
He added that the Emirates may also have thought that they could guarantee security by getting close to Iran’s enemies, but Iran had ""historically been the protector of its neighbours and ensurer of the security of the Persian Gulf.”

Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps said in a statement on Saturday the UAE-Israel deal, would “accelerate the process of the destruction of the child-killing Zionist regime.”

Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak, 22, was arrested on Friday and charged with breaching internal security rules and breaking regulations to stop the spread of coronavirus among other charges, by co-organising a protest on July 18.
Since that protest in July, university and high school student groups around Thailand have rallied almost daily, demanding for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who first took power in a 2014 military coup, and an end to the military domination of politics.
Some students have also demanded reforms to the powerful monarchy, once a taboo subject.
Parit told reporters at the court that he had been ordered not to re-offend as a condition of his bail, but that the director-general of the court had agreed that he could take part in a major protest planned for Sunday.
""My arrest must not be wasted, people must talk more publicly about the monarchy,"" Parit said after reciting a 10-point call for monarchy reform issued earlier this week by one of the student group.
""We have lifted the ceiling, there is no lowering it now.""
The monarchy is protected by a strict lese majeste law that punishes anyone who offends King Maha Vajiralongkorn or his family, but Prime Minister Prayuth said earlier this year that the king had asked for it not be used.
Prayuth appealed for national unity earlier this week but also said some of the student activist demands on the monarchy ""went too far."" 
Last week two other activists were arrested and later released on similar charges to Parit, and Human Rights Watch said the criminal court has issued arrest warrants for 12 others for organising the July 18 protest.

For the second day in a row in over four months, the country has reported a sudden jump in locally transmitted cases, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.
The KCDC reported 166 new cases as of Friday, of which 155 were domestic, prompting authorities to re-introduce anti-virus measures as they worried about the spectre of a fresh wave of the disease.
The tougher rules come as thousands staged demonstrations in downtown Seoul, despite a ban on rallies in the capital city, with some conservative groups protesting against President Moon's recent real estate market policy and a series of sex scandals involving leaders of his administration.
The protests, with some carrying placards reading ""Expel Moon Jae-in"", coincided with the National Liberation Day from Japan’s 1910-1945 colonisation of the peninsula.
South Korea used invasive tracing and widespread testing to contain its first outbreak of the novel coronavirus, but Asia’s fourth-largest economy has experienced persistent outbreaks in recent weeks, mostly in the densely populated capital area.
The new cases took South Korea’s tally to 15,039 with 305 deaths by Friday midnight. The recent spike in infections are emerging in multiple clusters, including church gatherings and restaurants.
Over 100 infections were linked to members of a Seoul church alone and those who came into contact with the churchgoers. The authorities are testing 4,000 members of the church, Health Minister Park Neung-hoo told a briefing.
The authorities decided to upgrade the social distancing guidelines to second stage for Seoul and nearby Gyeonggi province, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a meeting on Saturday.
""We are facing a desperately dangerous situation that could lead to another wave of epidemics if we cannot overcome this crisis,"" said Chung.
Health authorities had categorized social distancing rules in three stages - stage 1 being the least intense and stage 3 the toughest, where schools and businesses are urged to close. 

Second stage limits indoor gatherings to below 50 and outdoor gatherings to below 100, and bans spectators in sports matches, disappointing fans who had just gone back into baseball and soccer stadiums after a five-week delay to the season.

Residents of Khabarovsk, around 6,110 km (3,800 miles) east of Moscow, were protesting for a sixth consecutive weekend against the detention of Sergei Furgal, the region's popular governor.
Furgal was arrested on July 9 in connection with murder charges he denies. His supporters say the detention is politically motivated.

People marched on Saturday with posters reading ""Our choice"" and ""Freedom to Furgal"". Regional authorities estimated around 2,000 people took part, a smaller turnout than previous weeks.

KABUL (Reuters) - A prominent women's rights advocate and member of the Afghan team tasked with negotiating with the Taliban sustained minor injuries in an attack in Kabul by unknown gunmen, officials said on Saturday. 
They described the attack on Fawzia Koofi, a former lawmaker, as an assassination attempt. It was condemned by Afghanistan's president as well as senior politicians involved in the peace process.
""I strongly condemn the assassination attempt on Ms Fawzia Koofi and call upon the government to identify and apprehend the culprits and possible motive for the attack,"" Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said on Twitter.
A spokesman for the insurgent Taliban denied any involvement. 
Koofi could not immediately be reached for comment, but a post on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page said her right arm was injured but, ""Thankfully not a life-threatening injury!""
A government-mandated team is set to start long-awaited peace negotiations with the Taliban in Qatar's capital Doha in coming days once a prisoner release process is complete. 
The United States has been attempting to broker peace talks to end more than 18 years of war after signing a troop withdrawal deal with the militant group in February. 
Many have concerns about the protection of women's rights throughout the process. During their 1996-2001 rule, the Taliban banned women from education or leaving the house without a male relative. 
Koofi is a staunch advocate of women's and girls' rights, starting her public career in 2001 shortly after the ouster of the Taliban by campaigning for girls' education.
Human rights officials have raised concerns in recent months about senior civil society members being targeted in attacks. 
Shaharzad Akbar, head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, said there is a ""worrying pattern of targeted attacks that can negatively impact confidence in peace process.""

A new vote should be held transparently with the participation of international observers, the leaders said in a statement after meeting in Estonia.
Lukashenko's claimed landslide re-election victory last Sunday has been branded a fraud by protesters, and the European Union took the first step on Friday towards imposing new sanctions on Belarus over it.
Opposition presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled to neighbouring Lithuania early on Tuesday, has called for more protests and an election recount.
Friday marked a sixth consecutive day of street demonstrations against Lukashenko.
Facing the biggest challenge to his authority during his 26 years in power, he has warned people to stay at home to avoid becoming ""cannon fodder"" for what he has labelled foreign-backed revolutionaries.

TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking on the 75th anniversary of Japan's World War Two surrender, pledged never to repeat the tragedy of war and Emperor Naruhito expressed ""deep remorse"" over the wartime past, which still haunts East Asia.
""Never to repeat the tragedy of war. We will continue to remain committed to this resolute pledge,"" said Abe, wearing a face mask at an official ceremony for war dead on Saturday that was scaled back because of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Abe, who did not echo Naruhito's reference to remorse, sent a ritual offering to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine for war dead. But he avoided a personal visit that would anger China and South Korea.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a speech Seoul was always ready to discuss history disputes with Tokyo.
At least four Japanese cabinet ministers paid their respects in person at Yasukuni, which honours 14 Japanese wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal, as well as Japan's war dead. The shrine is seen by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japan's past military aggression. 
Shuichi Takatori, a member of Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters he made the offering on behalf of Abe as party leader, delivering a message that Abe ""paid his respects from the heart to the war dead and prayed for the rest and permanent peace of their souls.""
Abe has not gone to Yasukuni in person since a December 2013 visit that outraged China and South Korea, but has sent offerings. 
Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, 39, often floated as a future premier, was among the ministers who visited the shrine on the emotive anniversary.
South Korea's foreign ministry spokesman expressed ""deep disappointment and concern"" over the ministers' visit and said Japan's leaders must show their ""deep remorse through action"". 
Thousands of men and women braved scorching heat amid the COVID-19 pandemic to pay their respects at Yasukuni, where queues quickly became congested, despite markers and signs seeking to maintain social distance. Many people stood in long queues for hours, holding parasols to block the sun in heat over 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit).
""I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never again be repeated,"" Naruhito, 60, said at the official ceremony after bowing together with Empress Masako before an altar in front of a bank of flowers. Both royals also wore face masks.
The grandson of Emperor Hirohito in whose name Imperial troops fought the war, Naruhito is Japan's first monarch born after the war. He ascended the throne last year after his father, Akihito, abdicated.
The United States and Japan have become staunch security allies in the decades since the war's end but its legacy still haunts East Asia.
Koreans, who mark the date as National Liberation Day, resent Japan's 1910-1945 colonisation of the peninsula. 
China has bitter memories of imperial troops' invasion and occupation of parts of the country from 1931 to 1945.
""We must learn from history, let history be a warning for the future, and show that we are prepared to fight in the event of a war"", said a commentary by the official newspaper of China’s military, the People’s Liberation Army.
Japan's ties with South Korea especially are strained by a dispute over compensation for Koreans forced to work in Japan's wartime mines and factories.
""The door for negotiation is still widely open,"" Moon said in a speech in Seoul. 
Relations are also strained over ""comfort women"", as women, many Korean, made to work in Japanese military brothels are euphemistically known.
Consensus over the war remains elusive within Japan, where more than 80% of people were born after the conflict's end.
Abe has said future generations should not have to keep apologising for mistakes of the past.
One visitor to Yasukuni, Nobuko Watanabe, 51, said she understood why Koreans would resent visits there but added ties could improve. ""When people talk to each other one-on-one ... we are able to communicate and open our hearts to each other.""

Fewer than 600 people, including relatives of war dead, took part in Saturday's state-sponsored ceremony, down from more than 6,000 last year. Seats were spaced out and a musical performance replaced the singing of the national anthem.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is set to decide by Monday whether a general election will go ahead on Sept. 19, with most analysts expecting her to resist opposition calls for a delay due to a flare up in coronavirus infections.
A country of five million people, a long way from anywhere, New Zealand has fared far better than most countries during the pandemic, but a spate of new infections forced Ardern earlier this week to lockdown Auckland, the largest city.
Seven new cases were reported on Saturday.
Having kept New Zealand clear of infections for 102 days straight before the flare-up, Ardern has won praise for her decisive response to the pandemic, and opinion polls have shown her Labour Party in a winning position.
Pollsters have been unable to survey voters since the latest outbreak, but analysts expected Ardern to decide to go ahead with the election next month.
The opposition National Party would like it delayed, they said, in the hope that Ardern loses some of her lustre once hardships caused by the lockdown begin to bite.
""She is a savvy politician,"" said Grant Duncan, professor of politics at Massey University. ""It pays for the government to have an election sooner rather than later, while the opposition wants it delayed.""
Forced to cancel campaign events due to restrictions on movement and crowds due to the health scare, the opposition has accused Ardern of using the pandemic to shore up support as she appears on television nearly everyday to reassure New Zealanders, while their own leaders struggle to draw audiences.
Parliament is due to be dissolved on Monday, and Ardern told reporters on Friday that she would have decided by then, while giving assurances that the election commission had already planned for the vote - which must be held by Nov. 21 - to be conducted safely.
Pollster and blogger David Farrar said in a post on Kiwiblog that with Auckland still in lockdown for another 12 days, an election in September would be ""madness"", predicting a near record low turnout if it went ahead.

The United States has long opposed China's expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea and has sent warships regularly through the strategic waterway.
China has objected to such exercises and said the U.S. rejection of its claims in the South China Sea has raised tension and undermined stability in the region.

China claims nine tenths of the resource-rich South China Sea, through which some $3 trillion of trade passes a year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have competing claims.

(Reuters) - Evidence used by the United States to justify the extradition of Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou is ""unreliable and defective"" and should not be considered by a Canadian court, Meng's lawyers argued in documents released to the media on Friday.
Meng, 48, was arrested in December 2018 on a warrant from the United States which alleges that she misled the bank HSBC (L:HSBA) about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.
She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition while on house arrest in Vancouver.
Meng's lawyers submitted testimony from expert witnesses including John Bellinger, a former White House lawyer, as well as a Huawei Technologies Co Ltd presentation outlining its relationship with businesses operating in Iran, to back Huawei's argument that the United States left out key facts about communication with HSBC about Huawei's operations in Iran when requesting Meng's extradition from Canada.
The submissions show that the evidence used by the United States as part of their case is ""manifestly unreliable – so unreliable and defective – to justify refusing to commit (Meng) for extradition,"" lawyers for Huawei wrote.
The issue is scheduled to be argued in a British Columbia courtroom in September as part of Meng's extradition hearing. The entire extradition hearing is expected to run till April 2021.
On Monday, Meng will attend hearings in a Canadian courtroom via telephone, arguing for the Canadian attorney general to release more confidential documents relating to her arrest to show that her rights were abused. The Canadian attorney general has held back some of the documents related to her arrest claiming privilege. 

Meng's legal team argue that her extradition proceedings should be stayed as a result of the abuses.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - With internet rumors of a looming conflict between an anti-government militia, white supremacist rally-goers and counter-protesters, Georgia state officials said Stone Mountain Park, famed for its huge rock carving of Confederate leaders, will be closed to the public on Saturday.
The Three Percenters militia had applied last month to hold a more than 2,000-strong rally ""to defend and protect our history and second Amendment rights"" on Aug. 15 at the park northeast of Atlanta. The application was denied by state officials, who cited violence at a similar event in 2016. 
But several online groups, including one dubbed ""Defending Stone Mountain,"" vowed to march in the park anyway and asked participants to come with Confederate and U.S. flags. Another group, the Atlanta Antifacists, vowed to hold a counter-protest. 
Park officials were not immediately available for comment late on Friday, but said in a short statement that the park will be closed on Saturday, due to security concerns. 
The city of Stone Mountain, home to about 6,000 residents, also issued a statement asking the public to avoid the area.
Stone Mountain Park, which draws more than 4 million visitors a year to its sprawling 3,200 acres of woods and trails and amusements, is home to the largest monument to America's Civil War Confederacy.
Park authorities have faced renewed calls for the removal of its nine-story-high bas-relief sculpture of Confederate leaders since the May 25 death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police.

Floyd's killing helped revive a long-simmering conflict between groups seeking to abolish Confederate statues and sculptures, which they see as pro-slavery symbols, and those who believe they honor the traditions and history of the South.

The Supreme Court placed Uribe, perhaps the South American country's most divisive politician, under detention in a unanimous decision last week that cited potential for obstruction of justice. He says he is innocent.
Pence said on Twitter he had spoken to current Colombian President Ivan Duque, an Uribe protege, on Friday.
""We respect Colombia's institutions and independence,"" Pence said. ""But, as Former President Alvaro Uribe is under house arrest, we join all freedom loving voices around the world in calling on Colombian officials to let this Hero, who is a recipient of the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, defend himself as a free man.""
Uribe, who now serves as a senator, is being investigated over allegations that his surrogates tried to convince jailed former paramilitaries to lie about their interactions with a left-wing senator.
Duque and other Uribe allies have said his house arrest is unfair, comparing it to former rebel leaders who have been allowed to remain free while their war crimes proceedings move ahead. The guerrillas received special terms under a peace deal reviled by Uribe.
Duque has vociferously defended his mentor, while opponents hailed the Supreme Court's decision as a long-awaited victory for judicial independence.
Uribe's detention is the first time ever a Colombian court has detained a former president.

(Reuters) - Firefighters scrambled to protect thousands of homes from a wildfire racing through brush-covered mountains north of Los Angeles on Friday that caused hundreds of evacuations and burned a handful of structures.
The blaze, dubbed the Lake Fire, has scorched over 11,000 acres (4,451 hectares) and forced 250 people from their houses since erupting on Wednesday afternoon in the Angeles National Forest. 
Triple digit temperatures and single digit humidity fanned the flames, and little let-up is expected over the weekend with an excessive heat warning in effect across Southern California.
""Fire behavior is picking up,"" said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Andrew Mitchell. 
The cause of the blaze was under investigation but human activity is likely to blame, Mitchell said.
No casualties were reported but the blaze prompted the mandatory evacuation of around 100 homes in communities about 40 miles (65 km) north of downtown Los Angeles, with a further 5,000 homes threatened. The blaze was at 12% containment, said Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Jake Miller.
The fire destroyed five homes and other structures, according to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection data. 
Much of the area has not had a fire in 60-100 years, allowing flames to move swiftly through fuel-choked canyons, Miller said.
Across the United States, fires have been less ferocious so far in 2020, burning around 1.4 million fewer acres than in the same period of 2019. Conditions are expected to worsen in California next month when Santa Ana winds arrive in the south and El Diablo winds pick up in the North.

In drought-stricken Colorado, the Pine Gulch Fire, burning near Grand Junction, about 190 miles west of Denver, has blackened over 73,000 acres in remote mountain terrain, making it the fourth-largest in the state's history.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - A regional bloc comprised mostly of Latin American nations said on Friday it rejects plans by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to hold legislative elections without participation by all political parties.
""We express our firm rejection of the illegitimate regime's announcement of the celebration of parliamentary elections without the minimum guarantees and without the participation of all political forces,"" said the declaration co-signed by Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay and Peru. 
The Lima Group, which includes countries from across Latin America and the Caribbean as well as Canada, has long called for a transition government and free elections in Venezuela. 
The group - together with the United States and European nations - accuses Maduro of manipulating Venezuela's 2018 presidential contest and refuses to recognize the results. Maduro, in power since 2013 in the OPEC member nation, says he won reelection fairly.
Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido is recognized by dozens of countries as the legitimate leader of his country. His administration also signed on to the statement.
Colombian President Ivan Duque said earlier on Friday the December contest for the national assembly are a bid by Maduro to seize control of the body, the last bastion of opposition power.
""We cannot support, validate, applaud or recognize this process, which we already know is a fraudulent process meant to continue to silence independent voices,"" said Duque, who opened the group's virtual meeting.
Argentina confirmed its deputy foreign minister participated in the meeting, but said it did not agree with the position of some Venezuelan political parties who have said they will boycott the elections, saying every citizen needed representation in ""free, fair and impartial"" polls.
In another statement, European Union countries, the United States and some group members said relief from sanctions could be provided if there was progress towards a transitional government and free elections. 

Britain on Friday called on Venezuela to establish a transitional government and swiftly hold free presidential elections, due to the impact of COVID-19.

(Reuters) - Greenland's ice sheet may have shrunk past the point of return, with the ice likely to melt away no matter how quickly the world reduces climate-warming emissions, new research suggests. 
Scientists studied data on 234 glaciers across the Arctic territory spanning 34 years through 2018 and found that annual snowfall was no longer enough to replenish glaciers of the snow and ice being lost to summertime melting.
That melting is already causing global seas to rise about a millimeter on average per year. If all of Greenland's ice goes, the water released would push sea levels up by an average of 6 meters -- enough to swamp many coastal cities around the world. This process, however, would take decades. 
""Greenland is going to be the canary in the coal mine, and the canary is already pretty much dead at this point,"" said glaciologist Ian Howat at Ohio State University. He and his colleagues published the study Thursday in the Nature Communications Earth & Environment journal.
The Arctic has been warming at least twice as fast as the rest of the world for the last 30 years, an observation referred to as Arctic amplification. The polar sea ice hit its lowest extent for July in 40 years. 
The Arctic thaw has brought more water to the region, opening up routes for shipping traffic, as well as increased interest in extracting fossil fuels and other natural resources. 
Greenland is strategically important for the U.S. military and its ballistic missile early warning system, as the shortest route from Europe to North America goes via the Arctic island.
Last year, President Donald Trump offered to buy Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. But Denmark, a U.S. ally, rebuffed the offer. Then last month, the U.S. reopened a consulate in the territory's capital of Nuuk, and Denmark reportedly said last week it was appointing an intermediary between Nuuk and Copenhagen some 3,500 kilometers away.
Scientists, however, have long worried about Greenland's fate, given the amount of water locked into the ice. 
The new study suggests the territory's ice sheet will now gain mass only once every 100 years -- a grim indicator of how difficult it is to re-grow glaciers once they hemorrhage ice. 
In studying satellite images of the glaciers, the researchers noted that the glaciers had a 50% chance of regaining mass before 2000, with the odds declining since. 
""We are still draining more ice now than what was gained through snow accumulation in 'good' years,"" said lead author Michalea King, a glaciologist at Ohio State University. 
The sobering findings should spur governments to prepare for sea-level rise, King said. 
""Things that happen in the polar regions don't stay in the polar region,"" she said.
Still, the world can still bring down emissions to slow climate change, scientists said. Even if Greenland can't regain the icy bulk that covered its 2 million square kilometers, containing the global temperature rise can slow the rate of ice loss. 

""When we think about climate action, we're not talking about building back the Greenland ice sheet,"" said Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center who was not involved in the study. ""We're talking about how quickly rapid sea-level rise comes to our communities, our infrastructure, our homes, our military bases.""

776,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 07:00PM ET</span>",What is the U.S. threat to trigger 'snapback' of U.N. sanctions on Iran?,"By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States on Friday failed in its attempt to extend a U.N. arms embargo on Iran, and Washington could now act on a threat to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Tehran.
Here is a look at the events leading to the showdown and an explanation of what could happen next. 
WHY IS THE ARMS EMBARGO ON IRAN EXPIRING? 
The United Nations Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Iran in 2007. 
The embargo is due to expire in mid-October, as agreed to under the 2015 nuclear deal among Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States that prevents Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in return for economic sanctions relief. That accord is enshrined in a 2015 Security Council resolution. 
In 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump quit the accord reached under his predecessor Barack Obama, calling it ""the worst deal ever."" 
The United States failed on Friday in a bid to extend the arms embargo on Iran at the U.N. Security Council.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE 2015 NUCLEAR DEAL? 
Even though the United States has withdrawn from the nuclear deal, Washington has threatened to use a provision in the agreement to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran if the Security Council does not extend the arms embargo.
While diplomats have predicted that the so-called sanctions snapback process at the Security Council would be messy - with the remaining parties to the nuclear deal opposed to such a move - it could ultimately kill the nuclear deal because Iran would lose a major incentive for limiting its nuclear activities. 
After the United States quit the deal, it imposed strong unilateral sanctions. In response, Iran has breached parts of the nuclear deal.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Tuesday described the next few weeks and months as critical.
WHAT SANCTIONS WOULD SNAP BACK? 
A snapback of U.N. sanctions would require Iran to suspend all nuclear enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development, and ban imports of anything that could contribute to those activities or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems. 
It would reimpose the arms embargo, ban Iran from developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and reimpose targeted sanctions on dozens of individuals and entities. Countries also would be urged to inspect shipments to and from Iran and authorized to seize any banned cargo.
HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES TRIGGER A SANCTIONS SNAPBACK? 
The United States would have to submit a complaint about Iran breaching the nuclear deal to the Security Council.
The council would then have to vote within 30 days on a resolution to continue Iran's sanctions relief. If such a resolution is not put forward by the deadline, all U.N. sanctions in place before the 2015 nuclear deal would be automatically reimposed.
Some diplomats have said the United States could submit its complaint as early as next week.
CAN THE U.S. EFFORT BE STOPPED? 
It was not immediately clear how Russia, China or any other Security Council members might try to stop the United States from triggering a sanctions snapback or if procedurally there is any way they can.

Diplomats have said several countries are likely to argue that the United States legally could not activate a return of U.N. sanctions and therefore they simply would not reimpose the measures on Iran themselves.

780,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>","Israel-UAE deal could open up U.S. weapons sales to Gulf kingdom, experts say","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates could pave the way for more U.S. weapons sales to the Gulf Arab country, according to experts.
Israel and the UAE announced on Thursday that they will normalize diplomatic ties and forge a broad new relationship under an accord that U.S. President Donald Trump helped broker. 
The agreement makes the UAE only the third Arab state after Egypt and Jordan to make such a deal with Israel, which has enjoyed special access to U.S. weapons sales.
In a National Public Radio interview on Friday, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said that ""the more the Emirates become a friend of Israel, become a partner of Israel, become a regional ally of the United States, I think obviously that alters the threat assessment and could work out to the Emirates' benefit"" on future weapons sales.
The United States guarantees that Israel receives more advanced American weapons than Arab states get, giving it what is labeled a ""Qualitative Military Edge"" over its neighbors. One example is the F-35 jet made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co that Israel has used in combat, but the UAE is currently unable to purchase.
David Makovsky, director of the Project on Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank, told Reuters the deal is ""a win for the Emirates, which will undoubtedly be eligible for military sales that it could not obtain due to 'qualitative military edge' restrictions due to fear certain technologies could be used against Israel.""
In May, the U.S. State Department approved a possible sale of up to 4,569 used Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to the UAE for $556 million.
U.S. lawmakers have tried to rein in Trump administration plans for arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to pressure them to improve their human rights record and do more to avoid civilian casualties in an air campaign against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the war in Yemen.

A U.S. government watchdog report released on Tuesday said the State Department did not fully evaluate the risk of civilian casualties in Yemen when it pushed through a huge 2019 sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

782,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 05:46PM ET</span>",UAE's Israel deal met with Arab dismay but quiet welcome in Gulf,"By Rami Ayyub
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - From cries of ""betrayal"" to fears about ""falling dominoes"", the deal making the United Arab Emirates the third Arab state to forge ties with Israel stirred anger and dismay around the Middle East, but a cautious welcome from the UAE's Gulf allies.
The mixed response highlighted new fault lines in a region where fear and distrust of Iran - shared by Israel and some Arab states - has challenged a decades-old allegiance to the Palestinian issue as a major driver of Arab policy.
Palestinians, who want to establish a state on West Bank territory captured by Israel in 1967, denounced the agreement as a betrayal of the long-held Arab stance that peace should be conditional on Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory.
The agreement, which is set to make the UAE only the third Arab state after Egypt and Jordan to make peace with Israel, calls for a temporary suspension of Israel's planned annexation of occupied West Bank territory, but not withdrawal.
The deal, which U.S. President Donald Trump helped to broker with support from senior adviser Jared Kushner, forms a new axis with the UAE aligning itself with Israel in confronting Shi’ite Muslim Iran and Sunni Islamist radicals in the region. 
This is likely to heighten tensions in the Gulf, which has in the past two years seen attacks on tankers and energy assets that the United States and Saudi Arabia have blamed on Iran, a charge Tehran denies.
Iran's foreign minister said the deal aimed to hand Trump a win ahead of U.S. elections in November, a view echoed by the leader of Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement.
""It's shameful what Abu Dhabi did ... They don't see the Zionist regime as an enemy, but an ally and what's happening now is to help Trump in the elections,"" Iran's Mohammad Javad Zarif told Al Mayadeen TV.
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, in a televised speech, described the UAE move as an ""election favour"" for both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and said more Arab states would follow suit to ""satisfy"" Washington.
""It is good, though painful, that the masks have fallen,"" he said, describing the deal as a betrayal of Islam and Arabs.
'FALL LIKE DOMINOES'
Some worshippers at Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, where Palestinians want to establish the capital of a future state, carried pictures of UAE Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed with the word ""traitor"" underneath his image.
""Just like Egypt, Jordan and now Abu Dhabi, the whole Arab world will start to fall like dominoes,"" said Mohammad al-Sharif, 45, a member of Israel's Arab minority. ""That Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed and his dirty dogs look out for themselves and their interests and the rest of us can go to hell.""
Palestine Liberation Organization Secretary General Saeb Erekat spelled out the potential consequences for his people if a united Arab front splintered.
""The whole thing that we based our strategy on as Arabs is that the (2002) Arab peace initiative specified that once Israel withdraws, there will be peace between Arabs and Israelis.
""Netanyahu came determined, with Kushner, Trump... to change the formula, that they want Arab recognition of Israel while they continue with the occupation, and the United Arab Emirates yesterday stamped the green light for this,"" Erekat said.
TURKEY MAY SHUT EMBASSY
Turkey, a powerful regional rival of the UAE, said history would not forgive the Gulf country for making a deal which undercut the 2002 Arab peace plan, which had proposed peace in return for Israeli withdrawal from all occupied territory. 
""We may also take a step in the direction of suspending diplomatic ties with the Abu Dhabi leadership or pulling back our ambassador,"" President Tayyip Erdogan said after Friday prayers, adding that he could close Turkey's embassy.
But, in a region beset with other challenges including civil wars, poverty and economic crisis, some people appeared to have other concerns. 
At Istanbul's landmark Hagia Sophia, converted by Erdogan to a mosque last month in a move which he portrayed as a step towards restoring ""freedom"" to Al Aqsa in Jerusalem, worshippers who spoke to Reuters were unaware of the announcement.
INCENTIVE FOR PEACE
Egypt and Jordan, which signed peace deals with Israel in 1979 and 1994 respectively and enjoy close ties with the UAE, both welcomed the agreement. Jordan said the pact could make a beneficial impact if it spurred Israel to accept a Palestinian state on land it took in the 1967 Middle East war.
""If Israel deals with it as an incentive to end occupation..., it will move the region towards a just peace,"" Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said.
Oman and Bahrain praised the accord but Saudi Arabia, which has in the past led Arab policy towards Israel and hosts Islam's two holiest sites, has remained silent, as have Kuwait and Qatar. [L8N2FG22C] 
Jordan's former foreign minister, Marwan al-Muasher, said it was possible other Gulf states could follow Abu Dhabi's lead. But none of those could address the root problem. 

""In the end it's not the Gulf states who are living under occupation, it's the Palestinians. And until you reach a solution with the Palestinians, it does not matter how many peace deals you make with Arab states,"" he told Reuters.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - After months without museums, cinemas and bars, Mexico City residents began exploring them again this week, even as authorities continue battling the coronavirus pandemic that has so far killed over 55,000 people in Mexico.
Mexico has the third highest death toll worldwide from the virus, which has hammered the economy and caused unprecedented disruptions to life in the metropolis of 22 million people.
The capital has been one of the areas hardest hit by the pandemic, but as cultural centers and businesses reopened with new safety measures this week, some Mexicans could not wait to get back to venues that have been closed since late March.
""I'm not going out (fearfully) because I think the first thing that's going to get to us is fear,"" said Alma Esther Cervantes, a 50-year-old office worker, as she took her daughters to the Museo Soumaya art museum, all wearing face masks.
The reopening ran contrary to some other parts of Latin America, including Bogota, where seven neighborhoods enter lockdown from Sunday, and Argentina, which is extending curbs against the scourge until the end of August.
Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum says she is monitoring hospitalization levels to see when to open more activities.
Rodolfo Escoto, deputy director of operations at Cinemex, said re-opening was a test of the movie theater chain's ability to inspire confidence in people, ""and above all, to ensure they're no longer afraid to go out.""
After months of confinement, Carmen Oliva, a 32-year-old clerk, was delighted to be back at the cinema.
""You have to learn to adapt,"" she said. ""To learn to take measures to look after yourself, and the people you love."" 
Some saw the re-opening as crucial for mental health. 
""There was a point at which so much time alone was emotionally affecting some of us,"" 30-year-old Jessica Leon said at an eatery in Polanco, a wealthy neighborhood packed with watering holes that had turned off their lights in the pandemic.
City authorities have allowed bars to re-open if they register as restaurants, operate at 30% capacity and restrict their hours of service from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.

""Obviously it affects sales a bit, but to be honest we're grateful they've let us open, that's the most important thing,"" said Jonathan Maqueda, a restaurant manager in Polanco.

Queen Elizabeth's only daughter, who competed in equestrianism at the Olympics and once survived a kidnapping attempt, is known for her charity work and has continued to thank medics and support charities during the coronavirus lockdown.
To mark her birthday, the royal family released three official portraits of Anne at her country residence of Gatcombe Park in western England. 
Taken by the high profile photographer John Swannell, two showed the princess in formal dress while a third pictured her outside in the countryside. 
Mike Tindall, Anne's son-in-law and a former England rugby player, told the BBC this week that plans for a gathering in Scotland had been scaled back because of a nearby local lockdown sparked by an outbreak of COVID-19.
""It is a shame. I'm sure we will do something as a family to celebrate her 70 amazing years,"" he said. ""She's just an incredible woman in terms of how much work she can get through in the year.""
Anne has won plaudits over the years for the amount of charitable events she attends each year on behalf of the family.
She survived a kidnapping attempt in 1974 near Buckingham Palace when a man stopped her car and shot at those who tried to intervene. Told by the attacker to get out of the car, Anne replied ""Not bloody likely"" and managed to escape as the police arrived.

(Reuters) - Vice President Mike Pence will deliver remarks from historic Fort McHenry in Maryland during the Republican National Convention, a campaign official said on Friday, while President Donald Trump said he will likely give his address from the White House.
The plans for the convention, which starts on Aug. 24, have already drawn criticism from Democrats and ethics experts, who have raised concerns about the use of federal property for partisan advantage.
Meanwhile, Democrats will showcase some musical star power at their own convention next week, with the likes of John Legend, Common, Billie Eilish and the Chicks - formerly the Dixie Chicks - all set to perform during the four-night event that starts on Monday, officials said on Friday.
Both conventions, which are typically raucous affairs inside packed arenas, have been turned almost entirely into virtual affairs due to the coronavirus pandemic. The two events kick off what will be a frenetic two months of campaigning ahead of the Nov. 3 election between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.
Biden, the former vice president, and Senator Kamala Harris of California will formally accept the Democratic nominations for president and vice president at next week's convention, while Trump and Pence will be nominated for a second four-year term a week later.
Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, one of only two African-American Republicans in Congress, will be a featured speaker, as well as former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, first lady Melania Trump and Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, according to a Trump campaign official.
By tradition, Trump will speak on Aug. 27, the convention's final night. He told the New York Post on Thursday he planned to deliver his acceptance speech from the South Lawn of the White House after also considering the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
Pence will make his acceptance speech on Aug. 26 from another historic site: the Fort McHenry National Monument and Shrine in Baltimore. An unsuccessful British attack on the fort was the inspiration for the national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner (NASDAQ:BANR).""
Democrats have lined up the party's leading lights for their convention, including former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
Billionaire former presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, a late addition, will speak on one of the nights, though the schedule has not yet been finalized, according to a source familiar with the programming who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The former New York City mayor, who spent $1 billion of his own money on his abbreviated campaign, has vowed to spend heavily to defeat Trump, though he has not yet announced any specific plans.
Several other former contenders for the nomination will also appear, as the party seeks to present a unified front ahead of the Nov. 3 election. The list includes Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. 
Biden will speak from his home state of Delaware on Thursday, the convention's final night, while Harris will do so on Wednesday.
In an effort to counterprogram the Democratic convention, Trump will travel to the key battleground states of Minnesota, Arizona and Wisconsin on Monday and Tuesday and give speeches attacking Biden, the campaign said.

Preparations were also being made for a possible Trump visit to Charlotte, North Carolina, on Aug. 24, a campaign adviser said, the day that a small number of Republican delegates will gather there to formally nominate Trump.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday dismissed the National Rifle Association's lawsuit challenging New York's decision to close gun stores in the state in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic.
The decision came eight days after New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit seeking to dissolve the gun rights group, accusing senior leaders of corruption including the improper diversion of millions of dollars. 
U.S. District Judge Mae D'Agostino said the NRA lacked standing to challenge on behalf of its members a March 20 executive order by Governor Andrew Cuomo requiring gun stores to close in the state because they were ""non-essential"" businesses.
D'Agostino, who sits in the state capital, Albany, also refused to let the NRA amend its complaint, saying it would be futile because there was no evidence its ability to conduct day-to-day advocacy for its members had been impaired.
Since the lawsuit was filed on April 2, gun stores and other retailers have gradually been allowed to reopen in New York, as the number and rate of new COVID-19 infections declined.
""Although we respectfully disagree that the NRA lacked standing to pursue this case -- then or now -- we were pleased the action brought attention to an abuse of power against gun retailers,"" William Brewer, a lawyer for the NRA, said in a statement.
The case was one of many brought across the country by gun rights advocates who said store closures and other restrictions on the firearms industry violated the Second Amendment and other provisions of the U.S. Constitution.
In response to James's lawsuit, which it branded a ""baseless, premeditated attack,"" the NRA countered with its own lawsuit claiming that the attorney general's case was politically motivated and violated its First Amendment rights.

The case is National Rifle Association of America v Cuomo et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of New York, No. 20-00385.

APUI, Brazil (Reuters) - For a moment, the Brazilian firefighters were taken aback by the sudden rage of the climbing flames: the speed at which they grew and moved, carried by the evening wind. 
Under the supervision of fire fighters from Brazil’s environment agency Ibama, a farmer in this remote part of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had set alight undergrowth along part of his land, a last-ditch attempt to divert a major fire approaching his home by starving fuel from the encroaching flames. 
But fire is unpredictable, especially here in the Amazon where different vegetation burns at different rates during the long dry months of the annual ""fire season.""
Wind and heat can quickly change the pattern of a blaze. Even rainfall from months ago can make a difference. 
Ten firefighters, dressed in yellow flame-retardant jackets with white balaclavas covering their mouths to protect from the smoke, worked to control the larger blaze by pushing the new flames with a water cannon towards it.
There is little else to be done. 
The fire, filling up the horizon, is too big to put out with the little equipment and the small team that Ibama has in Apuí, a sawmill town of around 20,000 people on a rough dirt patch of the Trans-Amazonian highway in the eastern corner of Brazil's giant Amazonas state. 
Two Reuters journalists accompanied the firefighters, sweating from the flames and wearing gas masks against the smoke, as the heat rose through their boots. 
Reuters journalists had traveled for five days along dusty, potholed tracks and over precarious bridges of felled trees to report on some of the thousands of fires burning in the Amazon.
On Tuesday, Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro denied there were any fires in the Amazon, calling it a ""lie"" and blaming the media for spreading it.
According to government data, the first 12 days of August have seen about the same number of fires as this time last year, when a sharp increase in blazes across the Amazon attracted international condemnation amid alarm over the deforestation of a region crucial to the fight against global warming. 
Experts say that fires are rarely a natural phenomenon in the rainforest, resulting instead from deliberate burning by farmers and land speculators to clear deforested land for pasture. 
Deforestation rose 34.5% in the 12 months through July, compared to a year earlier. 
Bolsonaro has dispatched the military to fight fires and deforestation since May, but environmental experts question whether these deployments are working.

As night falls over Apuí, the fire crackles. A giant tree, tumbles in flames with a fiery crash. The worst is over, the fire largely controlled and the firefighters, reeking of smoke fumes, get into their trucks and drive on to the next one.

ATHENS/ANKARA (Reuters) - A Greek and a Turkish warship were involved in a mild collision on Wednesday during a standoff in the eastern Mediterranean, in what a Greek defence source called an accident but Ankara called a provocation.
Tensions between the NATO allies have risen this week after Turkey sent a survey vessel to the region, escorted by warships, to map out sea territory for possible oil and gas drilling in an area where Turkey and Greece both claim jurisdiction. 
European Union foreign ministers, who met via teleconference, called for a de-escalation of tensions, an EU official said.
The Turkish Oruc Reis survey ship has been moving between Cyprus and the Greek island of Crete, shadowed by a number of Greek frigates. On Wednesday one Greek ship, the Limnos, was approaching the survey vessel when it came into the path of one of its Turkish naval escorts, the Kemal Reis.
The Greek frigate manoeuvred to avoid a head-on collision and in the process its bow touched the rear of the Turkish frigate, the defence source said, calling it a ""mini collision.""
""It was an accident,"" the source said, adding the Limnos was not damaged. It subsequently took part in a joint military exercise with France off Crete on Thursday morning, the person said.
In Switzerland on Friday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Athens needs to act with reason and called on the European Union to stop ""pampering"" Greece. Turkey has also cautioned France to stay out of the row. 
Greece ""should not attempt to provoke Oruc Reis like it did two days ago or it will receive a response,"" Cavusoglu said, adding the European Union should not give it ""unconditional support.""
Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias, who met U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Vienna on Friday, said he hoped all parties involved would act within international law. 
""Everything can be resolved, but this is a question that you have to put to the Turks,"" Dendias said.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the naval Kemal Reis had fended off an attack by Greek vessels and also warned of retaliation. 
Relations between Greece and Turkey have long been fraught with tension. Disputes have ranged from boundaries of offshore continental shelves and airspace to the ethnically split island of Cyprus. In 1996 they almost went to war over ownership of uninhabited islets in the Aegean Sea.
In a call with Erdogan on Thursday, European Council President Charles Michel recalled the EU's full solidarity with Greece, an EU official said. Michel called for de-escalation of tensions, said provocations should be avoided and added that dialogue is preferred, the official added. 
That line was reiterated at the EU foreign ministers' meeting. Greece advocated sanctions on Turkey, while its EU allies emphasised the need for a de-escalation of tensions and negotiations, an EU official said. The situation would be reviewed at a meeting in Berlin at the end of the month.

Cavusoglu said Switzerland had offered to mediate the dispute between Turkey and Greece and that Ankara had agreed to this in principle.

MOSCOW/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday proposed a video summit with the United States, Britain, France, China, Germany and Iran in a bid to avoid ""confrontation and escalation"" at the United Nations, where Washington is trying to extend an arms embargo on Tehran.
""The issue is urgent,"" Putin said in a statement, adding that the alternative was ""only further escalation of tensions, increasing risk of conflict - such a scenario must be avoided.""
When asked if he would take part, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters: ""I hear there's something, but I haven't been told of it yet.""
French President Emmanuel Macron is open to taking part in a video summit, the Elysee palace said.
The 15-member U.N. Security Council will announce later on Friday the result of a vote on a U.S.-drafted resolution to extend the weapons ban. Diplomats say it is bound to fail and put the fate of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers further at risk.
If the United States is unsuccessful it has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran using a provision in the nuclear deal, known as snapback, even though Washington quit the accord in 2018. Diplomats say the United States could try to do this as early as next week.
Putin said Russia, which is an ally of Iran in the Syrian civil war, remained fully committed to the nuclear deal and that the aim of a video summit would be ""to outline steps that will allow to avoid confrontation and escalation of the situation in the security council.""
He also said leaders could discuss establishing ""reliable security and confidence building measures in the Persian Gulf"" adding that this could be ""achieved if we combine the political will and constructive approach of all our states and the states in the region.""
U.S. President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new deal with Iran that would prevent it from both developing nuclear weapons and curb its activities in the region and elsewhere. He dubbed the 2015 nuclear deal - reached by the Obama administration - ""the worst deal ever.""
The 13-year-old arms embargo is due to expire in October. 

Diplomats warn that if the United States triggers a sanctions snapback the process would be tough and messy. They say several countries would argue that Washington legally could not activate a return of sanctions and therefore simply would not reimpose the measures on Iran themselves.

Obama, speaking on a podcast with David Plouffe, who managed his winning 2008 presidential campaign, also played down the seriousness of progressive-moderate divisions in the Democratic Party and said younger voters provided the key to beating Trump.
Trump, who opinion polls show is trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, said on Thursday he was blocking Democrats' effort to include funds for the Postal Service in a new coronavirus relief bill, in a bid to stop universal mail-in voting. 
Trump has railed for months against mail-in ballots as a possible source of fraud, although millions of Americans have cast absentee ballots by mail for years without such problems.
""The thing I'm most worried about is A) how do we protect the integrity of the election process? How do we make sure that people's votes are counted?"" Obama said.
He said Republicans have actively discouraged voter turnout before but that Trump's efforts to ""actively kneecap the Postal Service"" were unprecedented.
""What we've seen in a way that is unique to modern political history is a president who is explicit in trying to discourage people from voting, right?"" he said.
The Postal Service has told at least four states -- Michigan, Pennsylvania, California and Washington -- there is ""significant risk"" voters will not have enough time to complete their ballots and return them on time under current state laws, according to correspondence seen by Reuters.
""When we have voted in large numbers, particularly young people, we make progress. And when we don't, that vacuum is filled by people who are only interested in protecting their own power,"" Obama said.
Democrats have been trying to get younger, more progressive people, who usually vote in lower numbers, to take part in the election on Nov. 3. They worry that disagreements between moderate Democrats, such as Biden, and the more left-leaning wing of the party could hurt turnout. 
Obama said Democrats were ""unified"" around the idea that everyone should have healthcare.

""So the good news is that a lot of the so-called divisions within the Democratic Party, I think are not going to be a major factor in the election,"" he said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Beirut's seismic explosion propelled the scarred Lebanese capital 30 years back in time with a violence scarcely imaginable even to a country that has endured so many wars, invasions, occupations, air strikes, car bombs and assassinations.
The city that took 15 years to rebuild after a devastating 1975-90 civil war lies now with its port wrecked and districts in ruins, just like three decades ago. Then, the Lebanese could justifiably hope for a rebirth. Now, hope is all but gone.
This old Mediterranean city picked itself up and rose from the rubble after the war. Beirut was rebuilt as a glamorous metropolis with much of its old splendour. Most of its highly educated expatriates – academics, doctors, engineers, economists, lawyers and artists – returned to take part in rebuilding their country.
Billions of dollars poured in: from Western and Gulf Arab countries, and from the far-flung Lebanese diaspora thought to be at least three times the size of the population.
Beirut regularly figured in publications such as Conde Nast Traveller as an exciting destination, a melting pot party-town, friendly and bursting with energy, spirit, charm and diversity.
Its lures included a wild nightlife, international festivals in Graeco-Roman and Ottoman settings such as Baalbek, with its temples of Jupiter and Bacchus, and tempting food and wines. Tourists strolled its waterfront, or ventured a short distance to ski on slopes or hike in lush mountains overlooking the city.
But the cataclysm that sent up a mushroom cloud over Beirut -- said by experts to be roughly a 10th the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima 75 years ago to end World War Two -- may finally have broken the fabled resilience of the Lebanese.
""The situation is such a disaster with the country down on it knees,"" Jan Kubis, U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, told Reuters. ""The country is broken and the people are broke and broken"".
The government resigned after waves of public indignation at the negligence that led to the blast, caused when it said 2,750 tonnes of highly combustible ammonium nitrate – used in fertiliser but also for explosives – was left unsecured at a port which is a local byword for corruption and warlord control.
President Michel Aoun, Prime Minister Hassan Diab and a host of officials had documents warning an explosion of the material could destroy Beirut. Aoun and Diab insisted they had referred the warning to the appropriate authorities.
The president announced an investigation. But diplomats who track Lebanon's sectarian power sharing politics suspect the probe may end up concealing more evidence than it reveals. 
For traditional elites – warlords, dynastic leaders of the main Christian and Muslim sects, and their oligarch allies – the aftermath of the blast has been business as usual, just as it has been during the past year of worsening economic crisis.
""Unfortunately, what I see is the political figures, leaders still operating in the usual way,"" Kubis said. ""Of course they understand that perhaps the country has reached the limit, but I don't see any changes in the behaviour"".
They are already busy selecting another prime minister, who will have to agree to follow their policies, preserve their patronage networks and avoid reforms demanded by the IMF to extend aid, diplomats, officials and analysts say.
When French President Emmanuel Macron visited after the blast, he toured ground zero and walked in demolished districts, comforting the bereaved and listening to people's fury.
Not one of Lebanon's purported rulers has shown his face at the stricken scene. When Macron met Aoun, Diab, and parliament speaker Nabih Berri, residents said, it spoke volumes that only Macron wore a black tie out of respect for the dead.
RULERS' IMPUNITY
At root, Lebanon’s many crises boil down to one problem: its rulers and their impunity, diplomats and analysts say.
At the end of the war, the militia leaders put on suits, shook hands and – with the exception of the Iranian-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah group – disarmed. But they remained in charge, and mostly under foreign patronage: the Sunnis and their Christian partners to the west and the Gulf, the Shi'ite and their Christian allies to Syria and Iran.
Syria, which stationed troops in Lebanon in 1976 for 29 years until its army was forced out after the 2005 assassination of prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri, deliberately preserved and refined the confessional system to divide and rule the sects.
Israel, which occupied parts of south Lebanon for 22 years, furnished apparent justification for Hezbollah to retain its arms and drive out the Israeli army in 2000.
Since then, Hezbollah has become Iran’s spearhead in Lebanon and the region and a force more powerful than the state at home. A power structure based on sectarian barons suits Hezbollah so long as none of them question its predominance.
""This is a country with deeply entrenched culture of impunity, this is the most striking element of Lebanon,"" said one foreign observer. ""This port blast has cost 170 lives (yet) there are no strong demands for accountability at the highest level.""
Lebanese commentator Sarkis Naoum said the former warlords took off their military fatigues and put on suits, but still run the country with the ""militia mentality of corruption, tyranny, of sectarianism.""
""We have become a failed state,"" he said. ""They are directly responsible for turning this country into a dysfunctional state because of their divisions and hatred to each other. Each one tied himself to a foreign nation and allied himself to those abroad.""
Mohanad Hage Ali, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, agreed that deep reforms under the current political class were unlikely.
""They are not ready to give up this quickly the old order, which enables them to finance their parties and lavish lifestyles,"" he said, noting that the country's dollar reserves were drying up. ""Time is running out ... There is the IMF or there is chaos."" 
Ordinary Lebanese have seen the value of their savings evaporate in local banks that shut them out of their own accounts. Lebanon’s rulers and bankers, in contrast, continue living comfortably.
Politics in Lebanon is so lucrative, Lebanese say, that it is studded with billionaires. Political barons pad the payrolls of ministries with their followers, siphon off government funds and award themselves inflated public contracts, they say. 
  There is a consensus among diplomats that the outgoing government came up with a reasonable reform plan in talks with the IMF, but nothing happened, mainly because they had no political support from the forces that nominated them. 
""Those who stand to lose from the (IMF) deal are the pillars of the Lebanese state. They thought they could get $10bn-20bn from the IMF and then go back to their old tricks,"" said Naoum.
Amid the chaos, a new exodus of the professional classes is under way – just like during the civil war. 

""This blast has brought Lebanon back to its knees,"" said one diplomat. ""What Lebanon needs now is a modern system of governance.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior White House officials on Friday sought to use the momentum from a historic deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates to appeal to more Arab and Muslim countries to set aside long-standing tensions and make similar agreements.
A senior White House official said President Donald Trump's senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and Middle East envoy, Avi Berkowitz, had been in touch with ""numerous"" countries in the region, trying to see if more agreements would materialize. The official declined to name the countries.
On Thursday, Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced they would normalize diplomatic ties and forge a broad new relationship, a move that reshapes the order of Middle East politics. Trump helped broker the accord.
Speaking at a news conference, Trump predicted that other countries would be signing similar accords with Israel.
""What you will see now is other countries will come into that deal and you will have peace in the Middle East,"" he said.
Speculation has centered around two Gulf nations, Bahrain and Oman, both of which welcomed the deal. Sudan was also a subject of speculation.
Bahrain hosted a U.S.-led Middle East conference a year ago, aimed at raising money for the Palestinians and Jordan as part of Trump's Middle East peace initiative.
""There are numerous countries that we have been in contact with literally in the last 24 hours,"" said the official. ""We have been in contact with officials from numerous countries, Arab and Muslim, in the Middle East and Africa.""
The Israel-UAE deal was viewed widely as a foreign policy victory for Trump as he struggles to contain the coronavirus pandemic in the United States and resulting economic recession while facing a tough battle for re-election on Nov. 3.
Trump said on Thursday he expected to have a signing ceremony for the deal in about three weeks, with delegations from each country.
Kushner and Berkowitz are making the case to other countries that improved ties with Israel could have economic benefits and help counter Iranian influence in the region.
""If you're an Arab or Muslim country and you see the positive reception the world gave this agreement, it would be natural to see this as a really historic time and opportunity and we are optimistic ongoing negotiations will prove fruitful,"" the official said.

BONOUA/ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Protesters in Ivory Coast set fire to a bus in Abidjan on Friday after deadly protests earlier in the week against the president's decision to seek a third term, and organisers elsewhere vowed further action against his bid to stand again.
At least five people have been killed during demonstrations in recent days, with tensions running high since President Alassane Ouattara announced last week he would run for re-election on Oct. 31. 
Opponents say the move violates a constitutional two-term limit and jeopardises the tenuous stability achieved since Ouattara's first election win in 2010 sparked a brief civil war. [nL8N2FF65T]
On Friday, the remnants of tyre barricades smouldered in the opposition stronghold of Bonoua, as residents gathered in the rubble of the town's police station that was torched by protesters the previous day after one of them was shot dead.
A column of police reinforcements arrived in Bonoua on Thursday night to restore order after the crowd clashed with police who used tear gas and live bullets, witnesses said.
""We're going to march until October, tomorrow we will keep on marching"" said local youth leader Frederik N’Ta N'Chou, to cheers from the crowd. ""We don't have weapons but we have stones.""
On Thursday, police confirmed one protester had died in Bonoua, but gave no further details. 
Opposition groups insist the president must stand down after serving two terms, in accordance with the law, but Ouattara says the new constitution, adopted in 2016, acted as a reset button, allowing him to run again. 
While Bonoua and other protest hotspots were mostly calm on Friday, a small protest in Yopougon, a district of the commercial capital Abidjan, saw a passenger bus set on fire in the early hours. By midday, traffic was flowing normally under the supervision of a police patrol. 

A police spokesman declined to comment on the incident or whether there had been any casualties.

The incident caused no casualties, the military said.
It followed at least five attacks directed at U.S. interests in Iraq this week, including four blasts against convoys carrying supplies to bases housing U.S. forces, a rocket attack on an air base north of Baghdad and a rocket attack near the U.S. Embassy in the capital.
Washington blames such attacks on Iranian-backed militia groups. Iran has not directly commented on the incidents but little-known groups believed to be connected to Iran-aligned militias have claimed some attacks.
Friday's attack took place as Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi prepares to travel to the United States for talks about Iraq's future strategic relationship with Washington.
It also comes after Israel and the United Arab Emirates, two regional opponents of Iran, announced they would normalise diplomatic ties, a move that some commentators say provides a fresh challenge to Iran's power in the Middle East.
Iraq, where U.S.-Iran tensions have often spilled over into violence, seeks to avoid being drawn into any regional conflagration. 
The Middle East came close to a full conflict in January after a U.S. drone strike killed the Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad airport.
Iran-aligned militias have sworn to avenge their deaths.
The militias see Kadhimi as having firmly sided with the United States since he took office in May, after he ordered an arrest raid against one powerful Iran-aligned group and has indicated he wants to rein in the paramilitaries.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Yemen's Houthi group to allow an assessment team to travel to a decaying oil tanker that is threatening to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil off the war-torn country's coast.
More then a month ago Houthi officials said they would agree to allow a U.N. mission to conduct a technical assessment and whatever initial repairs might be feasible on the Safer tanker. But the United Nations is still waiting for formal authorization.
Guterres is ""deeply concerned"" about the condition of the oil tanker, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Friday. The United Nations has warned that the Safer could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez disaster off Alaska.
""He specifically calls for granting independent technical experts unconditional access to the tanker to assess its condition and conduct any possible initial repairs,"" Dujarric said. ""This ... will provide crucial scientific evidence for next steps to be taken in order to avert catastrophe.""  

The Safer tanker has been stranded off Yemen's Red Sea oil terminal of Ras Issa for more than five years. The U.N. Security Council has also called on the Houthis to facilitate unconditional access as soon as possible.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - School bus drivers from the second largest school district in the United States led a noisy protest caravan through downtown Los Angeles on Thursday, demanding federal and state funding to help reopen schools safely amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The drivers from the Los Angeles Unified Schools District (LAUSD) were joined by other vehicles as they circled city hall and honked their horns.
""Until they get conditions safe, I prefer us to be at home,"" said John Lewis, a school bus driver, who has been in the job for 30 years. ""I miss work. I love my job, I love the students, the people I work with but I understand why we can't be at work right now because it's just not safe.""
Earlier this month, the Los Angeles teachers union and local education officials agreed on a plan for resuming online-only classes at the end of August. California's powerful teachers unions strongly oppose in-person instruction without safety measures that could be difficult and expensive to implement.
Such safety measures would likely require additional funding from the state and federal government.
Austin Beutner, superintendent of LAUSD, who joined the protesting drivers and other school staff, said investment was needed.
""Spread the desks, stay apart, wear a mask, clean and sanitize, redo the air filtration system. We've done all of those things. We also need to test for the virus and provide contact tracing at schools because schools could become a Petri dish,"" Beutner said.
""Unless we have a health crisis turn into an education crisis, we need to make sure the funding is there for schools,"" he said.

Belarus arrested the men last month and said they had sought to destabilise the country prior to Sunday's presidential election. 
Russia dismissed that accusation and described the men as employees of a private security firm. Moscow said the men were only passing through the Belarusian capital of Minsk on their way to other countries and that they had been wrongly detained.
Ukraine had sought the extradition of 28 of the alleged mercenaries whom it suspects of fighting alongside Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Belarus had said it would cooperate with Ukraine in the case.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The global community should help Lebanon rather than impose its will on the country, Iran's foreign minister said in Beirut on Friday, following the catastrophic blast at the city's port that killed 172 people and forced the government to resign.
Iran backs Lebanon's powerful armed movement Hezbollah, which along with its allies helped form the outgoing government. The United States classifies Hezbollah as a terrorist group.
Mohammed Javad Zarif was speaking after meeting President Michel Aoun, who had earlier met U.S. and French officials in a flurry of Western diplomacy that has focused on urging Lebanon to fight corruption and enact long-delayed reforms to unlock foreign financial aid to tackle its economic crisis.
""There should be international efforts to help Lebanon, not to impose anything on it,"" Zarif said in televised comments.
""It is not humane to exploit the pain and suffering of the people for political goals,"" he said, adding that the Lebanese and their representatives should decide on the country's future.
Iran is seen as a major player in Lebanon through backing, arming and funding Hezbollah, established by the Revolutionary Guards in 1982. The most powerful group in Lebanon, Hezbollah exercises major sway over government.
Its role has led U.S.-allied Gulf Arab states in recent years to end financial support for Lebanon.
Visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale said in televised comments later on Friday that Lebanon needs a government that ""genuinely commits to and acts for real change"".
He said concerted efforts were needed to root out corruption, enact financial and economic reforms, establish state control over ports and borders and revamp the power sector.
Lebanese had been staging angry protests against a political elite blamed for the country's many woes even before the Aug. 4. blast, which injured 6,000, damaged swathes of the city and left 300,000 homeless. Some 30 people remain missing.
French Defence Minister Florence Parly, who also met Aoun, called for the formation of a government capable of taking ""courageous decisions"".
International humanitarian aid has poured in but foreign states have linked financial assistance to reform of the Lebanese state, which has defaulted on its huge sovereign debts.
Zarif said Tehran and private Iranian firms were ready to help with rebuilding and rehabilitating the electricity sector. 
The explosion sharpened anger at the authorities.
""We can't live like this. The West has to pressure our leaders to save us,"" said Iyaam Ghanem, a Beirut pharmacist.
CALLS FOR JUSTICE
Hale has said the FBI will join a probe into the blast at a hangar in the port where Lebanese authorities say more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that detonated had been stored for years without safety measures. 
Aoun told Hale on Friday that Beirut needed help to ""understand the circumstances"" under which the nitrate shipment came into the port and was unloaded, an official statement said. 
The president has said the probe will look into whether the cause was negligence, an accident or ""external interference"".
Victims and their representatives told reporters that only an independent probe would deliver justice, appealing to the U.N. Security Council for an international investigation.
""Is it acceptable that people find their homes shattered, their families killed, their hopes and their dreams killed, with no justice,"" said Paul Najjar, whose three-year-old daughter Alexandra died in the blast.
State news agency NNA said questioning of some ministers due on Friday had been postponed as the judge appointed for the task said he did not have authority to question government ministers.
The cabinet resignation has fuelled uncertainty. Agreement on a new government will likely be very difficult in a country with deep factional rifts and a sectarian power-sharing system.

Senior Christian cleric Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, without naming countries, said a new Lebanon was being ""cooked in (foreign) kitchens"" to serve politicians' interests.

Yorgen Fenech has been behind bars since late November 2019 when he was arrested and accused of being an accomplice in the 2017 car bomb murder. He denies the claims. A date for his trial has not been set yet.
Three other men, accused of setting off the bomb, have been behind bars awaiting trial since December 2017. The middleman in the plot turned state evidence and has been giving testimony against Fenech.
Fenech went on hunger strike with two other prisoners as another two inmates were added to the prison section where he is being kept.
His family in a statement complained that Fenech, who owns hotels and a casino, has been held in a crowded room sharing a latrine and a tiny basin to be used for personal hygiene, cleaning dishes and clothes.
""Inmates sick with diarrhoea and vomiting are all penned up in the same cramped living space make the situation unbearable. This, not even mentioning the worsening of living conditions due to COVID-19 in the prison facilities,"" the family said.
They also complained that a weekly visit to Fenech by his relatives was cancelled on Friday morning.
In a reaction, one of Caruana Galizia's sons, Matthew, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that his own right to see his mother had been taken away when she was murdered.
The prisons department confirmed that three prisoners had started a hunger strike because they did not want any more inmates in their sleeping quarters.

As for visiting rights, the department said prisoner privileges were tied to their behaviour and observance of rules.

MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on Friday for more protests and an election recount, piling pressure on the authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, as he faces the biggest challenge in his 26 years in power. 
In a video posted on YouTube from self-imposed exile in Lithuania, Tsikhanouskaya asked supporters to demand an official investigation into allegations that Lukashenko rigged last Sunday's presidential election.
At least two protesters were killed and thousands detained in a violent crackdown this week. The European Union is considering new sanctions on Belarus, which is seen by Russia as a strategic buffer against NATO and the EU.
""Belarusians will never again want to live with the old authorities,"" Tsikhanouskaya said. ""Let's defend our choice. Don't stay on the sidelines. Our voices need to be heard.""
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets for a sixth consecutive day demanding that Lukashenko step down. Protesters were joined by workers at some of the state-owned industrial plants that are the centrepiece of his Soviet-style economic model.
As the crowd converged on the parliament building on Independence Square in Minsk, at least two helmeted security officers lowered their riot shields, prompting women to run forward to hug them and offer flowers. 
In a carnival atmosphere, marchers held up balloons, flags and placards saying ""we will not forget, we will not forgive"". Horns from passing cars blared in solidarity. 
In a rare climbdown, the government earlier apologised for the use of force as it freed more than 2,000 protesters from detention.
Several bore heavy bruises and complained of beatings, cramped conditions and starvation rations inside the cells. The government denied abusing detainees.
One teacher trembled and wept quietly as she held up flowers outside the State Philharmonic concert hall, along with a placard reading ""I'm a teacher, and I want to be proud of that!"".
'GO AWAY'
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the bloc's chief executive, called for sanctions on those ""who violated democratic values or abused human rights in Belarus"".
Belarus Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei told his Swiss counterpart in a call that Minsk was ready for ""constructive and objective dialogue with foreign partners"" about issues related to the election, the state news agency BelTA reported.
Russia, which has nudged Lukashenko into accepting closer political and economic ties, this week expressed concern over what it depicted as attempts by external forces to destabilise Belarus.
Lukashenko, a 65-year-old who once ran a Soviet collective farm, has faced increasing anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as a sluggish economy and civil rights.
The official election result handed him a landslide victory with 80% of the vote, compared to around 10% for Tsikhanouskaya. Washington said the vote ""was not free and fair"".
State television showed him calmly telling a meeting: ""I'm still alive, and not abroad."" 
But even sections of society normally seen as loyal have begun to dare to show dissent.
Several television presenters and journalists from the tightly controlled state media resigned this week in solidarity with the protesters.
Thousands of workers protested on Friday at the Minsk Automobile Plant (MAZ), which makes ‎trucks‎ and ‎buses, chanting ""Shame on you!"" and ""Go!"", echoing the unrest seen at several major factories this week. At the Grodno Azot chemical plant, a sea of workers in orange helmets clapped and cheered ""prison!""
Tsikhanouskaya, a 37-year-old former English teacher, emerged from obscurity a few weeks ago to take her husband's place in the election campaign after he was jailed. She has now led some of the biggest protests against Lukashenko since he came to power with the fall of the Soviet Union.
Shortly after the election, she fled to Lithuania, saying it was for the sake of her children. On Friday, she called for the international community to facilitate talks with the authorities and said she wanted to set up a council to enable a transfer of power, a proposal that was swiftly endorsed by the president of Lithuania. 

Lukashenko has alleged a foreign-backed plot to destabilise Belarus and dismissed the demonstrators as criminals and people without work.

VIENNA (Reuters) - The United States will do everything in its power to renew the international arms embargo on Iran under review at the United Nations, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday.
The U.N. Security Council has started voting on a U.S. bid to renew the embargo, expiring in mid-October. Veto-powers Russia and China are opposed, and results are due within hours.
Visiting Austria as part of a tour of central Europe, Pompeo said Iran must also provide full and immediate cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, whose head he met in Vienna.
""It makes no sense to permit the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism to purchase and sell weapons systems,"" Pompeo told a news conference. ""I mean, that's just nuts.""
Iran denies promoting terrorism.
Pompeo said Washington would ""do everything that we can within our diplomatic toolset to ensure that arms embargo doesn't expire"".
""The voting will be in the next handful of hours and we are hoping that we will be successful. When we see the results, we will make the decision about how to move forward.
""We have been unambiguous about the fact we have no intention of allowing this arms embargo to expire. None whatsoever.""
The embargo is set to end mid-October under Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which U.S. President Donald Trump's administration quit in 2018.
IAEA head Rafael Grossi, whose agency is policing Iran's nuclear deal with major powers, told reporters after meeting Pompeo that talks with Tehran on full access to all sites continued.
""We have requested Iran to grant access. That hasn't happened yet. We are working on that,"" he said.

""Our objective is to get access to continue the verification work which is essential for the international community.""

The warning, which comes after Austria recorded 57 new cases among people returning from Croatia within the last 24 hours, is effective from Aug. 17, the ministry said. 
Nearly a quarter of the people whose infections were reported within the past seven days show no symptoms, health minister Rudolf Anschober said. The average age of infected Austrians was 33.7 years.
The measure will take effect from Monday, and people returning to Austria will be required to present a negative test for COVID-19, which should not be older than 72 hours, the health ministry said.
Austria had already imposed tight testing requirements for arrivals from other Balkan states in July, after it saw an increase in infections among people returning from the region. It has travel warnings for Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia in place, as well as for European Union member states Bulgaria and Romania.
The number of daily COVID-19 cases peaked in Croatia on Friday as the country recorded 208 new cases. 
So far Croatia, a country of 4 million people, has recorded 6,258 cases of COVID-19 and 163 deaths. 
Austria, with 8.9 million people, has recorded 22,881 cases and 725 fatalities. As in other countries, the number of new infections has increased in the summer holiday period.

The chemical, organic peroxide, is used across many industries and was stored at the Magnox reprocessing site in northwest England, segregated from the nuclear operations of the plant.
""During a routine investigation we noted that the chemical had changed state,"" Sellafield Ltd. said in a statement.
""The plan, as advised by EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), is to burn the chemicals in a prepared incineration pit on a part of the site away from any buildings or infrastructure.""
The incineration was expected to be complete on Friday afternoon. 
The reprocessing plant was evacuated as a precautionary measure on Thursday. The plant was not in operation at the time, Sellafield Ltd said.
""Chemical monitoring is undertaken across the site to understand changing chemical states and to inform when and how industrial chemicals should be stored or disposed of,"" the company said.
""The risk has been identified as a conventional safety issue rather than a nuclear safety risk,"" it added.
Sellafield is a former nuclear power generating site. The Magnox plant at the site is due to close this year. It processes and separates plutonium and uranium.

Governor Phil Murphy's announcement came as Republican President Donald Trump stepped up his attacks on voting by mail, which is expected to increase dramatically this fall because of the coronavirus. Trump and his wife, nonetheless, requested absentee ballots for next Tuesday's primary election in their adopted home state of Florida.
Trump has said the voting method is susceptible to large-scale fraud, though experts say voter fraud of any kind is extremely rare in the United States.
New Jersey will use methods similar to what it employed for its primary vote in July, Murphy told CNN in an interview, with improvements based on lessons learned then.
""We're going to have more presence of secure drop boxes, make sure there is that physical in-voting capacity,"" he said, referring to in-person voting.
Residents who opt to go to their local polling places on Nov. 3 will do so in ""provisional voting,"" meaning they must use paper ballots, not voting machines, so that officials can guard against duplicate voting, Murphy said.
The process is ""a little bit more cumbersome but it works,"" he said.
Asked about potential voter fraud by using such a hybrid model, Murphy said, ""I'm pretty sure that we have a higher probability of being hit by lightning than we do uncovering voter fraud."" 
He said the July vote was a resounding success, convincing officials that was the way to go. New Jersey will join eight other states, including California and Nevada, that will offer universal mail-in balloting. 
Election officials in most states have encouraged at-home voting as the highly contagious nature of the novel coronavirus has made voting in person a concern.
Trump's re-election campaign and the national Republican Party this month sued Nevada to block a law that will send a mail-in ballot to every voter before November's election, saying it will result in ""inevitable"" voter fraud.

Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, is a Trump critic. Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, is a staunch ally of the president, who has praised Florida's election system as secure.

The move deals a blow to hopes for a swift revival of mass tourism after months of lockdown to stop the spread of the virus all but wiped out this year's high season for tourism in Europe.
Daily Bild had reported earlier that Mallorca had been added to the list of high-risk regions published by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany's public health agency.
The sources told Reuters that all of Spain except for the Canary Islands would be included on RKI's next list of risk regions.
Designations as risk regions are typically followed by the German Foreign Ministry warning against touristic travel to those areas and mean people returning from there face a coronavirus test or two weeks' compulsory quarantine.
The Balearic islands, off Spain's eastern coast, include holiday destinations like Ibiza, among the most popular destinations for north European sunseekers. 
The German government considers regions within the European Union high-risk once the number of new coronavirus infections exceeds 50 cases per 100,000 people over the course of seven days.
Infections in Spain have spiked in recent days following the end of Spain's tough lockdown seven weeks ago.
Friday's almost 3,000 new cases, little changed from Thursday but about double the average in the first 12 days of August, brought the cumulative total to 342,813 - the highest number in Western Europe.
But the Balearic Islands have some of the lowest daily infections among the Spanish regions. After peaking at around 80 cases in July, they have come down to 9 as reported by the health ministry on Friday.
Spanish authorities earlier on Friday ordered the closure of nightclubs, banned drinking in outdoor public areas and all but outlawed smoking to try to stem the virus resurgence.
(This story corrects sixth paragraph to say the Balearic Islands are off Spain's eastern coast, not northwestern)

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Claudette Halabi cried out from beneath the rubble of her house for an hour before she died. The neighbours couldn't save her.
""We kept hearing the screams. I heard her voice. But we couldn't do anything. It still hurts,"" said Johnny Khawand, near the remains of her Beirut building. The thundering blast at the port last week had crushed its three floors. 
Khawand, born 40 years ago in the same neighbourhood, stayed up all night for the rescue operation. Four died in that building alone, among them Claudette, a widow in her 70s he knew since he was a kid.
In one of Beirut's poorest neighbourhoods, Karantina near the port, people are still reeling from the explosion that flattened homes and killed many neighbours who felt like family. 
Everyone knows everyone. Everyone cried when they recalled the explosion. 
A week later, the neighbours are struggling to find the money to rebuild, without help from the state in a city that was already deep in economic collapse. 
The warehouse explosion killed at least 172 people, wounded thousands and ravaged entire districts. It shattered walls and ripped out balconies in Karantina, a neglected part of the capital. 
The cluster of streets, with a slaughterhouse and a waste plant, saw one of the bloodiest massacres of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. 
Many said the blast did more damage in a few seconds than 15 years of war. With the wreckage at their doorstep once more, families who have spent decades in Karantina have camped out in their apartments. They sleep on the floor or on ripped couches, without doors or windows, not sure how to go on.
'OUR LIFE SAVINGS'
""I'm in a nightmare I can't wake up from. I still can't believe I'm looking at my mother's coffin,"" said Claudette's son, George Halabi, who flew in for her funeral. 
At the church cemetery, the blast had blown the doors off family mausoleums, sending a stench that encircled mourners.
""It's a crime against all of Lebanon,"" Halabi said. ""My mother survived the war.""
Like many Lebanese, he blamed the sectarian elite that has ruled since the war for pushing the country to ruin.
With the blast under investigation, officials have pointed to a huge stockpile of explosive material stored in unsafe conditions at the port for years.
Months before the warehouse blew up, a currency crash had wiped out Tony Matar's savings from his family's linens store. 
""Our life's savings are in this house,"" said Matar, 68, whose grandfather was born in Karantina. ""It was a paradise.""
The shockwaves brought doors, closets, and chairs crashing on his daughter Patricia, 25. She had travelled to Beirut for her sister's wedding, and her broken bones will take months to recover. 
""Every time I come back home, I relive that moment. I remember how my daughter fell and I cry,"" said Tony's wife Souad, clad in black. 
Her mother had died from cancer just days before. ""I didn't even have time to mourn her,"" she said. ""Can you imagine I thanked God she passed away? So that she did not have to see this."" 
A CHILD'S TRAUMA
Abdou Batrouni, a fisherman, lost his small savings, stashed in a closet in a bedroom that was blown to pieces. 
His family has relied on donations and young volunteers who flocked to help from across the country. He and others said no officials visited the district, historically a place where refugees settled, which later also became home to some Syrian families and migrant workers.
Batrouni's wife had shielded their two sons, nine and three years old, with her body. They got out without a scratch, but he found one of the boys, Elie, crouched down, yelling ""I don't want to die, I don't want to die."" 
""Now if I just clap, he gets startled and bursts into tears."" The first night, they all slept next to each other on a mattress at the doorless entrance. 
Around every corner, neighbours told stories of loss but also bravery. A man who threw himself on his daughter needed dozens of stitches. A woman carried her elderly mother and hid her between two closets. 

""We all grew up together, we saw each other get married,"" said Hoda Jouni, who runs a minimarket. ""We lost everything.""

WASHINGTON/OTTAWA (Reuters) - The United States will extend to a ban on non-essential travel at land borders with Canada and Mexico for another 30 days as several states struggle to contain a coronavirus outbreak, a top U.S. official confirmed Friday.
Acting U.S. Homeland Security Department Secretary Chad Wolf confirmed the action on Twitter. Reuters reported earlier Friday the planned extension at the U.S.-Canada border.
""We continue to work with our Canadian and Mexican partners to slow the spread of #COVID19. Accordingly, we have agreed to extend the limitation of non-essential travel at our shared land ports of entry through September 21,"" Wolf wrote.
The month-long ban - which does not cover trade or travel by air - was first imposed in March and has been rolled over several times as cases in the United States spike. The current range of restrictions runs out on Aug 21.
A U.S. official briefed on the matter said the measures could last several more months depending on the progression of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 165,000 Americans.
The premiers of several major Canadian provinces say they want to keep out U.S. tourists until there is clear evidence the coronavirus outbreak south of the border is under control. 
A July 17 poll by Ipsos-Reid said 85% of Canadians think the land border should stay closed until at least the end of 2020. 
Last month Canada tightened its rules for foreign travelers who must transit to get to Alaska after several U.S. citizens were fined for making detours to sightsee.
The United States and Mexico agreed to similar clamp down on the border. Mexico has told the U.S. government that it supports extending restrictions for an additional month, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday.

Mexico has recorded over half a million official coronavirus cases and 55,000 deaths while Canada has had more success. The total number of Canadian cases is 121,234, with 9,015 deaths.

The Datafolha poll found that 37% of those surveyed viewed his government as great or good, compared with 32% in June, while his rejection rate has dropped 10 points to 34% who see his government as bad or terrible.
Bolsonaro has faced criticism for rejecting social distancing and lockdowns to curb the pandemic, which has yet to reach its peak in Brazil.
Datafolha said the poll show his main gains have been in the poorer and most vulnerable sectors of Brazilian society that have received emergency aid to make up for lost incomes.
Bolsonaro, who has recovered from a bout with COVID-19, welcomed the poll numbers and joked on Twitter: ""Truth, half truth or fake News? Good morning, all.""
His spike in popularity comes as the government has been making emergency 600 reais monthly payments to low-paid and informal workers totaling more than 250 billion reais ($47 billion). The government is considering extending the payments as they expire in September.
Datafolha said the emergency relief program made the most impact on Bolsonaro's approval standing in Northeast Brazil, a traditionally poor region where voters could decide his re-election chances in 2022. The president's negative numbers have dropped to 35% from 52% in the region.
Datafolha pollster Mauro Paulino said three in five of the percentage point gain in Bolsonaro's approval came from low-income informal workers who were the target of the emergency relief payments.
Brazil is suffering the world's worst coronavirus outbreak after the United States, with 3.2 million confirmed cases and 105,463 deaths.

Datafolha interviewed 2,065 people August 11-12, and the poll has a margin of error of two percentage points up or down.

The deputy civil protection minister said the limit on public gatherings would last until Aug. 24 and be imposed in parts of the country where infection numbers have risen.
Earlier, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis urged young people to wear masks, reminding them that they are not invulnerable to the novel coronavirus and could unwittingly infect their own families.
Recent data has shown COVID-19 infections have started to spread among lower age groups, Mitsotakis said, and he urged those returning from vacation to large urban centres to wear masks.
""No measures can substitute for personal responsibility, particularly that of young people to protect their parents and grandparents,"" Deputy Civil Protection Minister Nikos Hardalias said.
Greece reported 262 new infections on Wednesday, its highest daily tally since the start of the outbreak in the country. Another 204 cases were reported on Thursday.
That brings the total number of infections in Greece to 6,381 since late February, with 216 deaths.
The jump in infections has led the authorities gradually to introduce more restrictions at the peak of the tourism season.
Hardalias said restaurants and bars will not be allowed to operate after midnight in the greater Athens area and in other parts of the country including Crete, the islands of Paros, Santorini, Rhodes, Kos, Antiparos and Zakynthos.
Mask wearing will also be mandatory at refugee camps and military facilities.

Greece has also said visitors arriving from Sweden, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic must show proof that they have tested negative for the coronavirus before they can enter the country.

Student groups have rallied almost daily around the country since July 18, calling for an end to military influence over Thai politics after a disputed election last year kept junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister five years after he first took power in a 2014 army coup.
Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak, 22, was arrested on the outskirts of Bangkok while traveling to a protest, a video posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page showed.
""I would like to invite you to go to the investigating officers responsible for this case,"" said a man who identified himself as a member of the Bangkok Metropolitan Police in the video, citing a court's arrest warrant before at least four other men physically carried Parit into a car.
The video was apparently shot by a friend of Parit's and posted to his page.
""We can hold him for 48 hours for questioning,"" Police Major General Somprasong Yentuam, deputy Bangkok police chief, told reporters. 
""Once we are done, we will take him to a court to request for pre-trial detention,"" he said.
Somprasong said Parit will be charged for breaching internal security by ""raising unrest and disaffection,"" as well as for breaching coronavirus regulations banning public gatherings by helping organise a demonstration on July 18.
Human Rights Watch said the charges should be dropped and he should be immediately released.
Police on Friday also asked a court to revoke the bail for human rights lawyer Anon Nampa, 35 and student activist Panupong Jadnok, 23, whom they arrested on the same charges as Parit last week, Human Rights Watch said.
Prime Minister Prayuth has appealed for unity in light of the student-led protests, and said the government has been restrained with the protesters.

The student protest groups plan to stage a large protest on Sunday to intensify their demand to reform the military-backed constitution and call for new elections.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Landslides triggered by heavy rain swept away dozens of houses and killed at least 16 people in mountainous villages of Nepal on Friday and many people were missing, a home ministry official said.
Nepal suffers flash floods and landslides during the June-September rainy season, resulting in loss of life and property every year.
A massive landslide swept away dozens of houses, killing at least 10 people, early on Friday in Sindhupalshowk, near the capital Kathmandu, ministry official Murari Wasti said.
He said 28 people were missing.
“Rescue work has been hampered by continuous rain and mud still falling from the hills,” Wasti told Reuters.
Six people, aged between 10 and 19, were killed in remote Kalikot in far west Nepal - four of them from the same family.
Floods and landslides have so far killed 215 people this year, while 85 are missing, according to official data.
Dibya Raj Poudel, of the Nepal Red Cross Society, said 40,000 people had been housed in temporary huts or were staying with relatives or friends.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Angry Palestinians in Jerusalem accused the United Arab Emirates of collaborating with Israel and endangering Al-Aqsa mosque - Islam's third-holiest site - as they gathered for Friday prayers the day after the Gulf state's deal with Israel. 
Under an agreement brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, Israel and the UAE announced on Thursday that they will normalise diplomatic ties, brought together by a confluence of interests against Iran.
The deal also envisions giving Muslims greater access to Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque by allowing them to directly fly from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport.
This was greeted with dismay by Palestinian worshippers filing into the tree-lined hilltop compound in Jerusalem's walled Old City known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (Noble (NYSE:NE) Sanctuary) and to Jews as the Temple Mount.
""Our brothers in the Emirates put our blessed mosque in the grip of death,"" said Kamal Attoun, 60, an East Jerusalem Palestinian and Old City merchant. 
Asked if he would welcome Muslims from the Emirates or the Gulf under such circumstances, Attoun said: ""You've seen how collaborators from Saudi Arabia have been received in the past. The same fate awaits the Emiratis.""
He was referring to a pro-Israel Saudi internet influencer who was reportedly taunted as he walked through the Old City compound last year. 
Palestinians have long sought East Jerusalem, where the Old City is located, as capital of a future state and have looked to Arab nations to defend that stance. If they normalise ties with Israel, Palestinians fear losing any chance of future sovereignty in the city and guaranteed access to Al Aqsa mosque. 
Mohammad al-Sharif, 45, a member of Israel's Arab minority, said he would not hold it against ordinary Muslims from the Gulf ""because their rulers made a mistake"". 
But he was scathing about their leaders. 
""Collaboration with the UAE is worse, a hundred times worse than collaborating with Israel. That Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed and his dirty dogs look out for themselves and their interests and the rest of us can go to hell,"" he said, referring to Abu Dhabi's crown prince.
The top Islamic official in Jerusalem, Sheikh Abdul-Azim Salhab of the Islamic Waqf, told Reuters he does ""not accept the blessed Al-Aqsa mosque to be the subject of political bickering. It is higher than this tug-of-war.""
Condemnation also came from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose spokesman on Thursday read out a statement from the leadership on Palestinian television calling the deal a ""betrayal of Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa and the Palestinian cause"".
Palestinians across Gaza and the occupied West Bank rallied on Friday against the deal. Protesters in the city of Nablus burned effigies of Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed.
ISRAELIS DELIGHTED
Meanwhile, Israel embraced the deal, with the country's biggest-selling daily, Yedioth Ahronoth, calling it a ""bold breakthrough"".
Some analysts said Netanyahu risked angering his supporters by walking back pledges to annex land in the West Bank - territory sought by Palestinians for a state - so as to do a deal with an Arab Gulf country. 
""He gained a few points with the centre-left, which loves agreements with Arabs, but he lost many more points with his base of right-wing voters,"" wrote Ben Caspit in Maariv. 
Netanyahu, dogged by an ongoing corruption trial and criticised for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, has hailed the agreement as a personal success in integrating Israel in the Middle East. 
On his Arabic-language Twitter account he credited Israel's foreign intelligence service Mossad with helping to clinch the deal. 

Under spy chief Yossi Cohen, Netanyahu said, the Mossad helped develop Israel's relations with the Gulf and ""ripen the peace agreement with the Emirates"".

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel talked of ""history"" and Palestinians of ""betrayal"" after Thursday's surprise announcement of a deal to normalise relations between the Jewish state and the United Arab Emirates.
In a nationwide televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal would lead to ""full and formal peace"" with the Gulf Arab state and voiced hope that other countries in the region would follow the UAE's example.
Netanyahu said it also entailed acceding to a request from U.S. President Donald Trump to ""temporarily wait"" on implementing the Israeli leader's pledge to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.
""It’s an incomparably exciting moment, a historic moment for peace in the Middle East,"" Netanyahu said.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose officials seemed to be taken by surprise, issued an unusually strong condemnation of a regional Arab neighbour and instructed the Palestinian ambassador to the UAE to return immediately.
“The Palestinian leadership rejects and denounces the UAE, Israeli and U.S. trilateral, surprising, announcement,” said Abbas's spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
Reading a statement on Palestinian television, Abu Rudeineh said the leadership regarded the UAE's move as ""a betrayal"".
The statement urged the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to assemble to ""reject"" the deal, adding ""neither the UAE nor any other party has the right to speak in the name of the Palestinian people.""
The deal provides a diplomatic achievement for Netanyahu after weeks of domestic criticism over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the economy, but also angered right-wing Israeli settlers who want to annex the West Bank.
Netanyahu said that while he had promised to apply Israeli sovereignty to areas, including Jewish settlements, in the territory, which Palestinians seek for a future state, he had made clear he first needed a green light from Washington.
""He deceived us. He has deceived half a million residents of the area and hundreds of thousands of voters,"" said David Elhayani, head of the Yesha Council of settlers. 
PRO-ISRAEL STANCE 
Abbas, who heads the Palestinian Authority and the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization, has refused all political dealings with the Trump administration for more than two years, accusing it of taking a consistently pro-Israel stance.
Hanan Ashrawi, a veteran Palestinian negotiator, told Reuters: “We were blindsided. Their secret dealings are now completely out in the open. It is a complete sell-out.”
Much use was made of the word ""normalisation"" - a term that has very different connotations on either side. 
For Israel and the White House it signified a welcome rapprochement with a key Gulf player in a region from which Israel has long been isolated, aside from two peace treaties with its immediate neighbours Egypt and Jordan. 
But for many Palestinians and Arabs in other countries, the word has overwhelmingly negative connotations.
In Gaza, Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for Hamas, told Reuters: “Normalisation is a stab in the back of the Palestinian cause, and it serves only the Israeli occupation.” 
In a rare show of unity, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh spoke to Abbas by phone to convey his ""absolute rejection"" of the deal, Hamas officials said.
There was no official reaction or media coverage in Saudi Arabia, but some Saudis tweeted under hashtags “normalization is treason”, “UAE” and “Israel.”

Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group’s Supreme Revolutionary Committee, said the deal was a betrayal of the Palestinian cause and of pan-Arabism.

LONDON (Reuters) - Libya's sovereign wealth fund head plans to ask the United Nations to allow it to invest billions of dollars sitting idle in its accounts, after missing out on some $4.1 billion in potential equity returns during nearly a decade of sanctions.
The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) was blacklisted in March 2011 because it was then controlled by the family of toppled ruler Muammar Gaddafi. Its assets were valued at $67 billion in 2012, but LIA plans to update that in October after a review by its financial adviser Deloitte.
Sanctions have had a heavy toll on the LIA, with investment curbs meaning it had missed out on around $4.1 billion in potential returns if it had invested in line with the market average, chairman Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed told Reuters.
The LIA also wanted to avoid negative interest rate charges, which had cost it around $23 million since 2011, he said.
""We have billions of cash in our accounts not invested,"" Mohamed said in an interview this week. ""It would be much better to take advantage of the market situation and invest at this moment.""
Libya had previously asked the U.N. Security Council to approve a sanctions exemption for the LIA in 2016, but this request was turned down as the U.N. wanted to see a stable government in place before doing so.
Although the LIA is not pushing for a full rollback, it is aiming to apply to the U.N. Sanctions Committee for adjustments to enable it to invest, via a custodian, some of the $12.7 billion frozen cash held by its investment managers. 
This includes some of the proceeds from 796 bond holdings, with a value of $4.8 billion, that have matured since 2011.
Any investments the LIA tried to make at present were hampered by a lengthy process that required it to gain approval from the sanctions committee as well as within Libya.
""It is time consuming and investment decisions are time sensitive,"" Mohamed said.
Market volatility during the coronavirus crisis has hit the LIA, cutting the value of its stock holdings by about 5% and prompting a potential debt restructuring for some of its hundreds of subsidiaries.
Libya slipped into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of Gaddafi and has been split since 2014, with an internationally recognised government controlling the capital Tripoli and the northwest of the country, while military leader Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi rules the east.
""We are an independent sovereign wealth fund and have nothing to do with political conflicts within the country right now,"" he said. ""This fund is owned by all Libyans and we work for all Libyans.""

The government supervises the LIA through the board of trustees, he said. It aims to improve its governance in line with other sovereign funds by the end of 2020, including complying with the Santiago Principles and appointing an external auditor to review its financial results, he added.

Two cities in China on Thursday found the virus in frozen chicken wings imported from Brazil and shrimp from Ecuador, raising public concern even though the World Health Organization downplayed the risk of the virus entering the food chain.
Shanghai resident Wang Chao said he would go for more local foods now. ""I won't choose imported products, because right now the epidemic situation abroad is more serious than in China."" 
The coronavirus emerged in China late last year but the country is seen to have largely brought it under control, with the focus shifting to prevent localised outbreaks and cases imported from abroad. 
Fears of the risks from imported frozen food first arose when the virus was found on a chopping board in Beijing's Xinfadi wholesale market in June. The vendor had used the board to handle imported salmon. 
Austin Hu, the chef at high-end Shanghai restaurant Heritage by Madison, said they experienced delays in receiving live seafood like oysters after the incident as authorities stepped up checks, adding that consumer confidence had been affected. 
""It has been more difficult, I mean especially seafood we are talking about, since the incidents with shrimps and incidents with salmon,"" he said. 
When asked about imports from Brazil on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said authorities were engaging with the relevant country, and did not comment on whether imports would be restricted. 
Still, other shoppers said that they were placing their trust in the authorities and in food sellers. 
""We need to be careful, but I think the food should be safe if they put it out,"" said a man who only gave his surname as Lei. ""If they are selling it, then it should not have problems.""

LONDON/RESSONS-SUR-MATZ, France (Reuters) - Britons rushed to get back from summer holidays in France on Friday after their government said it would soon impose a 14-day quarantine on travellers from across the Channel due to rising coronavirus infections.
Britain's government announced late on Thursday that it would impose a quarantine from 0300 GMT on Saturday on arrivals from France, giving an estimated 160,000 UK holidaymakers there just over 24 hours to try to get home to avoid isolating. 
The sudden rule change dealt a fresh blow to tourists, airlines and tour operators all hoping for holidays after the pandemic, which has left many travel groups cash-strapped and facing an uncertain future. 
Many British tourists headed towards the French port of Calais hoping to catch a ferry or a shuttle train home in time.
""We've changed our plans when we heard the news last night. We decided to head back home a day early to miss the quarantine,"" one British woman at a service station on the motorway to Calais told Reuters.
During their week's camping holiday in the south of France, her family had met fewer people than on a typical day in their hometown of Guildford, southern England, she added.
The new quarantine rules apply to France, the second most popular holiday destination for Britons, the Netherlands and the Mediterranean island of Malta, transport minister Grant Shapps said.
Spain, the favourite holiday destination for Britons, came under British government quarantine rules on July 26.
France warned it would reciprocate, causing further headaches for airlines which might have to cancel yet more flights, meaning fresh financial pain and denying them the August recovery for which they'd hoped. 
Airline and travel shares tumbled. British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) was down 6% and easyJet (LON:EZJ), which said it would operate its full schedule for the coming days, fell 7%.
TIGHTENING QUARANTINE 
When Europe first went into lockdown in March, Britain was criticised for not restricting arrivals from abroad. But since June, it has introduced strict quarantine rules for arrivals from countries with infection rates above a certain level. 
The tightening quarantine for foreign travel, however, contrasts with the easing of rules at home, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered the reopening of the economy to resume, weeks after pausing it.
Shapps denied that the policies were contradictory, saying that the aim was to keep the reproduction rate of infection under one. 
""Being able to open up some of those things but having to close down travel corridors elsewhere is all part of the same thing,"" he told BBC Radio. 
Shapps said he sympathised with travellers but that they should not be entirely surprised, given the fluid situation around the pandemic.
""Where we see countries breach a certain level of cases ... then we have no real choice but to act,"" he told Sky News.
He ruled out any special assistance for holidaymakers, saying they knew the risks before travelling, with a possible quarantine to France having been rumoured for weeks.
Airlines UK, an industry body representing BA, easyJet and Ryanair, called on Britain to implement more targeted quarantines on the regions with the highest infection rates and to bring in a testing regime. 

An EU study showed that imported cases of COVID typically only account for a small share of infections when a pandemic is at its peak, but are more significant once a country has the disease under control.

Air accidents are relatively common in Congo because of lax safety standards and poor maintenance. All Congolese commercial carriers are banned from operating in the European Union.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - One in five prisoners at the largest jail in Indian Kashmir has tested positive for the coronavirus, authorities said on Friday, as the health ministry reported a daily nationwide rise of more than 60,000 cases for the third straight day.
India is the world's third worst-hit country, behind only the United States and Brazil, with more than 2.4 million confirmed coronavirus cases, according to a Reuters tally.
And numbers are expected to rise in coming weeks, as infections move deeper into the vast hinterland.
Authorities at the central jail in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar said they were preparing to shift some prisoners after 102 of the 480 tested positive.
""We are taking extra care and all new entrants are being tested and then quarantined for two weeks,"" V.K. Singh, Kashmir's Additional Director General of Prisons, told Reuters.
The Kashmir valley has reported more than 20,000 cases, of which nearly 5,500 people remain currently infected.
Racked by a decades-long insurgency, Kashmir is claimed in whole by India and neighbouring foe Pakistan but ruled in part by each.
Indian-ruled Kashmir has been put under a cycle of coronavirus-related lockdowns since late March. But cases are continuing to rise, putting pressure on medical infrastructure, doctors said.
Dr Nisarul Hassan, an associate professor at Srinagar's Government Medical College that has around 2,200 beds, of which some 350 are for COVID-19 patients, said resources were stretched.
""Our hospitals are full with COVID-19 patients. We are running out of oxygen beds,"" he said, ""Patients have to wait for ventilators as there are not enough of them.""
Like many other Indian cities, Srinagar's administration has also converted some buildings into temporary coronavirus facilities adding 3,000 beds, with another 2,000 beds in the pipeline.

Homosexuality is legal in China, which until 2001 had classified it as a mental disorder. However same-sex marriage is not recognized and concerns over stigma still dissuades people from coming out to their families.
""ShanghaiPRIDE regrets to announce that we are cancelling all upcoming activities and taking a break from scheduling any future events,"" it said late on Thursday in a statement on its official WeChat account.
ShanghaiPRIDE gave no reason for the decision. Social distancing restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic have largely been lifted in Shanghai after a sharp drop in cases nationwide.
The group's co-founder Charlene Liu said in a separate statement posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that ""the decision was difficult to make but we have to protect the safety of all involved,"" without providing further details. 
The group began in 2009 and over the past decade has staged forums, parties and events aimed at increasing public awareness about China's LGBT community. It held its annual Pride festival in June, which included a run in which over a 100 people participated.
ShanghaiPRIDE's announcement was widely discussed on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), with the topic viewed over 17 million times. 

""I feel regret, sadness, anger and helplessness,"" said one user.

The strongman nationalist Orban has extended his Fidesz party's influence over all walks of Hungarian life over the course of three landslide election victories since 2010, benefiting from a fragmented and divided opposition.
In municipal elections last fall, however, opposition parties fielded joint candidates in many districts around the country and upset Fidesz in key constituencies, including for the mayor of the capital Budapest. 
The new mayor of Budapest said his victory, based on a primary contest and then a joint effort by all opposition parties, was a blueprint to challenge Orban.
Recent polls indicate that about half of all active voters support Orban and half want an opposition victory. That count does not include undecided voters, who represent about a third of those eligible to vote and could sway the race.
""The opposition parties have heard their voters and party chairs today began official consultations to prepare for the 2022 parliamentary election,"" the parties said in identical statements.
They will field joint candidates in all 106 constituencies, establish a joint programme and govern together if they succeed, they said.

CHEONAN, South Korea (Reuters) - President Moon Jae-in vowed on Friday to spotlight the plight of South Korea's last few surviving ""comfort women"", as those forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels are known, in efforts to resolve a dispute with its neighbour over the thorny issue.
The comments figured in a recorded message to a 100-strong gathering of activists, government officials, and others in the city of Cheonan to commemorate the victims of Japanese wartime sexual violence.
It was the third such memorial day, instituted by Moon's government in 2018, after effectively abandoning a 2015 pact between Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Moon's predecessor that had aimed for compensation for the women and an apology.
""The most important principle of resolving the problem is 'victim-centrism',"" Moon, who has called the deal flawed for failing to fully reflect the desires of the survivors, said in Friday's remarks.
The event was held on a smaller scale than some in the past, hit by worries over the spread of the coronavirus, recent heavy rain, and a finance scandal in the activist community.
Lee Yong-soo, one of those prominent among the surviving comfort women, whose numbers have dwindled to just 17 now, urged survivors not to lose heart over the scandal.
""Don’t be angry,"" said Lee, speaking from a wheelchair. ""There are people who are making efforts to resolve the (comfort women) issue. Please keep them healthy and give them happiness.""
Lee, who has accused the longtime leader of an activist group of politically and financially exploiting victims, called for a halt to its weekly protest rallies outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul.
The group's former leader, Yoon Mi-hyang, has denied any wrongdoing but apologised for causing controversy.
Ties between Seoul and Tokyo have long been strained by disputes dating from Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korea peninsula.
Last year Japan put curbs on exports of high-tech materials to South Korea after a court in its neighbour ordered Japanese firms to pay compensation to Koreans forced to work for them during the war. 
Relations with Japan are expected to figure once again in an independence day speech by Moon set for Saturday.

The day is also the anniversary of the end of World War Two, when Abe is expected to send a ritual offering to Japan's Yasukuni Shrine, where wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal are honoured along with war dead, though avoiding a personal visit.

The protests in Belarus pose the biggest challenge yet to strongman President Alexander Lukashenko's 26-year rule. The protesters accuse Lukashenko of rigging last Sunday's presidential election to win a sixth term.
""We have already reviewed the law, so as to also be prepared for a possible wave of people who want to get to the territory of the EU,"" Przydacz told the Catholic radio station Siodma9.
""You need to consider support for people who need to pass the border quickly, but we must be responsible for our European partners, that is, the Schengen border.""
He gave no details. Because Poland belongs to the European Union's Schengen area, anyone who enters legally from Belarus can travel freely within the other 25 Schengen countries.
EU foreign ministers will on Friday discuss their response to the crackdown, and diplomats and officials say new sanctions are likely to be imposed later this month.
Andrej Babis, prime minister of the Czech Republic, Poland's southwestern neighbour, said on Friday that Belarus must rerun its election with foreign observers present.
Polish President's Andrzej Duda's top aide Andrzej Dera made a similar demand.
""If Belarus wants to move towards democracy, these elections should be repeated,"" Dera told the private broadcaster TVN24, according to the state news agency PAP.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki is due to publish a plan on Friday to help Belarus, whose 9.5 million people include between 300,000 and 1.2 million of Polish origin, according to different estimates.
Poland's conservative-nationalist government has in the past argued that security concerns required it to prevent refugees entering.
Critics say it has shirked its humanitarian responsibilities, exploiting anti-migrant European feeling and pandering to populist sentiment.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian hospitals are stockpiling drugs and protective kits and putting in place contingency plans amid a continuing spike in new COVID-19 infections that has forced the capital Brussels to make face masks compulsory in public spaces.
With nearly 10,000 deaths linked to the coronavirus so far, Belgium with a population of 11 million has one of the world's highest death rates from COVID-19 per head.
New infections have risen steadily in recent weeks, with Belgium now reporting one of the highest number of cases per inhabitants of any European country and prompting fears of a second wave.
In March and April when the pandemic accelerated, Belgian hospitals struggled with a shortage of equipment and with administrative hurdles. 
They have learned their lesson since then, said chief physician Michel Dewever at the Delta Hospital in Brussels, which has 500 doctors and 500 beds and is part of the Chirec Hospital Group.
""We have stocked up on curare, anesthetics and antibiotics that allow us to last for two or three months during any second wave that might arise,"" he said. 
""We have built up a stock of protective equipment for all the staff, whether it be gloves, gowns or masks. We received part of this inventory from the government. We also bought part of it,"" Dewever said.
The Group has amassed 20,000 masks, 700,000 gloves, 50,000 single use aprons and 5,000 reusable aprons.

Delta Hospital's contingency plan includes making more beds in the intensive care unit available for COVID-19 patients.

Western governments have rarely criticised Uzbekistan since President Shavkat Mirziyoyev came to power in late 2016, praising him for opening up the previously isolated nation of 34 million and releasing some prominent dissidents from prison.
But the U.S. ambassador to Tashkent, Daniel Rosenblum, said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the case of Bobomurod Abdullayev, who was detained this month in Kyrgyzstan at Uzbekistan's request.
Abdullayev has told Kyrgyz media he was accused of being behind an anonymous Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account which published allegations of corruption among senior Uzbek officials. Uzbekistan is now seeking his extradition.
""The governments of both Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan should respect Mr. Abdullayev’s freedom of movement and allow him to depart the Kyrgyz Republic to his destination of choice,"" Rosenblum tweeted late on Thursday.
""President Mirziyoyev spoke eloquently about media freedom and journalists’ rights in his Constitution Day speech last December, and many times since. The U.S. agrees that a free and independent media is indispensable to a functioning democracy.""
Abdullayev came to prominence in a landmark case in 2018 when an Uzbek court cleared him of charges of conspiring against the government, although he was still sentenced to community service for anti-government propaganda.
His case highlighted the thaw initiated under Mirziyoyev following the 27-year rule of his predecessor Islam Karimov who had tolerated no dissent and whose poor human rights record had drawn strong criticism from Western countries.
Mirziyoyev became president in 2016 after Karimov's death.

SRINAGAR (Reuters) - Militants attacked a police team in Kashmir on Friday, killing two officers and wounding one despite tight security in the disputed Muslim-majority region ahead of India's Independence Day.
A group of militants opened fire on the police team that was on duty in the Nowgam area of Srinagar city, the chief of police in Kashmir, Vijay Kumar, told Reuters.
""We had inputs that militants may carry out attack and were alert,"" said Kumar. ""They came through a narrow lane and fired indiscriminately.""
He said the militants had been identified and vowed to ""neutralize them"" soon. The area had been cordoned off searches were going on, he said.
The attack comes days after the first anniversary of the revocation of Kashmir's constitutional autonomy, a reform the Indian government said would promote the region's development by drawing it closer to the rest of the country.
But many people in Kashmir saw the loss of special autonomy as another step in the erosion of the rights of Muslims by the Hindu-nationalist government. The government rejects that.
Kashmir has been disputed by India and neighbouring Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Both countries claim it in full but rule it in part.
More than 50,000 people have been killed in more than three decades of insurgency in Kashmir that India accuses Pakistan of fuelling by supporting Muslim militant groups fighting India's security forces in its part of the divided region.
Pakistan says it only offers political support to its fellow Muslims in the Himalayan region.

The declaration, made in a government decree, follows a sharp increase in COVID-19 infections in France over the past two weeks.
On Thursday, France reported more than 2,500 new COVID-19 infections for the second day in a row, levels last seen in mid-April when the country was in the middle of one of Europe's strictest lockdowns. 
The government move gives local authorities in Paris and the Bouches-du-Rhone area powers to limit the circulation of people and vehicles, restrict access to public transport and air travel, limit access to public buildings and close restaurants, bars and other establishments.
Paris and Marseille had in recent days already made the wearing of face masks mandatory in busy public areas. 
Late on Thursday Britain said it would impose a 14-day quarantine on all arrivals from France from Saturday because of the spike in infection rates.
The Netherlands and four other countries were also added to the UK quarantine list that already included Spain and Belgium. 

Making Paris and Marseilles red zones could have a major impact on tourism, as it could lead other countries to impose quarantines on their citizens returning from those areas.

Doctors wearing yellow memorial ribbons gathered at a hospital in northern Taipei as the body of Lee, a committed Christian who died last month at 97, was driven downtown, past the presidential office and on to the Chi-Nan Presbyterian Church.
Senior government officials, including top security official Wellington Koo, stood outside the presidential office in tribute to Lee as the hearse passed by.
""Thank you, former President Lee,"" President Tsai Ing-wen wrote on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. ""We will continue to protect democratic Taiwan."" 
Family and friends attended a service at the church before the cremation. A formal state funeral is still being organised, however, and a final resting place has yet to be announced.
Lee, who was president from 1988 to 2000, championed Taiwan's separate identity from China, which claims the island as its own territory, angering Beijing.
At a memorial hall near the presidential office, people have been leaving messages of condolence for Lee, though not everyone remembered him fondly.
Police had detained one person for throwing red paint at a picture of Lee at the hall, the presidential office said on Friday.

KABUL (Reuters) - The Afghan government has begun releasing the last Taliban prisoners from a final batch of 400 who the militants want freed before they agree to start peace negotiations, a security agency spokesman said on Friday. 
The government agreed on Sunday to release the 400 ""hard-core"" prisoners after consulting a grand assembly of elders and other community leaders, known as a Loya Jirga. 
""The government ... yesterday released 80 Taliban convicts out of the 400 that the Consultative Loya Jirga sanctioned for release to speed up efforts for direct talks and a lasting, nationwide ceasefire,"" said Javid Faisal, spokesman for the National Security Council. 
He did not say when the remaining 320 would be set free. 
Disagreement over the release of the prisoners, who include some of those accused in connection with some of Afghanistan's bloodiest attacks, has delayed negotiations for months as the United States withdraws troops under a deal signed with the Taliban in February.
President Ashraf Ghani on Monday issued a decree to release the final batch of prisoners. 
The Taliban did not immediately respond to request for comment. They have previously said they would sit down for peace talks with the U.S.-backed government in Qatar within a week of the release of the last of the prisoners.
The Taliban have always refused to talk to the government, dismissing it as a U.S. ""puppet"".

But they agreed to power-sharing talks under the deal struck with the United States, on the withdrawal of its troops in exchange for Taliban security guarantees.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - In an Italian bistro in an upmarket Johannesburg neighbourhood, smiling patrons chat at candle-lit tables in a scene reminiscent of less-troubled times before the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But there's no alcohol on the menu. Instead, diners order red or white ""coffee"" served in grey mugs, the tell-tale sign of a modern-day South African speakeasy.
Under one of the world's strictest lockdowns, South Africa banned alcohol to lower hospital admissions for injuries from drink-related violence and accidents and ease the burden on healthworkers facing the worst coronavirus outbreak in Africa.
But businesses from wine makers to restaurants to informal taverns say the ban is costing jobs at a time when the economy is on its knees and President Cyril Ramaphosa is coming under pressure to end the prohibition as infection rates fall.
""Am I happy with what I'm doing? No,"" said the bistro owner, who asked not to be named, adding that alcohol sales had saved him from firing half a dozen staff. ""They've turned everybody into criminals.""
Restaurant workers, among the hardest hit by layoffs, protested last month calling for the right to sell alcohol while lobby group Agri SA said the ban had cost the wine industry 3.3 billion rand ($189 million) and 117,000 jobs.
Local media reported this week that the government body charged with managing the health crisis has recommended loosening lockdown restrictions and that has fueled speculation the ban might be lifted, possibly as soon as this weekend.
The presidency did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
'NON-ALCOHOLIC?'
Introduced in March, restrictions on alcohol sales have spawned a thriving underground industry, complete with bootleggers and online traders offering doorstep delivery.
More recently, as authorities allowed sit-down dining to resume, some restaurants have joined the illicit trade.
Just doors down from the Italian bistro, Reuters found at least two more restaurants flouting the ban, seating drinkers in back rooms or serving wine in bottles labelled ""non-alcoholic"". 
According to statistics through July, South African police had arrested over 6,000 people on charges related to the ban.
But with alcohol now so readily available to thirsty South Africans, some question whether the measure is still enforceable - and bootleggers who once thrived under the ban are taking a hit to their business.
""A lot of people have their own contacts now,"" one 27-year-old bootlegger told Reuters.
As the underground trade flourishes, however, legitimate businesses complain they are paying the price.
Since the ban came in, Dutch beer maker Heineken (OTC:HEINY) has dropped plans to build a new 6 billion rand ($345 million) brewery while Anheuser-Busch InBev's South African Breweries has postponed a 5 billion rand investment.
In recession even before the pandemic, South Africa's economy is now set to contract by more than 7% this year with a unemployment rate above 30%.
The growing economic fallout, coupled with indications the outbreak may be receding, have piled pressure on President Ramaphosa to end the prohibition.
""Illicit alcohol trading is shooting through the roof and government is losing billions in tax and excise income,"" Mihlali Xhala, head of the corporate chamber of Agri SA, said in a statement this week. ""If our main priority is economic recovery, this is definitely not helping."" 
'TRAUMA CARNAGE AS USUAL'
South Africa has recorded more than 560,000 coronavirus cases and more than 10,700 deaths, by far the highest recorded total on the African continent. Daily new cases have now fallen to their lowest level since mid-June.
But despite progress in curbing the spread of the disease, some experts warn that repealing the alcohol ban risks eroding the benefits that have allowed the health system to cope. 
""Going back to business as usual will go back to trauma carnage as usual,"" said Professor Leslie London, head of public heath medicine at the University of Cape Town.
Before the lockdown, alcohol-related cases accounted for roughly 40% of hospital trauma admissions, according to the South African Medical Research Council. 
In the two months after the ban was introduced, the health department in Western Cape province - an early epicentre of the virus - recorded a 40% to 50% drop in trauma cases.
""It substantially removed an unnecessary burden on the health services, which enabled hospitals to ready themselves for COVID-19. There is no dispute possible about that,"" said the University of Cape Town's London.
Four months into the lockdown, however, some South Africans now say they too need relief.
""You're locked up in one space,"" said one drinker, who asked not be named, served wine from a bottle labelled ""non-alcoholic"" at a tapas bar down the road from the Italian bistro. 
""The main reason for buying alcohol is just to kind of regain some of those moments of just letting loose.""

834,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 12:09AM ET</span>",How the Beirut Explosion Will Worsen Lebanon’s Crises,"(Bloomberg) --
Lebanon is no stranger to turmoil and devastation. The small country straddles the geopolitical fault lines of the Middle East and endured a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. It’s also notorious for graft and mismanagement. In the latest blow, a massive blast ripped through the port in its capital, Beirut, on Aug. 4, killing more than 170 people, injuring thousands more and damaging buildings across the city. Officials have said it was caused by the detonation of a 2,750-ton stockpile of ammonium nitrate stored there, equal to 1,800 tons of TNT. The tragedy piled yet another layer of hardship on a country already reeling from its worst financial crisis in decades and struggling to contain a burgeoning coronavirus outbreak.
1. How will this affect the economy?
The badly damaged port facility, which was slowly resuming operations by Aug. 12, is Lebanon’s largest maritime gateway, and while the second-biggest port Tripoli has been designated as the alternative, authorities are worried how the import-dependent country will bring in badly needed food, medical supplies and other goods. Lebanon has already been struggling under the weight of its economic meltdown, with the rapid devaluation of the local currency and a volatile exchange rate on the black market fueling inflation, shuttering businesses and plunging many people into unemployment and poverty. Fuel shortages and bread lines have become common.
2. What’s happened to the government?
Prime Minister Hassan Diab’s government resigned on Aug. 10 as an outraged public demanded accountability for the nation’s biggest peacetime catastrophe. He blamed a corrupt political elite for sabotaging his administration and pledged punishment for those responsible. Diab’s predecessor, Saad Hariri, who governed for three years until January 2020, has said he doesn’t want to be prime minister again at this point. At least 20 people were in custody as of Aug. 13, including the current and former general managers of the Lebanese Customs and port officials. State prosecutors have questioned ranking security personnel, and finance and public-works ministers in office since the ammonium nitrate was unloaded at the port in late 2013 were also to be quizzed.
3. How serious is the social unrest?
Citizens already fed up with government mismanagement were furious that the blast originated from a stockpile of explosive materials left for six years at the port despite repeated safety warnings. On the weekend following the disaster, thousands gathered outside parliament calling for the removal of the ruling elite, in one instance briefly occupying several government buildings. Since then, dozens have been gathering daily, rioting and throwing rocks.
4. What help is Lebanon getting?
President Michel Aoun has estimated damage from the explosion at $15 billion, money the bankrupt government can’t afford. World leaders pledged almost $300 million in emergency support for the Lebanese people at a virtual donors’ conference on Aug. 9, and pledged to bring together “major resources” within weeks to address Beirut’s needs. They also urged Lebanon’s government to enact deep reforms to unlock broader financial support for the country’s battered economy. The United Nations World Food Program has promised 50,000 tons of wheat flour, enough to supply Lebanon for three months.
5. What needs to be done about the debt?
After defaulting on a Eurobond repayment in March 2020, Lebanon embarked on talks with the International Monetary Fund for a loan of some $10 billion to help rescue its economy. It is also trying to overhaul its debt stock of $90 billion, which, at 170% of gross domestic product, makes Lebanon one of the most indebted countries in the world. In a strongly worded statement at the end of the donors’ conference, IMF director Kristalina Georgieva said months of talks had “yet to yield results” as politicians and bankers remained divided over what needed to be done. She set out four conditions including restoring the financial solvency of the state, cutting losses at state-owned companies, passing a law to regulate capital outflows and setting up a social safety net, as requirements for talks to move forward.
6. How has the coronavirus complicated matters?
Apart from the huge political and economic challenges, Beirut also faces a public health crisis. The explosion put three major hospitals out of action and incapacitated more than two dozen clinics, hindering the health system’s ability to respond to a spike in Covid-19 cases. Lebanon had successfully prevented its spread through a mix of travel restrictions, school closures and lockdowns but cases had begun to rise rapidly in the weeks before the blast. As casualties from the explosion surged into hospitals, social distancing became impossible and masks and gloves were often forgotten. Public hospitals have limited intensive care capacity and have at times been forced to turn off air conditioning and delay surgeries due to fuel shortages.

(Reuters) - The campaign of Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden has raised $48 million in the 48 hours since he named U.S. Senator Kamala Harris the Democratic vice presidential nominee, a campaign spokesman told Reuters late on Thursday.
Biden, a former vice president himself, on Tuesday picked Harris as his choice for VP, making her the first Black woman on a major-party U.S. presidential ticket.
With social unrest over racial injustice rocking the country for months since the death in custody of an African-American man, George Floyd - after a police officer knelt on his neck for about nine minutes - Biden was under pressure to select a Black woman as his running mate. 
Harris, a 55-year-old senator from California who made her own run for the White House, is also the first Asian-American on a major presidential ticket. Her parents were immigrants, her mother from India and her father from Jamaica.
She became only the second Black female U.S. senator in history when elected in 2016 and will be relied on to help mobilize African-Americans, the Democratic Party's most loyal constituency. 
Four years ago, the first dip in Black voter turnout in 20 years contributed to Democrat Hillary Clinton's upset loss to Donald Trump in the presidential election.
Harris, a former prosecutor and state attorney general in California, is known for her sometimes aggressive questioning style in the Senate.
As a presidential candidate, she took Biden to task in a nationally televised debate over his past stances on mandatory busing for students as a means to desegregate schools. 
The choice of a running mate has added significance for Biden, 77, who would be the oldest person to become president if he is elected. 
His age has led to speculation he will serve only one term, making Harris a potential top contender for the Democratic nomination in 2024.

Biden and groups affiliated to his campaign had raised $140 million in July.

LUBBOCK, Texas (Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Thursday sought to reassure parents he is doing all he can to keep students safe as most schools in the state prepare to reopen next week. 
But a top adviser to Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden's campaign in Texas blasted Abbott, a Republican, for what he called a lack of planning and funding for safely reopening schools, with the statewide coronavirus positivity rate hitting a record 24.5% this week. 
""What we learned from the reopening of the Texas economy is that if you don't do it right, people are going to die,"" said Mike Collier, senior adviser to the Biden campaign in Texas. ""Parents and teachers are being forced to make life and death decisions.""
Polls show Biden in a dead heat with President Donald Trump in Texas, long a Republican stronghold but where the Democratic Party made significant gains in the 2018 midterm election. How Abbott handles the pandemic and the reopening of schools could have a big impact on how voters cast ballots in November. 
Abbott defended his mandate giving local school boards the right to determine if and when schools reopen, curbing the power of local health officials to intervene and order schools closed if COVID-19 outbreaks occur. 
The Texas governor said schools are ready and argued that in-person classes would not be a significant spreader of the virus if schools follow basic safety precautions. 
""The ways that COVID-19 will most likely spread in the school setting is in gatherings after school is over,"" Abbott told a press conference in Lubbock. 
Abbott said people are spreading the virus in smaller, informal gatherings with friends and family. He encouraged parents and teachers to curtail gatherings of students.
He urged all Texans to remain vigilant on safety precautions as Labor Day weekend approaches. ""It's important people don't let their guard down like they did during Memorial Day weekend,"" which he said was a ""big spreading"" event in the state. 
LEAVE IT TO LOCALS
While Texas moves ahead with in-person classes, a group of parents and Republicans in California have gone to court seeking a reversal of Governor Gavin Newsom's order that schools in counties on the coronavirus ""watch list"" - which encompasses 90% of the state's population - stay shuttered this fall. 
""What we're seeking in the lawsuit is that the governor get out of the way and let local parents, local school boards and small schools make these decisions themselves,"" Harmeet Dhillon, Republican National Committee member from California and lawyer who brought the lawsuit, told a virtual press conference on Thursday. 
Marianne Bema, a plaintiff in the lawsuit who lives in Los Angeles with her three school-aged sons, said online learning in spring was disastrous for her children, and she does not make enough money to afford daycare if her children are not in school. 
Another plaintiff, Christine Ruiz of Santa Clarita, who also has three school-aged kids, said she was pleased with a hybrid model mixing in-person and online instruction their school originally had planned to roll out. 
""Now that choice has been taken away from us,"" Ruiz said. 
APPS, BATTLE ON MASKS
North Dakota, Wyoming and Alabama are the latest U.S. states launching apps to warn users about potential exposure to the novel coronavirus by tracking their encounters, representatives for the states told Reuters on Thursday.
Virginia last week became the first U.S. state to urge residents to download such an app using technology developed by smartphone software giants Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google.
In Georgia, Governor Brian Kemp said on Thursday he plans to drop a lawsuit against Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and the city, possibly ending a months-long feud over an order for people to wear masks to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Kemp had sued Bottoms and the city of Atlanta to stop enforcement of a local mask mandate arguing the city lacks the authority to override his order encouraging but not requiring face coverings.

MINSK (Reuters) - The Belarusian leadership began releasing thousands of detainees and issued a rare public apology on Thursday in a bid to quell nationwide street protests that pose the biggest challenge to strongman President Alexander Lukashenko's 26-year rule. 
Hundreds of friends and relatives, many of them in tears, stood outside a detention centre in Minsk waiting to give food, water and blankets to people emerging from inside in the early hours of Friday. 
Some of the protesters had bruises and described being tightly packed inside cells and complained of mistreatment. Deputy Interior Minister Alexander Barsukov denied the prisoners were abused and said all detainees would be freed by morning. 
At least two protesters have died and around 6,700 were detained this week in a crackdown following Lukashenko's contested re-election that has prompted the West to consider new sanctions on Minsk.
The detainees' release and the emollient tone used by two top state officials underscored the vulnerability of Lukashenko's hold over a country seen by neighbouring Russia as a strategic buffer against NATO and the European Union.
""I take responsibility and apologise for injuries of random people at the protests who got it in the neck,"" said Minister of Internal Affairs Yuri Karayev.
Tens of thousands of protesters on Thursday were joined by workers from some state-run industries that are the pride of Lukashenko's Soviet-style economic model, including the Minsk Automobile Plant (MAZ) that makes ‎trucks‎ and ‎buses. 
Footage showed them chanting ""elections"" and ""go away"". Local media also reported protests at the state-run haulage and earthmoving equipment manufacturer BelAZ in a town northeast of Minsk, and at the Grodno Azot chemical plant. 
Protesters formed human chains and marched in the capital, backed by at least 10 television presenters and reporters from the tightly controlled state media who resigned in solidarity.
The protesters accuse Lukashenko of rigging last Sunday's presidential election to win a sixth term. The president, alleging a foreign-backed plot to destabilise the country, has dismissed the demonstrators as criminals and unemployed. 
But another presidential ally, the head of a national state council Natalya Kochanova, said on Thursday that Lukashenko had ordered an urgent review of the detentions. 
""We don't fight, we don't need war,"" she said. 
RUSSIA ALLEGES MEDDLING
In Minsk, ambassadors from EU countries laid flowers at the site where one protester died, as a crowd cheered and chanted.
""We are here to mourn the loss of life and also to show solidarity with the victims of the violence and abuse that has taken place over many Belarusian towns and cities over the last few days,"" EU envoy Dirk Schuebel told reporters afterwards.
Lukashenko has sought better relations with the West amid strained ties with traditional ally Russia. 
The EU partially lifted sanctions, imposed over Lukashenko's human rights record, in 2016, but could introduce new measures as early as this month. Germany called on the EU to put pressure on Lukashenko.
Russia, which has nudged Lukashenko into accepting closer political and economic ties, expressed concern over what it depicted as attempts by external forces to destabilise Belarus.
A former Soviet collective farm manager, the 65-year-old Lukashenko has faced increasing anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic - which he dismissed as a ""psychosis"" - a sluggish economy and human rights.
Sergei, one of the freed detainees, said there had been 28 people in a cell that would normally contain five. Prisoners took turns to sleep, he said, and were given a single loaf of bread to share out over two days.
Reuters could not independently verify his account.

""They did not beat me in the cell, they took me out of the cell and beat me there,"" said Sergei, who declined to give his last name.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Some corals have lived for centuries at the fringes of Mauritius. Now smothered for days in heavy fuel oil spilled from a wrecked Japanese tanker nearby, parts of those reefs may be in trouble.
The full impact of the toxic spill is still unfolding, scientists say. As the Indian Ocean island's residents scramble to mop up the oil slicks and clumps, they are seeing dead eels and fish floating in the water, as fuel-soaked seabirds limp onto shore. 
Satellite images also show the 1,000 tonnes of spilled oil spreading northward along the coastline from the spill site in the turquoise waters of Blue Bay Marine Park. 
The damage, scientists say, could impact Mauritius and its tourism-dependent economy for decades. 
""This oil spill occurred in one of, if not the most, sensitive areas in Mauritius,"" oceanographer and environmental engineer Vassen Kauppaymuthoo told Reuters by telephone from the island, where he was surveying the disaster. ""We are talking of decades to recover from this damage, and some of it may never recover."" 
The wildlife at risk include the seagrasses blanketing sand in the shallow waters, clownfish darting around coral reefs, mangrove trees corralling the coastline with their tangled root systems, and the critically endangered Pink Pigeon, endemic to the island. 
Giant tortoises slow-walk through a nature reserve on the nearby islet, Ile-aux-Aigrettes, where there is also a scientific research station. Altogether, Blue Bay Marine park counts 38 types of coral and 78 species of fish. 
The spill brings ""a massive poisonous shock to the system,"" said Adam Moolna, an environmental scientist from Mauritius who lectures at Keele University in Britain. ""This oil will have cascading effects across the webs of life.""
STILL UNCONTAINED
The spill came from the Japanese-owned MV Wakashio, which rammed into a reef in the marine park on July 25. It is still unclear why the ship was sailing so closely to the coast. About a week later, oil began gushing from the cracked vessel. 
However, the flow had been stopped, authorities say, after they pumped the remaining oil from the ship.
On Thursday, the ship's owner Nagashiki Shipping said it would face up to its liability and assess compensation for the disaster.
Already, about 15 km of coastline have been affected by the spill, said Mauritius Marine Conservation Society President Jacqueline Sauzier.
""We don't have the equipment or the expertise to remove the oil, and time is of the essence to limit the damage,"" she told Reuters.
Local residents are wading unprotected into the toxic waters, while using human hair as well as husks from sugar cane factories to quickly soak up as much of the spill as they can. 
For both people and wildlife, the spill will have a ""resonating and resounding impact for the next 10 to 20 years,"" said environmental toxicologist Craig Downs, who assesses oil spills but has not studied the spill in Mauritius.
SPIRALING IMPACT
Coral reefs and fish are likely to suffer first. That's especially rough for Mauritius, where tourism and fishing are mainstays of the economy.
Corals that survive could have weakened resistance to marine heat waves, which are hitting the area due to climate change and have already caused some coral bleaching, experts say. 
""If things continue to go the way they are the future prospects for coral reefs look very, very bleak indeed,"" said Alex Rogers (NYSE:ROG), a visiting professor at Oxford University and science director of REV Ocean, a not-for-profit company.
Conservationists are also anxious about oil washing into mangrove forests, where roots serve as nurseries for fish.
Oil also could sink into sediments around mangroves, where it could smother molluscs, crabs and fish larvae, said Callum Roberts, a professor of marine conservation at the University of Exeter in Britain.
""It's very hard to remove once it's sunk into the sediment,"" Roberts said. ""Trees can become sick and die.""
Birds nesting in the mangroves, or migrating via nearby mudflats, are also vulnerable. Ingesting oil can make it hard for birds to fight disease or even to fly, said environmental toxicologist Christopher Goodchild at Oklahoma State University. 
Research has shown that ""just a small amount of oil being transferred to a bird's egg -- as small as a droplet of blood -- can actually cause a change in the bird embryo's physiology,"" he said.
Beds of seagrass, which like mangroves store vast quantities of climate-warming carbon dioxide, play a vital role in protecting coasts from waves. 
On land, some scientists warn that washed up oil deposits could harden and lead to lasting change. 
""In the long term, we could see an asphalt-like coast as the oil dissipates and degrades, as the oil puddles,"" said Ralph Portier, an environmental scientist at Louisiana State University who studied the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

""It's a real tragedy,"" Portier said.

The law would impose criminal penalties on any effort to change the date.
Tensions are brewing as the South American nation heads for a re-run of an October 2019 disputed vote that sparked protests and prompted former leader Evo Morales to resign. 
Bolivia's electoral tribunal in July pushed the election to Oct. 18 due to the coronavirus pandemic, but supporters of Morales are demanding the vote be held on Sept. 6. The dispute has prompted protests and roadblocks. 
The new law was swiftly rejected by the powerful Bolivian Workers’ Center (COB), an umbrella group representing various industries. Top COB leader Juan Carlos Huarachi said the law had ""never been agreed with the people."" 
The United Nations and the European Union, in a joint statement, expressed support for the October date. 

The election's main contenders are Morales' Movement for Socialism (MAS) party and a fragmented conservative opposition, including interim President Jeanine Anez, who took over in a power vacuum last year promising swift new election.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors said ensuring Ghislaine Maxwell's safety was a key reason she has been isolated from other inmates at the Brooklyn jail where she is being held on charges she facilitated late financier Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls.
In a letter on Thursday to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan, prosecutors also said it was ""at best premature"" to require they identify three alleged victims named in Maxwell's indictment.
Lawyers for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and eventually abuse three girls from 1994 to 1997, and committing perjury by denying her involvement under oath.
In an Aug. 10 letter, Maxwell's lawyers objected to her being subjected to round-the-clock surveillance and numerous body scans at the Metropolitan Detention Center despite no longer being on suicide watch, and said she belongs in the general population rather than in her cell 21 hours a day.
Prosecutors said Maxwell was isolated for reasons of ""safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility,"" and that it was appropriate to closely monitor new inmates facing a ""strong likelihood"" of many years in prison.
They nonetheless said jail officials agreed to give Maxwell 13 hours a day to review materials for her scheduled July 2021 trial, rather than the normal three hours.
Prosecutors also said they have acted ""expeditiously"" in turning over materials, and Maxwell can request victims' names and make other motions in December after discovery is finished.
Epstein was found hanged at age 66 last August in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Maxwell is separately asking a federal appeals court to block the release from a separate lawsuit of a 2016 deposition about her sex life, saying publicity could make getting a fair trial impossible. Oral arguments are scheduled for Sept. 22.

School boards in Canada's most populous province will be able to access about C$500 million ($378.3 million) in reserve funding to hire new teachers or lease space. Boards that do not have reserves will be given top up funding.
The province will also provide C$50 million to help upgrade HVAC and ventilation systems and C$18 million to facilitate online learning, Lecce told reporters.
Ontario's government has been under pressure from teachers, unions and parents worried over class size as students prepare to return to classrooms amid the coronavirus pandemic. Many were calling for class sizes to be capped.
Lecce said the government would not cap classes, but said the funding would give individual school boards ""flexibility"" in how they ensure physical distancing measures are followed.
Public schools in Ontario are set to reopen in September, with elementary-age students returning to classrooms on a full-time basis and most secondary students splitting their time between classroom and online.
Students in grades four and up will be required to wear masks at all times, though some exceptions will be allowed.
British Columbia on Wednesday delayed its back-to-school by two days to give students and staff extra time to adjust to new health and safety procedures.
Ontario reported 78 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, though numbers for the large Toronto Public Health unit were not yet available.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - At least three people died during protests in Ivory Coast on Thursday, police said, as small groups burned makeshift road blocks in protests against President Alassane Ouattara's decision to stand for a third term. 
The West African nation has seen a number of scattered protests since Ouattara announced last week he would run in the Oct. 31 election, with the opposition accusing him of violating term limits.
Protesters in the southeastern town of Bonoua set fire to a police station after a young man died during a protest there on Thursday, police spokesman Bleu Charlemagne said in a statement on the state TV channel RTI.
He did not explain how the others died.
A video circulating on social media showed Bonoua's police commissioner covered in blood as a crowd rescued him from the burning police headquarters.
Police arrested 58 people across the country, Charlemagne said.
The executive director of Ouattara's party, Adama Bictogo, defended Ouattara's decision to run again, saying: ""For us the debate is closed."" 
Ouattara's opponents have accused the police of using excess force to break up demonstrations this week. 
Ivory Coast law limits presidential terms to two, but Ouattara says a new constitution adopted in 2016 acted as a reset button, allowing him to run again. The October election is seen as a test of stability for a country still recovering from a brief civil war in 2010 and 2011. 
One of Ouattara's main challengers, former President Henri Konan Bedie, said on Wednesday that two protesters had been killed and others severely wounded during demonstrations held that day in his electoral stronghold Daoukro and elsewhere.

In the commercial capital, Abidjan, police in riot gear cleared makeshift road blocks that small groups of protesters had built and set alight on Thursday, according to a Reuters witness. Several people were arrested, an opposition spokesman said.

(Reuters) - Tropical Storm Josephine formed in the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday, hitting the earliest benchmark of a J-named storm on record, another sign the Atlantic hurricane season is more active than usual, forecasters said.
""It's the earliest 10th named storm on record. It means we're in a busy time ahead,"" said Daniel Brown, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.
""Typically we'd have just three named storms at this time of year,"" Brown said. ""This is a lot.""
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on Aug. 6 increased its prediction for the number of tropical storms expected this year to as many as 25, the highest in the agency's history, forecasters said.
By the end of the season on Nov. 30, NOAA predicts there will have been between seven and 11 hurricanes, of which six will be major, packing winds of 111 miles per hour (178 kph).
The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, which began on June 1, has already produced two hurricanes, including Isaias that lashed the North American Atlantic coast in early August and Hanna that hit the southeast Texas coast in July.
It was unclear if Josephine, packing maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph), would hit the U.S. coast. It was located about 865 miles (1,395 km) east southeast of the Northern Leeward Islands at 5 p.m., the Miami-based forecaster said.
Its topical force winds extended about 80 miles outward of its center. It could at least peak at 60 mph winds late Friday or into early Saturday, before weakening.
Previously, the earliest record-breaking J-named storm was Jose, which formed 9 days later in the season, on Aug. 22, 2005.
""Normally, we wouldn't see a 10th (named storm) until October,"" Brown said. ""We haven't even hit the peak (of the season) yet.""

U.S. prosecutors filed a lawsuit last month to seize the gasoline aboard four tankers that Iran is trying to ship to Venezuela, the latest attempt by the Trump administration to increase economic pressure on the two U.S. foes.
The lawsuit aimed to stop the flow of revenues from oil sales to Iran, which Washington has sanctioned over its nuclear program, ballistic missiles, and influence across the Middle East. Tehran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
The four vessels, called Luna, Pandi, Bering and Bella, were seized on the high seas in recent days and are now en route to Houston, the WSJ said https://on.wsj.com/3auMVJ2, citing the officials, adding that senior administration officials are expected to meet the tankers at an event scheduled to mark the docking.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council started voting on Thursday on a U.S. bid to extend an arms embargo on Iran, which is opposed by veto-powers Russia and China, and the result will be announced at a meeting on Friday, diplomats said. 
The 15-member council has been operating virtually amid the coronavirus pandemic so states have 24 hours to cast a vote.
The 13-year-old arms embargo is due to expire in October under a 2015 nuclear deal among Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States that prevents Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief.
In a bid to gain more council support, the United States slashed its draft resolution on Tuesday to just four paragraphs that would simply extend a weapons ban on Tehran ""until the Security Council decides otherwise,"" saying it's ""essential to the maintenance of international peace and security.""
But diplomats and analysts said the draft text was still likely to fail. To be adopted a resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain or France. 
If the United States is unsuccessful it has threatened to try and trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran using a provision in the nuclear deal, even though Washington quit the accord in 2018. The move could put the already fragile nuclear accord further at risk.
It was not immediately clear how Russia, China or any other Security Council members might try to stop the United States from triggering a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran, known as snapback, or if - procedurally - there is any way that they can.

Diplomats warn the process would be tough and messy. They says several countries would argue that Washington legally could not activate a snapback of sanctions and therefore simply wouldn't reimpose the measures on Iran themselves.

Tensions in the eastern Mediterranean have risen sharply this week after Turkey sent a survey vessel to the region, escorted by warships, in a move Greece decried as illegal. 
""We said that if you attack our Oruc Reis you will pay a high price, and they got their first answer today,"" Erdogan said in a speech in Ankara without giving details. 
The Oruc Reis set out on Monday with its military escort to survey waters between Crete and Cyprus.
In response, President Emmanuel Macron said France would increase its military presence in the region and called on Ankara to stop its exploration work. French and Greek forces held military training exercises off Crete on Thursday.
European Union foreign ministers, who have already imposed sanctions on two Turkish energy executives over Turkey's operations in the eastern Mediterranean, will discuss the situation on Friday. 
Greece's foreign ministry said Minister Nikos Dendias will brief EU counterparts ""about the real facts of the recent days regarding operations in the region"" at the emergency meeting.
Erdogan spoke by phone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and EU Council President Charles Michel on Thursday. He ""reiterated his commitment to defend Turkey's rights against attempts to disregard them"", Erdogan's office said of the call with Michel.
Both Turkey and Greece said this week that they were willing to resolve the dispute over their overlapping maritime claims, but vowed to protect their interests and blamed the other side for the stand-off.
""If we act with common sense and reason, we can find a win-win solution that meets everyone's interests,"" Erdogan said earlier on Thursday. ""We are not chasing any unnecessary adventures or seeking tensions.""

In apparent reference to France, Erdogan also said Greece was being pushed into taking ""wrong steps"" in the region by ""a country that doesn't even have a coast in the eastern Mediterranean"".

Last month, amid rising case numbers, Johnson said there was ""a warning light on the dashboard"" and paused the reopening of casinos, bowling alleys and skating rinks just hours before they opened their doors.
He said that phase of his reopening plan can now go ahead.
""Today, we are able to announce some further changes which will allow more people to return to work and the public to get back to more of the things they have missed,"" he said.
Most businesses are now allowed to operate, albeit within strict guidelines. Friday's announcement means trials of crowds at sporting events can also go ahead and indoor theatre, music and performances can resume with socially distanced audiences.
Data shows infections in Britain have topped 1,000 three times this month and remain at or above the level seen two weeks ago. Quarantine measures have been imposed on European neighbours where cases are rising more sharply. 
An accompanying statement issued by Johnson's office added: ""Two weeks ago the ONS (Office for National Statistics) had expressed concerns about a slight increase in the number of people in England testing positive. The situation now appears to have levelled off.""
However, Johnson also announced increased fines of up to 3,200 pounds ($4,175) for those who repeatedly refuse to wear a face mask where they are required to do so, and cautioned that he would halt the lockdown easing again if required.

The British government, wary of a second wave of coronavirus, has been removing countries from its safe travel list over the last few weeks based on infection data.
""Data shows we need to remove France, the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks & Caicos & Aruba from our list of #coronavirus Travel Corridors to keep infection rates DOWN,"" Shapps said on Twitter. 
""If you arrive in the UK after 0400 Saturday from these destinations, you will need to self-isolate for 14 days.""
The reimposition of quarantine conditions is hitting Britons' favourite holiday destinations in the middle of summer and dealing a fresh blow to a desperate travel industry. 
Earlier Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government would be ruthless when it came to imposing fresh restrictions on arrivals because of the danger of importing fresh cases of the virus.
For UK holidaymakers, France is the second most-visited country behind first-choice destination Spain - which has already been removed from the safe travel list. 
Almost 13 million Britons travelled to France in 2017, data from Statista showed.

Erian, 66, had served as deputy leader of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, and was swept up in a crackdown on the movement's leadership after it was forced from power in 2013.
He had been detained in Cairo's Tora prison along with other senior Brotherhood figures, and had been tried and sentenced in multiple cases linked to the turmoil that followed Egypt's 2011 uprising. 
In June 2019 the Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, who was elected president in 2012 and deposed the following year in an ouster led by then-army chief and current President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, died after collapsing during a court appearance at the Tora prison complex.
Erian had been moved to a prison hospital after suffering a heart attack and died during treatment, two prison sources said.
""We were informed of his death by prison authorities ... they told us the death was natural,"" said Abdel Moneim Abdel Maqsoud, a Brotherhood lawyer.
Egypt's public prosecutor had no immediate comment.
Relatives of other high-profile Islamist prisoners at Tora had previously raised concerns about their health, saying they were being held in poor conditions without adequate healthcare.
Rights group Amnesty International called on Egyptian authorities ""to immediately order an investigation into the circumstances of his (Erian's) death, the conditions of his detention and the extent to which he received medical care"". 
Egyptian authorities have denied mistreating prisoners or neglecting their health.

Palestinians in Islamist Hamas-ruled Gaza have launched dozens of helium balloons laden with incendiary material in recent days to pressure Israel to ease its blockade of the territory. 
Fuel shipments were stopped ""in light of the continued launching of incendiary balloons from the Strip toward (Israel) and of the undermining of security stability,"" a defence ministry statement said.

The halt in fuel shipments could shut down Gaza's sole power plant and lead to further electricity cuts, said Mohammad Thabet, an official with Gaza's main power distribution company. 
Gaza relies on Israel for most of its energy needs. Its population of two million currently receives around six hours of electricity followed by a 10 hour power cut.
Overnight, Israel said its warplanes and tanks struck Hamas facilities in response to the balloons. Israel had earlier shut down Gaza's main commercial crossing and reduced the area where it permits Palestinians to fish.
In Gaza City, a school run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) was damaged by one of the strikes, Gaza's interior ministry said. 
The school was empty at the time and there were no reports of casualties. ""Apparently the device did not explode,"" an UNRWA statement said. 
The Israeli military said that during its strikes on Hamas military targets, some of which it said were deliberately placed in heavily populated areas, a school building was accidentally damaged. The incident was being looked into, the military said.

Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008 and have traded blows in the past few years. Citing security concerns, Israel keeps tight control of its border crossings with Gaza and imposes a naval blockade.

854,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 04:11PM ET</span>","Israel, UAE to normalize relations in shift in Mideast politics; West Bank annexations on hold","By Maha El Dahan, Jeffrey Heller and Steve Holland
DUBAI/JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced on Thursday that they will normalise diplomatic ties and forge a broad new relationship, a move that reshapes the order of Middle East politics from the Palestinian issue to the fight against Iran.
Under the accord, which U.S. President Donald Trump helped broker, Israel agreed to suspend its planned annexation of areas of the occupied West Bank. It also firms up opposition to regional power Iran, which the UAE, Israel and the United States view as the main threat in the conflict-riven Middle East.
Israel had signed peace agreements with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. But the UAE, along with most other Arab nations, did not recognise Israel and had no formal diplomatic or economic relations with it until now. It becomes the first Gulf Arab country to reach such a deal with the Jewish state.
Officials from the three countries called the accord ""historic"" and a breakthrough toward peace. But Palestinian leaders, apparently taken by surprise, denounced it as a ""stab in the back"" to their cause. 
A joint statement said Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed had ""agreed to the full normalisation of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates"".
The accord will allow the two countries ""to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region,"" it said.
Israel and the UAE are expected soon to exchange ambassadors and embassies. A signing ceremony is due to be held at the White House.
""As a result of this diplomatic breakthrough and at the request of President Trump with the support of the United Arab Emirates, Israel will suspend declaring sovereignty"" over areas of the West Bank as envisioned in a U.S. plan announced by Trump in January, it said.
The agreement, to be known as the Abraham Accord, also gives Trump a foreign policy accomplishment as he seeks re-election on Nov. 3. Speaking in the White House Oval Office, Trump said similar deals are being discussed with other countries in the region.
Trump said the agreement unites ""two of America's closest and most capable partners in the region"" and represents ""a significant step towards building a more peaceful, secure and prosperous Middle East.""
The UAE said it would remain a strong supporter of the Palestinian people, who hope to create an independent state in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and that the agreement maintained the viability of a two-state solution to the longstanding Israel-Palestinian conflict.
The accord could also be a personal boost to Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption and whose domestic popularity has dropped over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
In a televised address, Netanyahu said the deal would lead to ""full and formal peace"" with the UAE and voiced hope that other countries in the region would follow its example. It also entailed acceding to a request from Trump to ""temporarily wait"" on implementing his annexation pledge, Netanyahu said.
""It's an incomparably exciting moment, a historic moment for peace in the Middle East,"" Netanyahu added.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, however, rejected the accord. Spokesman Abu Rudeineh, reading from a statement outside Abbas's headquarters in Ramallah in the West Bank, said it was a ""betrayal of Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa (mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine) and the Palestinian cause"". 
Asked if the Palestinian leadership had been aware the deal was coming, veteran negotiator Hanan Ashrawi told Reuters: ""No. We were blindsided. ... It is a complete sell-out.""
In Gaza, Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for the armed Islamist group Hamas, said: ""Normalisation is a stab in the back of the Palestinian cause and it serves only the Israeli occupation."" 
The UAE's Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed said the agreement would stop further Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories, for which Israel had been awaiting a green light from Washington. 
Senior UAE official Anwar Gargash said the deal had helped defuse what he called a ticking time-bomb. Gargash urged the Israelis and Palestinians to return to the negotiating table.
'NIGHTMARE' FOR IRAN
Trump's special envoy Brian Hook called the agreement a ""nightmare"" for Iran. An Iranian official said the agreement would not secure peace in the region.
Railing against ""criminal Israel"", Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, a special adviser to Iran's parliamentary speaker, said in a tweet: ""Abu Dhabi's behaviour has no justification, turning back on the Palestine cause. W/ that strategic mistake, #UAE will be engulfed in Zionism fire.""
Iran and Israel are arch foes. Israel is particularly concerned about suspected Iranian efforts to develop nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies. Iran is also involved in proxy wars from Syria to Yemen, where the UAE has been a leading member of the Saudi-led coalition opposing Iran-aligned forces there.
With a population of less than 10 million but the Arab world's second-largest economy thanks to oil, the UAE has exerted growing commercial and military clout in the Gulf and the wider region over the past two decades, much of it aimed at confronting Islamist militants and the influence of Iran.
Delegations from Israel and the United Arab Emirates will meet in the coming weeks to sign agreements regarding investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications and other issues, the joint statement said.
""Everybody said this would be impossible,"" Trump said. 
""Now that the ice has been broken, I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates' lead,"" Trump added.

This was already being discussed with other states, he said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Rami Basbous was on the phone with his uncle in Beirut on August 4, making arrangements to return his mother's remains from the United States to her birthplace, when he heard the blast that reduced large parts of the Lebanese capital to rubble.
The explosion, the biggest in Beirut’s history, killed at least 172 people, injured some 6,000 and triggered protests against Lebanon's political elite. It also put an end to the Basbous family's plan to bury a beloved wife and mother alongside her relatives. 
""Before the blast and riots we had a very large set of hurdles to get through but it was doable,"" said Rami, 21, after his mother's funeral on Wednesday in Houston, Texas. ""After the blast and now the riots we have a very slim chance at getting her there safely.""
Rita Basbous died earlier this month at age 53 in Houston, weeks after undergoing heart surgery. Rita, whose health was already compromised by a decades-long struggle with diabetes and related kidney problems, contracted the coronavirus in April and fought it through May. 
She eventually recovered, her son said, although the illness left her weak. 
""She loved the world,"" Rami said of his mother, who was born in Lebanon, spoke five languages and lived in Mauritania and the United States, following her father to his postings as a civil engineer. 
After the Basbous family settled in Houston, Rita worked as a teacher and dedicated much of her time to volunteering and helping fellow immigrants, her son said. 
Mask-clad mourners occupied every other row of pews at her funeral service at Our Lady of the Cedars Maronite Church in Houston. Pink and white roses adorned her casket.
In a time of pandemic, the family said they were grateful to be able to hold an in-person funeral at all. 
The son, Rami, said restrictions imposed by the pandemic forced them to get creative and live stream the funeral for family and friends unable to attend. 
For now, Rita has been buried at a Houston area cemetery. The family still hopes to return her remains to Lebanon but the unrest in Beirut, coupled with the health issues raised by coronavirus, have put those plans on hold for now. 

""We joke that that was her telling us 'no',"" Rami said.

The country's opposition-run congress says the oil came from the El Palito refinery, and this week said it opened an investigation into the spill that has contaminated parts of a national park in the northwest state of Falcon.
The environment ministry last week said cleanup had begun, but has not said how much crude has been spilled nor where it came from.
South Caribbean Foundation, an environmental non-profit, said it was surprised that national parks regulator Inparques had prevented its members from entering Morrocoy National Park to see the impact of the spill.
""Impeding the work of professionals and activists from regional non-profits ... further worsens the situation,"" the South Caribbean Foundation wrote in a statement.
Morrocoy National Park is famous for its crystalline blue waters and a network of keys that are surrounded by coral reefs and also serve as breeding grounds for marine turtles. 
The information ministry and Inparques did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Biologist and environmental activist Esmeralda Mujica told Reuters that several of her colleagues have been prevented from entering the area of the park since the start of August.
Legislators say the spill took place at the El Palito refinery in late July.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization said on Thursday it saw no evidence of coronavirus being spread by food or packaging and urged people not to be afraid of the virus entering the food chain.
Two cities in China said they had found traces of the coronavirus in imported frozen chicken wings from Brazil and on outer packaging of frozen Ecuadorian shrimp, raising fears that contaminated food shipments might cause a new outbreak. [nL4N2FF076]
""People should not fear food, or food packaging or processing or delivery of food,"" WHO head of emergencies programme Mike Ryan told a briefing in Geneva. ""There is no evidence that food or the food chain is participating in transmission of this virus. And people should feel comfortable and safe.""
WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said China had tested hundreds of thousands of packages and ""found very, very few, less than 10"" proving positive for the virus.
Brazil's Agriculture Ministry said in a statement that it was seeking clarification on the Chinese findings. Ecuador’s production minister, Ivan Ontaneda, told Reuters that the country maintains strict protocols and cannot be held responsible for what happens to goods after they leave the country.
More than 20.69 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and almost 750,000​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.
The WHO urged countries now that are striking bilateral deals for vaccines not to abandon multilateral efforts, since vaccinating pockets will still leave the world vulnerable.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Russia had become the first country to grant regulatory approval to a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing, a move Moscow likened to its success in the Cold War-era space race.
Moscow's decision to grant approval before then has raised concerns among some experts. Only about 10% of clinical trials are successful and some scientists fear Moscow may be putting national prestige before safety.
The WHO does not have enough information to make a judgment on the expanded use of the Russian vaccine, said Bruce Aylward, WHO senior adviser. 
""The vast majority of the population of the world is susceptible to this disease,"" he told the briefing. ""The second thing that we are seeing is the stringency of the application of control measures is dropping. People are coming closer together...masks aren't being used the way that they should etc.

""So any levelling of the disease that we are looking at is just lulling you into a sense of false security ... because it has lots of space to still cause trouble,"" Aylward added.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A top U.S. diplomat said on Thursday the FBI would join a probe of the massive Beirut explosion that killed at least 172 people, urging change in Lebanon to ""make sure something like this never happens again"".
On a tour of a demolished Beirut neighbourhood, U.S. Undersecretary for Political Affairs David Hale said Lebanon needed ""economic and fiscal reforms, an end to dysfunctional governance and to empty promises"".
The explosion at Beirut port injured 6,000 people and forced around 300,000 out of their homes in the city, which was already sinking deep into financial crisis. Some 30-40 people remain missing.
Authorities have blamed the Aug. 4 blast on a huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate stored for years at the port without safety measures.
""The FBI will soon join Lebanese and international investigators at the invitation of the Lebanese to help answer questions about the circumstances that led up to this explosion,"" Hale said on Thursday.
Lebanese President Michel Aoun has said the investigation will look into whether the cause was negligence, an accident or possibly ""external interference"".
Aoun has asked France for satellite imagery for the probe. A UK Royal Navy vessel was also deployed to Beirut to survey the site.
An Israeli seismological expert said on Thursday the explosion was preceded by a series of blasts, the last of which was combustion of fireworks.
FACTIONAL RIFTS
Authorities have estimated losses from the blast at $15 billion, a bill Lebanon cannot pay: it already defaulted on its enormous sovereign debt in March and IMF talks had stalled.
Humanitarian aid has poured in. But foreign countries that once helped have made clear they will not give funds to help Lebanon out of economic collapse without reforms to tackle state corruption and waste. 
Hale, the No. 3 U.S. diplomat, said Washington would back any new government that ""reflects the will of the people"" and enacts reforms. The fallout from the explosion forced the cabinet to resign this week. 
But agreement on a new one could be daunting in a country with factional rifts and a sectarian power-sharing system. Public anger has grown at a political elite in power for decades, which many blame for the country's woes.
The now-caretaker government came to office in January with backing from various political parties, including the heavily armed Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah. Together with its allies, they have a majority of seats in parliament. 
The United States classifies Hezbollah, which is backed by Tehran, as terrorist. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif landed in Beirut on Thursday evening, local media said.
Security forces were heavily deployed in Beirut on Thursday, stopping protesters from reaching a legislative session. 
""They are all criminals, they are the ones who caused this catastrophe, this explosion,"" said protester Lina Boubess, 60.
""Isn't it enough that they stole our money, our lives, our dreams and the dreams of our children? What more do we have to lose?""

Parliament approved an earlier government decision declaring a state of emergency, which activists criticized as an attempt to suppress dissent. It also confirmed the resignations of eight MPs who quit after the blast.

No injuries or deaths have been linked to the Lake Fire, which broke out late on Wednesday in a section of the Angeles National Forest about 60 miles (97 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, but some evacuations have been ordered, they said.
""This will be a major fire for several days,"" U.S. Forest Service regional Fire Chief Robert Garcia told reporters. 
""The current weather that we started with this morning has helped buy us some time to get some relief crews out there and start developing some preventive control anchor points,"" Garcia said.
Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said the fire destroyed ""several structures"" of the more than 100 located in the evacuation area in the communities of Palmdale and Castiac.
""Many structures were saved because of the actions of the firefighters last night, who were up all night,"" Osby said.
The cause of the fire is under investigation, he added.

Officials said an expected return of hot, dry weather later on Thursday, combined with steep terrain in the wooded area, which loaded with dry brush, will continue to hamper the efforts of firefighters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it was requiring the center that manages Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes in the United States to register as a foreign mission, the latest sign of deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a statement, labeled the Confucius Institute U.S. Center in Washington ""an entity advancing Beijing's global propaganda and malign influence campaign on U.S. campuses and K-12 classrooms.""
David Stilwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, told a briefing the dozens of Confucius Institutes in the United States were not being kicked out, but said U.S. universities should take a ""hard look"" at what they were doing on campus.
Academic exchanges needed to take place without government intrusion, Stilwell said.
Pompeo said the goal of the move was to ensure American schools ""can make informed choices about whether these CCP (Chinese Communist Party)-backed programs should be allowed to continue, and if so, in what fashion.""
""The United States wants to ensure that students on U.S. campuses have access to Chinese language and cultural offerings free from the manipulation of the Chinese Communist Party and its proxies,"" he said.
Pompeo said the Trump administration had made it a priority to seek fair and reciprocal treatment from China and Beijing had enjoyed free and open access to U.S. society while denying that same access to Americans and other foreigners in China. 
Last year, the U.S. State and Education Departments promised stricter monitoring of the institutes, which have been criticized in Congress and elsewhere as de facto propaganda arms of China's Communist government.
In June, the State Department announced it would start treating four major Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies, calling them mouthpieces for Beijing.
U.S.-China relations are at their lowest ebb in decades, with President Donald Trump taking a tough line on Beijing ahead of his Nov. 3 re-election bid. 
The world's top two economies are at loggerheads on issues ranging from the handling of the coronavirus pandemic to China's crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong and what U.S. officials say is rampant espionage activity to steal U.S. business and military secrets.
In his briefing, Stilwell said China had taken no action to address fundamental U.S. concerns about where bilateral ties were going and also referred to U.S. allegations that Chinese diplomats were involved activities that undermined medical research and freedom of speech.
""We are having discussions and we're emphasizing to them that they need to address our fundamental concerns, and we will take steps if they do not,"" Stilwell said, when asked about a recent statement by China's Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng on the need to ensure the relationship does not derail.
Stilwell said there were about 500 Confucius classrooms in the United States affiliated with a university-based Confucius Institute.
According to the U.S. non-profit organization, the National Association of Scholars, there were 75 Confucius Institutes in the United States as of June, including 66 at colleges and universities. 

The association contends that the institutes compromise academic freedom, defy Western norms of transparency, and are inappropriate on campuses. China rejects that criticism, calling it politicized and baseless.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Conference of Mayors took direct aim at powerful police unions on Thursday, calling the collective bargaining agreements they negotiate an obstacle to police reform and the regaining of public trust.
That finding in a report could escalate tensions in the national debate over police use of force and racial inequality that burst into nationwide street protests following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Cities have ceded too much authority to police unions in the disciplining of bad cops, the report said.
""We're at the inflection point, and unions need to be part of the solution,"" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, chair of the conference's working group on police reform and racial justice, told a news conference. ""Police cannot be effective, they cannot do their job, if they do not have the community on their side.""
Police unions typically wield more power than other public-sector unions, often gaining support from both pro-labor Democrats and pro-police Republicans. They have proven effective at forcing mayors to temper calls for reform and unifying behind officers accused of misconduct.
Too many collective bargaining agreements enable investigations to be covered up or delayed, or the purging of disciplinary records, Lightfoot said.
The report, which will be debated by the organization's 1,400 member cities, also called for many state laws to be rewritten, the licensing of police officers, and the establishment of a national database to prevent abusive officers from being rehired in other cities. 

The national Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police union, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a Chicago branch of the union, which will negotiate a new contract with Lightfoot this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday left in place a lower-court ruling that relaxes voting restrictions in Rhode Island during the coronavirus pandemic.
The justices rejected an emergency request made by the Republican National Committee and the state's Republican Party.
The decision means that mail-in ballots will not, as usual, have to be accompanied by the signatures of two witnesses or one notary.
The unsigned order left intact a decision by Rhode Island-based U.S. District Court Judge Mary McElroy, who ruled on July 30 that the Republican groups had waited too late to intervene in the case. The order said three of the nine justices, conservatives Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, would have granted the request.
The Republicans wanted to challenge a consent decree suspending the signature requirement that McElroy had approved.
The case was originally brought against the state by voting rights groups, including Common Cause Rhode Island.
On August 7, the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put McElroy's ruling on hold.
The Supreme Court on July 2 had granted a similar request made by Republican officials in Alabama.
Thursday's order noted that, unlike the Alabama case, state officials in Rhode Island supported the settlement.
Republican President Donald Trump, who is up for re-election on November 3, has frequently attacked the possibility of mail-in ballots being used widely as the nation reels from the pandemic that has so far killed more than 160,000 Americans.

Trump has made unsubstantiated claims that mail-in ballots are especially vulnerable to fraud and suggested that their widespread use would lead to a ""rigged election.""

Britain has in recent weeks imposed a 14-day quarantine period for arrivals from countries like Spain and Belgium, responding to rising infections and fears of a second wave of the virus, having initially declared them safe for travel.
""We've got to be absolutely ruthless about this, even with our closest and dearest friends and partners around the world,"" Johnson told reporters on a visit to Northern Ireland.

For UK holidaymakers, France is the second most-visited country behind first-choice destination Spain. Almost 13 million Britons travelled to France in 2017, data from Statista showed.

Daily recorded cases have topped 800 three times in the past week, far above earlier levels, leading authorities to cancel big events and urge Poles taking advantage of the sunshine to follow social distancing and sanitary guidelines.
Singing songs and carrying banners, people converged on the Jasna Gora monastery in the southern city of Czestochowa, where the Black Madonna of Czestochowa icon has been venerated by pilgrims since the Middle Ages.
The feast of Assumption, marked by Catholics as the day when Jesus' mother Mary rose into heaven, falls on August 15.
Extra measures in place this year include volunteers disinfecting surfaces and stalls offering free hand sanitizer.
""Pilgrims can come to us and get a free mask if they have forgotten to take one, they can drink water and they can measure their temperature,"" Marta, a volunteer standing at a stall next the road in Czestochowa told private broadcaster TVN.
An estimated 16,000 pilgrims will visit the monastery in August, according to Polish state-run news agency PAP.
Some have split in to smaller groups, each walking a section of the route for a day before heading home and leaving another group to take up the journey, to avoid crowding.
However, some fear that this year's event could lead to an increase in cases in the city of over 220,000 people. Outbreaks in Malaysia, South Korea and the United States have followed religious gatherings.
""The mayor made an appeal to pilgrims to visit Czestochowa, but next year,"" said Rafal Kusal, head of Czestochowa's Crisis Management Department.

867,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>",EU eyes sanctions over disputed Belarus election 'as soon as end-August',"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will likely impose new sanctions on Belarus as soon as later this month, diplomats and officials said, after President Alexander Lukashenko cracked down on protests triggered by a disputed election. 
Germany, Lithuania, Latvia and Sweden have spoken publicly in favour of sanctions and Austria was another hawk, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of emergency talks between EU foreign ministers on Friday.
Security forces have clashed with protesters in Minsk and other Belarusian cities in recent days after Lukashenko claimed a landslide re-election victory in a vote on Sunday that his opponents say was rigged. Police have detained around 6,000 people.
With any EU decision on sanctions requiring unanimity of all the 27 member states, Hungary was the main sceptic, according to the sources. Hungary on Thursday called on the bloc ""to pursue dialogue with Belarus and avoid ostracising it"".
Suggesting it could agree to some restrictions, however, Budapest passed up the opportunity to block a statement earlier this week on behalf of all EU countries that specifically mentioned sanctions ""against those responsible for the observed violence, unjustified arrests, and falsification of election results"" as an option.
""The direction of travel seems clear. How many people would be blacklisted, how deep we go will largely depend on Hungary,"" said one EU diplomat in Brussels. 
No final decision was expected on Friday, but the response could be finalised within days after another discussion among EU foreign ministers due in Berlin on Aug. 27-28, the sources said.
Germany's Heiko Maas said earlier this week the EU might need to reinstate some of the sanctions it had previously placed on Belarus over its human rights record, before lifting them partially in 2016 after Lukashenko released political prisoners.
On Thursday, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics joined the growing chorus of those calling for ""individual sanctions against Belarusian officials responsible for crackdown of protests and election fraud"".
Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for more than a quarter of a century, denies electoral fraud and has accused the protesters of being in cahoots with foreign backers from Russia and elsewhere to topple his government.
NARROW SANCTIONS
As was the case with EU sanctions on Russia and the people held responsible for Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and the turmoil in east Ukraine, the sources said sanctions on Belarus would come in the form of travel bans and the freezing of assets held in the bloc.
""There has been no signal that any EU country wants to block some restrictive measures because the violence is blatant,"" said an EU official close to the matter. 
""What we need to assess is the level of pressure that would be useful versus what would be counterproductive and risk pushing Lukashenko into Russia's arms if he sees this as his only possibility to stay in power.""
In the narrower option, only some officials at the Belarusian election body or security forces who oversaw clashes with protesters could be sanctioned. In a broader version, curbs could also be placed on government officials such as the interior minister, the sources said.
As the EU weighs its options, one of the bloc's leading Russia hawks, Poland, called for support to protesters, including possible mediation between them and Lukashenko, rather than a much tougher line.
Warsaw is wary of a repeat of the 2013/2014 street protests in Kyiv, which the EU and the United States supported and Russia then used as an excuse to annex Crimea from Ukraine before backing separatists in the industrial east of the country.
That suggests a narrower set of sanctions may be more likely for the time being, the sources said, also pointing to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's visit to Minsk in June when he called for the remaining EU sanctions on Belarus to go. 

For the time being, EU restrictive measures on Belarus include an arms embargo as well as a ban on exporting equipment that can be used for internal repression.

The Indian Ocean island nation, popular with tourists for its beaches and turquoise waters, has become a focal point in China's Belt and Road Initiative aimed at building trade and transport links across the region.
On Thursday, India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told his Maldivian counterpart Abdulla Shahid that New Delhi will support the Male connectivity project with a grant of $100 million and a new line of credit of $400 million, the Indian foreign ministry said.
Jaishankar said the plan linking Male to the islands of Villingili, Gulhifahu and Thilafushi will be the largest civilian infrastructure project in the Maldives, the foreign ministry said.
""EAM (external affairs minister) and Foreign Minister Shahid emphasized that greater connectivity results in prosperity,"" it said.
India has sought to regain diplomatic influence in the islands after a new administration led by President Ibrahim Solih took power following the defeat of the pro-China strongman Abdulla Yameen in elections in 2018.
Yameen was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to five years in prison last year, after facing allegations of awarding contracts, including for a major bridge connecting Male to the island of Hulhumale and an extension to the international airport, to Chinese companies at inflated prices.

""Since November 2018, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, India and Maldives have embarked on a dynamic and ambitious phase of the partnership that builds on our enduring ties based on mutual trust and shared interests,"" the foreign ministry said.

""The tide is turning against the Chinese Communist Party in its efforts to restrict freedom for all of us,"" Pompeo said in the town of Bled after a signing ceremony for the declaration on developing a secure 5G network.
Speaking to the press, Pompeo said U.S. President Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump, who was born and raised in Slovenia, ""had sent greetings."" 
Last month Telekom Slovenia began to roll out its 5G network and expects to have one-third of the country covered by the end of the year. 
Pompeo said another important topic in talks with Slovenian officials would be ensuring energy security by reducing the country's dependence on Russia. 
""We spoke about the enormous potential of next generation nuclear technology to deliver clean, reliable diversified energy that will help ensure political independence and economic prosperity for Slovenia and the entire region,"" he said. 
Slovenia is the only former Yugoslav republic to have a nuclear power plant. 

Pompeo visited Slovenia as part of a European tour this week. He is due to travel to Vienna later in the day, before he visits Poland on Saturday.

People’s Alliance for Credible Elections (PACE), an independent group of election monitors in the country, said on Thursday the election commission had denied it accreditation on the basis that it had received foreign funding.
The chairman of the election commission did not answer Reuters' calls for comment, and a spokesman could not immediately be reached.
PACE said it had planned to deploy more than 2,900 observers to watch the voting.
Foreign observer missions, which have been permitted, are likely to be limited given travel restrictions and quarantine requirements during the coronavirus pandemic, the group said.
""Therefore, to safeguard the transparency and accountability of the electoral processes, domestic election observers' role is of crucial importance,” PACE said in a statement.
Myanmar has only reported 361 cases of the virus but has banned international flights and imposes 21-day quarantines for visitors with special permission to enter.
The nation goes to the polls on Nov. 8 in what analysts see as a test of the transition away from direct military rule, but preparations have been complicated by the pandemic and escalating ethnic conflict.
Longtime opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party took power in 2016 after a landslide election win that ended half a century of army rule, although the military retains significant powers.
Richard Horsey, a Myanmar-based political analyst with the International Crisis Group, said PACE had significant experience of observing previous elections and was able to deploy large numbers of people.
""As Myanmar starts to consolidate a system of electoral democracy after so many decades of authoritarianism, observers play a key role in giving the elections credibility,"" he said.
""Firmly establishing that practice now can also serve Myanmar well in future years, when its electoral integrity might face difficult tests,"" he said.

The agency said over 100,000 more people are angling, with a surge in rod licence sales by nearly a fifth compared to the same time last year.
Fishing retailers have also reported huge demand for beginners’ fishing kits and tackle since lockdown restrictions eased on May 13.
Angling was one of the first sports allowed to restart as England inched toward normality.
There are currently over 750,000 anglers with a licence in England and Wales and the Environment Agency is targeting 1 million by 2025.
""As lockdown restrictions have eased, there has been a boom in licence sales as now, more than ever, people have a desire to get outdoors and escape their daily stresses,"" said Heidi Stone, the agency's fisheries manager.
Medical professionals are also backing the call to fish and the pursuit of outdoor activities to help people deal with the impact of the pandemic.
""Growing evidence suggests that spending time in ‘green’ and ‘blue’ spaces has a very positive effect on our mental health, providing protective and restorative benefits,"" said Antonis Kousoulis, director of the Mental Health Foundation.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Sleep Comfort survived Lebanon's 15-year civil war. But nothing could have prepared the high-end family furniture business for the Beirut port blast that destroyed swathes of the capital. 
Employees barely escaped glass shards which flew across the showroom, located in one of the hardest-hit districts. In an instant, one-third of the furniture stock was lost and the factory gutted, incurring some $600,000 in losses.
""I am only here for my father otherwise I would have left,"" said chief sales manager Jad Ayoub. 
""I would go anywhere.""
The biggest blast in Beirut's history killed at least 170 people, injured 6,000 and triggered protests against a political elite blamed for political turmoil and economic collapse. Homes and businesses were razed in the country's commercial heart.
Authorities have said they will hold those responsible to account.
The Aug. 4 explosion dealt a catastrophic blow to everyone from mechanics to major food importers, already struggling amid a financial crisis that hammered the currency and sent unemployment soaring.
Beirut was built around its port, one of the region's busiest and for centuries a lifeline for Lebanon's merchant culture.
The blast badly damaged it, and while some shipping lines say they are resuming visits to its container terminal, traders and business owners say they have no visibility on what goods survived or when imports can resume. 
""The government decided that anything in the port has to be analysed for ammonium nitrate residues ... Everything is at a standstill. There is nobody to answer us,"" said Hani Bohsali, general manager of Bohsali Foods SAL and president of Lebanon's food importers syndicate.
""NO ONE IS HELPING US""
He said the 52 companies in the Syndicate of Importers of Foodstuffs, Consumer Products and Drinks could suffer losses of no less than $50-60 million. 
""It is indeed a disaster. In case these goods were demolished (along with) a good part of my working capital, can I continue in the same volumes I used to before? Definitely not. Will the bank give me new credits? No, because of the financial crisis.""
Lebanon imports nearly 85% of its food. It defaulted on its foreign currency debt in March, citing critically low reserves. 
The government, which quit this week over the blast, had launched talks with the IMF for a bailout but they were put on hold due to an internal row over the scale of financial losses.
Authorities have said initial estimates show $15 billion in damages, a bill Lebanon cannot pay.
Insurance firms have taken a hit.
Ghassan Saab, vice chairman of Fidelity, said the company has received 500 claims for property and motor damages as well as those from political unrest running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
""I doubt that all of the 60 insurance companies operating in Lebanon would survive the 2020 challenges which are the financial crisis, Covid-19 and the explosion,"" Saab said.
""Definitely, the government resignation will help, but the government is not enough. Lebanon needs a complete reform to recover.""
Foreign donors have linked any financial lifeline to the state to the enactment of long-demanded reforms.
After the blast, the central bank told local banks to lend dollars interest-free to people and businesses for essential repairs, saying it would in turn provide those financial institutions with the funding.
The banking association is studying ""specific mechanisms"" to help customers and says it will cooperate with the central bank. But many business owners doubt they will get any help from banks that have frozen people out of hard currency savings.
""We can't go to the banks, they have no money,"" said George Saab, who incurred losses of $500,000 from damage to his laundry and restaurant equipment business.

""The government are a bunch of crooks. There is nothing we can do. No one is helping us. The world community has to rescue us.""

""I will lead a government that will not ... veer away from the road leading to membership of the European Union after obtaining membership of NATO,"" Zaev said. 
The Social Democratic leader, who needed time to ensure the support of parties representing Macedonia's ethnic Albanian minority before getting the green light to form a cabinet, will have 20 days to do so.
Zaev, who had led the previous government of the former Yugoslav republic since 2017, put the country on a path toward EU membership by agreeing to add ""North"" to its name.
That resolved a decades-old stand-off with Greece, which had viewed the name Macedonia as a claim on its province of the same name, and had blocked its neighbour's entry into both the EU and NATO. Newly renamed North Macedonia joined NATO this year.
Parliament dissolved in February when Zaev resigned after the EU declined to set a date for membership negotiations. A month later the EU announced talks could begin. It again set no date, but diplomats said it would likely be later this year. 

A party alliance led by the Social Democrats squeaked to victory in the parliamentary election with 35.89 percent of the vote, just ahead of the nationalist VMRO-DPMNE with 34.57 percent.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Two cities in China have found traces of the new coronavirus in imported frozen food and on food packaging, local authorities said on Thursday, raising fears that contaminated food shipments might cause new outbreaks.
A sample taken from the surface of frozen chicken wings imported into the southern city of Shenzhen from Brazil, as well as samples of outer packaging of frozen Ecuadorian shrimp sold in the northwestern Xi'An city, have tested positive for the virus, local authorities said on Thursday.
The discoveries came a day after traces of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 were found on the packaging of frozen shrimp from Ecuador in a city in eastern Anhui province. China has been stepping up screenings at ports amid the concerns over food imports. 
Shenzhen's health authorities traced and tested everyone who might have come into contact with potentially contaminated food products, and all results were negative, the city's notice said.
The Brazilian embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not immediately reach the Ecuadorean embassy in Beijing. 
""It is hard to say at which stage the frozen chicken got infected,"" said a China-based official at a Brazilian meat exporter. 
The Shenzhen Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters said the public needed to take precautions to reduce infection risks from imported meat and seafood. 
The health commission of Shannxi province, where Xi'An city is located, said authorities are testing people and the surrounding environment connected to the contaminated shrimp products sold in a local market. 
In addition to screening all meat and seafood containers coming into major ports in recent months, China has suspended some meat imports from various origins, including Brazil, since mid-June. 
The first cluster of COVID-19 cases was linked to the Huanan seafood market in the city of Wuhan. Initial studies suggested the virus originated in animal products on sale at the market. 
Li Fengqin, who heads a microbiology lab at the China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment told reporters in June the possibility of contaminated frozen food causing new infections could not be ruled out. 
Viruses can survive up to two years at temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius, but scientists say there is no strong evidence so far the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can spread via frozen food. 
Xinfadi market in China's capital city Beijing, a sprawling food market linked to cluster infections in June, where virus was found on the chopping board on which imported salmons were handled, will be reopened from the weekend.

How the virus entered the market in the first place is yet to be determined, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in its latest update of the investigation in July.

875,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",Mass arrests in Ethiopia raise spectre of repressive past,"By Dawit Endeshaw
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia has detained more than 9,000 people after deadly clashes last month, the state-run human rights commission told Reuters, raising fears that a government hailed for reforms is returning to the iron-fisted tactics of past administrations. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who came to power in 2018 promising democratic changes in one of Africa's most repressive nations, is struggling to rein in resurgent ethnic nationalism that sporadically explodes in bouts of violence.
Abiy's changes have unleashed old disputes over land, resources and local power, and he now faces the challenge of protecting citizens while preserving fledgling freedoms that helped win him the Nobel peace prize last year. He's promised to hold Ethiopia's first free and fair elections in 2021, which would be a milestone for Africa's second most-populous nation. 
But the state-run Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said around 9,000 people had been arrested since the June 29 shooting of a musician sparked days of protests that killed more than 178 people in the capital and surrounding Oromiya region - the deadliest spasm of violence since Abiy took office.
Asked to comment on the arrests, the government signalled that order was its immediate priority.
Billene Seyoum, a spokeswoman for the prime minister, told Reuters, ""One of the government's primary roles and responsibilities is ensuring security and stability and that the rule of law prevails ... actions taken over the past weeks are a reflection of the commitment to law and constitutional order.""
Abiy's critics detect disturbing echoes of the past.
Among those detained: opposition activist Dejene Tafa, whom police dragged from his bed in the middle of the night on July 8 as he slept next to his pregnant wife. Dejene is a university professor and secretary of the Oromo Federalist Congress party. 
DISSENT
Aselefech Mulatu, his 42-year-old wife, said her husband is being held without charge and has contracted COVID-19 in prison. 
""We thought we had transitioned to a democratic system,"" she said, her belly large with their fifth child. 
Tegene Regassa, spokesman for Ethiopia’s health ministry, confirmed Dejene had been hospitalised for COVID-19 but said he had recovered. 
Dejene had already spent two years in prison without charge for taking part in the street protests that toppled the previous prime minister, his wife said. 
Getachew Balcha, a regional government spokesman, confirmed 7,126 people had been arrested in Oromiya alone. He said did not know how many had been charged but said ""files were being prepared"" on 500 of them. The state office of the attorney general did not respond to requests for comment.
Mass arrests were common under the previous administration which used security forces to crush dissent. When anti-government protests propelled Abiy to power, he speeded up the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners. 
But now activists like Fisseha Tekle, Amnesty International's Ethiopia analyst, fear Abiy's government is resorting to the arbitrary mass arrests of his predecessor.

""The government arrests people and then looks for evidence,"" said Fisseha. ""This is in line with previous experience.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed five members of his own family to cabinet and ministerial roles following his resounding parliamentary election win earlier this month.
Gotabaya and his older brother Mahinda Rajapaksa won an overwhelming majority in the Aug. 6 poll, giving the family the power to enact sweeping changes to the island nation's constitution.
The two-thirds majority for his Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party and its allies will allow him to restore full executive powers to the presidency, a move analysts say could push the country towards authoritarianism.
In a ceremony late on Wednesday, Gotabaya appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa - himself a former president - as minister of finance, urban development and housing, and religious and cultural affairs.
Gotabaya's elder brother Chamal Rajapaksa will serve as minister of irrigation, and a state minister for defence, while Mahinda's son, Namal Rajapaksa becomes minister for youth and sports.
Chamal's son Shashendra Rajapaksa will also serve as a state minister.
Gotabaya reappointed himself defence minister, a role he held during Sri Lanka's bloody civil war.

Long a dominant force in Sri Lankan politics, the family's popularity rose significantly among the island's majority Sinhalese population following deadly bombings carried out last year by Islamist militants that killed more than 250.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - The sight of local kids playing under the palm trees in an almost empty Plaça Reial square reminds Gloria Gomez of her childhood in the 1980s before tourism swamped the Barcelona landmark.
""It's nice to see it but at the same time it's so sad,"" said Gomez, 53, a concierge at a building in the old-town square, a job she inherited from her mother. 
The pandemic has dealt a huge blow to tourism-dependent countries like Spain and cities such as Barcelona, one of Europe's most popular. But now they are seeking to lure visitors back, they are also debating the need to change their economic models to tackle a longstanding overcrowding problem.
""There's a total change of strategy,"" said Marian Muro, director of Turisme de Barcelona, a public-private consortium, explaining the shift away from general promotion of the city.
""Quality is more important than quantity"" and a greater respect from visitors to Barcelona's residents are among the factors behind the city's more segmented approach, she said.
Seeking new tourism assets, it aims to promote its local food and tech startup scene and is offering travel agents training to cater to Chinese visitors' needs to draw more high spenders from there, as well as Southeast Asia and the United States.
It is also demanding health requirements from tourism companies receiving a United Nations sustainable commitment label to guard against the pandemic and has signed a deal with Moscow to promote long weekend trips for culture and shopping.
They are new tactics for the city of 1.6 million that last year estimated it had close to 30 million visitors, including day trippers and some 14 million who stayed at least one night.
Before the pandemic, amid anger over soaring housing prices and concerns tourists were creating no-go areas for locals, the municipality tried measures such as restricting the opening of new hotels, drawing criticism from the private sector.
Tourism normally accounts for over 12% of GDP in Spain, which the United Nations recorded as the world's second most visited country in 2018 after France.
But international arrivals slumped 98% in June from a year ago. Hopes of a rebound in July after the end of a nationwide lockdown were dashed by quarantines and no-travel advisories issued by many countries as various areas of Spain - Barcelona in particular - suffered an uptick in infections. [nL5N2EZ1HK]
Less than a third of Barcelona hotels are open and were just 20% full in July, and the government of Catalonia expects tourism sector losses of at least 15 billion euros in the region. Direct spending from tourists reached around 8.8 billion euros in Barcelona in 2018, according to city hall.
BUBBLE BURST?
""The sector will need to adapt and learn to be more resilient because there will likely be more pandemics,"" said Francesc Romagosa, head of research at Barcelona's Autonomous University tourism school, noting it is a ""great moment"" to diversify the urban tourism model.
Some want more radical change.
Maria Garcia, spokeswoman at the environmental group Ecologistes en Accio, called for a transformation to smaller-scale and climate-friendly tourism and away from what she described as the ""burst bubble"" of a sector based on hypermobility, precarious jobs and huge urban impact.
Garcia said the pandemic showed the potential disruption from climate change and called for an end to airline subsidies in favour of train-based tourism as well as regulation of house prices and conversion of tourist shops back into local stores.
Ramon Gonzalez, a CCOO union leader in Catalonia, said manufacturing should be given greater economic weight, warning that tourism might not recover until 2022.
The impact of the virus is evident in Barcelona's once bustling Gothic quarter, where dozens of souvenir shops have closed and hotels are locked with chains.

""We have gone from one extreme to another,"" said Gomez from Plaça Reial, who now misses the nightly noise she used to hate: ""It's an ugly silence.""

So far, two organisers of the anti-government movement have been arrested on charges of violating emergency coronavirus bans on large gatherings. Human rights lawyer Anon Nampa, 35, and student activist Panupong Jadnok, 23, are now free on bail.
Protests have been held nearly every day since July 18, calling for the resignation of Prayuth, who first took power in a 2014 coup, and an end to military domination of politics.
Some of the protests also have broken decades-long taboos by calling for reform of the powerful monarchy, which Prayuth said ""went too far"". Thailand has strict ""lese majeste"" laws against insulting or defaming the king, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
""We have to look into many things, look into if anyone is behind the (student) protests and what their intentions are. They can protest based on their basic rights, but we'll have to see if they've violated any laws,"" Prayuth told reporters on Thursday. He did not elaborate.
He also said the government has been restrained in not taking action against student activists who may have broken unspecified laws on social media.
Though Prayuth did not mention the lese majeste laws, for months online comments involving the king has been increasingly bold. 
In March, the hashtag #whydoweneedaking? was used more than 1 million times on Thai-language Twitter. A Thai-language Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group that often mocks the monarchy has attracted more than 850,000 members.
""When they break the law, there are many people out there who are unhappy with the government for doing nothing about this,"" Prayuth said.

""The government has been extremely careful about this,"" he said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's move to reopen schools in some areas risks creating new clusters of coronavirus cases, with at least 180 students and teachers infected since a new academic year started in July, a teachers' federation said on Thursday. 
The world's fourth-most populous country has allowed schools to reopen with limited capacity in ""yellow"" and ""green"" zones, with fewer reported cases and covering 43% of the student population, according to government data.
Parents can opt not to send their children to schools in these areas and extracurricular activities are not allowed.
Heru Purnomo, the secretary general of The Federation of Indonesian Teachers Associations (FSGI), said distance learning was still preferable.
""We've always sounded out our worries that schools could become new clusters,"" Purnomo said. ""Distance learning, be it offline or online, is safer than face-to-face lessons.""
Wiku Adisasmito, a spokesman at Indonesia's COVID-19 task force, told reporters on Thursday that new clusters would not break out at schools if all health protocols were adhered to.
Explaining the policy of limited reopening, education minister Nadiem Makarim told a streamed talkshow on Wednesday that almost 90 percent of children live in areas where ""most of the students find it extremely difficult to do any type of technology-based distance learning.""
In its situation report on Thursday, the World Health Organization in Indonesia warned a return to schools ""risks worsening local transmission, putting a heavier burden on the nation's limited healthcare facilities and workers and, in the long term, slowing down the economic recovery.""

Some provinces have reported a significant number of cases among the young. In Papua, nearly 300 people aged under 19 had confirmed infections as of Wednesday. 
A co-founder of Lapor COVID-19, a volunteer group collating information, told Reuters it had found six clusters originating in schools that had reopened in West Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.
Indonesia has reported 132,816 coronavirus infections and 5,968 deaths, the highest death toll in Southeast Asia. Around 9% of infections are among the 0-18 age group.

881,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 06:16AM ET</span>",Special report: A collapsing economy and a family feud pile pressure on Syria's Assad,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi, Maha El Dahan, Tom Perry and Michael Georgy
BEIRUT/AMMAN/DUBAI (Reuters) - In May, Syrian tycoon Rami Makhlouf, a cousin and long-time ally of President Bashar al-Assad, took a once unimaginable step.
In a video he published on social media, he lashed out against Assad's ""inhumane"" state security forces. ""Mr President, the security forces have started attacking people's freedoms,"" Makhlouf said.
The outburst shocked Syrians, and exposed a rift at the heart of the ruling elite. Never before had such a senior figure spoken out against the regime from within Damascus.
Through Syria's 10-year civil war, Makhlouf had helped Assad evade Western sanctions on fuel and other goods vital to his military campaign. He was part of the president's inner circle, accused by the United States of exploiting his proximity to power to enrich himself ""at the expense of ordinary Syrians."" His business empire spanned telecoms, energy, real estate and hotels, looming large over Syria's economy.
But now the two men were locked in a battle over money. Security forces had recently raided Makhlouf's telecoms company, Syriatel, in a tax dispute and detained dozens of employees for questioning.
Makhlouf's public defiance showed that a threat to Assad's iron rule may ultimately come, not from the battlefield, but from once loyal allies and Syria's collapsing economy. In a nation where criticism of the ruler is rarely tolerated, Makhlouf has been able to speak out, people familiar with the matter say, because of the family connection and because he is well regarded in the Alawite Muslim community that dominates the top echelons of Syria's leadership. Makhlouf and Assad are both Alawite.
Reuters spoke to more than 30 sources - including people close to the Assad and Makhlouf families, local businessmen, and Western intelligence officials - and reviewed official documents to chart the breakdown of a family alliance that stretched back two generations. Many of the sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
In interviews, these sources described how:
• In expanding his business empire over two decades, Makhlouf kept some of his wealth hidden from the president.
• In May 2019, Assad instructed Syria's intelligence chief to track down Makhlouf's estimated billions of dollars of riches stashed abroad.
• After a decade of war, Assad is so desperate for cash that in Sept 2019 the central bank summoned Syrian tycoons to a meeting and ordered them to hand over some of their fortunes.
""Makhlouf has brought into the open the feud within the regime,"" said a person with ties to the Assad family.
The Syrian Information Ministry didn't respond to detailed questions for this story. Questions emailed to Makhlouf via his son went unanswered. Syriatel didn't comment.
THE RISE
The financial arrangement between the Assad and Makhlouf families began with the fathers.
Assad's father, Hafez, an air force officer from a mountain village, seized power in a military coup in 1970. He turned to Makhlouf's father, Mohamed, to manage the money, derived from state-controlled industries and contract commissions, that would shore up his rule. Mohamed, known as Abu Rami, had financial skills that Hafez lacked.
""The Makhlouf side was generally better educated and refined, so they could help out with the finances, which is something the Assads were not good at and didn't have the education for,"" said Joshua Landis, a Syria specialist and head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma. ""They were also better at dealing with the people of Damascus and Aleppo, who dominate Syria's economy.""
Makhlouf senior reaped extensive rewards from the relationship. In the 1970s, he was appointed head of the General Organization of Tobacco, which had a monopoly over the industry in Syria. A decade later he expanded his business interests as chief of the state-owned Real Estate Bank, and acted as middleman for government contracts.
The sons grew up together and were close. As a young man, Rami Makhlouf ""used to go to Assad's residence and open the fridge like any family member,"" said a former business associate of Makhlouf.
Ayman Abdel Nour met both men at Damascus University in the 1980s when he was a teaching assistant and they were students. Abdel Nour now lives in the United States. Makhlouf and Assad were so close that even their mannerisms were similar, Abdel Nour said. ""Rami would sit very calmly, in a way that was similar to Bashar. He copied his personality because they grew up together.""
Bashar's mother, Anisa, was Rami's aunt. With a strong personality and deep political influence, she lobbied for her nephew within the family and was instrumental in his rise, said people who know the family. As his father aged, Rami smoothly took over the responsibilities as money manager for the Assads.
In the early 2000s Syria enjoyed rapid economic growth and Makhlouf's business flourished. The jewel in the crown was telecoms firm Syriatel. The company has grown from a few hundred thousand subscribers in the early 2000s to around 11 million, according to Makhlouf. ""Rami built Syriatel into a sophisticated business that many of Syria's best and brightest wanted to work for,"" said Landis.
Makhlouf drew the attention of the United States. In 2008, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on the tycoon, describing him as ""one of the primary centres of corruption in Syria."" The Treasury alleged he manipulated the justice system and used state intelligence officials to intimidate rivals and acquire exclusive licenses to represent foreign firms in Syria. His ties to Assad brought him lucrative oil exploration and power plant projects, the Treasury said.
""Rami Makhlouf has used intimidation and his close ties to the Assad regime to obtain improper business advantages at the expense of ordinary Syrians,"" Stuart Levey, then Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said at the time.
Makhlouf, who rarely spoke in public, didn't respond to the sanctions.
When protesters took to the streets calling for Assad's overthrow in 2011, their chants were also directed against ""the thief"" Makhlouf. As the popular uprising turned into a civil war and then a multifaceted conflict, Makhlouf helped power Assad's military campaign with fuel and other imports.
Behind Assad's back, he was also feathering his own nest, said more than a dozen sources with knowledge of the matter. A former business associate and a banker said Makhlouf had created a network of front companies, including in neighbouring Lebanon, where he generated his own money separate from the funds Assad asked him to place in safe havens on behalf of the ruling family. They didn't quantify the sums of money involved.
In a post on social media on July 26 of this year, Makhlouf conceded that he set up such firms, but insisted ""these companies' role and aim is to circumvent sanctions,"" not to enrich himself.
Among Makhlouf's interests outside Syria was a Beirut law practice called Middle East Law Firm SAL. Publicly available data show the firm was set up in 2001 by Makhlouf, his brother and Lebanese partners. According to Lebanon's Commercial Register, the law firm continues to operate and its activities include the management of companies inside and outside Lebanon and foreign trade transactions. Reuters couldn't reach the law firm or its partners for comment, nor could the agency determine whether Makhlouf plays any role there today.
One former business associate with first-hand knowledge said that Makhlouf set up entities in Jersey and the Virgin Islands. ""Makhlouf would buy supplies and equipment for the government from companies that he ultimately owns. He would create these shell companies that would be suppliers,"" said the former associate, a shareholder in Makhlouf's Cham Holding, a real estate developer.
Makhlouf's personal wealth has been estimated by Syrian business associates at between $5 billion and $15 billion. Its true scale is a closely held secret. In one of his recent video appearances, Makhlouf said profits from his businesses were used for charitable causes, such as funding injured war veterans and bereaved families, via a holding company he owns.
THE FALL
With the help of Russia and Iran, Assad has turned the tide of Syria's war. But victory on the battlefield has come at a cost.
Syria's economy is in ruins. The Syrian pound has lost almost 80% of its value over a decade of war. The fighting has caused tens of billions of dollars' worth of damage, disrupted agriculture, devastated industry and wiped out foreign currency flows from tourism and oil exports. Inflation is rampant and many Syrians are struggling to afford even basics such as food and power. Eight in 10 people live below the poverty line in Syria, according to the United Nations.
While Russia has backed Assad militarily and with food supplies, its intervention isn't for free. Syria has to pay for much of the Russian wheat it imports and for weaponry.
In recent months, a banking crisis in neighbouring Lebanon has cut off a vital source of dollars for the regime, worsening the economic shock and aggravating already strained money relations between Assad and Makhlouf.
While much of Syria lies in ruin, two of Makhlouf's sons have been living lives of luxury. On social media, they posted pictures, many since deleted, of fancy sports cars, a private jet and opulent homes.
In one video, in the summer of 2019, Mohamed Makhlouf, one of Rami's sons, appeared driving a Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) in the South of France. The camera zoomed in on the speedometer as he revved the engine. Another video showed him at a beach party on the Greek island of Mykonos. Someone commented beneath the post: ""It's been 45 years and they are still stealing from the people.""
As the economy imploded, Assad became determined to bring home the billions of dollars held by Makhlouf in offshore companies, said more than a dozen sources. These sources include well-connected people in Syria's financial community, an official with ties to Assad's government and Western intelligence sources.
In the summer of 2019, Assad and his brother Maher, head of the Republican Guard that defends Assad's seat of power in Damascus, met with Ali Mamlouk, the head of Syria's intelligence agency, the General Intelligence Directorate. At that meeting, the Assads told Mamlouk to track down Makhlouf's wealth overseas, said a person allied with the Syrian government and a Western intelligence source who was briefed about the meeting. Reuters couldn't independently verify this account. Syrian authorities didn't respond to questions about the matter.
""It was time to put the house in order"" now that the security pressures on the regime had eased after containing the insurgency, said the Western intelligence source.
A first sign of Makhlouf's fall from grace came in December 2019, when Syria's customs directorate accused Makhlouf and some other businessmen of importing goods without declaring their real value. The order, which was reviewed by Reuters, froze the assets of Makhlouf and his wife. It was signed by Syria's finance minister. Makhlouf has since said he paid seven billion Syrian pounds ($3 million) to settle the dispute. Syrian authorities didn't comment.
The sums accumulated abroad by Makhlouf - estimated in excess of $10 billion by members of Syria's business community - are of real economic consequence. One Western diplomat said repatriating the money ""is of existential importance for the regime.""
Though he caved in the customs dispute, Makhlouf has resisted surrendering his vast holdings. He told the president to seek dollars elsewhere, from other tycoons, said bankers and business associates familiar with the matter.
Starting early this year, Syrian security forces began a campaign of arrests that netted dozens of employees at Makhlouf's Syriatel, without legal explanation. Sources in Syria said people were arrested, sometimes released and then re-arrested. Reuters couldn't determine whether any charges have been brought. A Damascus banker with knowledge of the matter said the employees were questioned about fund transfers to front companies set up by Makhlouf in the British Virgin Islands and Jersey.
""They were interrogating them over the details of offshore companies that have signed management deals with Syriatel,"" said the Damascus banker. He did not elaborate, and Reuters couldn't determine whether any money had been repatriated.
A businessman said the detentions were designed to send a message to those working for Makhlouf ""that he is in disgrace.""
The rift between Assad and Makhlouf burst into public view on April 30, when Makhlouf posted the first of three videos to social media. In the videos, he said the government had asked him to step down from his companies, including Syriatel. He also spoke of threats by unspecified people in the regime to revoke Syriatel's license and seize its assets if he did not comply.
On May 19, 2020, the finance ministry froze the assets of Makhlouf, his wife and an unspecified number of his at least two children, according to a document reviewed by Reuters. It also ordered that overseas assets should be seized ""to guarantee payment of dues to the telecom regulatory authority."" The government has said Syriatel owes the telecom regulator 134 billion Syrian pounds ($60 million) relating to the terms of the company's license. Makhlouf insisted in one of his social media posts that he stands ready to pay.
A separate order banned Makhlouf from obtaining government contracts for five years.
A former business associate said years of acting as Assad's trusted money keeper and family treasurer made Makhlouf feel like a partner. ""Makhlouf was telling his cousins (the Assads), 'we are partners,' and it has shocked him they are now telling him, 'no you are not, you are just serving us',"" said the associate, who used to work with Makhlouf.
HUNT FOR CASH
As Makhlouf has fallen, others have stepped into his place.
One powerful man who has emerged at the top of a new elite is Samer Foz, a building contractor turned commodities trader. Foz, a Sunni Muslim, was sanctioned by the United States in June 2019, along with more than a dozen individuals and companies, for providing financial support to Assad.
""Samer Foz, his relatives, and his business empire have leveraged the atrocities of the Syrian conflict into a profit-generating enterprise,"" then Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker, said in a statement. ""This Syrian oligarch is directly supporting the murderous Assad regime and building luxury developments on land stolen from those fleeing his brutality.""
Foz didn't comment for this article, telling Reuters: ""You can write what you want. I have nothing to say to the press.""
In September 2019, central bank governor Hazem Karfoul assembled some of Syria's wealthiest players for a closed-door meeting at the Damascus Sheraton. Syrian media have previously reported that the meeting took place, but details of what was discussed are revealed here for the first time.
On the surface, the gathering was projected to the public as an effort to strengthen the struggling currency through donations from Syria's wealthy elite. But the meeting was not about charity, said three sources briefed by people who attended.
The central bank governor listed the businessmen's properties and other assets, and the lucrative deals they had struck. He suggested their fortunes could be seized if they did not give a significant contribution to state coffers.
Foz pledged $10 million, according to the sources. The central bank governor told him that wasn't enough, to which Foz replied, ""consider it a first payment,"" one of the sources said. Foz didn't comment.
""This was to show that these merchants of war were being pressured to do their bit for the country,"" said a business executive who is close to some of the attendees and a personal friend of the central bank governor. ""Everyone knows who they are and how they made their wealth and who they work for.""
Syria's central bank didn't respond to Reuters' questions about the meeting.
""WE SHOULDN'T DISAGREE""
In recent months, Makhlouf has been projecting himself as a spiritual man, in an apparent attempt to appeal to members of the faith practised by the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam, to which Makhlouf and Assad belong. Reuters couldn't determine how Makhlouf's messages are being received in the community. People were reluctant to discuss the matter with Reuters by phone.
The Alawites rose to dominate the political system in majority Sunni Syria after controlling the army following a coup that brought the Baath Party to power in 1963. The Alawites' influence has spread to business, undermining a Sunni merchant establishment that had traditionally dominated commerce.
One of Makhlouf's social media posts after the rift became public was a prayer asking God to end the injustice against him, written in the Alawite dialect.
Commenting on Makhlouf's social media posts and his messaging, a financial adviser involved in transactions with him before 2011 said the videos were clearly made to appeal to the loyalist Alawite camp.
""He is telling Bashar, 'We are defenders of our community, we should not disagree.'""
In a recent post, on July 9, Makhlouf remained defiant. Arrests of his employees, he said, hadn't stopped. ""Now it's only our women who are left,"" he said. ""Even so, they didn't get what they wanted to force us to surrender.""

882,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Explainer: Pandemic behaviour - Why some people don't play by the rules,"By Kate Kelland and Megan Revell
LONDON (Reuters) - Lockdowns and social distancing measures introduced around the world to try and curb the COVID-19 pandemic are reshaping lives, legislating activities that were once everyday freedoms and creating new social norms. 
But there are always some people who don't play by the rules.
Rule-breaking is not a new phenomenon, but behavioural scientists say it is being exacerbated in the coronavirus pandemic by cultural, demographic and psychological factors that can make the flouters seem more selfish and dangerous.
Here are some questions and answers on the science of human behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic:
WHAT MAKES SOME PEOPLE FLOUT AND OTHERS OBEY THE RULES?
A key factor is individualism versus collectivism.
""Some countries...tend to be higher on individualism, which is about expressing your sense of identity and who you are as an individual,"" said Jay Van Bavel, an associate professor of psychology at New York University. 
People in individualist cultures tend to reject rules and ignore attempts by public health authorities to ""nudge"" behaviour change with risk messages or appeals for altruism.
""If you say, for example, that wearing a mask will help protect others, people in individualistic cultures just care less,"" said Michael Sanders, a expert at the Policy Institute at King's College London.
In collectivist cultures, people are more likely to do what's best for the group.
Researchers said the United States and Britain were examples of individualist cultures while Asian cultures tended to be collectivist.
ARE TRUST AND FEAR IMPORTANT?
Yes. These and other instincts are significant influences on human behaviour. 
In societies with more political division, for example, people are less likely to trust advice from one side or the other, and also tend to form pro- and anti-camps.
Optimism and fear are also crucial. A little of both can be positive, but too much of either can be damaging.
""In a situation like a pandemic, (optimism) can lead you to take risks that are incredibly dangerous,"" said Van Bavel.
WHY IS SOCIAL DISTANCING DIFFICULT?
""We are truly social animals,"" said Van Bavel. ""Our bodies and brains are designed for connection and the pandemic in many ways goes against our instincts to connect.""
That's partly why local outbreaks can crop up in bars and nightclubs, or religious ceremonies, weddings and parties.
""People have a hard time resisting that tendency for social and group connection."" 
IF RULE-BREAKERS ARE A MINORITY, WHY DOES IT MATTER?

""The problem is that, in a massive collective problem like the one we're facing now, if everybody breaks the rules a little bit, then it's not dissimilar to lots of people not following the rules at all,"" said Sanders.

Anti-racism protests in cities, including Portland, Oregon, have at times erupted into arson and violence, and federal officers sent into the Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) city have repeatedly clashed with crowds targeting the federal courthouse there. 
""We know there are people in the crowd who do not want violence or vandalism to occur but know there are some people in this crowd who are engaged in criminal activity,"" the police said.
""To those outside of The Justice Center, this gathering has been declared a riot.""
The crowd that converged on South West 3rd Avenue outside the courthouse building were asked to leave the area immediately, the police said, or be subject to tear gas, other crowd control agents, citation or arrest. 
In Portland, some demonstrators have previously attacked a federal courthouse and others have gathered to speak out against racism and police brutality following the May 25 death of George Floyd.
Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr came under fire from Democratic lawmakers earlier this month for sending federal officers to disperse the protesters in Portland.

LAGOS (Reuters) - When Divine Umukoro refused to pay police a bribe after breaking Lagos state's night-time curfew, she says they slapped her, slashed her car tyres and threatened violence.
A video of the incident went viral on Nigerian blogging sites, and Citizens' Gavel, a non-profit organisation that fights against police misconduct, stepped in, helping her to recover her seized car within three days.
The police have declined to comment on the incident. 
""When the whole thing started with the hitting, with the slapping of my face, pushing my friend - I felt so angry,"" Umukoro, 25, said of the July 11 incident, when she acknowledged she was out past a 10 pm curfew instituted to combat the spread of the coronavirus. 
Citizens' Gavel, founded in 2017, and the Headfort Foundation, founded last year, aim to help marginalised Nigerians get fair treatment from the police and the courts.
The two NGOs have handled nearly 400 cases in total so far.
International organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have long accused Nigerian police of extortion, physical attacks and other abuses, charges they deny.
Lagos police spokesman Bala Elkana said police were already accountable, pointing to a dedicated unit that investigates brutality accusations. He said 10 officers had been dismissed and more than 70 punished this year alone. 
But Oluyemi Orija, chief executive of the Headfort Foundation, said that without help, poor clients can spend months in jail for offences such as driving without a licence because they cannot afford to pay bail or bribe the police. They can also be coerced to confess to crimes they did not commit. 

""Things can land poor people in jail for months, but a rich person will walk into the police station, pay them and get away with it,"" said Orija, a lawyer. ""It is so unfortunate that young people don't even know their rights.""

886,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",Taiwan to raise defence spending as China details combat drills,"By Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan unveiled a T$42.1 billion ($1.4 billion) increase for next year's planned defence spending on Thursday, as China announced details of its latest combat drills near the democratic island.
China has stepped up its military activity near Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province.
On Monday, Taiwan said Chinese fighters briefly crossed the sensitive median line of the Taiwan Strait, the same day U.S. health chief Alex Azar met President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei. China had denounced Azar's trip.
Tsai's Cabinet is proposing T$453.4 billion in military spending for the year starting in January, versus T$411.3 billion budgeted for this year, up 10.2% according to Reuters calculations.
""The steady increase in the defence budget will facilitate the implementation of various military-building and war-preparation tasks ... and ensure national security and regional peace and stability,"" Taiwan's Defence Ministry said.
About three hours after the budget announcement, China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command said its forces had in recent days carried out combat drills in the Taiwan Strait and to the north and south of the island, implying they were aimed at Azar's trip.
""Recently, a certain large country has continued to make negative moves on Taiwan-related issues, sending serious wrong signals to 'Taiwan independence' forces, and seriously threatening the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,"" it said.
""The theatre command's organising of patrols and exercises are necessary actions taken in response to the current security situation across the Taiwan Strait and to safeguard national sovereignty,"" the statement added.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the situation was normal and people should not worry.
Tsai has made modernising Taiwan's armed forces and increasing defence spending a priority.
The budget must be approved by lawmakers, though Tsai's Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party has a large majority in the legislature, making it unlikely to be blocked.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and has denounced the United States for arms sales to the island. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.
Taiwan is in discussions with the United States to acquire sea mines to deter amphibious landings, as well as cruise missiles for coastal defence, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to United States said on Wednesday. 
Last year, the U.S. State Department approved arms sales worth US$10 billion for Taiwan.
Taiwan's military is well-armed, but dwarfed by that of China.
""Taiwan authorities are spending their taxpayers' money on defence, but no matter how much they spend on defence, Taiwan is still a small place. Confronting the mainland is like an ant trying to shake a tree,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's foreign minister said on Thursday the arrests of Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow and media tycoon Jimmy Lai raised questions over freedom of speech and the press in Hong Kong and Tokyo's concerns over the situation were growing.
Chow, released on bail after her arrest under the new National Security Law, earlier thanked Japanese people for their outpouring of support, urging them to not to forget Hong Kong.
""Japan's grave concerns regarding the situation in Hong Kong are getting stronger,"" Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said, speaking from Singapore to reporters via an online system.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government, seeking to keep ties with Beijing on an even keel, has been somewhat circumspect in its comments on Hong Kong.
Monday's arrest of 23-year-old Chow, a fluent Japanese speaker who often tweeted in Japanese and has been dubbed the ""goddess of democracy"" by Japan's media, was top news this week in the country, where the hashtag #FreeAgnes trended on Twitter.
""Thank you so much,"" Chow said in a brief Japanese-language segment of a Chinese-language video about 24 hours after her release on bail late on Tuesday.
""I hope the people of Japan will keep paying attention to Hong Kong,"" she added.
A cross-party group of lawmakers, including members of Abe's Liberal Democratic Party, has condemned the arrests, urging the government to refuse any requests for evidence based on the security law, and to ease visa restrictions on Hong Kong residents.
Hong Kong's Beijing-backed government called the group's statement incorrect and inappropriate.
The crackdown on pro-democracy opposition in Hong Kong has drawn international criticism and raised fears for freedoms promised by Beijing under a ""one country, two systems"" model.
The city's government and Chinese authorities say the law is needed to restore order after sometimes violent anti-government protests last year. 
Chow last posted on her Japanese-language Twitter account on June 30, saying, ""As long as we live, there is hope.""

Thursday's exercise was the first manifestation of French President Emmanuel Macron's commitment to temporarily reinforce his country's presence in the eastern Mediterranean. France has called on Turkey to halt oil and gas exploration in disputed waters.
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis discussed the situation in the region with Macron by telephone on Wednesday.
On Thursday, the French armed forces ministry said it was sending two Rafale fighter jets and the naval frigate ‘Lafayette’ to the eastern Mediterranean.
The frigate and the jets had arrived in Crete earlier on Thursday and carried out joint manoeuvres with Greek forces, the Greek defence sources said.
""Emmanuel Macron is a true friend of Greece and a fervent defender of European values and international law,"" Mitsotakis tweeted, in French, after the call with Macron.
Tensions have simmered between NATO allies Greece and Turkey in recent days over overlapping claims to hydrocarbon resources in Mediterranean waters.
A Turkish seismic vessel, the Oruc Reis, has been sailing between Crete and Cyprus since Monday, despatched by Ankara days after Greece signed a maritime deal with Egypt designating an exclusive economic zone between the two nations.

Turkey says it plans to open up some of the area for potential hydrocarbon exploration, and a precursor to that is collecting seismic data it can process and sell to potential bidders. Both countries lay claim to the area.

The four men, who have not been identified, went missing in the Parlitobel Gorge in the canton of St. Gallen just before 1700 GMT on Wednesday.
The accident was reminiscent of a tragedy two decades ago in the Swiss mountains that killed 21 people.
The Spanish tourists were reported missing after a violent thunderstorm. Three were found dead during the night; the fourth has not been found, police said. Police did not say where in Spain they were from.
""They were together on a canyoning tour in the Parlitobel gorge and were probably surprised by the storm,"" St. Gallen police said.
Police said the four men were not participating in a guided tour but had struck out on their own. A rescue effort was launched, but weather halted the search on Wednesday before it was resumed on Thursday morning.
Canyoning is travelling through canyons and gorges by a variety of techniques -- walking, climbing, jumping, abseiling and swimming. The area where the Spaniards were canyoning is well-known; the local region's tourist web site advertises it, describing ""multiple worthwhile canyoning tours.""
The activity is popular in Switzerland, but carries risks, particularly in the Alps where the weather can turn quickly and fill narrow gorges with torrents of water.
In July 1999, 21 people, most of them Australians, were killed during a guided canyoning tour in the Bernese Oberland when they were swept up after sudden rain that rushed into the gorge they were exploring.

Russia has denied playing any part in the nerve agent poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy, and his daughter Yulia Skripal, in the English cathedral city of Salisbury.
Britain has named two Russian military intelligence agents as the prime suspects in the case, which led to the biggest Western expulsions of Russian diplomats and spies since the Cold War.
In response, Britain introduced new legislation, the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, which includes the new powers now coming into effect.
Known as Schedule 3 powers, they will allow specially trained police officers to stop, question, and when necessary detain and search individuals travelling through UK ports to determine whether they are involved in hostile state activity.
The Home Office, or interior ministry, said the new system included robust safeguards such as independent oversight by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, as well as special protections for confidential material and journalistic sources.
""The threat to the UK from hostile state activity is growing and ever changing,"" Home Secretary Priti Patel said in a statement.
""These new powers send a very clear message to those involved in it that this government has zero tolerance for those acting against British interests.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai said on Thursday he was overwhelmed by the support he got after becoming the most high-profile person to be arrested under a new national security law and urged patience in a ""long-term fight"" for democracy.
Lai, a staunch supporter of the city's democracy movement, was arrested on Monday on suspicion of collusion with foreign forces as police raided the offices of his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily tabloid.
He was released on bail early on Wednesday, and greeted by a throng of supporters chanting ""fight till the end"".
In a #LiveChatWithJimmy video appearance on Twitter, Lai thanked his supporters and said their action showed the police raid was a ""violation of Hong Kong people's belief"" in wide-ranging freedoms, which he likened to oxygen.
""The oxygen is getting thin, and we are all choking, but when we're choking we're still taking care of each other and keep resisting and keep fighting for our rule of law and freedom,"" he said.
Lai, who China sees as a ""traitor"", was arrested under a new security law imposed by Beijing on June 30 in response to a year of pro-democracy unrest in the former British colony, which returned to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula aimed at preserving its autonomy.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, fuelled by fears Beijing has been eroding city freedoms, has enjoyed and sustained broad support in the city. 
Lai said pro-democracy activists had to play a long game.
""We cannot be radical, we cannot confront them face-to-face because we're just like an egg and they are a high wall,"" he said. 
""We have to flexible, and innovative and patient, but persist.""
The law punishes whatever China considers subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. 
Critics say the law brings semi-autonomous Hong Kong closer to mainland China's authoritarianism, while its supporters say it will bring stability to the city and safeguard its prosperity.
Since Lai's arrest people have been queuing up early in the morning to buy his Apple Daily, and many have also bought shares in Next Digital (HK:0282), Lai's media company that publishes his newspaper, sparking a rally of more than 2,000% at its peak.

Lai called the rise in share price an ""ephemeral phenomenon"" and urged people ""not to touch it"".

SEOUL (Reuters) - Satellite imagery suggests recent flooding in North Korea may have damaged pump houses connected to the country's main nuclear facility, a U.S.-based think-tank said on Thursday.
Analysts at 38 North, a website that monitors North Korea, said commercial satellite imagery from August 6-11 showed how vulnerable the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center's nuclear reactor cooling systems are to extreme weather events.
The Korean peninsula has been hammered by one of the longest rainy spells in recent history, with floods and landslides causing damage and deaths in both North and South Korea.
Located on the bank of the Kuryong River about 100 km (60 miles) north of North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, Yongbyon is home to nuclear reactors, fuel re-processing plants and uranium enrichment facilities that are thought to be used in the country's nuclear weapons programme.
The five-megawatt reactor - believed to be used to produce weapons-grade plutonium - does not appear to have been operating for some time, and an Experimental Light Water Reactor (ELWR) has not yet come online, but such flooding in the future would likely force a shutdown, the 38 North report said.
""Damage to the pumps and piping within the pump houses presents the biggest vulnerability to the reactors,"" the report said. ""If the reactors were operating, for instance, the inability to cool them would require them to be shut down.""
While there was further flooding downstream, it did not appear to reach the Yongbyon facility's Uranium Enrichment Plant and by August 11 the waters appear to have somewhat receded, 38 North said.
North Korea's state media has not mentioned any damage to Yongbyon, but reported this week that senior leaders had been touring flood-stricken areas, delivering aid and providing guidance on how to prevent the high waters from damaging crops.
South Korea's Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the 38 North report, but said it is always monitoring developments related to North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes and maintaining close cooperation with the U.S. government. 
At a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Vietnam in 2019, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un offered to dismantle https://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-usa-denuclearisation-yongbyon/explainer-nkoreas-yongbyon-nuclear-complex-takes-centre-stage-in-stalled-talks-idUSL3N20J05S Yongbyon in exchange for relief from a range of international sanctions imposed over North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.

At the time Trump said he rejected that deal because Yongbyon is only one part of the North's nuclear programme, and was not enough of a concession to warrant loosening so many sanctions.

AGADEZ, Niger (Reuters) - A dispute between Fulani herders and their nomadic Tuareg neighbours over stolen cattle and motorbikes threatened to turn violent in the village of Amataltal when one man grabbed his rifle and fired skywards.
It was a rare outburst in the quiet commune of a few hundred people in north Niger, residents said, and sent a warning: disputes like this have opened a door for jihadists expert at exploiting conflict to boost recruitment and spread chaos.
Wary of escalation, Amataltal's leaders called in a regional peacekeeping committee to mediate in June last year. Within days, rivals sat opposite each other at tables in a eucalyptus grove. They aired concerns and agreed to keep peace, according to a video of the event and two witnesses.
Islamist violence has overrun large parts of West Africa's Sahel, the arid region south of the Sahara desert, since 2017 when militants linked to Islamic State ambushed and killed four U.S. soldiers in Niger. 
On Sunday, six French aid workers and two locals were shot dead in a giraffe reserve 65 km (40 miles) from Niger's capital Niamey, in a zone previously considered safe.
But a few hundred miles north, the Agadez region where Amataltal is located - an area the size of France that borders Algeria, Libya and Chad - has remained largely peaceful.
Local leaders say a network of influential ex-rebels, clerics and peace committees - formed in response to an armed uprising seeking greater political autonomy for Tuaregs in the 1990s - has stopped jihadists gaining a foothold by monitoring grievances and people with extreme ideas. 
With thousands of French troops struggling to contain the bloodshed elsewhere, and the United States mulling a drawdown of forces, Agadez leaders say their methods offer a possible blueprint for defeating militants - without weapons. 
""Agadez shows that it can be done. With the right leadership and the right relationships, you can have stability,"" agreed Hannah Armstrong, analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank.
Agadez's fortunes stand in stark contrast to the Tillaberi region in southwest Niger, which borders Mali and Burkina Faso. 
Last year, attacks by militants with links to Islamic State and al Qaeda killed at least 367 people, nearly all in that border zone - four times the number in 2018, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a U.S.-based research organization. In the first half of 2020, 482 died.
Agadez is not invulnerable: militants exploded a car bomb outside a military base in 2013, killing at least 20 soldiers. In 2010, a local al Qaeda affiliate kidnapped seven foreigners in the region's uranium mining zone around the town of Arlit.
Similar peacekeeping efforts elsewhere in the Sahel - including Mali before Tuareg rebels took over the north and began advancing on the capital in 2012 - have shown signs of promise before falling apart. A French-led intervention pushed the rebels back the following year, but Islamist militants have since regained a foothold in the north and centre, tapping into rivalries between Tuaregs and Fulanis. 
A TALE OF TWO REGIONS
For now, though, Agadez leaders are confident.
""The jihadists are far from here. They are not here because we are paying attention,"" said Silymane Hiyan Hiyar, an ex-rebel who spent years living in mountain caves fighting government forces during the 1990s uprising. 
He is now a member of the peace committee that visited Amataltal and lives in a compound with his family in the regional capital Agadez, where he spoke to Reuters.
A peace agreement reached in 1995 gave communities in northern Niger a voice by integrating Tuareg rebels into the army and promoting Tuareg politicians.
Ex-rebels are members of peace committees and keep the government informed of disputes. Religious leaders travel in caravans, preaching peace on the government's behalf. 
The changes have not brought continuous peace to Agadez - another Tuareg uprising broke out in the north from 2007-2009 - but experts say the region learned from past struggles.
""The people have seen atrocities in Agadez. Now, as soon as there is conflict, the people come together to discuss the problem,"" said Issouf Sibi-Moussa, assistant coordinator at HED Tamat, a local aid group. 
In the Tillaberi region, a lack of local leadership, peace mechanisms or strong ties with Niamey have allowed ethnic rivalries to fester and attacks to continue, security experts said. Jihadist groups have won recruits among disaffected locals who believe the state has abandoned them. 
""It is dangerous for local officials in Tillaberi to liaise with the state because the jihadists' intelligence networks are very sophisticated. Their calls and meetings are listened to,"" said Armstrong. 
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the border commune of Inates, where militants killed over 70 soldiers in an attack on a camp in December. Much of the surrounding area is in the hands of jihadists. Many residents fled.
Algateig Mohamed was driving with the local chief to a neighbouring town in July last year when gunmen on motorcycles encircled their car and opened fire, he said. 
The assailants tied his hands behind his back and knocked him unconscious with a rifle butt, he said. He woke alone and walked all night to get home. When he arrived, he found out the chief was dead.
Mohamed fled the next day with his wife and six children.

""There is death there,"" said Mohamed, who sleeps on the unswept floor of a friend's house in Niamey. ""I cannot go back.""

896,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>",Germany: Optimistic we'll have a vaccine in coming months and certainly next year,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Thursday he expected there to be a COVID-19 vaccine in the coming months and definitely next year, speaking after the public health agency withdrew a report suggesting there would be one in autumn. 
""I'm optimistic that in the next months, and certainly in the next year, there can be a vaccine,"" Spahn told ZDF television.
His forecast appeared to chime with a report that the Robert Koch Institute issued on Wednesday and later withdrew, in which the public health agency said it expected a vaccine by the autumn. The institute later said the document was not up-to-date and had been published in error.
Spahn declined to name a specific month in which the vaccine would be ready, saying it was not yet possible to determine how often people would need to be vaccinated or how long-lasting the immunity it conferred would be.
He added: ""But one thing we can say is that thanks to us all working together - researchers, scientists, the public - we will probably have a vaccine faster than ever before in the history of humanity.""
German Research Minister Anja Karliczek has previously said any vaccine was unlikely to be widely available before the middle of next year.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Tuesday that Russia had become the first country to grant regulatory approval to a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing.
Spahn repeated his scepticism of that vaccine, dubbed ""Sputnik V"", saying it had not yet been broad tests like with other vaccines and there was relatively little data about it.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 1,445 to 219,964, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Thursday, while the reported death toll rose by 4 to 9,211.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese couple Rikiya and Ayumi Kataoka had their honeymoon wrecked by the coronavirus pandemic, but their resourcefulness in enforced exile in Cape Verde has won them appointments as ambassadors for its Olympic team. 
The Kataokas had completed a third of their round-the-world trip when a suspension in long-haul flights stranded them for five months in the archipelago of 10 tiny islands off the coast of West Africa. 
Unable to resume their journey to Europe and then home to Japan and unwilling to head to the African mainland, where virus cases are spiking, they had to trade their skills with domestic businesses to earn funds in the absence of work visas.
But Cape Verde's Olympics officials were so intrigued by the ties the couple had built with locals that they decided to include the Kataokas in their team heading to the rearranged games in Tokyo next July.
""They want me to be an ambassador of the Olympic team,"" Rikiya, 30, told Reuters via Zoom, speaking from the island of Sal. ""When I go back to Tokyo, I will do a job for them."" 
Cape Verde, who have never won an Olympic medal despite participating in every summer Games since 1996, hope to take three or four athletes to Tokyo.
Not only will the Kataokas be useful for their local knowledge but the islands' officials hope the recognition helps repay the couple for their work in promoting the islands, where their plight turned them into minor celebrities.
""We felt the urge of giving back,"" said Leonardo Cunha, the islands' chef de mission for Tokyo.
""The guys are Japanese citizens and they deserve, in the name of the friendship we have with Japan, just to be well-treated,"" he added. 
""It was our interest to accompany them on their journey as well (and) making them part of our adventure in Japan.""
Miles from home with dwindling funds, the Kataokas could easily have panicked, but Rikiya, who occasionally works as a videographer back home, made social media videos https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdgeSYowlD8ZLtvROaXHbXg, tagging hotels and restaurants, in exchange for lodging and food.
""I shot many things in restaurants and hotels, as a volunteer,"" he said, adding that had prompted job offers.
""For example, the restaurant owner offered me a job... and then they gave me food for free."" 
Wife Ayumi modelled for the shoots when not doubling as a reviewer.
That kind of enterprise could pay off in Japan for the Cape Verde Olympic Committee, which learnt of the couple when they moved into a hotel owned by American former windsurfing world champion Josh Angulo.
""You go to another planet, Planet Olympics,"" said Cunha, describing the benefits for the Kataokas. 
""When they will arrive there, they will be in shock, because it is so big and so emotional, they really will understand where our invitation comes from and what it will mean for them.""

Turkey has regularly attacked Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)militants, both in its mainly Kurdish southeast and in northern Iraq, where the group is based. In June, Ankara launched a new ground offensive, dubbed Operation Claw Tiger, that saw Turkish troops advance deeper into Iraq.
On Tuesday, a Turkish air strike in northern Iraq killed two members of Iraq's border guard and their driver, Iraq's military said, calling the attack a ""flagrant aggression"". 
Iraq's foreign ministry then said Baghdad cancelled a visit by Turkey's defence minister to the country, and summoned the Turkish ambassador to inform him of ""Iraq's confirmed rejection of his country's attacks and violations"".
In a statement early on Thursday, Turkey's foreign ministry said PKK presence also threatened Iraq and that it was Baghdad's responsibility to take measures against the militants, but that Ankara will defend its borders if the PKK's presence is allowed.
""Our country is ready to cooperate with Iraq on this issue. However, in the event PKK presence in Iraq is overlooked, our country is determined to take the measures it deems necessary for its border security no matter where it may be,"" the ministry said. ""We call on Iraq to take the necessary steps for this.""
The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict, focused in southeast Turkey.

Acknowledging differences between his agriculture and environment ministries over the herbicide, which is used in brands such as Roundup, Lopez Obrador said the government would immediately stop using glyphosate on its own projects. 
The agriculture ministry said that private food producers will have until 2024 to phase out glyphosate, which has sparked safety concerns in a number of countries.
""We couldn't get rid of it in one fell swoop, it can't be done, it would hit food output,"" the president told reporters. ""We would have to import, and also products and foods that are grown with these agrochemicals.""
Lopez Obrador noted that some countries had already tried to find alternatives to glyphosate, without success.
The president's announcement follows the leaking of an audio of Environment Minister Victor Manuel Toledo criticizing the government for internal contradictions during a private meeting. Toledo has been a strong critic of the herbicide.
Opponents of glyphosate argue the herbicide is carcinogenic, while proponents of its use reject that assertion.

Sudan is one year into a three-year transition after the overthrow of former President Omar al-Bashir and faces challenges including simmering insecurity in several regions and a deep economic crisis.
Security forces arrested 85 people over the recent violence, which also left 98 people wounded, and local authorities imposed a curfew in Port Sudan to restore order, the ministry said in a statement. The casualties included security force members.
Local media reports and activists on social media said the clashes broke out between the Beni Amer and Nuba tribes which have a history of mutual violence. 
Representatives of the two tribes signed a reconciliation deal in September last year after deadly clashes.
The government had deployed more security forces to the state to impose ""the prestige of the state and the rule of law, and to strengthen security and stability,"" the interior ministry said.
The security measures had helped to stabilise the situation and led to ""a cautious calm,"" it added. Port Sudan is also used by South Sudan to export oil.
Prime Minster Abdalla Hamdok said in an earlier statement he had held several meetings during the past week with community and political leaders from eastern Sudan to address ""the political, security and violence situation"" in the region.
Hamdok is leading a transitional civilian government under a three-year power-sharing deal with the military.

Transit in the other direction, inbound to mainland China, will remain banned at a time when China's aviation regulator has severely limited the number of international flights due to concerns over the spread of coronavirus.
That has caused ticket prices for those looking to return to China to soar.
Cathay will be the main beneficiary of the new policy, which the South China Morning Post reported was aimed at helping students resume studies at overseas universities, given rival Hong Kong Airlines flies only regionally in Asia.
Cathay Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said on Wednesday that opening mainland transit flights would improve its passenger volumes and that it could gear up at short notice to add flights.
He said one-third of Cathay's passengers were transiting the airport at present for connecting flights, down from around 40% to 50% before the pandemic when mainland passengers were allowed to transit in both directions.

Cathay on Wednesday reported a record first-half loss of HK$9.87 billion ($1.27 billion) and warned it did not expect a meaningful recovery in passenger demand for some time.

The New York Times in June reported that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan — including American troops, citing U.S. intelligence officials.
President Donald Trump said he was not told about the information because many U.S. intelligence officials doubted its veracity, although several U.S. and European sources contradicted his comments.
In an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Pompeo declined to say whether he believed the intelligence was credible or if he thought Trump should have been briefed, but said Washington would not put up with such behavior.
""If the Russians are offering money to kill Americans, or for that matter other Westerns as well, there will be an enormous price to pay. That's what I shared with foreign minister Lavrov,"" Pompeo said in the interview, conducted during his official visit to the Czech Republic.
""I know our military has talked to their senior leaders as well. We won't brook that, we won't tolerate,"" Pompeo said.
Last month, U.S. and European sources familiar with intelligence reporting said that the United States had acquired fresh reporting backing up the allegations that Russia had encouraged Taliban-affiliated militants to kill U.S. and allied soldiers in Afghanistan.
The intelligence reporting comes as the United States has been engaged in negotiating with the Taliban as well as the Afghan government to get a stalled peace agreement, struck in February for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, moving.

The 84-year-old king had been released from hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to remove his gall bladder.
In videos posted by Saudi state television and the kingdom's Ministry of Foreign Affairs of King Salman's arrival in NEOM, he can be seen standing on an escalator carrying him from a plane to a waiting car, and walking into a building, surrounded by several men wearing masks. The king was walking with a cane, as he usually does. Reuters could not independently verify the footage.
King Salman, who has ruled the world's largest oil exporter and close U.S. ally since 2015, had been admitted to hospital on July 20, suffering from gall bladder inflammation.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MbS as he is widely referred to, is Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler and next in line to the throne.
The royal family has traditionally spent much of the summer outside the country in places such as the French Riviera, Marbella in southern Spain and Tangier, Morocco. 
However, since 2018 King Salman has spent time in NEOM, the $500 billion flagship business zone that MbS has pledged to build from scratch near the Red Sea.

It is part of his Vision 2030 plan to attract foreign investment and create jobs in a bid to wean the kingdom off reliance on oil. NEOM includes high-tech projects powered by wind and solar energy as well as sports halls, concert facilities and restaurants.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A California businessman who tipped prosecutors off to a vast U.S. college admissions cheating and fraud scheme was sentenced on Wednesday to one year in prison after admitting he participated in a stock fraud.
U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston said that under normal circumstances, Morrie Tobin, 57, would deserve eight years in prison for trying to deceive investors out of $15 million through ""pump-and-dump"" schemes.
But he cited Tobin's ""substantial assistance"" in helping authorities probe not just that fraud but also an ""infamous"" scheme in which wealthy parents sought to fraudulently secure their children's admission to top universities.
The scheme's mastermind, admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer, is cooperating after admitting he facilitated college entrance exam cheating and used bribery to help children gain admission to colleges as fake athletic recruits.
To date, 55 people have been charged, including actress Lori Loughlin, who is to be sentenced next week after pleading guilty. Another defendant, test administrator Niki Williams (NYSE:WMB), agreed to plead guilty Wednesday.
Tobin's lawyer, Brian Kelly, said sending him to prison sends a ""terrible message"" to would-be cooperating witnesses. Tobin must also pay a $100,000 fine and forfeit $4 million.
In court last year, assistant U.S. attorney Eric Rosen said the probe stemmed from an investigation into a California man's stock fraud. That man was Tobin, Kelly confirmed in court Wednesday.
Rosen said the man told investigators he was involved in a bribery scheme with Yale University's women's soccer coach, Rudolph Meredith (NYSE:MDP).
The Federal Bureau of Investigation subsequently secretly recorded a meeting in which Meredith sought $450,000 for designating Tobin's daughter as a soccer recruit. 

Rosen said investigators learned about Singer during that meeting. He said Meredith then agreed to record phone calls with Singer, helping prosecutors build their case against him. Meredith pleaded guilty last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday rejected Ghislaine Maxwell's request for a three-week delay in the unsealing of additional documents related to her dealings with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Lawyers for the British socialite, who faces criminal charges she aided Epstein's sexual abuses, had on Monday said ""critical new information"" had surfaced that could affect Maxwell's ability to obtain a fair trial, justifying the delay.
But in a two-page order, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan said she had no reasonable basis to order a delay, because a protective order in the criminal case meant the new information could not be disclosed.
Lawyers for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The documents come from a long-settled civil defamation case against Maxwell by Virginia Giuffre, who said Epstein kept her as a ""sex slave"" with Maxwell's help.
Maxwell has asked the federal appeals court in Manhattan to block the release from that case of a 2016 deposition about her sex life, also citing the threat to a fair trial.
That court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Sept. 22. Maxwell's criminal trial is scheduled for next July.
U.S. prosecutors are expected by Thursday to respond to a separate request by Maxwell's lawyers that she be moved into the general population at the Brooklyn jail where she is being held.
The lawyers said Maxwell has been subjected to ""uniquely onerous"" conditions, including 24-hour surveillance and numerous body scans, and should be treated like other pretrial detainees.
Epstein was found hanged last August in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, 2-1/2 weeks after an apparent unsuccessful suicide attempt.

Maxwell's lawyers called her treatment in jail ""a reaction"" to Epstein's jailing and death.

Johnson will also meet Ireland's new prime minister Micheál Martin for the first time since the formation of a new Irish coalition government in June.
On his first visit to Northern Ireland since the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson wants to firm up ties badly strained by several years of acrimonious Brexit negotiations.
""As the country begins to get back on its feet in the wake of coronavirus, we cannot simply strive to rebuild, but we must commit to building back stronger than ever,"" he said in a statement.
His message echoes that made on a similar trip to Scotland, where polls show support for independence now outstrips that for remaining part of the union.
Northern Ireland's views on leaving the United Kingdom are still largely split along sectarian lines with many Catholics favouring the creation of a united Ireland while pro-British Protestants favour the status quo. 
The dispute fuelled three decades of bloodshed that largely ended with a 1998 peace deal.
Northern Ireland voted 56 to 44% to remain in the European Union in a 2016 Brexit referendum, when the United Kingdom as a whole voted 52 to 48 to leave.
That angered Irish nationalists, who feared they would be cut off from friends and relatives in the Republic of Ireland, one of the EU’s most enthusiastic members - prompting some to call for a referendum on leaving the United Kingdom. 

The subsequent Brexit negotiations in turn angered pro-British unionists who were outraged at Johnson’s decision to agree a Brexit deal that will see EU customs rates and regulations remain in place Northern Ireland while the rest of Britain goes its own way.

A body was found in a field in Lower Saxony on Monday, a spokeswoman for the Braunschweig prosecutor's office said on Wednesday.
Local newspaper Helmstedter Nachrichten, citing sources, said the dead person was a Volkswagen employee who had done business with the Bosnian supplier group, who was also being probed for potentially illegal recordings of conversations.
A spokesman for police in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, Germany, where Volkswagen is based, confirmed a body had been found in Rottorf, Helmstedt, but referred further queries to the Braunschweig prosecutor's office. 
The Braunschweig prosecutor's office declined to comment on whether the dead person was a Volkswagen employee, adding that it had not yet been possible to formally confirm the identity of the deceased.
The Braunschweig prosecutor's office however said its staff were now looking at whether the death was linked to the staffer at the centre of the VW eavesdropping probe, and whether there were links to an arson attack on the VW staff member's house in May.
Preliminary findings by forensic staff, who examined the body on Tuesday, had shown no obvious signs of ""outside interference"" which may have caused the death, the prosecutor's office said. 
Volkswagen on Wednesday said it would be inappropriate to speculate on the matter given that the carmaker had not received official notification about a possible death of one of its employees, and could not comment on an ongoing investigation. 
Volkswagen earlier this month said one of its employees had been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation into eavesdropping.
Volkswagen and the Bosnian supplier group fell out in 2016 in a disagreement over pricing, prompting Car Trim and ES Automobilguss, both part of Bosnia's Prevent Group, to halt deliveries of seat covers and cast iron parts for gear boxes, causing production losses at six of VW's factories.
VW and Prevent have since been involved in claims and counterclaims for damages caused by the dispute. 
A spokesman for Prevent Group on Wednesday declined to comment on the death. ""It is a tragic event. There is nothing more to be said about it,"" he said.

Charges were first brought against Marsalek in June 22, and his status as a suspect was widely known, but under Germany's extremely strict privacy laws, formally announcing he is a suspect and soliciting public help is a major step. Prosecutors said they believed he was outside Germany.
Munich-based Wirecard collapsed in June after auditors EY refused to sign off on its 2019 accounts because it could not verify 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion) supposedly held abroad in escrow by third-party partners.
The company subsequently filed for insolvency owing debts of 3.2 billion euros. Three former top managers have been arrested on suspicion of fraud and racketeering in Germany's biggest accounting scandal.
The wanted notice, issued in English and German versions and illustrated with two pictures of the 40-year-old Austrian, one from 2017 in which he sports a beard, and one from last year in which he is cleanshaven, is headlined ""Fraud in the billions"".
""Jan MARSALEK, ex board member of Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY), is strongly suspected of having committed billions in commercial gang fraud, the particularly serious case of embezzlement and other property and economic offences,"" the notice issued jointly by Munich prosecutors and federal police reads. ""He is currently on the run.""
The collapse of the financial technology company was widely seen as an embarrassment for German regulators, who for years ignored warnings from investigative journalists and market sceptics that Wirecard was inflating revenues and profit.

Former chief executive Markus Braun and former finance head Burkhard Ley have been in detention since July 22. They too are suspected of involvement in the alleged fraud.

Reuters television video showed around a hundred protesters in the streets of the capital Ankara demanding better implementation of the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention.
Scuffles broke out between police and protesters as security forces blocked the road and asked the women to disperse, the video showed.
Despite signing the Istanbul Convention in 2011, Turkey had 474 femicides last year, double the number in 2011, according to a group which monitors murders of women.
Many conservatives in Turkey say the pact, ironically forged in Istanbul, encourages violence by undermining family structures. Their opponents argue that the deal, and legislation approved in its wake, need to be implemented more stringently.
The AK Party has been expected to announce a decision soon on whether to remain in the accord or withdraw.

""Many in Europe have a lot of interest for this country. They want to know that there are economic reforms and good governance,"" Maas added.
The resignation of Prime Minister Hassan Diab's government has deepened uncertainty. His cabinet's talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout had already stalled over internal differences about the scale of financial losses. 
Forming a new government could be daunting amid factional rifts and growing public discontent with a ruling class that many Lebanese brand as responsible for the country's woes.
The foreign ministers of Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed on Wednesday on the importance of creating ""beneficial external conditions"" for the formation of a new Lebanese government, the Russian foreign ministry said.
Humanitarian aid has poured in but foreign countries have made clear they will not provide funds to help pull Lebanon from economic collapse without action on long-demanded reforms to tackle systemic graft, waste, mismanagement and negligence.
INVESTIGATION
Some 30-40 people are still missing more than a week after the blast. The Lebanese army said on Wednesday that rescue teams pulled another body from the wreckage of a silo in the port.
Aoun has promised a swift investigation into the detonation of what authorities say was more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored at the port for years without safety measures.
Reuters reported that the president and prime minister were warned in July about the warehoused ammonium nitrate, according to documents and senior security sources.
The presidency said on Wednesday that as soon as Aoun received a state security report on the ammonium nitrate on July 20, the president's military consultant instructed the secretary general of the Supreme Defence Council to ""do the necessary"".
He later tweeted estimated losses from the blast exceed $15 billion, a bill Lebanon cannot pay given its financial crisis.
Sitting amid the debris, Lebanese said the state had abandoned them.
""Who knows what will happen. How will we get back to business?"" said Antoinne Matta, 74, whose safe and lock store was heavily damaged by the blast. Five employees were wounded.
A donor conference raised pledges of nearly 253 million euros ($298 million) for immediate relief. Maas gave a cheque for more than 1 million euros to the Lebanese Red Cross, part of 20 million euros in humanitarian aid from Germany.
""EVERYTHING IS GONE""
The central bank has instructed local banks to extend interest-free dollar loans to individuals and businesses for essential repairs, and said it would in turn provide those financial institutions with the funding. 
Bandali Gharabi, whose photo studio was destroyed, said local authorities had only given him a compensation sheet to fill out. ""Everything is gone,"" he said. ""I just want someone to rebuild my shop.""
Volunteers and construction workers with bulldozers were still clearing wreckage from neighbourhoods, where rows of cars were flattened.
Nagy Massoud, 70, was sitting on the balcony when the blast gutted his apartment. His pension is frozen in a bank account he cannot access due to controls prompted by the economic crisis.

""Where is the government?"" he said, looking around his shattered apartment.

ISLAMABAD/KARACHI (Reuters) - Pakistan's army chief will visit Saudi Arabia this weekend, officials said, seeking to calm diplomatic strains over Kashmir as financial support for Islamabad hangs in the balance.
The two countries are traditionally close and Saudi Arabia in 2018 gave Pakistan a $3 billion loan and $3.2 billion oil credit facility to help its balance of payments crisis.
But Riyadh is irked by criticism from Pakistan that Saudi Arabia has been lukewarm on the Kashmir territorial dispute, two senior military officials told Reuters, motivating General Qamar Javed Bajwa's planned fence-building visit on Sunday. 
""Yes he is travelling,"" Pakistan army spokesman Major General Babar Iftikhar told Reuters, though the official line was that the visit was pre-planned and ""primarily military affairs oriented.""
India and Pakistan have fought three wars over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both claim in full. 
Pakistan has long pressed the Saudi-led Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) to convene a high-level meeting to highlight alleged Indian violations in the part it controls. 
But the OIC has only held low-level meetings so far.
""If you cannot convene it, then I'll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris,"" Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told local media last week.
MONEY AT STAKE
Last year, Islamabad had pulled out of a Muslim nations forum at the last minute on insistence by Riyadh, which saw the gathering as an attempt to challenge its leadership of the OIC.
Qureshi's remarks have revived Riyadh's anger, one of the Pakistani military officials and a government advisor said. 
Saudia Arabia had already made Pakistan pay back $1 billion two weeks ago, forcing it to borrow from another close ally China, and Riyadh is yet to respond to Pakistan's request to extend the oil credit facility.
""The first year (of the oil credit facility) completed on 9th July 2020. Our request for an extension in the arrangement is under consideration with the Saudi side,"" a Pakistani finance ministry official told Reuters. 
Saudi Arabia is also asking for another $1 billion back, officials at Pakistan's finance ministry and one of the military officers said. The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Pakistanis account for more than a quarter of the 10 million expatriates working in Saudi Arabia.
Pakistani leader Khan is also seeking to mediate between Saudi Arabia and Iran, after attacks on Gulf oil interests that Washington blamed on Tehran, though he said recently that was progressing slowly.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition-run congress has opened an investigation into an oil spill that continues to pollute palm-lined beaches along the South American nation's Caribbean coast, legislator Maria Gabriela Hernandez said on Wednesday.
Authorities said last week they were cleaning up the oil slick that washed up on the coast of Falcon state, known for wetlands and nature preserves, but did not provide an estimate of how much had spilled or the cause of the incident. [nL1N2F70W5]
The legislature's environment commission is now asking government institutions, including state oil company PDVSA, for details on what maintenance was carried out at the 146,000 barrel-per-day El Palito refinery, where the oil is believed to have originated.
""We want to know the maintenance schedule, so that we can determine responsibilities,"" said Hernandez, head of the environment commission, in a virtual press conference. 
She said legislators are also asking ""which international insurance, which companies do they have, that can compensate for the damages that the oil industry has caused.""
The spill was the result of an overflow in late July at El Palito's oxidation ponds, Hernandez said, citing research by environment experts who have tracked satellite images.
A heavy storm contributed to the overflow, she said. 
Oxidation ponds typically store refinery waste water.
PDVSA, which operates El Palito, and Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

The possibility that the oil slick could continue to spread westward has set off alarm bells among environmentalists who say it risks contaminating protected wetlands and a bird refuge in Falcon state.

The incident took place on Monday, when a UH-1N Huey helicopter was on a routine training mission near Middleburg, Virginia, and was flying about 1,000 feet above the ground, an Air Force spokeswoman said. 
The helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing at 12:43 p.m. in Manassas, Virginia. One crew member suffered a minor injury and there was damage to the aircraft, the spokeswoman said.
""The Office of Special Investigations is fully engaged with our FBI colleagues on this incident,"" she said, referring queries about the investigation itself to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
U.S. military helicopters regularly carry out training flights around the Washington area. The Huey was conducting an instrument approach into Manassas airport at the time of the incident and was about 10 miles northwest of the airport when it was hit by gunfire.
The Air Force did not disclose additional details, including whether the crew were able to identify rounds of gunfire or where the shots came from on the ground. 
The helicopter involved in the incident was assigned to the 1st Helicopter Squadron, which has approximately 120 aircrew members, 22 helicopters and provides airlift for senior U.S. officials and dignitaries. It also assists with emergency medical evacuation, according to the Air Force.

The conflict between separatists demanding independence from the mostly Francophone state and government forces has killed more than 3,000 people since 2017, with both sides regularly accused of committing atrocities.
In the video, a young woman is seen with her hand behind her back being accosted by several young men, who then slit her throat with a machete and dump her body in the middle of the road. 
The Cameroon-based Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa (CHRDA) said in a report that the victim was a 35-year-old mother of four. It said she was killed on Tuesday in the town of Muyuka by separatist fighters who accused her of spying for the government after she spent the weekend with a soldier. 
CHRDA director Felix Agbor Nkongho told Reuters the incident spoke to a deteriorating security situation in the English-speaking Southwest and Northwest Regions. 
""There is an escalation of crimes against civilians, especially women,"" he said. 
Ilaria Allegrozzi, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, said she was investigating the incident and called on separatist leaders and their supporters to ""stop these atrocities and attacks against civilians"". 
The leader of the main armed separatist faction, Julius Ayuk Tabe, could not be immediately reached for comment. Separatist leaders have in the past denied similar accusations. 
Last week, a Cameroonian humanitarian worker was killed in the Northwest Region, said a statement by the U.S. embassy that called for an independent investigation. 
Representatives of Cameroon's government held their first peace talks with Tabe and the other main leaders of the insurgency last month, but no meetings have been reported since.

The employee was shot at the Carrilu cement and limestone mine in Lualaba province as camp staff attempted to drive away seven attackers, the report said. 
A Congolese national was also injured in the raid, but their condition was not believed to be life threatening. Lualaba's governor and provincial mines minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company said the incident did not affect operations at its Kamoa-Kakula Copper project, a joint venture with  Ivanhoe Mines  (OTC:IVPAF) that is considered the world's largest undeveloped, high-grade copper discovery.
Despite security risks, Congo has attracted billions of dollars in investment from Chinese miners in recent years. In April three Chinese nationals were killed in the northeastern province of Ituri.
Zijin bought a majority share in the Carrilu mine in Kolwezi, near the Zambian border, in June last year for around $38 million, according to the company's 2019 annual report.

BEIRUT, (Reuters) - Stepping into the delivery room where his wife Emmanuelle was about to give birth, Edmond Khnaisser meant to capture their son's first moments on camera.
Instead, he recorded the instant the biggest blast in Lebanon's history sent whole windows crashing onto his 28 year-old wife's hospital bed.
""I saw death with my own eyes...I started feeling 'is it over?' I was looking around and at the ceiling, just waiting for it to fall on us,"" Emmanuelle said, recollecting the direct aftermath of the massive blast that injured 6000 and killed more than 170 people in Beirut on Aug. 4.
Brushing off blood and shattered glass, medical staff instinctively carried Emmanuelle into the corridor, fearing another explosion could follow.
About to faint and shaken to the core, Emmanuelle said she knew she had to focus on giving birth.
""He has to come to life and I have to be very strong,"" she told herself.
Right after the blast, Stephanie Yacoub, chief resident of obstetrics and gynecology at St. George Hospital University Medical Center, had run out the room to help an injured nurse. 
But it was too late and the nurse died. Yacoub hurried back to Emmanuelle straight away to help her give birth, along with Professor Elie Anastasiades and a team of medics.
""There was no electricity and the sun was starting to set, so we knew we had to get this done as soon as possible. And with the use of people's phone lights, he came into the world,"" she told Reuters a week after the blast.
Seventeen people died in St. George hospital right after the blast and dozens were injured, including Edmond Khnaisser’s mother, who suffered six broken ribs and a punctured lung.
Running back and forth between his wife and his mother, Khnaisser said he had one objective in mind, to get his new son George to safety.
As they got into strangers’ cars and out of the blast’s perimeter, the extent of the destruction started to sink in.
They eventually made it to a hospital right outside of the capital where George was finally bathed and cleaned.

""George is very special. He is the light in the darkness, a birth in wreckage,"" Edmond said, showing pictures of his son on the Instagram page he created for the boy they now call ""miracle"" baby George.

In a report published on Wednesday, the inspector general's office said it asked the relevant State Department bureau to conduct further review based on its findings and take action, a recommendation the agency disagreed with.
""Offensive or derogatory comments, based on an individual's race, color, sex, or religion, can create an offensive working environment and could potentially rise to a violation of EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity) laws,"" it said.
A billionaire with no prior diplomacy experience, Johnson was appointed to the coveted post of ambassador to Britain, one of Washington's closest international partners, in August 2017. He is co-owner of U.S. football team the New York Jets. 
The inspector-general's office said it found that Johnson's 'demanding and hard-driving' management style had a negative impact on morale in some sections of the embassy.
The report also gave examples of how Johnson's conduct ""did not always model the principles of the Department.""
""For example, some embassy staff told OIG that when the Ambassador was frustrated with what he interpreted to be excessive staff caution or resistance to suggestions about which he felt strongly, he sometimes questioned their intentions or implied that he might have them replaced,"" the report said.
""This caused staff to grow wary of providing him with their best judgment.""

The State Department's Bureau of European and Eurasian affairs said it did not believe a formal assessment was required, and that instead all staff, including the chief of mission, should undertake training to ""heighten awareness on these important issues,"" according to the report.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile will lift one of the world's longest quarantines on Monday, moving the capital Santiago's central business district and adjoining Central Station to a ""transitional"" stage under a ""Step by Step"" reopening.
""This is a very important announcement for us and one that gives us great satisfaction,"" Health Minister Enrique Paris told a press conference in Santiago on Wednesday.
Chile has faced one of Latin America's fiercest coronavirus outbreaks, at one stage ranking only behind Qatar globally for cases per head of the population, but case and fatality rates have declined steadily over the last two months.
Santiago Mayor Felipe Alessandri said the reopening did not give ""carte blanche"" to citizens, who should remain indoors whenever possible, wear masks in public and wash their hands. 
People may leave their homes on weekdays without the previously required police permissions, and meet in small groups, while businesses can gradually reopen. 
The center of Santiago has a large, multicultural and floating population and contains the presidential palace, government ministries, many businesses and transport hubs. It has been under strict lockdown for 143 days since March 26, shortly after Chile's first coronavirus case was confirmed. Central Station followed a month later. 
The government started to reopen the capital city two weeks ago by lifting the lockdown in suburbs to the east and south. [nL2N2EV1BR]
It has been more cautious about reopening Santiago's densely populated center, particularly the Alameda central thoroughfare and Plaza Italia, where massive and often violent social protests started in October over inequality. [nL2N2790UC]

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al Assad said on Wednesday that sweeping new U.S. sanctions amounted to a new stage of economic warfare against his government and were part of long-standing U.S. efforts to ""choke"" the living standards of Syrians.
In a speech to deputies at the presidential palace, Assad also blamed the sanctions, known as the Caesar Act, for a fall in Syria's currency to new record lows, with panic buying of dollars by Syrians worried about their economic situation.
Assad urged his subjects to support the currency, which has lost around almost two thirds of its value since the start of Syria's nearly decade-old conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and made millions refugees.
""Our support of the pound is a source of our strength,"" Assad said, criticizing a scramble by ordinary Syrians to buy foreign currencies as a safe haven to cushion themselves from skyrocketing inflation.
The pound touched a record low of 3,000 to the dollar in June as many feared the new sanctions would tighten the noose around Assad and worsen Syria's dire economic plight. 
It traded at 47 to the dollar before protests against Assad’s rule erupted in March 2011. 
The collapse of the currency has driven up inflation and aggravated hardship as Syrians struggle to afford food, power and other basics.
Assad said Western adversaries were waging a long-term economic war that Syria could withstand by raising its food self-sufficiency and by cracking down on corruption, which he said was wasting public funds needed to raise living standards.
""The Caesar Act is not a separate case, it is another phase in stages of sanctions that preceded it for years and which have caused huge damage,"" he told the deputies.
Washington says the goal of the new sanctions is to hold Damascus to account for war crimes and deter it from further pursuing the war. The sanctions exempt humanitarian aid.
Earlier, state media had flashed that Assad had suffered low blood pressure for a few minutes while delivering a speech to parliament, before resuming normally, and that it would broadcast it later in the evening.
Assad was shown in a pre-recorded speech asking for a chair to rest after he stopped the address, and in the edited footage he reappeared on television in front of the deputies.
""Doctors are the worst patients, in truth I have not had anything to eat since yesterday. I had some sugar and salt,"" the 55-year-old former eye doctor said, without elaborating.

Health ministry data showed 1,690 new coronavirus cases were diagnosed in the 24 hours to Wednesday, up from the 1,418 reported on Tuesday and bringing the cumulative total to 329,784. The new daily number excluded Madrid, which did not provide fresh data due to technical difficulties.
Since lifting its strict lockdown around six weeks ago Spain has struggled to keep a lid on new infections, with average daily cases rising from less than 150 in June to more than 1,500 in the first 12 days of August.
In scenes reminiscent of the epidemic's March-April peak, TV footage showed air force personnel setting up dark green tents to serve as a field hospital in Zaragoza, Aragon's regional capital in northeastern Spain. 
Set to open on Friday, the facility attached to Zaragoza's University Clinic hospital will be used as a triage centre and temporary ward, the air force said in a statement. 
With 571 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, Aragon has the highest prevalence of the virus in Spain. Navarre, with the second-highest rate, has just 159 cases per 100,000 people.
Despite having some of the lowest levels of the virus, northwestern Galicia issued a blanket ban on smoking on the street and on restaurant terraces when social-distancing cannot be guaranteed.
Under Spain's decentralised government, each region is largely in charge of its own response to the virus, leading to a patchwork of different restrictions and preventative measures.

Wealthy northeastern Catalonia is set to expand a mass-testing program in the coming days to include several neighbourhoods of its capital, Barcelona.

The ceremony marked the king's first public appearance since the nearly unprecedented calls in two student-led protests for curbing the new powers King Vajiralongkorn has amassed since taking the throne after the death of his father in 2016.
The king, as head of state, gave his blessing to the new cabinet members, wishing ""good health and wisdom to have the strength to perform your duties according to your oaths"".
He also expressed a desire ""for the happiness of the people, happiness of the public and for order and peace"".
He did not publicly acknowledge the student protests, some of which defied ""lese majeste"" laws against insulting the monarchy that carry a maximum 15-year prison sentence.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Tuesday that thousands of student protesters ""went too far"" after some issued a 10-point call for reform of the monarchy, which is considered semi-divine in the country's conservative culture. 
So far, no protest leaders have been charged under the lese majeste laws, though two key leaders were arrested on charges including sedition and violating coronavirus regulations on large gatherings before being released on bail.
Wednesday's swearing in of the new cabinet members follows the resignation last month of six ministers under Prayuth, amid ruling party internal disputes as the government faces the growing protest movement.

Among the six new cabinet members are veteran banking executive Predee Daochai as finance minister and Supattanapong Punmeechaow as energy minister.

Taking advantage of hot weather and calm sea conditions, hundreds of people have crossed the Dover (NYSE:DOV) Straits over the past week, many in overloaded rubber dinghies, a development described as ""unacceptable"" by British ministers.
""The aircraft will track vessels and pass information to the Border Force who will then take any appropriate further action,"" a Ministry of Defence statement said. It replaces a different aircraft which undertook similar operations in recent days.
The Home Office, or interior ministry, asked the armed forces last week to help deal with the migrant boats.
The British government has also sought to put pressure on France to do more to stop boats from setting off towards England. France says it is already intercepting many boats.
The two countries said on Tuesday they had agreed to work ""at pace"" to finalise a new plan to shut down the Channel route.
Refugee rights groups say the British government is exaggerating the impact of the crossings, pointing out that the numbers getting across are tiny compared with flows of migrants in many other parts of the world.

About 4,000 people are estimated to have reached the English shore since the start of this year, a fraction of the numbers who have entered the European Union via Italy, Malta, Greece and Spain after dangerous Mediterranean crossings.

STONEHAVEN, Scotland (Reuters) - Three people died in a train derailment in eastern Scotland on Wednesday that left carriages overturned and piled on top of each other on a steep wooded slope, making it hard for emergency services to access the scene.
Dark smoke billowed from the site of the accident for most of the day after the ScotRail train derailed in the morning in a narrow valley near Stonehaven, south of the city of Aberdeen.
Aerial footage showed one carriage detached from the rail tracks and lying on its side some distance down the slope. Another was completely overturned and had two carriages resting on it, one of which was also overturned.
Two air ambulances and about 30 emergency service vehicles could be seen in a field just above the site. With rescue workers hampered by the steep terrain and dense woodland, it took many hours for casualty numbers to be confirmed.
""My deepest condolences are with the loved ones of those who lost their lives in this tragic incident,"" said Nicola Sturgeon, first minister of Scotland's semi-autonomous government.
The British Transport Police said the driver was believed to have been among the dead. Six people were taken to hospital with injuries not thought to be serious, and officers believed everyone who had been on board was accounted for.
The force gave no indication on the causes of the derailment, saying only that it was investigating.
Stonehaven and the surrounding area had been hit by floods in recent days following heavy rain and some reports suggested a landslide may have played a part in the derailment, although that was not confirmed by the authorities.
FEW PASSENGERS
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was saddened to learn of the ""very serious incident"" and his thoughts were with all those affected.
The train appeared to have been carrying very few passengers. The government has been advising Britons to avoid public transport wherever possible as part of efforts to reduce transmission of the coronavirus.
Britain has one of Europe's lowest rates of fatal rail accidents, with a stronger safety record than Germany or France in recent years, according to Eurostat data that includes unauthorised people on railway tracks and at level crossings.
For passengers, European railways are very safe, with just 13 rail passenger deaths across the European Union's 28 member states in 2018, according to the most recent available data from Eurostat. One of those was in Britain.

The worst rail disasters in Britain in recent decades were a 1999 collision between two trains at Ladbroke Grove, in London, in which 31 people died, and a 2001 accident near Selby in Yorkshire, northeast England, in which 10 people died after a car ran onto the track and was hit by two trains.

Speaking to the Washington's Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Institute think tank, Hsiao Bi-khim said Taiwan was facing ""an existential survival issue,"" given China's territorial and sovereignty claims over the island and needed to expand its asymmetric capabilities.
""What we mean by asymmetric capabilities is cost effective, but lethal enough to become deterrence - to make any consideration of an invasion very painful,"" she said.
Hsiao said Taipei was currently working with the United States on acquiring a number of hardware capabilities, including cruise missiles that would work in conjunction with Taiwan's indigenous Hsiung Feng missile system to provide better coastal defense.
Other systems under discussion included ""underwater sea mines and other capabilities to deter amphibious landing, or immediate attack,"" she said.
Earlier, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen told the online event she had made expanding accelerating development of Taiwan's asymmetric defense capabilities its number-one priority. 
Hsiao said Taiwan also wanted to strengthen defenses on islands its controls in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety.
""For Taiwan, our priority in our survival involves building up the defense of Taiwan itself, but also of the islands that Taiwan currently controls in the South China Sea,"" she said.
Taiwan has been bolstering its defenses in the face of what it sees as increasingly threatening moves by Beijing. 
It said in May it plans to buy land-based Boeing-made Harpoon anti-ship missiles and U.S. sources said last week Washington was negotiating the sale of at least four sophisticated aerial drones to Taiwan for the first time.
Washington broke off official ties with Taipei in 1979 in favor of Beijing but is still Taiwan's biggest arms supplier and is bound by law to provide it with the means to defend itself. 
The Trump administration has emphasized its support for Taiwan as U.S. relations with Beijing sour over issues including human rights and trade.

This week, U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar became the highest-level U.S. official to visit Taiwan in four decades, a trip condemned by China, which routinely denounces U.S. arms sales to Taipei.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - China's global economic power makes the communist country in some ways a more difficult foe to counter than the Soviet Union during the Cold War, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on a visit to the Czech Republic on Wednesday.
Pompeo called on countries around Europe to rally against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which he said leverages its economic might to exert its influence around the world.
""What's happening now isn't Cold War 2.0,"" Pompeo said in a speech to the Czech Senate. ""The challenge of resisting the CCP threat is in some ways much more difficult.""
""The CCP is already enmeshed in our economies, in our politics, in our societies in ways the Soviet Union never was.""
The Cold War reference came after China's ambassador to London last month warned that the United States was picking a fight with Beijing ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.
U.S.-China ties have quickly deteriorated this year over a range of issues including Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus; telecoms-equipment maker Huawei; China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea; and the clampdown on Hong Kong.
Pompeo's visit to the Czech Republic, part of the Soviet bloc until the 1989 democratic Velvet Revolution, marked the first stop on a swing through the region to discuss cyber and energy security.
He used the occasion to swipe at both Russian and Chinese influence and lauded officials in the central European nation of 10.7 million who took on Beijing over the past year.
He cited the Czech Republic's efforts to set security standards for the development of 5G telecommunications networks after a government watchdog warned about using equipment made by China's Huawei.
Pompeo and Prime Minister Andrej Babis signed a declaration on 5G security in May, but the country has not made an outright decision to ban Huawei technology. Its President Milos Zeman has been promoting closer ties with China. 
Pompeo also acknowledged the chairman of the Czech Senate Milan Vystrcil, who followed through on a plan by his deceased predecessor to visit Taiwan at the end of this month, a trip that has angered China. 
Pompeo said some nations in Europe would take longer to wake up to the threats, but there was a positive momentum. 
""The tide has turned (in the United States), just as I see it turned here in Europe as well. The West is winning, don't let anyone tell you about the decline of he West,"" he said. 

""It will take all of us... here in Prague, in Poland, in Portugal. We have the obligation to speak clearly and plainly to our people, and without fear. We must confront complex questions... and we must do so together,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Last year was one of the three warmest on record, with glaciers melting, sea levels rising and a spate of wildfires, heatwaves and droughts, research published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS) showed.
The BAMS annual State of the Climate Report, by 528 climate scientists from 61 countries, said only 2015 and 2016 were hotter than 2019, based on records dating to the mid- to late 1800s.
Each decade since 1980 has been successively warmer than the preceding one, with the most recent (2010-2019) being around 0.2 degrees Celsius warmer globally than the previous (2000–09).
For the 32nd consecutive year, 2019 saw the loss of mass from mountain glaciers, while lake temperatures were above the long-term average and permafrost temperatures continued to rise.
In 2019, global mean sea level set a new record for the eighth year running, reaching 87.6 mm above the 1993 average when satellite measurements began, with an annual average increase of 6.1 mm from 2018, the report said.
Greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change and pollution, increased. Carbon dioxide emissions rose by 2.5 parts per million (ppm), nitrous oxide by 1 part per billion (ppb) and methane by 9.2 parts per billion, the report said.
""A number of extreme events, such as wildfires, heatwaves and droughts, have at least part of their root linked to the rise in global temperature,"" said Robert Dunn from the UK's Met Office, which contributed to the report.
""The rise in global temperature is linked to another climate indicator: the ongoing rise in emissions of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane.""
Pressure is building for governments to do more to limit emissions to maximise the chances of capping a rise in average global temperatures at 1.5C, a goal enshrined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

The deal, worth about $1 billion, will be managed through the Foreign Military Sales programme and will be concluded by the end of September, MTI added.
Hungary has long vowed to increase its military spending, which as in many NATO countries remains far short of the alliance's goal of 2 percent of economic output. Much of its military infrastructure dates back to communist times.
It recently purchased tanks from Germany and is renewing its air capabilities as well, and Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has put more focus on the military than most governments in past decades, when economic improvement was the priority.
Defence Minister Tibor Benko said things had changed.
""We see that the peace that we live in is an extremely vulnerable situation,"" he said, adding that extended beyond armed conflict into hybrid warfare such as in Crimea.
Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, was one reason why Western allies have criticised Hungary for its closeness with Moscow. Orban campaigned for Western sanctions against Russia to be eased.
Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto announced at a 2019 press briefing with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Budapest that the two countries were discussing the procurement of American air defence systems.

931,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>","British fossil hunters find bones of new dinosaur species, cousin to T.Rex","LONDON (Reuters) - Four bones found on a beach on the Isle of Wight, off England's south coast, belong to a new species of theropod dinosaur, the group that includes Tyrannosaurus rex, researchers at the University of Southampton said on Wednesday.
The new dinosaur, which has been named Vectaerovenator inopinatus, lived in the Cretaceous period 115 million years ago and was estimated to have been up to four metres long, the palaeontologists said.
The name refers to the large air spaces found in the bones, which were discovered on the foreshore at Shanklin, a seaside resort on the island, last year.
The air sacs, which are also seen in modern birds, were extensions of the lung, the researchers said, and it is likely they helped fuel an efficient breathing system while also making the skeleton lighter.
One of the finders, Robin Ward, a regular fossil hunter from Stratford-upon-Avon in central England, said: ""The joy of finding the bones we discovered was absolutely fantastic."" 
""I thought they were special and so took them along when we visited Dinosaur Isle Museum,"" he said. ""They immediately knew these were something rare and asked if we could donate them to the museum to be fully researched.""
James Lockyer, from Spalding, Lincolnshire, in east England, was also visiting the island when he found another of the bones. 
""I was searching a spot at Shanklin and had been told and read that I wouldn't find much there,"" he said. ""However, I always make sure I search the areas others do not, and on this occasion it paid off.""
Chris Barker, a doctoral student who led the study, said: ""We were struck by just how hollow the animal was – it's riddled with air spaces. Parts of its skeleton must have been rather delicate.""
It is likely that the Vectaerovenator lived in an area just north of where its remains were found, with the carcass having washed out into the shallow sea nearby, the researchers said.

Tourism generated 63 billion rupees ($1.6 billion) for the economy last year. In May, the central bank said that in the past two months alone, the nation had lost 12 billion rupees in foreign exchange due to the fall in tourism. 
Willow River-Tonkin, who owns a kite-surfing business, said local guides would be some of the hardest hit. 
""It is really going to affect the communities down there, especially for the fisherman, the local guys that live there, you know that's how they make money from tourists,"" said 
""Taking them out to go diving to go snorkelling, to go wake boarding, to go see dolphins and all that sort of thing you know and all of that is going to affect it, if we don't get it under control very soon.""
The MV Wakashio, owned by Nagashiki Shipping and operated by Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd, struck a reef and went aground off the Indian Ocean island's southeast coast on July 25. It began leaking oil last Thursday. 
Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth declared a state of emergency last Friday. 
Romina Tello, the 30-year-old founder of sustainable tourism agency Mauritius Conscious, said that border closures due the coronavirus had already battered tourism. Mauritius shut its borders on March 19 and has had only 344 cases of COVID-19, of which 332 have recovered and 10 have died. 
It is still closed to international air travel. 
The southeast coast where the oil spill happened is famous for snorkelling, kite surfing and people visiting the sea flora and the fauna of Mauritius, Tello said, as well as sailing, as boats tend to travel to the islands nearby.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Wednesday said two former presidents should have to testify about corruption after a former head of state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) accused former officials of involvement in bribes. 
Former Pemex Chief Executive Emilio Lozoya on Tuesday filed a complaint saying former President Enrique Pena Nieto and his finance minister, Luis Videgaray, had instructed him to direct bribes to Pena Nieto's 2012 election campaign and to buy votes in Congress.
Lopez Obrador called on Lozoya, who headed Pemex from 2012 to 2016, to come forward with evidence to back his accusations, and said Pena Nieto's predecessor, Felipe Calderon, should also have to testify along with several unnamed lawmakers.
""Ex-President Calderon, ex-President Pena (Nieto), the lawmakers that are mentioned, the senators, all those mentioned have to testify,"" Lopez Obrador said at his daily morning news conference.
""They all have to testify ... them being guilty, that's another story,"" said Lopez Obrador.
Calderon's media office said the former president's position was that any evidence against him should be brought forward. 
""They should stop using the attorney general's office as an apparatus for political persecution,"" the media office said.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach a representative of Pena Nieto. 
Lopez Obrador's naming of Calderon appeared to reflect part of Lozoya's complaint that Attorney General Alejandro Gertz said referred to irregularities in the construction of a petrochemical plant.
Lozoya's allegations raise the stakes in an anti-corruption drive that Lopez Obrador has put at the heart of his agenda ahead of midterm elections next year.

According to Gertz, Lozoya said he received more than 100 million pesos ($4.5 million) from Brazilian firm Odebrecht, most of which went to advisers in Pena Nieto's election campaign. Odebrecht has previously admitted to paying bribes in Mexico.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The St. George Hospital where Soha Khalaf works as a nurse lies less than a mile from Beirut port. She had no time to recover from the enormous explosion that blasted over the city.
The ceiling crashed onto her head and tears streamed down her face, but she stuck to her task. 
""People ran here yelling, 'please we need the ER.' But the ER was gone. And wherever I turned, I saw staff rushing down from other floors screaming,"" recalled Khalaf, assistant head nurse at the emergency room of Lebanon's oldest hospital. 
Needles flew across the hall. Blood covered the floor. The lights went off. 
Hundreds of people poured in from across the Lebanese capital after the Aug. 4 warehouse blast, which killed more than 170 people and demolished neighbourhoods. 
""We just kept working, even as some of us bled, and we cried and cried."" 
With her colleagues, Khalaf stitched, intubated and bandaged victims on the pavement outside the ER. They stopped random cars to send patients to other hospitals, and relied on light from mobile phones as it got dark. 
Across Beirut, doctors and nurses recounted a night of horror that shook up veteran medical workers in a city no stranger to explosions.
The aftermath of the blast has also raised fears for a healthcare system in tatters, already fighting a coronavirus oubtreak which has seen 87 deaths and more than 7,100 cases since February.
Beirut's hospitals - which long attracted patients from around the region - have also been wrestling with the country's financial meltdown since late last year. 
There are shortages in everything from dialysis equipment to syringes, with the state owing hospitals millions of dollars in arrears.
Now with hospitals turned into trauma centers and coronavirus cases still rising, some healthcare workers are asking: how can the system cope?
""THE KNOCKOUT""
On the night of the blast, hospitals used two months' worth of supplies, said Rona Halabi, spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The explosion, which injured more than 6,000 people, knocked out three hospitals in Beirut and damaged 12 other facilities. Days later, pressure piled on thanks to hundreds of injuries at protests against Lebanon's leaders. 
""These times are unparalleled to say the least,"" Halabi said, warning that the need for mental health care was also rising after scores of people suffered trauma.
""I have seen many explosions and a war. But I've never seen what I saw on August 4,"" said Khalaf, who has worked at St. George for 28 years. 
The blast killed four nurses there. A few floors above, a doctor had delivered a baby as the building shook.
The next day, Khalaf and her friends returned to help clear rubble from the blast, which officials blamed on explosive material stored in unsafe conditions at the port.
When the shockwaves hit Naji Abi Rached's hospital all 17 elevators crashed. Staff had to carry some patients down eight flights of stairs. They could not evacuate patients in the COVID-19 ward.
Abi Rached, medical director at the nonprofit Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, said the virus could now spread faster. With nearly a quarter of a million people homeless, the risk has grown. Lebanon recorded on Tuesday 300 new infections and seven deaths. 
""This blast dealt the final blow, the knockout,"" he said.
Still, a week later, with the help of volunteers, the ER was running again. The dialysis center also opened, although with shattered windows. 
For Beatrice Karam, a nephrologist who returned to Beirut after living abroad, the past week killed any hope for stability. Many of her friends felt the same, she said, warning of a looming exodus of doctors. 

""It's like there was a blast inside of me too. And I had no feelings anymore, and I just want to leave.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Baton-wielding police patrolled barricaded and deserted streets in parts of the southern Indian tech hub of Bengaluru on Wednesday, after three people were killed in overnight clashes triggered by a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post offensive to Muslims.
The violence began late on Tuesday, with mobs pelting stones, burning vehicles and setting a police station on fire, and lasted until the early hours of Wednesday. Dozens of people were wounded.
""Seeing that much fire, smoke and the violence was really scary. I was really frightened. We've only seen such things on TV,"" said Ahan Khan, a college student who lives near the police station in northeast Bengaluru.
Police said the person responsible for the offensive post, which has since been deleted, had been arrested. A spokesman for Facebook said it was investigating, adding its standards prohibit hate speech and incitement to violence.
Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant said his officers had initially tried to hold back around 1,000 protesters using batons and tear gas, but then opened fire.
""The police had no escape and they had to resort to firing and three people died,"" Pant said, adding that 110 people had been arrested for alleged vandalism and attacking the police.
The three victims were Muslim men aged between 19 and 21, said Rizwan Arshad, a Congress party lawmaker in Bengaluru, who reached the police station amid the violence on Tuesday night to appeal for calm.
A medical officer at the government-run Bowring hospital said they had treated at least 27 injured policemen and 12 protesters, including three who had suffered gunshot wounds.
A police official said an emergency law prohibiting gatherings had been imposed in Bengaluru, a city of 12 million people known as India's Silicon Valley.
Police gave the first name of the accused man as Naveen, and said he was the nephew of a Congress politician, whose house was attacked and burnt in the violence.
The politician, R. Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy, appealed for calm in a video message carried by media.
""We're all brothers. Whatever crime has been committed, let the law teach them a lesson,"" Murthy said. ""I appeal to our Muslim brothers and everyone else to maintain peace.""
Television channels on Tuesday night showed a group of people gathered outside a police station, clashing with officers and burning several police vehicles.
On Wednesday afternoon, charred remains of several cars and motorcycles were strewn across the basement parking lot of D.J. Halli police station, the facade of which was also scarred by fire.
Nearby streets were lined with burnt vehicles, with all shops shuttered along the nearly two-km stretch where the police station is located.

""We are investigating the issue and will make use of the CCTV footage to see who is behind these violent acts, and will take stringent actions,"" said Basavraj Bommai, home minister of Karnataka state, where Bengaluru is located.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey wants to resolve its dispute with Greece over energy exploration in the eastern Mediterranean through dialogue, Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said on Wednesday, while vowing to defend Turkey's coastal interests.
Turkey and Greece, NATO allies, vehemently disagree over overlapping claims to hydrocarbon resources in the region based on conflicting views on the extent of their continental shelves in waters dotted with mostly Greek islands.
Tensions rose when Ankara sent an exploration vessel on Monday to a disputed area of the Mediterranean, accompanied by warships. Greece says the Oruc Reis is operating illegally in its continental shelf, accusations which Ankara has dismissed.
""Despite all this, we want to believe that common sense will prevail. Both on the field and at the table, we side with international law, good neighbourliness and dialogue,"" Akar told Reuters. ""We want to reach political solutions through peaceful means in line with international laws.""
However, he added that Turkey would continue to defend its ""rights, ties and interests"" in coastal waters. ""It should be known that our seas are our blue homeland. Every drop is valuable,"" he said.
Turkey says it has the longest coastline in the eastern Mediterranean but that it is penned in to a narrow strip of waters due to the extension of Greece's continental shelf, based on the presence of many Greek islands near its shore.
Akar singled out the Greek island of Kastellorizo, some 2 km off Turkey's southern coast and 570 km from the Greek mainland, as a particular source of Turkish frustration.
""Greece's demand for a 40,000 square kilometre maritime jurisdiction zone because of the 10 km square Meis island (Kastellorizo)...cannot be reconciled with any logic,"" he said.
Greece's claim to the waters around Kastellorizo is based on a U.N. maritime convention endorsed by many countries, but not Turkey.
Ankara said on Tuesday it would issue new exploration and drilling licences in the eastern Mediterranean, while Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias urged Turkey to ""immediately leave the Greek continental shelf"", saying Athens was determined to defend its rights.
European Union foreign ministers will discuss the issue in an emergency teleconference on Friday at the request of the Greek government. Dendias will also meet his U.S. counterpart Mike Pompeo in Vienna on Friday to discuss the dispute.

Security Council to extend an arms embargo on Tehran would fail, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech on Wednesday, a day after U.S. officials circulated a revised proposal.
Washington streamlined its bid on Tuesday to win more support in the 15-member Security Council but it is unlikely to overcome opposition by veto powers Russia and China to extending the weapons embargo that ends in October under Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers.
""Until today, the U.S. has failed politically, and it will fail again...if such a resolution is passed...Its initiators will be responsible for the consequences,” said Rouhani, without elaborating on what Tehran's reaction could be. 
The new U.S. resolution would extend Iran's arms ban ""until the Security Council decides otherwise,"" stating it is “essential to the maintenance of international peace and security”.
The previous U.S. draft resolution was described by diplomats and analysts as “maximalist”. It would have required countries to inspect cargo going to or coming from Iran and included an annex of individuals and entities for targeted sanctions.
Separately, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the revised U.S. draft was a “very illegal"" resolution.
""I am certain that the Security Council will reject (it)."" 
Although U.S. President Donald Trump exited the nuclear deal in 2018, Washington has threatened to use a provision in the accord to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran if the Security Council does not extend the arms embargo indefinitely.
Renewed sanctions - a move known as ""snapback"" - would likely kill the nuclear deal, under which Iran agreed to curb its sensitive uranium enrichment programme in exchange for lifting most sanctions on Tehran.

Washington has reimposed harsh economic and financial sanctions on the Islamic Republic since 2018. In retaliation, Iran has gradually scaled back its commitments set by the nuclear deal.

LAGOS (Reuters) - A Nigerian court made the first convictions under a new anti-piracy law, giving hope to the world's shipping fleets that legal reforms will help stem rising attacks in the Gulf of Guinea.
The three men fined by the court in Port Harcourt, Nigeria's oil hub, on Tuesday were among nine accused of hijacking the tanker MV Elobey VI off Equatorial Guinea in March and securing a $200,000 ransom for the crew. 
The merchant shipping industry has long pressed Nigeria to take action in the area, which has been dubbed ""pirate alley."" 
It accounts for over 90% of maritime kidnappings globally, according to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), with attacks on everything from oil platforms to fishing vessels. 
The court fined the three men convicted 10 million naira ($26,300) each for each of the two counts of piracy to which they pleaded guilty.
The remaining six pleaded not guilty and their trial continues. 
Nigerian navy spokesman Commodore Suleiman Dahun said the convictions were the first conviction under the law, passed last year to make it easier to prosecute pirates. 
He said the fines were levied in lieu of prison sentences.
While the Gulf of Guinea spans more than a dozen West African countries, experts say the pirates typically come from Nigeria's oil-rich but poverty-stricken Delta region. 
Previously, attackers rarely faced judicial consequences as piracy was not illegal under Nigerian law. 
A total of 49 crew were kidnapped in the Gulf in the first half of this year, compared with 27 last year, according to IMB figures. It said attackers were also going further out to sea.
""We need to change the risk-to-reward ratio...,"" IMB Director Michael Howlett said last month. ""Without an appropriate and proportionate deterrent, pirates and robbers will get more ruthless and more ambitious.""

NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR (Reuters) - India is considering offering young Kashmiri militants an escape from a life of violence by temporarily resettling them in more peaceful parts of the country, according to the top military commander in the Kashmir Valley.
Lieutenant General B.S. Raju revealed the plan for a new scheme to offer a way out of militancy during a telephone interview from his headquarters in Srinagar, Kashmir's main city. 
He told Reuters recommendations had been submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and that the plan, while not finalised, was in an advanced stage. 
""These are young boys who need to be taken care of for a period of time,"" Raju said, adding that could involve temporarily settling them outside of Muslim-majority Kashmir.
Past efforts to persuade fighters to put down their guns have had mixed success. But Raju said the military had recommended the schme take a longer-term approach to rehabilitating ex-militants.
""The bottom-line is that it will have a structure that will help and give confidence to the people who are opting to surrender,"" Raju said.
More than 50,000 people have died during more than three decades of an insurgency that New Delhi accuses neighbouring Pakistan of fuelling, by using militant groups to wage a proxy-war across the disputed border dividing the Himalayan region.
India has flooded the valley with security forces - about 200,000 military and paramilitary troops are deployed there. And Raju said militant attacks have dropped by nearly 40% compared to last year.
AROUND 180 ACTIVE
Last August, Prime Minister Modi changed the political landscape by taking away Jammu & Kashmir's status as India's only Muslim majority state, splitting it into two federally-controlled territories and removing the special privileges afforded to Kashmiris.
Promising a concerted effort to develop the region economically, Modi said the move was need to integrate Kashmir more fully with the rest of the country, but critics said it would further alienate Kashmiris.
Pakistan, which maintains a long-standing territorial claim on Kashmir though it denies accusations that it materially helps the militants, has denounced Modi's action.
Since the start of the year, Indian security forces have killed around 135 militants, most of them recruited locally.
The military estimates that there are currently around 180 militants operating with various groups active in the valley, Raju said. Some 70 local Kashmiris are reckoned to have been recruited by these groups since the start of the year, about a dozen less than during the same period a year ago.
""We wish that this should drop further, and finally cease altogether,"" Raju said.
Currently most surrenders are conducted in line with a 2004 policy that provides a lump sum payout of 150,000 Indian rupees ($2,000), a small monthly stipend, free vocational training and cash payments for weapons handed over.
The New Delhi-based South Asia Terrorism Portal estimated that more than 400 insurgents have surrendered since 2004, but after 2007 the numbers came down to a trickle, with only two dozen men giving up arms in the last three years.
Kuldeep Khoda, a former Kashmir police chief, said the scheme had partly failed because the vocational training provided by the government was inadequate.

""If you ask me very frankly, there was hardly any training being given. They were just kept there for a few months,"" he said. ""It was just a formality which was being completed.""

Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth said on Tuesday that the MV Wakashio was still holding 2,000 tonnes of oil and was expected to break up, raising concern of a major ecological disaster. 
""I heard the collection is almost over, but it is hard to tell if there is absolutely no oil left on the ship,"" Yoshinori Fukushima, a spokesman for Nagashiki, said. 
The ship was being operated by Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd when it struck a reef and went aground off the southeast Mauritius coast on July 25. Jugnauth declared a state of emergency last Friday. 
Oil from the stricken vessel has reached some of the Indian Ocean island's most pristine beaches, threatening corals, other local wildlife and the country's tourism industry.
Former colonial ruler France has said it will assist Mauritius with the clean up and Japan said it will send experts to help. The International Maritime Organization is providing technical advice.
Japan P&I Club, the only organisation in Japan that underwrites protection and indemnity (P&I) insurance for ocean-going vessels and coastal ships, said it had yet to estimate the cost of the clean up.
""We are trying to make internal estimates under different scenarios ...including the worst and the best, but we don't have any figures yet that we can disclose,"" spokesman Koichi Miyahiro said.

President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Russia had become the first country to grant regulatory approval to a COVID-19 vaccine, after less than two months of human testing.
The vaccine has not yet completed its final trials. Only about 10% of clinical trials are successful and some scientists fear Moscow may be putting national prestige before safety.
""It seems our foreign colleagues are sensing the specific competitive advantages of the Russian drug and are trying to express opinions that in our opinion are completely groundless,"" Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Wednesday.
He said the vaccine developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute would be administered to people, including doctors, on a voluntary basis, and would be ready soon. 
""The first packages of the medical vaccine against the coronavirus infection will be received within the next two weeks, primarily for doctors,"" he said. 
Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Institute, said clinical trials would be published once they have been assessed by Russia's own experts. 
He said Russia plans to be able to produce 5 million doses a month by December-January. 

Kazakhstan plans to send government officials to Moscow later this month to discuss possible deliveries of the vaccine, its presidential office said.

The meeting between Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo comes days after Turkey dispatched the seismic survey vessel Oruc Reis to an area of sea claimed by both nations, saying it will operate there until Aug. 23.
Turkey has said it plans to issue gas exploration and drilling licences in the region, somewhere between the Greek island of Crete and Cyprus, this month.
NATO allies Greece and Turkey vehemently disagree about their overlapping claims on hydrocarbon resources in the eastern Meditteranean, based on conflicting views of how far their continental shelves extend in waters dotted with islands.
Turkey's latest moves, days after Greece signed a maritime deal with Egypt which angered Ankara, have further raised tensions with its neighbour, ending a brief period of calm brokered by Germany. 
Dendias urged Turkey on Tuesday to ""immediately leave the Greek continental shelf"" saying the country was determined to defend its sovereign rights. Athens has also called for an emergency EU meeting to address the issue. 
An extraordinary EU foreign ministers' meeting has been set for Friday at 1300 GMT, and will be held via teleconferene. 
The United States has appealed for a resumption of direct talks between Turkey and Greece, which Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said had been under way for two months until they were broken off last week.

Turkey said the deal with Egypt - which Greek diplomats said effectively nullified an accord between Turkey and the internationally recognised government of Libya - showed it could not trust Athens, and vowed to continue surveying waters that are also claimed by Greece and Cyprus.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday angrily denied the existence of fires in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest, calling it a ""lie,"" despite data produced by his own government showing that thousands of fires are surging across the region.
Bolsonaro last year similarly denied a spike in fires that provoked a global outcry, with the right-wing populist trading barbs with French President Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders.
The president's comments on Tuesday come even as Reuters witnesses in the remote Amazon town of Apui observed smoke blanketing the horizon in all directions during the day and large fires setting the sky aglow at night. 
Fires in Brazil's Amazon for the month of August hit a nine-year high in 2019 and this month so far looks even worse. More than 10,000 fires have been recorded in the first 10 days of August, up 17% from the same period a year ago, according to data from the country's national space research agency Inpe.
But in a speech to other South American leaders on Tuesday, Bolsonaro challenged foreign representatives to fly over the Amazon saying that traveling by air from the far flung cities of Boa Vista to Manaus, you would not see a single flame.
""They won't find any spot of fire, nor a quarter of a hectare deforested,"" the former army captain told a meeting of members of the Leticia Pact, an agreement between Amazon countries to protect the rainforest.
""This story that the Amazon is going up in flames is a lie and we must combat it with true numbers,"" he said.
Bolsonaro interfered in Inpe after it released unfavorable data on Amazon deforestation last year, firing the agency's head Ricardo Galvao who defended his agency's numbers that showed rising destruction.
In his speech, Bolsonaro argued that Brazil has shown itself capable of protecting the Amazon alone because the majority of the forest is still standing.
He said the Amazon is a wet forest that preserves itself and does not catch fire. The media and foreign governments are presenting a false narrative about the Amazon, he said. 
Experts say that fires are not a natural phenomenon in the rainforest, but are usually man-made in order to clear deforested land for pasture.
Deforestation rose 34.5% in the 12-months through July, compared to the same period a year ago. Forest clearances did fall in July, the first decline in 15 months, a point emphasized by Bolsonaro.[nL1N2F913F]
Foreign pressure is mounting on Brazil to protect the world's largest rainforest, an ecosystem vital to preserving climate change because of the vast amount of carbon dioxide that it absorbs.
Global investors managing more than $2 trillion have threatened to pull their investments out of Brazil's meatpackers, grains traders and government bonds if Bolsonaro's administration doesn't take action on Amazon destruction.[nL1N2DV1BP]
Bolsonaro has dispatched the military to fight fires and deforestation since May, with the armed forces working with environmental agency Ibama to combat fires near Apui, according to Reuters witnesses.

950,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",Defectors say South Korea investigations threaten N.Korean 'Underground Railroad',"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - A combination of coronavirus border closures and an unprecedented pressure campaign by a South Korean government keen to engage with North Korea may destroy networks defectors have long used to start new lives, activist groups say. 
South Korea's Unification Ministry said last month it will ""inspect"" 25 defector-run NGOs, citing their failure to file necessary documents, and check if 64 others are following conditions to stay registered. On Wednesday, the ministry expanded the investigation to a total of 289 organisations. 
The sweeping probe comes as South Korean President Moon Jae-in's administration strives to restart dialogue and economic projects with Pyongyang, which is under strict international embargoes due to its nuclear weapons programme. 
The ministry has already revoked the licenses of two defector groups that were sending anti-Pyongyang propaganda into the North, following complaints from North Korea.
Only a handful of NGOs have been investigated since 1998, and just one other has previously been stripped of its license. Without a license, the organisations cannot get tax exemptions and hold fundraisers, though donations are still allowed. 
Some 30 NGOs joined forces to issue a statement urging the ministry to halt what they called a ""discriminatory crackdown"". 
Many of the groups have for decades worked with Seoul behind the scenes to bring defectors to the South via an informal network of brokers, charities and middlemen dubbed the North Korean ""Underground Railroad"". 
Hired and funded by the NGOs, the intermediaries work as guides and offer shelter for defectors during their long, dangerous journey across China into Southeast Asia. 
DEFECTOR NUMBERS PLUMMET
This year, the number of defectors arriving in South Korea plummeted to an all-time low at 147 as of June, mainly because the North closed borders on coronavirus concerns.
Moon's administration had already sharply cut funding and now the investigations are scaring away donors, activists said.
Several NGOs told Reuters the defector networks may never recover, even when borders reopen. 
""Even if the investigation ends up with nothing, rescue networks would mostly be dismantled, defection routes gone and the NGOs closed by then,"" said Lee Young-hwan, the founder of the Transitional Justice Working Group, which works with defectors.
Unification Ministry spokesman Yeo Sang-gi said the investigation does not target defectors and was designed to ensure the NGOs follow rules. 
GOVERNMENT LESS HELPFUL
Activists say Moon's administration has been less helpful than previous governments in navigating the delicate diplomacy to ensure defectors are not caught and forcibly repatriated to the North.
When 13 defectors were detained in Vietnam last year, U.S. diplomats came to rescue instead of South Korean authorities, two sources familiar with the matter said. 
Ji Seong-ho, a defector-turned-lawmaker who previously ran a rescue network, said he managed to help another group of refugees caught in China get to South Korea - despite little help from Seoul officials. 
Ji was astounded more than six months later when the officials said they were still striving to free the group. 
""I was speechless,"" Ji said. ""Government involvement may not always be successful, but how would they get the defectors released without even knowing where they were? In fact, they were already living well here."" 
A foreign ministry official said the government remains fully committed to defector support but some countries' relations with North Korea could complicate its efforts, without elaborating on the two cases. 
When South Korea last year repatriated two North Korean sailors, calling them dangerous criminals who had killed 16 colleagues, some defectors feared they could be sent back, said Lim Il, a novelist who defected in 1997. 
A coalition of 21 Seoul-based NGOs sent a petition to the United Nations last month, requesting a review of Moon's policies. Human Rights Watch and others urged Seoul to halt what they called a ""political crackdown"".

Imesh Pokharel, who oversees the U.N. rights agency's Seoul office, said any restrictions on the freedom of expression must be ""proportionate and necessary,"" calling for Seoul to work with the NGOs to promote North Koreans' rights.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine scientists were set on Wednesday to meet representatives of the Russian research facility that developed a coronavirus vaccine, to discuss possible participation in clinical trials and access to its research data. 
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has lauded the vaccine and offered to be ""injected in public"" with the Russian COVID-19 vaccine, to allay public fears about its safety.
Russia on Tuesday became the world's first country to grant regulatory approval for a COVID-19 vaccine, to be named ""Sputnik V"" in homage to the world's first satellite launched by the former Soviet Union.
Russia's decision to grant approval before completing trials has raised concerns among some experts, who fear it may be putting national prestige before safety.
Health Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire said Philippine experts would meet representatives of the state research facility Gamaleya to discuss trials and would request a ""complete dossier"" on the vaccine. 
""We will see if the allegations are true,"" she told a regular briefing, referring to concerns that its approval was hasty. 
""That is why were talking with them to understand this vaccine,"" Vergeire said, adding that local regulatory approval is required for trials to take place.
The Philippines has among Asia's highest coronavirus case numbers, which rose to 143,749 on Wednesday, two days after having hit a daily record of 6,958 infections. Areas in and around the capital have returned to a strict lockdown to contain the spread.
In July, Duterte made a plea to his Chinese counterpart to make the Philippines a priority if it develops a vaccine, amid concern in developing countries about availability.
More than half a dozen drugmakers globally are conducting large-scale, advanced human trials of their potential COVID-19 vaccines, each with tens of thousands of volunteers.

The Russian vaccine's approval comes before trials that would normally involve thousands of people, commonly known as a Phase III trial. Such trials are usually considered essential precursors for a vaccine's approval.

The SPD on Monday proposed Scholz, the party's most popular politician, to run to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel in next year's national election, when her fourth and final term is expected to end.
The decision marks a comeback for Merkel's vice chancellor, who was last year defeated by two left-wing outsiders in the race to lead the SPD, the junior partner in her conservative-led ruling coalition.
Following Scholz being picked, the SPD rose to 18% in an INSA poll, hitting their highest level since February 2019, while the Greens edged down to 15%. This would enable the SPD to demand the chancellor job in any possible centre-left coalition.
The popularity of Merkel's CDU/CSU remained relatively stable at 36%, according to the INSA poll. This means that the SPD still faces an uphill battle during the election campaign to come in first and secure a stable majority.
Scholz has said that strengthening relations within Europe would be one of his top priorities as chancellor, adding that the EU leaders' agreement to help coronavirus-hit member states financially should not be viewed as a one-off event.

The SPD is hoping that Scholz can win back centrist voters, who in the past voted for the conservatives because of Merkel's relatively moderate agenda. The conservatives so far have not decided who should run as their candidate for chancellor.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States will kick off their annual joint military drills this week but without mobilising U.S.-based troops after scaling back the programme due to coronavirus concerns, a military source in Seoul said on Wednesday. 
The allies have been discussing how to adjust the exercises, which usually begin in August, with the coronavirus threatening to disrupt the travel of U.S. personnel.
The programme involves tens of thousands of soldiers from both sides, though it is largely focused on computerised simulations rather than live field training. 
The exercises will be held from Aug. 16-28 but in a reduced scale, though the timeframe was extended by a couple of days to disperse participants and minimise night activities, the military source said, adding that a formal announcement would soon be made. 
Seoul's defence ministry spokesman said the plans have not yet been finalised. Jacqueline Leeker, a spokeswoman for U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), said regular training is aimed at maintaining ""trust, proficiency and readiness"" but did not provide details. 
The 28,500-strong USFK has reported at least 65 COVID-19 cases among its troops, employees and their families since July, prompting concerns among some South Korean residents near their base. All were confirmed upon arrival or while in two-week mandatory quarantine.
Leeker said the U.S. Army has stepped up its preventive control measures, and requires soldiers to undergo a test before travelling internationally, effective Aug. 21. 
The combined drills are closely monitored by North Korea which calls them a ""rehearsal for war"" and had already been reduced in recent years to facilitate U.S. negotiations aimed at dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear programmes. 
OPCON TRANSFER
This year's exercises also provide a chance to assess South Korea's readiness to take over wartime operational control (OPCON), and the change could complicate President Moon Jae-in's drive to complete the transfer before his term ends in 2022. 
The United States agreed to hand it over on the conditions that South Korea has secured key military capabilities to lead the combined defence posture and effectively counter North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, and that there is a security environment conducive to a transfer. 
The allies will determine whether the conditions are met after three rounds of capability tests, the first of which was done last year. 
The military source said this year's test has ""limits"", as Washington is not bringing evaluators because of coronavirus concerns. 
Park Won-gon, a professor at Handong Global University, said at least 300 evaluators are required for the test. 
""Now that the second-round evaluation is postponed, the final test and the decision will likely take place after Moon's term is over,"" he said. 
""To meet the requirements, resolving the North Korean nuclear issue is also essential, in which stalled negotiations and the upcoming U.S. presidential election play a factor,"" Park added.

The coronavirus pandemic has meant that almost no examinations took place in Britain. Pupils in England are set to receive marks for their A levels on Thursday, exams that are taken generally by 18-year-olds to gain a place at university.
Results were due to be based on the judgement of a student's school and then moderated by exam boards. 
But education minister Gavin Williamson said on Wednesday that students would now have the option of choosing between using their calculated grade, or deciding to go with their mock result, or sit a new exam in the autumn.
That means no-one will get an outcome lower than their mock result, exams that were taken earlier this year. 
Scotland was forced to axe its downgraded results on Tuesday after dismay and protests sparked by an exam board moderation process which led to 75,000 young people seeing their grades revised down.
Williamson said that if English students want to use a valid mock result instead of their calculated grade, they will be able to do so through an appeals process. 
""By ensuring students have the safety net of their mock results, as well as the chance of sitting autumn exams, we are creating a triple lock process to ensure confidence and fairness in the system,"" he said in a statement.

According to three officials, former Mexico City police chief Jesus Orta and 18 others are suspected of embezzling millions of dollars during their time in the federal police under the 2012-2018 presidency of Enrique Pena Nieto.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, one official said the suspects were wanted for creating a criminal network of more than three people, defined as organized crime.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a news conference that the arrest orders were the result of an investigation into the accounts of the previous Interior Ministry, which then controlled the federal police. He did not provide details. 
Orta, who was general secretary of the federal police at the start of the Pena Nieto administration, later served as chief of police in Mexico City, the capital, under current Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum until his resignation last October.
Among the 18 others wanted is Frida Martinez, another former general secretary of federal police described in Mexican media as a protege of Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, who was interior minister for most of Pena Nieto's administration.
Neither Orta nor Martinez could be reached immediately for comment.
Sheinbaum is a close ally of Lopez Obrador and is a member of his political party, the leftist National Regeneration Movement, or MORENA.
Orta also held important posts in the city government under current Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard when he was mayor of Mexico City from 2006-2012, following Lopez Obrador.

DENVER (Reuters) - The family of a 23-year-old Black man who died after a violent encounter with Aurora, Colorado, police officers filed a civil rights lawsuit against the city and its police on Tuesday, alleging murder and routine use of excessive force against Black people.
The man, Elijah McClain, was walking on the street alone in August 2019 when he was stopped by three officers based on a report that he was ""being suspicious.""
According to the complaint, the officers held him in two carotid holds around his neck, tackled him although he presented no physical threat, and medics attending to him administered an overdose of the sedative ketamine which left him unconscious.
McClain died days later in the hospital. 
""Plaintiffs bring this action seeking both accountability for the profound loss of a beautiful soul, and to ensure that Elijah did not die in vain by sending a resounding message that racism and brutality have no place in American law enforcement,"" McClain's family wrote in the complaint.
A spokeswoman for Aurora said the city attorney's office was reviewing the complaint but had no immediate comment. 
McClain's family maintains that he had committed no crime and was stopped unlawfully. Citing previous instances of Aurora police forcefully detaining Black people, they alleged that McClain's case was part of a pattern of racist policing.
The Colorado Attorney General's Office issued a statement on Tuesday confirming that it had launched a broad investigation of Aurora police department patterns and practices that might pose civil rights violations. The office is conducting a separate inquiry into McClain's death, it said.
The case drew renewed scrutiny and public ire in June as protesters against racial injustice and police brutality took to the streets across the United States after George Floyd, a Black man, died in Minneapolis when an officer knelt on his neck. 
The officers' forceful restraint of McClain lasted 18 minutes, and he was handcuffed and on the ground for 15, the complaint said.
""I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe please. I can’t. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe, please stop,"" were among his last words, according to the complaint.
The officers have said McClain tried to take their guns, but there is no body camera footage supporting those statements, the complaint said.
The lawsuit also named Aurora Fire Rescue Department personnel as defendants, alleging that medics failed to care for McClain when they injected him with ketamine, which impaired his breathing. The complaint said McClain showed no signs of resisting when medics administered the sedative.
Three Aurora officers were fired and a fourth resigned last month after authorities found they shared photos of themselves re-enacting the chokehold near the site of the McClain encounter. One of the officers who detained McClain was among those fired.

The Justice Department said last month that it opened a civil rights probe of the incident last year. Colorado's governor appointed a special prosecutor to review the case in June.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Wednesday delayed a key step toward next month's general election, as the country was plunged back into lockdown after the discovery of the first COVID-19 cases in more than three months. 
Ardern said she was suspending the dissolution of parliament, which was due to make way for an election scheduled to take place on Sept. 19, until Monday. No decision had yet been made on delaying the actual poll, she added. 
""It's too early to make decisions but there is a bit of flexibility to move the election date if required,"" Ardern told a televised media conference, adding any date before Nov 21 can be chosen for the election. 
New Zealand health officials are urgently tracing the source of four new cases of COVID-19, all within one family in Auckland, the country's largest city. 
The cluster, the first cases reported in the country for 102 days, led Ardern to announce the reimposition of lockdown measures late on Tuesday. 
Auckland shifted to level 3 restrictions at midday (2400 GMT) on Wednesday, requiring people to stay at home unless for essential trips. The rest of the country was placed back into slightly looser level 2 restrictions. The restrictions will initially remain in place until Friday.
""Stay kind, looking after one another,"" Ardern said, adding that the search for the source of the infection was ongoing. The family had not travelled overseas.
""We know that although we are primarily look for human to human transmission we do need to check whether or not it had something to do with freight,"" she said.
Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the infected family was in strict isolation at home, but one woman had travelled to tourist spots in Rotorua while she was symptomatic.
Health officials were urgently tracing her activities and were prepared to test tens of thousands of people in the coming days, Bloomfield said.
Ardern said aged care facilities would close their doors to everyone but staff and essential deliveries from midday.

A Minnesota judge on Friday ordered the public release of the footage nearly three months after Floyd's death, which sparked nationwide protests against police violence and racism. Floyd was Black and the officer charged with murder is white.
The videos, roughly an hour in length, came from the body cameras of former officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, who were the first to respond to a store where Floyd was accused of passing a fake $20 bill.
The footage began at 8:09 p.m. on May 25 as Lane and Kueng approached Floyd's vehicle and quickly escalated after Lane drew his gun. 
Lane, Kueng and a third officer have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. Derek Chauvin, a fourth officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, has been charged with murder.
Without explaining the reason for the stop, Lane pulled Floyd from the car and Floyd and passenger Shawanda Hill told police he was previously shot in a similar situation. Hill told them he has ""a thing going on"" about the police.
Floyd begged the officers not to put him in a police car, saying he was claustrophobic and has coronavirus before they push him into the back seat.
Floyd then got out, at which point the officers put him face down on the ground and Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's neck for around 9-1/2 minutes.
Around 16 minutes into the footage, Floyd uttered his final words: ""Man, I can't breathe.""
Floyd was on the ground around six minutes before Kueng checked his pulse and said he could not find one. When emergency responders arrived two minutes later, they loaded Floyd into the ambulance rather than treating him on the spot.
It was only when Floyd was inside the ambulance, after several more pulse checks, that Lane began chest compressions. Five minutes later a medic ventilated Floyd, 10 minutes after Kueng failed to find a pulse.

Journalists and members of the public were previously allowed to view the video by appointment, and a British newspaper published parts of the video before media organizations requested they be made public.

MINSK (Reuters) - Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanouskaya said on Tuesday she had fled abroad for the sake of her children after strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko's claim of victory in Sunday's presidential election prompted bloody street protests.
Tikhanouskaya, a 37-year-old former English teacher who took her husband's place on the ballot after he was jailed, fled to neighbouring Lithuania. She urged her compatriots not to oppose the police and to avoid putting their lives in danger.
But unrest erupted for a third night in a row on Tuesday as security forces fired rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse thousands of protesters who took to the streets accusing Lukashenko, in power since 1994, of swindling the vote.
A Reuters witness saw security forces detaining dozens of people and beating protesters in the street. Another saw security forces smashing car windows and dragging some people out of vehicles to attack them. A third saw at least two news photographers being attacked and their cameras damaged.
Car horns blared in solidarity with the opposition, and people marched, clapped and shouted ""go away"". 
The European Union earlier accused Lukashenko's government of ""disproportionate and unacceptable violence"" and said it was reviewing its relations with Minsk.
Although Tikhanouskaya's husband Syarhei, an anti-government blogger, remains in jail in Belarus, she was reunited with her children in Lithuania. She had moved them earlier after receiving anonymous threats about their safety.
""You know, I thought that this whole campaign had really toughened me up and given me so much strength that I could handle anything,"" she said in an emotional video.
""But, probably, I'm still the weak woman I was in the first place. I have made a very difficult decision for myself,"" she said, adding that the political tumult in Belarus was not worth anyone losing their life for. 
""Children are the main thing in life,"" said Tikhanouskaya.
FLOWERS
The mood on the streets of Minsk had been calmer during the daytime on Tuesday, but a Reuters reporter saw riot police parked outside several factories in Minsk amid calls on anti-Lukashenko social media channels for a general strike. 
People laid flowers at the site in central Minsk where a protester died in Monday's clashes.
Lukashenko has compared the protesters to criminal gangs and dangerous revolutionaries with shadowy foreign backers. State media on Tuesday showed detained young men with their hands behind their backs, calling them ""Russian provocateurs"".
Belarus has strained relations with Moscow, though President Vladimir Putin used a congratulatory telegram to nudge Lukashenko to accept closer ties. Lukashenko has long accused Russia of aiming to swallow up his nation of 9.5 million people.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said Tikhanouskaya had found herself in an impossible situation. 
""She apparently faced certain pressure and did not have much choice but to leave the country,"" he told a news conference.
Belarusian authorities said she was not forced to leave but a separate video appearance, apparently filmed at the central election commission before she left Belarus, raised questions about her departure.
In it, she was seen reading from a piece of paper in stilted official language and reversed her earlier stance and asked supporters to accept the election's outcome and stop protesting in order to prevent bloodshed. 
It was unclear if the video had been made under duress or as part of a deal allowing her to leave the country. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Belarus's election was ""not free and fair"" and condemned ""ongoing violence against protesters and the detention of opposition supporters"".
The European Union said its relationship with Belarus was under review, though it declined to comment on whether sanctions would be reimposed on the country.
Foreign observers have not judged an election to be free and fair in Belarus since 1995, and the run-up to this month's vote saw authorities jail Lukashenko's rivals and open criminal investigations of others who voiced opposition.

Tikhanouskaya's campaign rallies drew some of the biggest crowds since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Young people in the South Pacific islands of Bougainville are seizing the opportunity to help reshape the future of the autonomous region of Papua New Guinea as they head to the polls this month to elect a new leader.
The general election is the first since Bougainville voted overwhelmingly for independence from Papua New Guinea at the end of last year, and the winner will preside over negotiations on the terms of separation. 
For Bougainville's younger ""lost generation"", who grew up either under or in the shadow of a bloody 10-year civil war, it gives them a chance to break from the past and elect a civilian president with no ties to the previous unrest.
Two decades after combatants snapped arrows to signal the end of hostilities, there is anger among the younger generation that there has been little economic progress for the resources rich region. 
""It has been wasted on mere politics, and there's nothing on the ground to show for it,"" Pajomile Minaka, a 37-year-old law student, told Reuters by telephone. 
""In terms of bringing sustainable economic development there is nothing. Young people like me believe the government has failed the people.""
Bougainville's 250,000 strong population has a median age of just 20, a demographic that's likely bad news for the ex-combatants among the open field of 25 candidates vying for the top political office.
Younger voters are likely to push for a fresh face, even though prominent figures from the conflict had the advantage of wide-spread name recognition, said Paul Barker, executive director of Port Moresby-based think tank the Institute of National Affairs. 
""There is a strong element of the lost generation missing out and wanting change,"" Barker told Reuters, ahead of two weeks of polling that begins on Wednesday for the five-yearly election.
Bougainville descended into a decade-long conflict in 1988, triggered by a dispute over how the profits from the lucrative Panguna gold and copper mine should be shared and the environmental damage it had caused. As many as 20,000 died during the fighting between the region's rebel guerilla army and PNG forces, and Panguna was closed.
Last year's non-binding independence poll was part of the peace process that ended the conflict, but competing claims over development rights to Panguna still hang over its future. 
Bougainville Vice President Raymond Masono said Panguna should ""play a major role in revitalising Bougainville's economy.""
Younger voters, like Augustine Teboro, 30, said it was time to dispense with the ""old view"" that Bougainville's future relied on re-opening Panguna when it should be making use of its physical and natural beauty by cultivating its tourism, agriculture and fisheries industries.
""Our hope is that this generation will transform our society and not be a generation that will make the same mistakes of the past,"" said Teboro, who heads a Bougainville youth federation.
""We are looking for a civilian leader with integrity.""
ELECTION COMPLICATIONS
With no formal political polling and a diverse list of candidates to replace long-serving president John Momis, the election is considered an open race.
Among the old guard candidates are former president and combatant James Tanis and government-backed candidate Thomas Raivet. Other candidates include Fidelis Semoso, who served in the national PNG parliament, lawyer Paul Nerau and businessman and former sports administrator Peter Tsiamalili Junior. There are also two female candidates, health care professional Ruby Mirinka and former Bougainville MP Magdalene Toroansi.
Polling is likely to be complicated by the first recorded case of COVID-19 in Bougainville, a 30-year-old man who returned from Port Moresby last week. 
The coronavirus pandemic has also thrown a cloud over whether international observers will be able to attend. The United Nations said in a statement the Bougainville Electoral Commissioner had asked the PNG government to invite diplomatic missions in Port Moresby to observe the vote.

""This election will determine the future political status of this emerging nation,"" Masono said. ""The next government must consult with the national government on independence – nothing more, nothing less.""

LISBON (Reuters) - Banging on their flight cases, hundreds of struggling live-event workers took over one of Lisbon's main squares Tuesday night to urge the country's government to help them survive the economic collapse caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Across the world, the coronavirus outbreak and lockdowns have led to widespread cancellations and postponement of events to later this year or 2021. And workers, from sound technicians to stage managers, quickly found themselves in a tight spot.
Lighting technician Joao Perliteiro was one of the many workers who joined Tuesday's protest to highlight the struggles of the live-events industry. Similar protests took place in other European cities, including Manchester, England.
""We were the first sector to close and we will be the last reopen,"" said the 20-year-old, who normally has a busy summer working at music festivals across the southern European nation. ""We are trying to change that. We all need money."" 
During the peaceful protest, organisers projected various messages onto Lisbon's historic buildings, including, ""What do we want? Support, solidarity, work.""
In Portugal, theatres, cinemas and other cultural venues got the go-ahead to reopen in June but many stayed shut, fearing audiences would not show up. Large music festivals have been banned until at least the end of next month. [nL8N2DE41D] 
Salvador Sequeira, 40, director of an events company, is not optimistic about what the future might bring and is unsure when the sector will recover. 
""There are a lot of people in the sector without a contract. These people are completely forgotten at the moment,"" Sequeira said. ""People who work in the sector are going through a very critical situation.""
The Portuguese Association of Technical Services for Events APSTE said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page the government must ""take the necessary measures for the events and shows industry to survive"". 
Some companies have seen their revenues drop more than 80% during the pandemic, according to APSTE.
The sector has long struggled to win government support. Many say the around 30 million euros ($35.28 million) announced for the cultural sector as a whole was insufficient. 

($1 = 0.8504 euros)

While Sunak expects to deliver his budget as planned, it is a sign of government anxiety over a possible autumn COVID-19 spike that he is ready to delay big public spending decisions until after the crisis, the FT said. 
Britain risks a second wave of COVID-19 in the winter twice as large as the initial outbreak if it reopens schools full-time without improving its test-and-trace system, according to a study published last week. 
The government wants all pupils to return to school by early September, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling this a national priority.

In the event the budget is postponed — probably until spring 2021 — Sunak would be expected to produce a ""mini-spending review"" in the autumn, allocating spending to departments for just a single year, the FT said.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealanders on Wednesday scrambled to stock up on essentials as the country's biggest city prepared to go into lockdown again, following new cases of the coronavirus that ended a 102-day record run without any new infections.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced overnight that she was shutting down Auckland after four new cases of COVID-19 were discovered in the city from the same family, despite the international borders' being shut to foreigners and returning New Zealanders put in mandatory quarantine.
The government has said the source of the new infections was unknown so far.
Long queues were reported outside supermarkets in Auckland and across other parts of the country, as people raced to stock up on food and other essential items before the new restrictions took effect from noon. 
New Zealand's biggest city will move back into alert level-3 lockdown, which would mean people should stay away from work and school, and gatherings or more than 10 people would again be restricted. The restrictions will be in effect for three days, until Friday.
The rest of New Zealand will move into level 2, meaning social distancing measures would be applied and mass gatherings would be limited to 100 people.
Health Minister Chris Hipkins told Radio New Zealand on Wednesday that the government was considering making mask wearing mandatory for Aucklanders.
New Zealand's successful fight against COVID-19 was hailed globally, and the Pacific island nation of 5 million was seen as one of the safest places, as the pandemic raged globally.
It marked 100 days without a domestic transmission of the coronavirus on Sunday, but warned against complacency as countries like Vietnam and Australia which once had the virus under control now battle resurgences.
Calls have grown to postpone the national election scheduled for Sept. 19, as political parties suspended campaigns due to the new restrictions. 
""It's going to be very difficult to have an election in mid-September when we are now mid-August,"" opposition National Party leader Judith Collins told Newshub.
Ardern, who is seen winning comfortably, according to opinion polls, has said she has not yet considered the impact of the new restrictions on the polls.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Angry and grieving protesters on Tuesday read aloud the names of at least 171 people killed in last week's explosion at Beirut port and called for the removal of Lebanon's president and other officials they blame for the tragedy.
Gathered near ""ground zero"", some carried pictures of the victims as a large screen replayed footage of the mushroom cloud that rose over the city on Aug. 4 after highly-explosive material stored for years detonated, injuring some 6,000 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.
""HE KNEW"" was written across an image of President Michel Aoun on a poster at the protest venue. Underneath, it read: ""A government goes, a government comes; we will continue until the president and the parliament speaker are removed.""
Reuters reported that the president and prime minister were warned in July about the warehoused ammonium nitrate, according to documents and senior security sources.
Aoun, who has pledged a swift and transparent investigation, tweeted on Tuesday: ""My promise to all the pained Lebanese is that I will not rest until all the facts are known.""
Residents of Beirut were still picking up the pieces as search operations continued for 30 to 40 people still missing and security forces fired tear gas at stone-throwing protesters in the fourth such day of unrest.
""Our house is destroyed and we are alone,"" said Khalil Haddad. ""We are trying to fix it the best we can at the moment. Let's see, hopefully there will be aid and, the most important thing: hopefully the truth will be revealed.""
Lebanese have not been placated by Monday's resignation of Prime Minister Hassan Diab's government and are demanding the wholesale removal of what they see as a corrupt ruling class they brand as responsible for the country's woes.
""We will not forget until nooses are erected (for the leaders),"" one man said at Tuesday's demonstration after he read out some of the victims' names shown on the screen.
ENDEMIC CORRUPTION
Diab, announcing his cabinet's resignation, blamed endemic graft for the explosion, which was the biggest in Beirut's history and compounded a deep financial crisis that has ravaged the currency, paralysed the banking system and sent prices soaring.
""I said before that corruption is rooted in every juncture of the state but I have discovered that corruption is greater than the state,"" Diab said, blaming the political elite for blocking reforms.
Talks with the International Monetary Fund have stalled due to lack of progress on reforms and a row between the government, banks and politicians over the scale of vast financial losses.
For many Lebanese, the explosion was the last straw in a protracted crisis over the collapse of the economy, corruption, waste, negligence and dysfunctional government.
The blast left a crater more than 100 metres across on dock nine of the port, the French ambassador tweeted following a visit to the site by French forensic scientists supporting an investigation into the disaster. 
The Beirut port mirrors the sectarian power system in which the same politicians have dominated the country since the 1975-90 civil war. Each faction has its quota of directors at the port, the nation's main trade artery.
""It's a good thing that the government resigned. But we need new blood or it won’t work,"" said silversmith Avedis Anserlianin in front of his demolished shop.
Diab formed his government in January with the backing of the powerful Iranian-backed Hezbollah group and its allies, more than two months after Saad Hariri, who had enjoyed the support of the West and Gulf states, resigned as premier amid anti-government protests against graft and mismanagement.
Aoun is required to consult with parliamentary blocs on who should be the next prime minister, and is obliged to designate the candidate with the most support. The presidency has yet to say when official consultations will take place.
Forming a government amid factional rifts has been daunting in the past, but it could prove especially difficult now to find someone willing to be prime minister. 
In France, where President Emmanuel Macron has continued to consult Lebanese and regional political players after visiting Beirut last week, some voices in his ruling party say the only possible short-term solution to carry out reforms would be forming a government of technocrats.
""The only thin path I see between the absence of civil society leaders and the rejection of the current political class is a government of technocrats,"" French lawmaker Loic Kervran, chair of the France-Lebanon committee, told Reuters.
Officials have said the blast could have caused losses of $15 billion, a bill Lebanon cannot pay.
Ihsan Mokdad, a contractor, surveyed a gutted building in Gemmayze, a district a few hundred metres from the port. 

""They're all a bunch of crooks,"" he said. ""I didn't see one member of parliament visit this area.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States streamlined its bid on Tuesday to get the U.N. Security Council to extend an arms embargo on Iran, a move that could win Washington more support in the 15-member body but is unlikely to overcome opposition by veto-powers Russia and China.
The new text, seen by Reuters, is just four paragraphs and would extend a weapons ban on Iran ""until the Security Council decides otherwise,"" stating that is ""essential to the maintenance of international peace and security.""
The 13-year-old arms embargo is due to expire in October under a 2015 nuclear deal among Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States that prevents Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief.
The previous U.S. draft resolution was described by diplomats and analysts as ""maximalist."" It was more than a dozen pages long, would have required countries to inspect cargo going to or coming from Iran and included an annex of individuals and entities for targeted sanctions.
Diplomats said that while the new simple draft text might win the United States some more votes, it was unclear if Washington could get the minimum nine votes needed, and they said it was unlikely to convince Russia and China to abstain. 
""Don't let the brevity of the new U.S. draft fool you. The key point is that it authorizes an indefinite extension of the Iran arms embargo ... and China and Russia will *not* like that,"" Richard Gowan, U.N. director for conflict prevention advocacy body the International Crisis Group, posted on Twitter.
""So good chance this U.S. draft will fail by Friday,"" he said.
The United States has asked council members for comments by Wednesday morning. The council is operating virtually so once a vote is called, members would have 24 hours to submit their response. The result would be announced at a public meeting.

If irregularities are proven, the governing party could lose its legal status, preventing it from fielding candidates in future elections, in addition to fines and criminal penalties that may affect its leaders. 
In an extreme outcome, Congress could also declare Duque's presidency invalid, according to procedures for investigating and trying political crimes.
The commission said in a statement that it has ""opened a preliminary investigation against the then-candidate and current president of the Republic of Colombia, Ivan Duque Marquez, campaign manager Luis Guillermo Echeverri Velez and the Democratic Center party for alleged violation of electoral regulations for financing political campaigns.""
The commission is investigating accusations Venezuelan businessman Oswaldo Cisneros gave $300,000 in financial support to Duque's campaign, using as evidence phone calls to Democratic Center director Nubia Stella Martinez that were intercepted by the attorney general's office.
Electoral law prohibits foreign donations to campaigns.
Martinez and Echeverri will have to testify and the Democratic Center will be required to submit accounts from the Duque campaign to the commission, so it can determine the origin and amount of financial contributions.
The Democratic Center said in a statement its finances for the campaign were managed in accordance with the law and using strict donor controls. It will hand over accounting reports to prove it, the statement added. 
Duque, who has grappled with low approval ratings for much of his term, is likely to face more problems amid economic and social troubles caused by the coronavirus outbreak and the recent house arrest of former President Alvaro Uribe, who is Duque's mentor and the head of the Democratic Center.

Protests led by an opposition coalition called M5-RFP have raged since June, caused by contested local elections and perceived government corruption and incompetence.
Tensions escalated in July when police shot dead at least 11 demonstrators.
Regional powers are worried that prolonged unrest could derail the fight against Islamist extremists in the region, many of whom are centered in Mali. Their presence has rendered large areas of the center and north of Mali ungovernable.
Keita had hoped that concessions to opponents, and recommendations from a mediating delegation of regional leaders would help stem the tide of dissafection.
But the majority of protestors appeared unmoved as they filed into Bamako's heaving Independence Square in their thousands on Tuesday, shouting ""Keita step down"" and ""listen to your people"". 
""M5-Rfp demands purely and simply the resignation of Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and his regime to allow for a democratic transition,"" prominent M5-RFP member Ibrahim Maiga told the cheering crowd.

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday said he had ""full confidence"" in Finance Minister Bill Morneau amid reports of a clash over policy between the two men, who also both face an ethics probe.
The Globe and Mail newspaper cited unnamed sources as saying Trudeau was uncertain whether Morneau was the right person to handle the recovery from the coronavirus outbreak, prompting analysts to fret about Ottawa's becoming distracted.
""Of course the Prime Minister has full confidence in Minister Morneau and any statement to the contrary is false,"" said a statement from Trudeau's office, praising Morneau's ""important work.""
The Globe said Morneau was unhappy about how much money Trudeau wanted to spend to deal with the outbreak.
Canada has provided more than C$212 billion ($159.7 billion) in direct COVID-19 support and nearly 14% of gross domestic product in total support. Canada's budget deficit this fiscal year is expected to hit C$343.2 billion, the largest shortfall since World War Two.
Morneau, 57, has been finance minister since the ruling Liberals took power in late 2015.
""To have turnover in such a key role in the middle of an economic crisis ... could rattle investor confidence in Canada and in turn weigh on the Canadian dollar,"" said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York.
Morneau is under pressure over his failure to promptly repay travel expenses covered for him by a charity at the heart of an ethics investigation. Although Morneau apologized, opposition legislators say he must resign.
Trudeau is also being probed over a possible ethics violation after the charity - which has ties to his family - was chosen to manage a major student grant program. He apologized but denied the charity received any preferential treatment over the deal, which has been scrapped.
""The bus has been rolling toward Mr. Morneau for weeks. Market participants understand that he has become a major political liability,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN).
Even so, Schamotta said, ""Rocking the canoe might increase downside risk for the loonie (the Canadian dollar) and for markets more generally. And a distracted government is the last thing the economy needs.""
Potential replacements for Morneau would include Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and Treasury Board Minister Jean-Yves Duclos, the Globe said.

Another possible choice is Mark Carney, a former head of both the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, the paper said. He does not have a seat in Parliament and tradition dictates he would need to be a legislator before being named to the Cabinet.

The head of the country's internationally-recognised government, who has lived in exile in Riyadh since the Iranian-aligned Houthi group captured the Yemeni capital Sanaa in 2015, has been treated for a heart condition since 2011.
He is set to return in a week, the sources said.
Hadi has been on several trips for medical checks and treatment to the United States, most recently in June 2019. 
Yemen's conflict has killed more than 100,000 people since a Saudi-led alliance intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to try to restore Hadi's government, an ally of Riyadh. The war is largely seen regionally as a proxy struggle between Riyadh and Tehran.
The sources said the trip would not delay talks between Hadi's administration and the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) around the formation of a new government. 
Riyadh is seeking to end a conflict between the separatists and the Saudi-backed government, which has been based in Aden for five years after the Houthis ousted it from Sanaa.
The government and the STC, which is backed by the United Arab Emirates, are the main Yemeni forces in the Saudi-led anti-Houthi coalition. But the two Yemeni allies have been at loggerheads since last August when the STC took over Aden.

In July, Saudi Arabia presented a framework to expedite a stalled November deal in Yemen's south designed to end the dispute.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptians began voting on Tuesday for members of a newly created second chamber of parliament, with restrictive measures in place to curb a resurgence of novel coronavirus infections. 
The Council of Senators will be an advisory body without legislative powers. It will include 200 elected members and 100 presidential appointees.
As in Egypt's main parliamentary chamber, supporters of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi are expected to dominate. 
Officials say the Senate will enhance political participation. But the build-up to the elections was low key, which commentators attributed to the coronavirus pandemic, a lack of awareness about the new chamber, and apathy.
Reuters reporters saw sparse turnout at at least five polling stations in the Cairo area, although there was a queue at one of the stations where media were allowed to film.
Election Commission and government officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
In Shubra al-Khaima, on Cairo's outskirts, a man who arrived at a polling station on a company bus said the firm's owner had urged him and fellow employees to vote. At another polling station in Giza, a group of elderly voters said they had come because of a promise of grocery boxes or money.
Sisi was elected president in 2014 with 97% of the vote, and re-elected four years later with the same percentage. 
Last year, a referendum approved constitutional changes that could allow him to stay in office until 2030, widening his powers over the judiciary and establishing the Senate. 
One hundred Senate members will be elected as individual candidates and 100 from a closed list system, where people vote for parties.
The only closed list to be submitted is led by the strongly pro-government Mostaqbal Watan Party, though it included two parties from a coalition that opposed last year's constitutional changes.
""Of course, the government is using us to beautify the picture,"" by giving the impression of political competition, Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, who heads the opposition Reform and Development Party, told Reuters. 
Nearly 63 million people out of a total population of more than 100 million are eligible to vote, according to state news agency MENA. 
Polling stations opened at 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) and will close at 9 p.m., over two days of voting. Results are due on Aug. 19.
Anti-coronavirus measures include sterilisation and nurses at polling stations, and free masks for those not wearing them.

Officially confirmed cases of the virus in Egypt have rebounded slightly after a sharp fall, with some officials and doctors warning of a second wave of infections.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily tabloid responded with defiance on Tuesday to the arrest of owner Jimmy Lai under a new national security law imposed by Beijing, promising to fight on in a front-page headline over an image of Lai in handcuffs.
Lai was released on bail in the early hours of Wednesday morning, flanked by his lawyers, and greeted by a throng of supporters who chanted ""fight till the end"" and ""support apple, have an apple a day"", referring to the pro-democracy tabloid.
Readers had queued from the early hours of Tuesday to get copies of the newspaper, a day after police raided its offices and took Lai into detention, the highest-profile arrest under the national law.
""Apple Daily must fight on,"" the front-page headline read, amid fears the new law is eroding media freedoms guaranteed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
""The prayers and encouragement of many readers and writers make us believe that as long as there are readers, there will be writers, and that Apple Daily shall certainly fight on.""
More than 500,000 copies were printed, compared with the usual 100,000, the paper said on its website.
Mainland-born Lai, who was smuggled into Hong Kong on a fishing boat when he was a penniless 12-year-old, is one of the most prominent democracy activists in the city and an ardent critic of Communist Party rule in Beijing.
His arrest comes amid a crackdown on the pro-democracy opposition in Hong Kong that has drawn international criticism and raised fears for freedoms promised by Beijing under a ""one country, two systems"" formula.
The sweeping security law imposed on June 30 punishes anything China considers secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
The city's Beijing-backed government and Chinese authorities say the law is necessary to restore order after months of at times violent anti-government protests last year, sparked by fears China was slowly eroding those freedoms.
Hong Kong has since become another source of contention between the United States and China, whose relations were already at their most strained in years over issues including trade, the coronavirus, China's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority and its claims in the South China Sea.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday called Lai a ""patriot"", saying Beijing had ""eviscerated"" Hong Kong's freedoms.
Britain said Lai's arrest was further evidence the security law was a ""pretext to silence opposition"", to which China's embassy replied by urging London to stop ""using freedom of the press as an excuse to discredit"" the law.
'DANCING WITH THE ENEMY'
Police detained Lai for suspected collusion with foreign forces after about 200 officers searched the newspaper's offices, collecting 25 boxes of evidence.
Handcuffed and apparently wearing the same clothes after spending the night in jail, he was driven by police on Tuesday to his yacht which police searched, according to media footage.
On his release from a police station, Lai left in a black car without speaking.
Beijing has labelled Lai a ""traitor"" in the past and issued a statement supporting his arrest.
The Beijing-backed China Daily newspaper said in an editorial Lai's arrest showed ""the cost of dancing with the enemy"". The paper added that ""justice delayed didn't mean the absence of justice"".
Police arrested 10 people in all on Monday, including other Apple Daily executives and 23-year-old Agnes Chow, one of the former leaders of young activist Joshua Wong's Demosisto pro-democracy group, which disbanded before the new law came into force.
Chow was released on bail late on Tuesday, calling the arrest of herself and other activists ""political persecution"".
""It's very obvious that the regime is using the national security law to suppress political dissidents,"" she said.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement has managed to sustain broad support across the community.
Shares in Next Digital (HK:0282), which publishes Apple Daily, surged for a second day, gaining more than 2,078% from Friday's close, after online pro-democracy forums called on investors to show support.
Its market value rose as high as HK$5.17 billion ($666.7 million) from some HK$200 million. 
In the working-class neighbourhood of Mong Kok, dozens of people queued from as early as 2:00 a.m. (1800 GMT) to buy Lai's paper.
""What the police did yesterday interfered with press freedom brutally,"" said 45-year-old Kim Yau as she bought a copy. 
""All Hong Kong people with a conscience have to support Hong Kong today, support Apple Daily."" 
In another show of support, long queues formed at lunch time at the Cafe Seasons restaurant owned by Lai's son, Ian, who was also arrested on Monday. 
The United States last week imposed sanctions on several top officials over what it said was their role in curtailing political freedoms in Hong Kong. China responded with sanctions on top U.S. legislators and others.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",French PM: Coronavirus spread may get harder to control,"PARIS (Reuters) - The renewed spread of coronavirus in France could become harder to control without a collective effort to stop a rise in the infection rate, its prime minister said on Tuesday.
The public was becoming careless, Jean Castex warned, speaking shortly before health authorities said new daily infections were up by 1,397 over 24 hours, almost twice as much as Monday, to reach 204,172.
""If we don't act collectively, we expose ourselves to the heightened risk that the rebound in the epidemic becomes hard to control,"" Castex said during a visit to a hospital intensive care ward in southern France.
A health ministry statement also reported 15 new deaths in hospital due the disease, compared to an increase of 16 over a three-day period between Monday and Saturday, with the total death toll standing at 30,354.
France's 7-day moving average of new infections climbed to 1,691 on Tuesday from 1,056 on July 31. The 7-day measure reached a post lockdown low of 272 on May 27, a little over two weeks after France eased one of Europe's strictest lockdowns.
But as in most neighbouring European countries, new clusters have mushroomed as people let their hair down on holiday, families hold reunions and workers return to offices and France is desperate to avoid another full-scale lockdown.
Britain has said it will not hesitate putting more countries on its quarantine list, including France, where hordes of Britons spend their summer vacations.
Earlier on Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron held a video conference with top ministers from his Riviera summer retreat.
During the meeting, it was decided France would draw up new restrictions for the 20 largest cities to curb the rising infection rate and that a ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people would be extended until Oct. 31. 
Some cities have already taken action. Paris on Monday joined Toulouse, Lille, Biarritz and others in imposing a mandatory face mask order in crowded outdoor zones. They are already compulsory nationwide in shops and banks. 
The prime minister said testing was ""more than satisfactory"", with more than 600,000 tests being conducted weekly, but said more could still be done to target those with symptoms, the prime minister said.
Talking of the risk of another lockdown, Castex said: ""no one wants to live through that again.""
Later, on a visit to a Mediterranean seaside resort, Castex said he had started talks with employers and unions with a view to making mask-wearing in workplaces as widespread as possible. 

Hospitals are not at this stage overwhelmed by the uptick in the disease, as the number treated for the infection fell by 33, to 5,012, after rising on Monday for the first time in 10 weeks. The total of COVID-19 hospitalisations reached a peak of 32,292 on April 14.

(Reuters) - Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez has appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump to spare the life of the only Native American on federal death row, arguing the U.S. government was infringing tribal sovereignty.
Lezmond Mitchell, a Navajo, was convicted of murdering a 9-year-old Navajo girl, Tiffany Lee, and her grandmother Alyce Slim in 2001 on the tribe's territory, which spans four states in the U.S. Southwest. 
Mitchell, 38, was sentenced to death in an Arizona federal court over the objection of Navajo officials, who said the tribe's cultural values prohibited taking human life ""for vengeance.""
Under Trump, the Justice Department resumed executions this year after a 17-year hiatus, killing three condemned men in July at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. 
Last month, the department scheduled Mitchell's execution for Aug. 26, angering some Navajo officials.
""It's a complete slap in the face to our values and our justice system and the deference that's owed to us as guest of ours on this land,"" Carl Slater, a member of the Navajo Nation Council who represents Mitchell's home district, said in an interview.
Nez is set to address a clemency hearing before the Office of the Pardon Attorney on Tuesday. In a letter to Trump, Nez said a sentence of life in prison would be ""appropriate to begin to restore harmony and balance to the affected families and to the inherent sovereignty of the Navajo Nation.""
Under the Major Crimes Act, the federal government has jurisdiction over certain major crimes occurring on Indian territory, including murder, but usually cannot pursue capital punishment for a Native American for a crime on tribal land without the tribe's consent.
In Mitchell's case, Navajo officials said they would not give their consent. But John Ashcroft, attorney general under then-President George W. Bush, overrode the objection of federal prosecutors in Arizona. 
In what Mitchell's lawyers deride as a legal loophole, federal prosecutors successfully pursued a capital case against Mitchell for carjacking, a capital crime that is not among those listed in the Major Crimes Act.

(Reuters) - The head of a U.N. investigative body on Myanmar said Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has not released evidence of “serious international crimes”, despite vowing to work with investigators looking into abuses in the country, including against the Rohingya Muslim minority.
Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar (IIMM), told Reuters the social media giant was holding material “highly relevant and probative of serious international crimes” but had not shared any during year-long talks. 
He declined to give details of the material the IIMM had asked for.
Facebook has said it is cooperating with the IIMM and a representative on Tuesday declined to immediately comment further.
Myanmar is facing charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over a 2017 military crackdown on the Rohingya that forced more than 730,000 people to flee into neighbouring Bangladesh.
Myanmar denies genocide and says its armed forces were conducting legitimate operations against militants who attacked police posts.
U.N investigators said Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fuelled the violence.
The company says it is working to stop hate speech and has deleted accounts linked to the military including senior army officials, but preserved data.
The U.N. Human Rights Council set up the IIMM in 2018 to collect evidence of international crimes in Myanmar to be used in future prosecutions.
“Unfortunately, to date, the Mechanism has not received any material from Facebook but our discussions continue and I am hopeful that the Mechanism will eventually receive this important evidence,” Koumjian said on Monday.
His comments followed a move by Facebook last week to block a bid by Gambia, which brought the genocide case against Myanmar at the ICJ in the Hague, to obtain posts and communications by members of Myanmar’s military and police. 
The social media giant urged the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to reject the demand, which it said would violate a U.S. law that bars electronic communication services from disclosing users’ communications.
In a statement last week Facebook said it could not comply with Gambia's request but was working with the IIMM.
Tun Khin, president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation U.K., said in a statement on Tuesday the ""evidence Facebook sits on could be crucial"" to support ongoing cases against the Myanmar military.

Matthew Smith, founder and chief executive officer of Fortify Rights, told Reuters Facebook was ""telling states that even in an instance of genocide, their communications and data are secure and won't be shared with prosecutors or law enforcement"".

980,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 12:13PM ET</span>",Explosions hit U.S. coalition supply convoys in Iraq: sources and military say,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - At least two explosions have hit convoys supplying U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq in the last 24 hours, security sources said, the first on Monday evening near the southern border with Kuwait and the second on Tuesday north of Baghdad.
The explosions, which caused no casualties but did some material damage, are the latest in a string of such incidents in recent weeks. An attack in southern Iraq on Sunday hit a convoy carrying supplies to coalition forces, the military said.
Several thousand U.S. forces are still based in Iraq, leading a coalition whose mission is to fight Sunni Muslim Islamic State militants.
Those forces are also a target for Iran-backed Shi'ite militias, which the United States blames for regular rocket attacks on bases hosting the coalition, and on other U.S. targets such as Washington's embassy in Baghdad.
The militias have vowed to avenge the death of paramilitary commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was killed alongside Iranian military mastermind Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad in January. Political forces aligned with the militias demand a full withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq.
They also oppose Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who took office in May. He is viewed as being friendly with the United States and has challenged the power of Iran-aligned armed groups in Iraq.
Kadhimi is struggling to make good on pledges to ensure Iraq does not become a theatre for power and resources struggles between foreign countries including the United States, Iran and other regional powers.
In a separate incident in northeastern Iraq on Tuesday, a Turkish air strike - part of Ankara's latest campaign against Kurdish separatist militants based in the northern, Kurdish part of Iraq - killed three members of Iraq's border guard, the Iraqi military said in a statement.
MULTIPLE ATTACKS
Tuesday's explosion near the Taji military base north of Baghdad caused a fire to a container on one vehicle, the Iraqi military said in a statement. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast.
The explosion on Monday night near the Jraischan border crossing between Iraq and Kuwait struck a convoy carrying equipment for U.S. forces, three sources from different branches of Iraq's security services and military said.
The Iraqi military denied that incident took place.
Kuwait's military on Twitter also denied any attack along its border with Iraq.
Vehicles are regularly loaded with military equipment at the crossing, the security sources said, and cargo is usually loaded or unloaded before entering or exiting Iraq.
Foreign companies are contracted by U.S. forces to provide security in the area, the Iraqi security sources said.
A little known Iraqi Shi'ite militia group by the name of Ashab al-Kahf claimed responsibility for the attack and published a video showing an explosion at a distance. It said it was able to destroy U.S. military equipment and large parts of the crossing.

ANKARA/ATHENS (Reuters) - Turkey will issue gas exploration and drilling licences in the eastern Mediterranean this month, its foreign minister said on Tuesday, further raising tensions with Greece, which said it would seek an emergency EU meeting to address the issue.
The two NATO allies vehemently disagree about their overlapping claims on hydrocarbon resources in the eastern Mediterranean, based on conflicting views of how far their continental shelves extend in waters dotted with islands.
On Monday, Turkey sent an exploration vessel into a disputed area, ending a brief period of calm brokered by Germany. Ankara said a maritime deal Greece signed with Egypt last week showed it could not trust Athens, and vowed to continue surveying waters that are also claimed by Greece and Cyprus.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara would issue new seismic exploration and drilling licenses by the end of August. ""Our determination is unfaltering here,"" he told reporters. ""We will not compromise in any way from this.""
Backing up Cavusoglu's unyielding tone, Turkey's communications director Fahrettin Altun tweeted video footage of Turkish fighter jets, warships and exploration vessels deployed at sea. 
""Every drop of our blue homeland is sacred,"" Altun tweeted, referring to a doctrine championed by recent Turkish naval commanders calling for Ankara to adopt a more muscular approach in its coastal waters.
Turkey says it has the longest coastline in the eastern Mediterranean but that it is penned in to a narrow strip of coastal water by the presence of numerous small Greek islands close to its shore. Greece and other regional states cite a United Nations accord to support their maritime demarcations. 
ATHENS SEEKS EMERGENCY EU MEETING
Greece will request an emergency meeting of the European Union foreign affairs council, the prime minister’s office said, while Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias urged Turkey to ""immediately leave the Greek continental shelf"". Athens would defend its rights, he said.
In a video call with military commanders, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkey had completed preparations to protect Turkish interests.
The European Union, which has imposed an entry ban and asset freeze on two Turkish energy executives over previous Turkish exploration in disputed waters, called for dialogue. ""The latest developments are extremely worrying,"" European Commission foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano said.
The United States also appealed for a resumption of direct talks between Turkey and Greece, which Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said had been under way for two months until they were broken off last week.
The contacts had led to ""an understanding"" between them, which was then scuppered by Thursday's announcement of the Greek-Egyptian deal, he said.

""The moment the accord with Egypt was announced, we received very clear orders from our president. 'Stop the talks',"" Kalin told broadcaster CNN Turk at the weekend.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 11:56AM ET</span>",Who owned the chemicals that blew up Beirut? No one will say,"By Maria Vasilyeva, Lisa Barrington and Jonathan Saul
MOSCOW/DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - In the murky story of how a cache of highly explosive ammonium nitrate ended up on the Beirut waterfront, one thing is clear -- no one has ever publicly come forward to claim it.
There are many unanswered questions surrounding last week's huge, deadly blast in the Lebanese capital, but ownership should be among the easiest to resolve.
Clear identification of ownership, especially of a cargo as dangerous as that carried by the Moldovan-flagged Rhosus when it sailed into Beirut seven years ago, is fundamental to shipping, the key to insuring it and settling disputes that often arise.
But Reuters interviews and trawls for documents across 10 countries in search of the original ownership of this 2,750-tonne consignment instead revealed an intricate tale of missing documentation, secrecy and a web of small, obscure companies that span the globe.
""Goods were being transported from one country to another, and they ended up in a third country with nobody owning the goods. Why did they end up here?"" said Ghassan Hasbani, a former Lebanese deputy prime minister and opposition figure.
Those linked to the shipment and interviewed by Reuters all denied knowledge of the cargo's original owner or declined to answer the question. Those who said they didn't know included the ship's captain, the Georgian fertilizer maker who produced the cargo and the African firm that ordered it but said it never paid for it.
The official version of the Rhosus' final journey depicts its voyage as a series of unfortunate events.
Shipping records show the ship loaded ammonium nitrate in Georgia in September 2013 and was meant to deliver it to an explosives maker in Mozambique. But before leaving the Mediterranean, the captain and two crew members say they were instructed by the Russian businessman they regarded as the ship's de facto owner, Igor Grechushkin, to make an unscheduled stop in Beirut and take on extra cargo.
The Rhosus arrived in Beirut in November but never left, becoming tangled in a legal dispute over unpaid port fees and ship defects. Creditors accused the ship's legal owner, listed as a Panama-based firm, of abandoning the vessel and the cargo was later unloaded and put in a dockside warehouse, according to official accounts.
The Beirut law firm that acted for creditors, Baroudi & Associates, did not respond to requests to identify the cargo's original legal owner. Reuters was unable to contact Grechushkin.
The empty ship eventually sank where it was moored in 2018, according to Lebanese customs.
The Rhosus' final movements are under fresh scrutiny after the ammonium nitrate caught fire inside the warehouse and exploded last week, killing at least 158 people, injuring thousands and leaving 250,000 people homeless.
Among the still-unanswered questions: who paid for the ammonium nitrate and did they ever seek to reclaim the cargo when the Rhosus was impounded? And if not, why not?
The cargo, packaged in large white sacks, was worth around $700,000 at 2013 prices, according to an industry source. 
UNINSURED
Reuters inquiries have raised numerous red flags.
Under international maritime conventions and some domestic laws, commercial vessels must have insurance to cover events such as environmental damage, loss of life or injury caused by a sinking, spill or collision. Yet the Rhosus was uninsured, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
The ship's Russian captain, Boris Prokoshev, said by phone from his home in Sochi, Russia, that he had seen an insurance certificate but could not vouch for its authenticity.
Reuters was unable to obtain a copy of the ship's documents.
The Mozambican firm that ordered the ammonium nitrate, Fábrica de Explosivos Moçambique (FEM), was not the cargo owner at the time because it had agreed to only pay on delivery, according to its spokesman, Antonio Cunha Vaz.
The producer was Georgian fertilizer maker Rustavi Azot LLC, which has since been dissolved. Its owner at the time, businessman Roman Pipia, told Reuters he had lost control of the Rustavi ammonium nitrate plant in 2016. UK court documents show that the firm was forced by a creditor to auction off its assets that year. 
The factory is now run by another firm, JSC Rustavi Azot, which also said it could not shed light on the cargo owner, according to the plant's current first deputy director, Levan Burdiladze.
FEM said it had ordered the shipment through a trading firm, Savaro Ltd, which has registered companies in London and Ukraine but whose website is now offline.
A visit to Savaro Ltd’s listed London address on Monday found a Victorian terraced house, with a locked and barred door, near the fashionable bars of Shoreditch. No one responded to knocks on the door.
Reuters contacted UK-registered Savaro Ltd director Greta Bieliene, a Lithuanian based in Cyprus. She declined to answer questions. 
A source familiar with the inner workings of Savaro's trading business said it sold fertilizer from ex-Soviet Union states to clients in Africa.
Ukraine-based businessman Vladimir Verbonol is listed as director of Savaro in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian corporate data base You Control. Reuters was unable to contact Verbonol for comment.
THE RUSSIAN
As grief and anger over the blast turn to civil unrest in Beirut, there are signs the Lebanese government's promised investigation has already turned its sights back to the Rhosus and Grechushkin, the man the crew considered as its owner.
A security source said Grechushkin was questioned at his home in Cyprus last Thursday about the cargo. A Cypriot police spokesman said an individual, whom he did not name, had been questioned at the request of Interpol Beirut.
The Rhosus arrived in Beirut in November 2013 with a leak and in generally poor condition, captain Prokoshev said. It had already been beset with problems.
In July 2013, four months before docking in Beirut, the ship was detained for 13 days by port authorities in Seville, Spain, after multiple deficiencies including malfunctioning doors, corrosion on the deck area and deficient auxiliary engines were found, according to shipping data. It resumed sailing after inspection firm Maritime Lloyd issued a cargo ship safety construction certificate, which would have involved a survey of the ship, the data showed.
Teimuraz Kavtaradze, an inspector at Georgia-based Maritime Lloyd, which does not rank among the most prominent and widely-used inspection firms, said he could not confirm whether or not the firm had provided any inspection documents to port officials in Seville. He said he was working for Maritime Lloyd in 2013 but that other staff and the management had since changed.
Seville port officials were not immediately available for comment. Paris MoU, a body of 27 maritime states under whose authority the detention was carried out, confirmed in an email that the vessel was detained and inspected in Seville.
Moldova, where the Rhosus is registered, lists the owner of the ship as Panama-based Briarwood Corp, a certificate of ownership seen by Reuters shows. Reuters was not immediately able to identify Briarwood Corp as a Panamanian registered company. Panama’s maritime authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The ship's charterer, Teto Shipping Ltd, is based in the Marshall Islands and was dissolved in 2014, according to International Registries, which says it provides shipping registry services to the Marshall Islands.
Igor Zaharia, the director of Moldova's Naval Agency, said Grechushkin was Teto Shipping's director. 
The Rhosus' captain passed Reuters an email address that he and the crew had been using for Teto Shipping, but requests for comment to the same address went unanswered. The captain said he regarded Grechushkin and Teto as the same entity.

Lawrence was 18 when he was killed in an unprovoked racist attack in Eltham, southeast London. Police quickly identified five suspects but bungled the investigation. Two of the suspects were eventually convicted in 2012, three remain at large.
""It is well known that other suspects were also involved in the events which unfolded that night and it is deeply frustrating that we have been unable to bring them to justice,"" said Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick.
After relentless campaigning by Lawrence's parents, Doreen and Neville Lawrence, the failed police response to the murder was exposed in a public inquiry that became a watershed moment in the history of race relations in Britain.
The inquiry, published in 1999, found the Metropolitan Police was ""institutionally racist"" and recommended 70 reforms to the force and other institutions in an effort to combat racism in society as a whole.
It also led to the scrapping of the double jeopardy legal principle, which prevented a suspect from being tried twice for the same crime.
This allowed police to renew their efforts to prosecute suspects after failed attempts in the 1990s. After a forensic breakthrough, two of the original suspects, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were tried in 2011 and convicted in 2012.
In 2013, police began a new phase of the investigation to try and prosecute the remaining suspects.
Tuesday's announcement brought the active investigation to an end. From now on, detectives will review any new information that comes to light, and assess every two years whether any advances in forensic techniques could allow them to make progress.
Since the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis and subsequent Black Lives Matter protests, allegations of racism in policing in London have once more come into focus.
Black people are over nine times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, according to civil rights group Liberty.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's supply of antiviral drug remdesivir and generic equivalents is stabilising after shortages of the vital COVID-19 medicine at hospitals, according to a top executive at one of the country's big drugmakers, Cipla Ltd.
Remdesivir, made by U.S.-based  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD), has been in high demand globally, and a handful of companies including Cipla are authorised to make and sell generic versions in 127 developing nations.
Cipla's launch of remdesivir in late June, along with subsequent launches by others, has helped ease supply bottlenecks in India, Cipla's Global Chief Financial Officer, Kedar Upadhye, told Reuters.
""Of late, some of the complaints for supplies, and the number of panicky calls that I used to get, have come down dramatically,"" Upadhye said. ""Looks like things have settled.""
COVID-19 cases in India, the world's third-worst hit country, have surged in the past month, with new infections topping 50,000 daily.
Yet while hospitals previously reported they were struggling to get their hands on the drug, leading to black market sales, Upadhye said the indications from his supply chain were that pressure had eased.
That suggested severe cases had not surged as much as the overall numbers, he said.
Government data at the end of July showed about 0.3% of the country's active coronavirus patients were on ventilators, while 1.6% on intensive care unit support and 2.3% on oxygen support.
Severe cases likely amounted to under 3% of all infections, said Giridhara Babu, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India.
India, one of the world's biggest producer of generic drugs, recommends remdesivir for moderate to severe COVID-19. Doctors also use other drugs, including favirpiravir, another antiviral approved for the disease.
Cipla, which is also free to export the drug, supplies it in South Africa and plans to expand access to ""several sub-Saharan African countries"", it has said.
India had previously blocked exports of another drug, hydroxychloroquine, used by some doctors in treating the disease. The ban has since been lifted.

Cipla declined to comment on the number of vials of remdesivir it had shipped so far, but said it had started making the drug at a plant in Goa in western India to ramp up production.

Raggi, 42, became the Eternal City's first woman mayor when elected in 2016, in a major breakthrough for 5-Star ahead of national polls two years later when it won almost twice as many votes as its nearest rival.
Her early years as mayor were dogged by resignations from her team, the arrest for corruption of a top aide and chronic problems with trash collection. 
In November 2018, she was acquitted of accusations of lying over the appointment of the capital's head of tourism.
Since then, the pressure on her has eased and city hall has made progress in road repairs, public transport and consolidating finances.
""You can't change Rome in five years, but you can turn things in the right direction, and we have turned things in the right direction,"" Raggi told daily Il Fatto Quotidiano in an interview on Tuesday, confirming her aspiration for another term. 
She faces an uphill task. 5-Star is polling at around 16% nationally compared with the 32% it won at the 2018 election.
It is not even clear if she will have the support of her own party which, if it wants to back her, will need to change internal rules that do not allow members to hold elected office - even in different posts - for more than two terms.
Raggi is already in her second elected position, having served as a city councillor before becoming mayor.
Matteo Salvini's right-wing League, Italy's most popular party, and its hard-right ally Brothers of Italy have been attacking Raggi for months with an eye on the 2021 election.

""Raggi is the only one who doesn't realise what a state Rome is in,"" Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni tweeted on Tuesday. ""We need a mayor who is worthy of the capital.""

PARIS (Reuters) - French police are investigating a spate of killings of horses involving mutilation of the animals' bodies.
The latest in Cortambert, a village in the Saone-et-Loire region, occurred overnight on Friday. 
The horse's right ear was cut off, one of its eyes was gouged out and its genitals had been cut away. ""This is absolutely barbaric,"" a local official said.
A Paris police spokeswoman said there had been about 10 similar cases across France since the start of the year, most in the north and many taking place in secluded meadows. 
She said there were also cases between 2014 and 2016 and that similar killings and mutilations of horses had been reported in the past in Belgium and Germany. 
But the high number in France was unprecedented over such a short period. 
""We do not understand the motivation. Is it a satanic rite, insurance fraud, some macabre trophy hunt or an internet challenge? We don't know. It is very traumatising,"" she said. 
She said all types of horses had fallen victim, as well as one donkey, and that mutilation of an ear was a common factor. No meat had been taken from the carcases.
National police are assisting local investigations of cases, and France has sent alerts to other European countries' forces, she said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Ahmed Staifi's wife fled the relentless bombing in neighbouring Syria only to die in the biggest explosion ever to hit Beirut.
His family escaped the war raging across the border in Syria six years ago, looking for refuge in Lebanon where he was already living and working as a labourer. 
""My wife had called me and said Ahmed, 'I'm fleeing the war and coming to you.' Death followed her here,"" the Syrian father of four said.
When Staifi rushed home after the warehouse explosion that rocked Beirut last week, he heard his daughter calling out from beneath the rubble of their apartment. 
""I came to see my family, and I found this. One of my daughters was yelling 'Dad, Dad I don't want to die,'"" he recalled.
She survived, as did another child who remains in intensive care. 
But his wife Khaldiya and his youngest and oldest daughters - Jude and Latifa, aged 13 and 24 - were killed as a mushroom cloud rose above the Lebanese capital from the blast at Beirut port.
It reduced the three-storey building where Staifi's family lived into slabs of concrete and twisted metal. 
The explosion, which killed more than 160 people and injured 6,000 more, demolished entire neighbourhoods of Lebanon's capital in an instant, including Karantina, where the Staifi family had enjoyed a mostly quiet life. 
More than a million refugees from the Syrian war have poured into Lebanon since 2011, when the conflict there erupted. Many, scraping by on daily labour and living in camps, have languished in poverty.
At least 43 Syrians were reportedly killed in the explosion at Beirut port.
The blast compounded months of economic collapse in Lebanon which had crashed the local currency and left many Lebanese in dire financial straits. It also fueled public outrage that led to the collapse of the government.
Officials have said a huge stockpile of highly explosive material was stored in unsafe conditions at the port for years.
In a speech declaring his government's resignation on Monday, Prime Minister Hassan Diab blamed endemic corruption. 
But the last thing on Staifi's mind is the investigation of the blast right now.
""What can I do? My family is gone,"" he said. ""I have nothing."" 

Now, he said, he does not call to check up on his relatives in his city of Idlib in northwest Syria, ravaged by years of war. ""Now, they're checking up on me instead.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelans are steadily losing access to cheap basic services from water to cooking gas that have helped them survive economic crisis, forcing many to find creative solutions and adding pressure during the coronavirus quarantine. 
Services have long been near-free due to heavy subsidies by the ruling Socialist Party, which has overseen a six-year economic collapse despite Venezuela's oil wealth.
But as the decay of state-run utilities has led to constant shortages, Venezuelans now have to pay the equivalent of several months' salary for a few days of water, gas or telephone because private alternatives are priced in dollars.
For those without the money, workaround solutions abound: from wood-burning stoves and long walks to find cellular coverage to improvised pipes for siphoning water off a mountain. 
Others simply do without.
""Every week, we adjust to what happens,"" said Geraldine Escalante, a cook in a coastal area of Vargas state.
She went for a month-and-a-half without water until April, when she paid $20 for a cistern with 2,000 liters (529 gallons) which lasted a week. At other times, she and other residents link hoses between different communities to share water or carry bottles back-and-forth for several kilometers.
Access to running water is particularly crucial to curb the COVID-19 disease, which is running rampant around South America.
The generous oil-financed subsidies begun under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez have gradually disappeared under his successor President Nicolas Maduro. He has eliminated years of price and currency controls amid U.S. sanctions that have further weakened an already foundering economy.
The Information Ministry and state service companies did not reply to requests for comment.
'FELT LIKE CRYING'
Yusbel Castro, a community leader in Caracas' poor west end, was driving around the city trying to find subsidized gas to fill a 20 kg propane tank for less than $1 to fuel stoves at a communal soup kitchen she runs. 
But during one recent search in June, she only found black market resellers charging $7, equivalent to more than two months of minimum wage salary. 
Unable to afford it, Castro could not cook lunch for the 110 children who rely on the soup kitchen. It frequently serves beans or soups, which cook for longer than other foods and therefore require more gas.
""It would be $14 every six days, and I get paid in bolivars,"" she said. ""I felt like crying.""
Just 3 in 10 Venezuelans in May could obtain gas at regulated prices while only 1 in 10 received running water, according to data from the non-profit watchdog Venezuelan Observatory of Public Services (OVSP). 
While water costs less than a dollar per month at subsidized rates, cisterns can cost $100. 
Service interruptions now affect both wealthy neighborhoods and the slums. ""The crisis in public services has put the poor and rich on equal footing"" in that respect, said economist Luis Pedro Espana during a presentation of a demographic study last month that showed poverty reached 65% of households.
""That is the paradox of the Venezuelan state: it remains powerful in social control but is fading away as a provider of public goods and services,"" added Asdrubal Oliveros, head of the local Ecoanalitica consultancy, to Reuters. 
'FINDING SOLUTIONS'
A group of Caracas residents in June built a system to use water accumulated at a stalled tunnel construction project near the El Avila mountain bordering Caracas. 
They used 1,300 meters of hoses for the network and the residents contributed 10 dollars each to buy parts.
""We can't spend our whole lives complaining,"" said Wilfredo Moscoso, one of the project's leaders. ""We are finding solutions."" 
In some places, Venezuelans have to walk for kilometers to find a cellular signal. 
""The only one way I manage to get even a bit of coverage is when I get up on the roof of the house,"" said Jose Atacho, a pharmacy manager in the western city of Punto Fijo, who has lines with three different operators to improve the odds. 
Working and studying from home during coronavirus quarantine while struggling with faulty connections has led families to rely on pricey mobile phone data services. 
In some cases, residents pay up to $30 per month for additional services, compared with the notoriously faulty state-provided internet that costs $2 per month.

In the western city of Maracaibo, Argenis Linares paid for a satellite internet service and charges people several dollars per month for access. ""Some neighbors asked me, especially the friends of my kids, to do their homework,"" he said. ""Two are in a tough situation and they just pay what they can.""

993,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 08:11AM ET</span>","Some U.S. colleges stick to in-person reopening in pandemic despite doubts, pushback","By Jan Wolfe and Catherine Koppel
(Reuters) - Many U.S. universities are revamping campuses to resume in-person classes despite COVID-19, requiring students to be tested, wear masks and socially distance, but some college town residents and critics say schools are putting profits before public safety.
Tulane University, a private college in New Orleans, plans to reopen on Aug. 19 to as many as 13,000 students. Before students move in to dormitories, they must report to an ""Arrival Center"" at a city hotel ""where they will be guided through two days consisting of COVID-19 testing and orientation sessions"" according to Tulane's published guidance.
Maintenance workers at Tulane and other colleges are fitting auditoriums and classrooms with signage for social distancing. Students are being asked to wear masks, and at Tulane, those who host parties or gatherings with more than 15 people could face expulsion, the college said.
Rice University in Houston, Texas has contracted for 60,000 COVID-19 tests, and has bought temporary structures and open-sided tents for classes and meeting space.
Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, will require that students enter into a ""behavioral compact"" aimed at stemming the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 162,000 people in the United States and infected over five million.
Tulane president Michael Fitts said enrollment has been largely unaffected by the pandemic.
""The interest in sort of the classic, undergraduate, on-ground experience has never been stronger,"" he said.
While college presidents like Fitts say public health is paramount, some industry experts point to schools' powerful financial motivation to be on campus and in residences because of auxiliary revenue from services such as dining halls, bookstores, and vending machines.
""I don't think it's only about money - but it leads with money,"" higher education researcher Jeff Selingo said. ""Their entire business model, including their financial stability, is predicated on bringing people together in close proximity.""
HYBRIDS
Some colleges, however, are lowering the number of people allowed on campus to reduce risk of contagion, offering hybrids of in-person and online learning or altering the academic year's structure.
When the novel coronavirus shook the world back in March, U.S. colleges almost uniformly shut down, dormitories emptied and classes moved online. 
""What we are seeing this fall is a million different scenarios,"" Selingo said.
In late May, about two-thirds of U.S. colleges and universities said they were planning to resume in-person instruction in the fall, according to data compiled by the Chronicle of Higher Education. That number declined to about 50 percent as of late July.
Johns Hopkins University, a research institution in Baltimore, Maryland, is one of several schools that abandoned plans to have students return to campus.
""Unfortunately, the pandemic is worsening,"" Johns Hopkins President Ronald Daniels said in an Aug. 6 letter. ""We have concluded that returning in person would pose unacceptable risks.""
Cornell, which has about 23,000 students, has said that in-person classes actually will result in fewer coronavirus cases than a virtual semester.
Thousands of students live off-campus, and many have indicated they will return to Ithaca even if classes are online, Cornell president Martha Pollack said in an Aug. 5 letter.
Resuming campus life makes it easier to monitor and test those students, wrote Pollack, who declined to be interviewed for this article. 
Students, for example, will have to fill out a daily online health assessment as part of a behavioral compact and will face penalties, including suspension, for misleading the school.
Still, Cornell's plan has drawn objections from some Ithaca residents. Ri Bornstein, an artist and administrative assistant, said townspeople have kept the virus under control by acting responsibly and that some students who already have returned to campus are not.
""Cornell is saying people will act appropriately, but then I look outside and see frat parties,"" Bornstein said. 
""They are enacting the plan that's about the most possible profit for them,"" he asserted, saying Cornell's modeling seems questionable and self-serving. 
Pollack's letter said that the reopening plan was driven by science, not financial considerations.
Pollack said that while there could be more than a thousand coronavirus cases during the coming semester, online learning would result in several thousand infections, according to statistical modeling done by Cornell data scientist Peter Frazier.
""As we all have learned, there are no perfect solutions to this deeply imperfect situation,"" she said. ""All we can do is strive our hardest for the best solutions we can find.""

Attackers on motorbikes ambushed the group on Sunday while they were driving through the reserve, a popular destination for expatriates southeast of Niamey in the Tillabery region.
French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted on Tuesday that France would bolster security measures to protect its nationals in West Africa's Sahel region, without providing any details. 
France has 5,100 troops deployed in the arid region south of the Sahara desert, but violence by jihadists linked to Islamic State and al Qaeda continues to rise. 
A state of emergency had already been in place in parts of Tillabery to the north and west of Niamey, near the borders with Mali and Burkina Faso. 
An affiliate of Islamic State has repeatedly carried out attacks in that zone, including one that killed four U.S. soldiers in 2017. 
Niger's national security council announced late on Monday that it was extending the state of emergency to all of Tillabery, which extends more than 350 km (217 miles) south from the Malian border to the frontier with Benin. 
The state of emergency empowers the government to impose security restrictions such as curfews and bans on the circulation of motorcyles, the jihadists' most common means of transport.
Niamey, which lies roughly in the middle of Tillabery, is an autonomous region and is not affected by the state of emergency. 
The national security council also suspended access to the Koure reserve, home to West Africa's last sizeable population of giraffes in the wild, while an investigation proceeds. 
No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. France's anti-terrorism prosecutor has also launched an investigation. 

French charity ACTED, which employed the aid workers, said on Tuesday it had temporarily suspended its activities in Niger.

The two NATO allies, who hold fundamentally different views on where their continental shelves begin and end, are at odds over overlapping claims for hydrocarbon resources in the region.
Tensions escalated on Monday after Turkey’s navy issued an advisory known as a Navtex saying that the Oruc Reis vessel would operate in an area of sea south of Turkey's Antalya and west of Cyprus between Aug. 10-23. Seismic surveys are part of preparatory work for potential hydrocarbon exploration. 
Greece's Foreign Affairs Ministry urged Turkey to ""immediately cease its illegal activities which undermine peace and security in the region"". Turkey has dismissed the Greek objections, saying they had no legal basis, and vowed to continue operations.
The latest advisory came after Egypt and Greece signed an accord last Thursday designating an exclusive economic zone between the two nations in the east Mediterranean, increasing friction with Turkey over the area.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis met Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias on Tuesday and called for the emergency meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers. 
An EU spokesman said consultations among member states would take place before a decision on the request is made. EU foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in Berlin on Aug. 27-28.
""We agree that the situation in the eastern Mediterranean is extremely worrying and needs to be solved in a dialogue, not in a series and sequence of steps that are increasing the escalation and the tensions,"" said European Commission spokesman Peter Stano.
""The EU stands in full solidarity with Cyprus and Greece.""

A similar Turkish advisory was issued last month prompting another dispute that was calmed after the intervention of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, leading Turkey to agree to a pause in operations.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - A 35-year-old woman and her three children, aged between four and 11, were killed in western Nepal when heavy rains brought down their mud-and-stone house early on Tuesday, police said.
The poor Himalayan nation has recorded 198 deaths due to landslides and floods triggered by pre-monsoon and monsoon rains since late May, while in neighbouring India, 134 people have died in the states of Assam and Bihar, though flood waters have now receded in most places.
The rainy season typically ends in September in South Asia.
Nepal police official Janak Raj Pandey said that five other members of the family, including the woman's husband and her parents, survived the incident in Doti, 440 km (276 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu.
""The house collapsed while the family was asleep following incessant rains,"" Pandey told Reuters.
Large swathes of farm land and villages have been submerged in the southern plains bordering India, while landslides or floods have upended roads and swept away bridges across the country of 30 million people.
In Assam, floods have killed 110 people and affected 5.7 million since May, though only 73 people remained in government shelters as of Tuesday, a state bulletin said.

In Bihar, 24 people have died so far and 11,849 continue to stay in relief camps, though a state official said the situation was improving.

LIMA (Reuters) - Angry residents in Peru's Andean and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) regions have attacked three mining and oil sector firms in the last week, two of which were forced to halt operations after deadly clashes, as a second wave of COVID-19 infections hits the country.
The main reason: demand for economic aid and healthcare support during the pandemic, which has underscored stark divisions between the rich and often rural poor in the country, the world's second largest producer of copper.
""What the pandemic has done is to lift the veil on the reality of an inefficient, disjointed state,"" human rights ombudsman Walter Gutierrez told local radio RPP on Monday.
According to a report from the ombudsman on Sunday, there were 162 social protests linked to COVID-19 in Peru in June and July, most relating to public health and requests for aid, including 16 linked to the engine of the country's economy: mining.
There were 326 cases of coronavirus-related unrest between March when the pandemic emerged in Peru and the end of May, a previous report showed. 
On Sunday, three indigenous people from the Amazon region died and 17 people were injured, including residents and police, after protesters wanting to halt production at an oil field operated by Canada's PetroTal clashed with security forces.
Another protest, over the Glencore-owned Antapaccay copper mine, was resolved after an agreement with the local town, under which each resident will receive a $285 shopping card for food, medicine, clothes and education.
Antapaccay also committed to funding a medicinal oxygen plant. Medicinal oxygen, key to the treatment of COVID-19 patients suffering from respiratory failure, has been declared by the government as a product of ""national interest"" due to its scarcity, high demand, and price in the market.
Peru has the seventh highest tally of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, with over 478,000 cases and more than 21,000 deaths. Daily cases have spiked sharply in recent weeks in a second wave after the country eased lockdown restrictions.
""We are in an extremely critical situation,"" Gutierrez said. ""The numbers are alarming indicators.""
The rise in social tensions comes as President Martín Vizcarra seeks to emerge from a political crisis after being forced to replace his prime minister - the second in three weeks - after a revolt by the opposition-dominated Congress.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore started crushing nine tonnes worth of elephant ivory on Tuesday, in what authorities said was the biggest such event globally in recent years and signalled the island nation's fight against illegal trade in wildlife. 
The city-state, a nautical way point in shipments of banned animal products between Africa and Asia, is destroying tusks worth an estimated S$18 million ($13 million) including a record 8.8 tonne seizure last year which authorities said came from nearly 300 African elephants.
In the event, streamed online, workers in hard hats were seen emptying trolley-loads of tusks into a skip where they were then pulverised by an industrial rock crusher.
The crushing process may take several days and the fragments will then be incinerated.
""The destruction of the ivory... will prevent it from re-entering the market and will disrupt the global supply chain of illegally traded ivory,"" the National Parks Board said of the event, which comes ahead of Wednesday's World Elephant Day.
An estimated 100 African elephants are killed every day by poachers seeking ivory, meat and body parts, leaving only 400,000 remaining, environmentalists estimate. A large chunk of the demand for ivory comes from Asian countries such as China and Vietnam, where it is turned into jewels and ornaments.
As well as taking a tough stance on transited products, Singapore said last year it would ban the domestic trade in ivory from September 2021.
""Elephant poaching is at crisis levels in Asia and Africa due to the illegal trade,"" said R. Raghunathan, CEO of World Wide Fund for Nature Singapore. 
Raghunathan said the city-state's ivory crush and other initiatives underlined its determination to ""stamp out the illicit transit of wildlife products through Singapore"".
Neighbouring Malaysia destroyed 9.55 tonnes of seized elephant tusks in 2016.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>","U.S. health chief, visiting Taiwan, attacks China's pandemic response","By Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar attacked China's response to the coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday and said that if such an outbreak had emerged in Taiwan or the United States it could have been ""snuffed out easily"".
The Trump administration has repeatedly criticised Beijing for trying to cover up the virus outbreak, first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, and prevaricating on information sharing. China angrily denies the accusations.
""The Chinese Communist Party had the chance to warn the world and work with the world on battling the virus. But they chose not to, and the costs of that choice mount higher every day,"" Azar said in Taipei, capital of self-ruled Taiwan, an island China claims as its own.
As the virus emerged, China did not live up to its ""binding"" international obligations in a betrayal of the cooperative spirit needed for global health, he added, wearing a face mask as he has done for all his public events in Taiwan.
""I believe it is no exaggeration to say that if this virus had emerged in a place like Taiwan or the United States, it might have been snuffed out easily: rapidly reported to public health authorities, who would have shared what they knew with health professionals and with the general public,"" Azar said.
""Instead, Beijing appears to have resisted information sharing, muzzling doctors who spoke out and hobbling the world's ability to respond.""
The United States has the highest number of coronavirus infections and deaths in the world and President Donald Trump has come under scathing attack from critics at home for not taking what he calls the ""China virus"" seriously enough.
Taiwan has been praised by health experts for its early and effective steps to control the outbreak, with only 480 infections, including seven deaths.
Azar arrived in Taiwan on Sunday as the highest-level U.S. official to visit in four decades, a trip condemned by China.
China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has vowed to bring it under its rule, by force if necessary. 
Chinese fighter jets on Monday briefly crossed the median line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait, and were tracked by Taiwanese anti-aircraft missiles, part of what Taipei sees as a pattern of harassment by Beijing. 
Washington broke off official ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing but is still Taiwan's biggest arms supplier. The Trump administration has made strengthening its support for the democratic island a priority as relations with China sour over issues including human rights, the pandemic, Hong Kong and trade.
Azar said the world should recognise Taiwan's health accomplishments and not try to push it out, pointing to Taiwan's exclusion from the World Health Organization due to Chinese objections.
""This behaviour is in keeping with Beijing's approach to WHO and other international organisations. The influence of the PRC (People's Republic of China) far outweighs its investment in this public health institution - and it uses influence not to advance public health objectives, but its own narrow political interests.""
Both China and the WHO say Taiwan has been provided with the help it needs during the pandemic, which Taiwan disputes.

DOVER, England (Reuters) - Britain said on Tuesday it wanted greater flexibility to return illegal immigrants to France after a surge in the number embarking on the perilous journey across the English Channel.
Hundreds of people, including some children, have been caught crossing to southern England from makeshift camps in northern France since Thursday - many navigating one of the world's busiest shipping routes in overloaded rubber dinghies.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he wants to stop the illegal crossings and has sent Immigration Minister Chris Philp to Paris for talks with the French government.
Britain says the EU's so-called Dublin Regulation, which currently governs the return of illegal immigrants, is too inflexible and has very tight timeframes. Junior health minister Edward Argar said Johnson wanted more flexibility. 
""What he's looking at, quite rightly, is greater flexibility ... in returning people who have come here illegally ... and need to be returned back to France,"" Argar told Sky News.
More than 20 migrants were escorted to Dover (NYSE:DOV) on Tuesday by the British border force.
Many of the migrants seeking to reach Britain come from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria and countries in Africa, fleeing poverty, persecution or war. 
Some stand a chance of being granted asylum, while others, considered illegal economic migrants, are unlikely to be allowed to remain in Britain.
Organised crime groups offer to help the migrants cross the Channel for around 500 pounds ($650), the Sun newspaper reported, adding that some smugglers offer ""kids go free"" deals. 
Britain's interior ministry, known as the Home Office, declined repeated requests to supply data on the number of illegal crossings.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lebanon's leaders were warned in July about explosives at port - documents,"By Samia Nakhoul and Laila Bassam
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese security officials warned the prime minister and president last month that 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored in Beirut's port posed a security risk and could destroy the capital if it exploded, according to documents seen by Reuters and senior security sources.
Just over two weeks later, the industrial chemicals went up in a massive blast that obliterated most of the port and swathes of the capital, killed at least 163 people, injured 6,000 and destroyed 6,000 buildings, according to municipal authorities.
A report by the General Directorate of State Security on events leading up to the explosion included a reference to a private letter sent to President Michel Aoun and Prime Minister Hassan Diab on July 20.
While the content of the letter was not in the report seen by Reuters, a senior security official said it summed up the findings of a judicial investigation launched in January which concluded the chemicals needed to be secured immediately.
The state security report, which confirmed the correspondence to the president and the prime minister, has not previously been reported.
""There was a danger that this material, if stolen, could be used in a terrorist attack,"" the official told Reuters.
""At the end of the investigation, Prosecutor General (Ghassan) Oweidat prepared a final report which was sent to the authorities,"" he said, referring to the letter sent to the prime minister and president by the General Directorate of State Security, which oversees port security.
""I warned them that this could destroy Beirut if it exploded,"" said the official, who was involved in writing the letter and declined to be named.
Reuters could not independently confirm his description of the letter.
The presidency did not respond to requests for comment about the July 20 letter. 
A representative for Diab, whose government resigned on Monday following the blast, said the PM received the letter on July 20 and it was sent to the Supreme Defence Council for advice within 48 hours. ""The current cabinet received the file 14 days prior to the explosion and acted on it in a matter of days. Previous administrations had over six years and did nothing.""
The prosecutor general did not respond to requests for comment.
'DO WHAT IS NECESSARY'
The correspondence could fuel further criticism and public fury that the explosion is just the latest, if not most dramatic, example of the government negligence and corruption that have already pushed Lebanon to economic collapse.
As protests over the blast raged in Lebanon on Monday, Diab's government resigned, though it will remain as a caretaker administration until a new cabinet is formed.
The rebuilding of Beirut alone is expected to cost up to $15 billion, in a country already effectively bankrupt with total banking system losses exceeding $100 billion.
Aoun confirmed last week that he had been informed about the material. He told reporters he had directed the secretary general of the Supreme Defence Council, an umbrella group of security and military agencies chaired by the president, to ""do what is necessary"".
""(The state security service) said it is dangerous. I am not responsible! I don't know where it was put and I didn't know how dangerous it was. I have no authority to deal with the port directly. There is a hierarchy and all those who knew should have known their duties to do the necessary,"" Aoun said.
Many questions remain over why the shipment of ammonium nitrate docked in Beirut in late 2013. Even more baffling is why such a huge stash of dangerous material, used in bombs and fertilisers, was allowed to remain there for so long.
The letter sent to Lebanon's president and prime minister followed a string of memos and letters sent to the country's courts over the previous six years by port, customs and security officials, repeatedly urging judges to order the removal of the ammonium nitrate from its position so close to the city centre.
The General Directorate of State Security's report seen by Reuters said many requests had been submitted, without giving an exact number. It said the port's manifest department sent several written requests to the customs directorate up until 2016 asking them to call on a judge to order the material be re-exported immediately.
""But until now, no decision has been issued over this matter. After consulting one of our chemical specialists, the expert confirmed that this material is dangerous and is used to produce explosives,"" the General Directorate of State Security report said.
HAZARDOUS MATERIAL
The road to last week's tragedy began seven years ago, when the Rhosus, a Russian-chartered, Moldovan-flagged vessel carrying ammonium nitrate from Georgia to Mozambique, docked in Beirut to try to take on extra cargo to cover the fees for passage through the Suez Canal, according to the ship's captain.
Port authorities impounded the Rhosus in December 2013 by judicial order 2013/1031 due to outstanding debts owed to two companies that filed claims in Beirut courts, the state security report showed.
In May 2014, the ship was deemed unseaworthy and its cargo was unloaded in October 2014 and warehoused in what was known as Hangar 12. The ship sank near the port's breakwater on Feb. 18, 2018, the security report showed.
Moldova lists the owner of the ship as Panama-based Briarwood Corp. Briarwood could not immediately be reached for comment.
In February 2015, Nadim Zwain, a judge from the Summary Affairs Court, which deals with urgent issues, appointed an expert to inspect the cargo, according to the security report.
The report said the expert concluded that the material was hazardous and, through the port authorities, requested it be transferred to the army. Reuters could not independently confirm the expert's account.
Lebanese army command rejected the request and recommended the chemicals be transferred or sold to the privately owned Lebanese Explosives Company, the state security report said.
The report did not say why the army had refused to accept the cargo. A security official told Reuters it was because they didn't need it. The army declined to comment.
The explosives company's management told Reuters it had not been interested in purchasing confiscated material and the firm had its own suppliers and government import licences.
From then on, customs and security officials wrote to judges roughly every six months asking for the removal of the material, according to the requests seen by Reuters.
Judges and customs officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment.
A number of customs and port officials have since been detained as part of the investigation into the blast.
'BAD STORAGE AND BAD JUDGMENT'
In January 2020, a judge launched an official investigation after it was discovered that Hangar 12 was unguarded, had a hole in its southern wall and one of its doors dislodged, meaning the hazardous material was at risk of being stolen.
In his final report following the investigation, Prosecutor General Oweidat ""gave orders immediately"" to ensure hangar doors and holes were repaired and security provided, a second high-ranking security official who also requested anonymity said.
On June 4, based on those orders, state security instructed port authorities to provide guards at Hangar 12, appoint a director for the warehouse and secure all the doors and repair the hole in the southern wall, according to the state security report and security officials.
The port authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""The maintenance started and (port authorities) sent a team of Syrian workers (but) there was no one supervising them when they entered to fix the holes,"" the security official said. 
During the work, sparks from welding took hold and fire started to spread, the official said.
""Given that there were fireworks stored in the same hangar, after an hour a big fire was set off by the fireworks and that spread to the material that exploded when the temperature exceeded 210 degrees,"" the high-ranking security official said.
The official blamed port authorities for not supervising the repair crew and for storing fireworks alongside a vast deposit of high explosives.
Reuters could not determine what happened to the workers repairing the hangar.
""Only because the hangar faces the sea, the impact of the explosion was reduced. Otherwise all of Beirut would have been destroyed,"" he said. ""The issue is all about negligence, irresponsibility, bad storage and bad judgment.""

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>",India air safety watchdog to check airports hit by heavy rain after crash,"By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's air safety regulator plans to conduct special audits of airports across the country affected by heavy rain, the watchdog's chief told Reuters, days after an air crash killed 18 people and raised questions about safety.
An Air India Express plane with 190 people on board, overshot the rain-soaked runway at an airport near the southern city of Kozhikode on Friday. The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 landed in tailwind, skid off the runway and broke in half.
""We will conduct additional checks at major, busy airports across India that are affected by the monsoon rains,"" Arun Kumar, head of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in an interview late on Monday. 
""We will review everything - the condition of the runway, its incline, the lighting as well as drainage.""
Kumar said the special audit was over and above the DGCA's routine checks and could cover a dozen airports including those in Chennai, Kochi, Trivandrum as well as Mumbai, all of which get heavy annual rains.
Air India Express is the low cost arm of state carrier Air India. The flight was repatriating Indians stranded in Dubai due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The black boxes have been recovered and their data is being examined. 
India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is leading the probe into the crash. Boeing and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board are also taking part in the effort, Kumar said.
""Once the findings are finalised, and if something is amiss we will take action to rectify it,"" he said.
The crash was the worst in India in a decade, and the second fatal accident on a ""table-top"" runway which is typically found in high-altitude areas. 
Table-top runways are built by excavating the peaks of hills and have steep drops at one or both ends, increasing the danger if pilots under- or over-shoot their approach.
At Calicut airport, where the plane crashed on Friday, the pilot landed a third of the way along the runway, Kumar said on Sunday, leaving less room to bring the plane to a halt.
Airports with table-top runways are subject to the same rigorous regulatory requirements and are periodically audited for safety, Kumar said.
In 2010, an Air India Express plane overshot a similar runway in the southern city of Mangalore. It fell down a hillside and burst into flames, killing 158 people. 
A government-led committee looking into that crash had suggested installing an Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS) on table-top airports. EMAS is a special surface usually installed at the end of the runway to quickly stop an aircraft.
However, a second committee suggested that if the runway safety area was increased at Calicut airport, the EMAS would not be needed, Kumar said. 

Subsequently, the runway safety area was increased to 240 metres, more than the 90 metres prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, he said.

About 3,000 to 4,000 protesters chanted “Long live democracy” at Thammasat University on the outskirts of Bangkok on Monday night, with speeches calling for the resignation of Prayuth, who first took power in a 2014 coup, and an end to military domination of politics.
But protesters from a Thammasat University Pro-democracy Group also issued a 10-point call for reform of the monarchy, becoming at least the third student protest group to break a decades-long taboo on questioning its role and powers.
Thailand has strict laws against insulting or defaming the king, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
Palace officials declined to comment on the student protests or on any criticism of the monarchy.
Former army chief Prayuth told reporters he had watched the protests.
""Yes, I watched it, how can I not?"" he said when asked about the students' demands.
""I am concerned,"" he said, but did not elaborate on what concerned him and did not comment on the demands for royal reform.
Prayuth has warned protesters against involving the monarchy in their protests but said King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who took the throne after the death of his father in 2016, has asked him not to arrest anyone under the ""lese majeste"" laws.
Since the 2014 coup, activists have accused Prayuth of using the military's close association with the palace to justify its grip on power, including accusations of manipulating results of elections last year. Prayuth denies the allegations.

The students' new demands included reversal of a 2019 order that transferred two army units to the king's personal command and a 2017 law that gave him full control of the crown's extensive property holdings.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has lauded Russia's efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine and is willing to participate in trials, as he welcomed a supply offer from Moscow that he expects will be free of charge.
Russia expects regulatory approval for a potential COVID-19 vaccine this month and is ready to provide it to the Philippines, or team up with a local firm to mass produce it.
The Philippines has among Asia's highest numbers of coronavirus infections, which rose to 136,638 on Monday after a record daily jump of 6,958 cases.
""I will tell President (Vladimir) Putin that I have huge trust in your studies in combating COVID and I believe that the vaccine that you have produced is really good for humanity,"" Duterte said on television late on Monday.
The frenetic global race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine has raised concern that speed and national prestige could compromise safety.
To allay public fears, Duterte offered to be a guinea pig when the vaccine arrives and said: ""I can be the first they can experiment on.""
His office on Tuesday said the Philippines stands ready to work with Russia on vaccine trials, supply and production.
In July, Duterte made a plea to his Chinese counterpart to make the Philippines a priority if it develops a vaccine, amid concern in developing countries about availability.
He this month restored a strict lockdown in and around the capital Manila for an initial two weeks, heeding the plea of medical frontliners for a ""timeout"" amid a surge in infections during a period when restrictions were eased. 
If the situation becomes a ""runaway contagion"", Duterte on Monday vowed to mobilise the military to enforce the lockdown.

The lockdown has been among the world's toughest and Duterte's opponents and rights groups have voiced concern about his security-centred approach and the conduct of police.

PORT OF SPAIN (Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley claimed victory for his ruling party in a general election on Monday, appearing to secure a second term despite concern over the coronavirus, migration and recession in the energy-rich Caribbean country.
Preliminary results showed the ruling People's National Movement (PNM) won 22 of the 41 electoral seats, while the opposition United National Congress (UNC) led by former prime minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar won 19 seats. 
Official results are expected on Tuesday.
""In a most difficult situation, we have once again been called to the service of the people of Trinidad and Tobago,"" Rowley told reporters late on Monday.
The election campaign in the twin island nation of 1.3 million people was overshadowed by the novel coronavirus pandemic, with traditional, colorful political rallies replaced by streamed rallies and noisy motorcades.
Trinidad and Tobago, which has been officially closed to travel since March, has registered a relatively low total of 280 cases of the virus and 8 deaths - a fact the ruling PNM heralded as testament to its successful handling of the outbreak. 
Yet, like in many countries worldwide, the number of cases has jumped again since it started easing initial lockdown measures. It currently has 134 active cases.
Moreover, the opposition UNC has criticized Rowley's government for requiring nationals who did not return to the country before the border closure to obtain exemptions to travel home.
The party also accused the government of not protecting borders and allowing thousands of Venezuelans, fleeing their country's economic collapse, to enter illegally.
Trinidad and Tobago's own economy has not fared well of late, contracting seven out of the last 10 years largely due to lower energy prices.

The ruling party has said it will continue to seek to diversify the economy by boosting exports of energy services, digitalising services to improve ease of business and providing support to the private sector.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council is preparing to vote this week on a U.S. proposal to extend an arms embargo on Iran, a move that some diplomats say is bound to fail and put the fate of a nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers further at risk. 
A last-minute attempt by Britain, France and Germany to broker a compromise with Russia and China on an arms embargo extension appeared unsuccessful so far, diplomats said. Russia and China, allies of Iran, have long-signaled opposition to the U.S. measure.
A Chinese diplomat at the United Nations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that ""extending the arms embargo on Iran in whatever form lacks legal basis and will undermine efforts to preserve"" the nuclear deal, adding that there is ""no chance"" the U.S. text will be adopted.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft said Russia and China wanted to benefit from the end of the arms embargo. ""Russia and China are waiting to be able to sell arms to Iran,"" Craft told Fox News. 
The embargo is due to expire in October under a 2015 deal among Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States that prevents Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief.
Even though U.S. President Donald Trump's administration quit the accord in 2018 - with Trump dubbing it ""the worst deal ever"" - Washington has threatened to use a provision in the agreement to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran if the Security Council does not extend the arms embargo indefinitely.
Renewed sanctions -- a move known as snapback -- would likely kill the nuclear deal because Iran would lose a major incentive for limiting its nuclear activities. Iran has already breached parts of the nuclear deal in response to the U.S. withdrawal from the pact and Washington's imposing strong unilateral sanctions.
""This U.S. administration's goal is to terminate the Iran nuclear deal,"" said a European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook alluded to the United States wanting to reimpose all U.N. sanctions when he said last week, ""We need to restore the U.N. Security Council standard of no enrichment.""
A snapback of U.N. sanctions would require Iran to suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development, and ban imports of anything that could contribute to those activities or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems.
It would reimpose the arms embargo, ban Iran from developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and reimpose targeted sanctions on dozens of individuals and entities. States would also be urged to inspect shipments to and from Iran and authorized to seize any banned cargo.
'ZERO CHANCE'
Richard Gowan, U.N. director for conflict prevention advocacy body the International Crisis Group, said there was ""zero chance"" the U.S. attempt to extend the arms embargo would be adopted and that it was ""a ploy to get to snapback.""
The council is operating virtually so once a vote is called the 15 members would have 24 hours to submit their decision and the result would be announced at a public meeting, but diplomats say there is little support for the current U.S. text.
The draft resolution needs at least nine votes in favor to force Russia and China to use their vetoes, but some diplomats question whether Washington can even secure those nine votes.
""Everyone at the U.N. understands that this resolution is just the curtain-raiser for a much bigger fight over the Iranian nuclear deal,"" said Gowan.
Washington argues it can trigger the sanctions because a Security Council resolution enshrining the nuclear deal names it as a participant. But the remaining parties to the agreement are opposed to such a move, and diplomats say the United States would face a tough, messy battle.
""It's highly likely ... a number of countries will be saying they have no intention of implementing further sanctions, until the U.N. Security Council decides whether or not snapback has been carried out legally,"" said a senior council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 

""I don't see how the council can decide that given the divisions that will be within it,"" the diplomat said. ""I don't see any rush to re-establish sanctions regimes therefore around the world.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday slammed China for the arrest of Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who he called a ""patriot,"" and said the move indicated that Beijing is unlikely to change its position on the financial hub.
Lai's arrest under a sweeping new security law comes amid Beijing's crackdown against pro-democracy opposition in the city and further stokes concerns about media and other freedoms promised when it returned to China in 1997. China imposed the law on Hong Kong on June 30, drawing condemnation from Western countries.
""Lai was nothing more than a patriot who wanted good things for the people of Hong Kong,"" Pompeo told the Conservative Political Action Conference. 
""I'm not optimistic given what we saw this morning ... that they're going to change what they're doing,"" he added, referring to the Chinese government.
Tensions between world's top two economies have been increasing daily.
Later on Monday, Pompeo took a fresh swipe at Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok, repeating that it presented a national security threat to Americans due to what he said was the obligation of all such companies to the Chinese Communist Party.
""The United States is aware that these companies are being used for China's national security purposes,"" Pompeo said in an interview on Newsmax, without offering concrete evidence of such use.
President Donald Trump has unveiled sweeping bans on U.S. transactions with the Chinese owners of TikTok and messaging app WeChat.
Pompeo said that the United States would take action to ensure that Hong Kong is treated as an extension of China after Beijing passed its national security legislation in June, prompting Washington to end the territory's special status.
He said he feared that Hong Kong may have had its last democratic election, in an apparent reference to 2019's lower-level district council elections.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam last month postponed a Sept. 6 election for seats in the city legislature for a year because of a spike in novel coronavirus cases. The United States said it was the latest example of Beijing undermining democracy in the territory.

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 07:27PM ET</span>",Special Report: Lebanon’s power struggle – why a failing state can’t get the lights on,"By Tom Perry and Ellen Francis
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Surveying Beirut's shattered streets last week, in the aftermath of a massive explosion at the port that killed at least 158 people, French President Emmanuel Macron offered support to the people of Lebanon and delivered a stern message to the country's ruling class.
What Lebanon needs, he said, is fundamental change.
""Strong political initiatives must be undertaken to fight corruption, to impose transparency and to carry out reforms put forward two years ago"" at a conference of international donors in Paris, Macron said. Chief among these: ""Overhaul the energy sector to counter the electricity shortages that affect the Lebanese people today."" It was a point Macron made repeatedly during his one-day visit.
On Monday, faced with growing public anger Prime Minister Hassan Diab announced his government would resign.
For years Lebanon has been blighted by power cuts. For many Lebanese, the state's inability to deliver reliable electricity has become a metaphor for their country's wider failings. The words, ""The electricity went,"" are among the first spoken by children here. Every day, lights, fridges and washing machines go off for hours when the supply from the state owned Electricite du Liban (EdL) stops. All the while, EdL is wracking up annual losses of up to $2 billion — around one third of Lebanon's budget deficit.
Since the 2018 donors' conference in Paris, the World Bank and Western and Arab states have stood ready with billions of dollars to help Lebanon sort out its finances and infrastructure, starting with electricity, on one condition: Beirut must enact reforms, including appointing a regulator, modernising the grid and eventually raising prices that haven't changed since the 1990s. Over the last two years, the donors have watched in frustration as Lebanon's economy imploded, reforms went nowhere and politicians argued over where to build a new power plant.
The underlying cause: the factional, sectarian politics of this country of six million that is home to many Muslim and Christian faiths. 
The biggest Christian party in government, the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), wants to build a power station in a northern Christian area, on a rocky strip of Mediterranean coast near a village called Selaata. It argues the plant is essential for Lebanon's energy security. Other political parties and Lebanon's international donors have raised concerns about the idea, however, not least because Selaata isn't connected to the grid. Some suspect that behind the Free Patriotic Movement's dedication to Selaata lie other motives, including its location in a mainly Christian part of the country. The FPM denies having a hidden agenda.
Documents seen by Reuters and interviews with more than a dozen officials with knowledge of the matter together reveal how the Free Patriotic Movement refused to give ground even as questions grew around the Selaata project's viability and it became clear donors would not finance it as part of immediate steps to overhaul the power sector. These officials included international sources familiar with donor thinking, senior Lebanese politicians from across the spectrum, and civil society activists. The international sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Reuters reporting also shows how this episode has frustrated donors, whose help Lebanon needs more than ever after last week's explosion.
In the political gridlock over the plant, power cuts have worsened. Since last October, thousands of Lebanese have taken to the streets to protest against the country's ruling class, with Lebanon's broken power network top of their grievances. ""We spent 10 days without any electricity at all,"" said Samira al-Azar, a gym manager, who joined protests last month outside the state power firm's Beirut headquarters, its yellow fence recently topped with barbed wire. "" Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) off the lights at the rulers' houses, light up the people's houses,"" chanted the crowd. 
The failure to fix the electricity sector offers a glimpse into how Lebanon got into its worst crisis since the 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. Since late 2019, the financial system has unravelled under the weight of public debt, shutting savers out of their bank accounts, triggering a sovereign default, crashing the currency and driving up poverty.
Last week's explosion has piled more misery onto the people, wrecking the commercial heart of Beirut and leaving around 250,000 people without homes. Power cuts have made cleanup attempts more difficult and dangerous in dark streets covered with broken glass and rubble, with the ever-present risk of falling debris. Officials have blamed the explosion on ammonium nitrate stored unsafely at the port. For many Lebanese, it was just the latest neglect by a sectarian elite that has for decades failed to provide the most basic services. 
Jan Kubis, U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, said that without reforming the electricity sector through ""immediate, tangible and technically and economically sound measures, Lebanon cannot stop the deepening economic and social collapse (and) the Lebanese are doomed to increasing misery, that they cannot and will not tolerate.""
""The whole country knows it, but do its leaders?""
The government has pushed back against criticism that it has done nothing to fix the grid. After French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said, during a visit to Beirut in July, that steps to tackle the power sector were not encouraging, Prime Minister Diab retorted that Le Drian didn't know enough about the ""extent of the government's reforms."" Energy Minister Raymond Ghajar, who was nominated by the Free Patriotic Movement, also defended the administration's record. In a written response to Reuters, Ghajar said EdL's financial position and service were improving. The main obstacles to reform, he went on, were ""delays in administrative processes to get the necessary approvals.""
Asked why the Free Patriotic Movement is pressing for a power plant at Selaata, Free Patriotic Movement leader Gebran Bassil told Reuters: ""My insistence is on 24-hour electricity…. Electricity (generation) must be distributed, for the integrity of the network, ask any expert. We need a number of locations.""

FRACTURED NATION
Lebanon has been governed by a sectarian power-sharing system since independence from France in 1943: The head of state must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shi'ite Muslim. While designed to ensure representation for a total of 18 religious communities, the system has helped inflict crisis after crisis on Lebanon, peaking in a civil war from 1975 to 1990.
The system's critics say it has precluded the establishment of an effective, central state as former warlords and sectarian leaders are too often driven by regional agendas and self-interest. The main parties dominating Lebanon - Sunni, Shi'ite, Druze and Christian - have all carved out spheres of influence in the state which they have exploited to their own end, while blaming each other for the mess.
The most powerful is the heavily armed, Iran-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah movement, which the United States has labelled a terrorist organisation and deems a global threat. The group is today more deeply involved in state affairs than ever.
Centre stage in the row over electricity is the biggest Christian bloc, the Free Patriotic Movement, which was founded by President Michel Aoun and has defined itself as a protector of Christian rights. The party is led by Aoun's son-in-law, Bassil, a former energy minister. It has held the energy brief for a decade, and with it oversight of state power firm EdL. 
EdL's problems run deep. They include a production gap of at least 1,500 Megawatts, a wasteful transmission grid, power theft, metre tampering and billing problems. EdL tariffs have not been increased since the 1990s, contributing to its hefty loss. Successive governments have vowed to fix this but never delivered. All sides blame others for blocking reform.
When EdL power goes down, households are forced to rely on private neighbourhood providers, at a high cost. Economists estimate that Lebanese pay some $1.5 billion or more a year to private suppliers, who distribute power to neighbourhoods via small generators and a spaghetti of cables often hung precariously from lampposts. The government last year sought to regulate these generator owners to reduce prices.
Omar Elhani, 38, who works at a florist shop in the northern city of Tripoli, needs a stable electricity supply for his 10-month-old son, who relies on a nebuliser to aid his breathing. These days their house only gets one to two hours of power a day from the grid and the local generator isn't filling the gaps, so Elhani takes his son to friends' homes in search of electricity. ""The situation isn't just bad. It's really bad,"" said the father of six, who earns little over a dollar a day. 
A ROCKY SHORE
Besides local factories, the shore around Selaata is little touched compared to much of the Lebanese coast. The sleepy coastal road is bordered by verdant, rocky hills that rise sharply on one side and on the other by a rocky shoreline enjoyed by more intrepid beachgoers.
The World Bank Group flagged big concerns about Selaata as a location for a power plant as early as 2018, said an international source familiar with the matter. The costs, which include land acquisition by the state and sea reclamation, meant it was not a viable investment, the source said. The World Bank didn't comment when asked by Reuters whether it had alerted the authorities to such long-held concerns.
When Diab, a Sunni Muslim under the sectarian system, took office in January this year - the previous government had resigned after street protests - he vowed to press on with long-delayed reforms, including measures to stamp out corruption and improve tax collection.
A World Bank emergency plan for the electricity sector set priorities for the government's first 100 days in office. It called for starting a procurement process to build a power plant at Zahrani, a predominantly Shi'ite area in the south that is widely deemed to be a suitable site because it is already home to a power station. This should help keep the project costs down. The World Bank advised proceeding with plans for Selaata only after the government completed a study assessing its environmental and social impact.
As part of efforts to guide Lebanon, the World Bank commissioned French power company Electricite de France (EDF (PA:EDF)) to draw up a plan for the least costly options for generating power in the next decade. A draft of the EDF study, dated April and reviewed by Reuters, details a roadmap for meeting Lebanon's needs - with the base scenario omitting generation capacity at Selaata. It foresees new capacity at Zahrani and Deir Ammar, a Sunni village in the north, as well as renewable energy projects. The international sources said Selaata was left out because it doesn't make technical sense.
An EDF spokesman declined to comment on the report and said the company's work was very preliminary. EDF had signed a consultancy agreement with the World Bank to create a master plan for the optimal energy mix in Lebanon and the ultimate decisions would be for the government to make, the spokesman said.
The World Bank told Reuters in a written response that it had recommended to Lebanon's government ""that any power plant should undergo a rigorous analysis of its environmental and social impacts"" and should be picked on a least-cost basis. It said it was ""unclear whether the first recommendation was fully implemented"" and, if so, what the conclusions of the analysis were.
Energy Minister Ghajar said the ""unfortunately"" leaked draft report was still a work in progress with many different scenarios and that his ministry was ""engaged with EDF to validate all the input data"" for an updated version.
ANOTHER ROADBLOCK
On May 14, it finally looked like the government was moving forward with a plan to increase electricity generation. A cabinet decision explicitly spelt out where to site the first new power plant: It said it should be built at Zahrani, in the Shi'ite Muslim south. The majority of the cabinet was in favour, wanting the process moved along, political sources said.
Donors saw it as a move in the right direction, said a senior European diplomat and four other international sources familiar with donor thinking. ""It was a possible, pragmatic step forward,"" the diplomat said.
But the decision quickly hit another political roadblock.
The Free Patriotic Movement saw the plan as an attempt to shelve Selaata, political sources said. President Aoun demanded a review of the decision, noting that the government's original plan to overhaul the sector involved three power stations, one of them at Selaata. In a cabinet session chaired by Aoun at the presidential palace two weeks later, the government confirmed its commitment to the original 2019 plan.
Around the same time in May, Ghajar, the energy minister, reminded donors in a presentation at a meeting at the government headquarters that Selaata remained a priority. The May 18 presentation, produced by the Ministry of Energy and Water and reviewed by Reuters, ranked Zahrani as the most suitable site but still dedicated a section to detailing exactly where in Selaata another power station should be located. It listed Selaata as the second most suitable site.
This did not go down well with donors, the international sources and other attendees said.
""It was really like thumbing the nose … like saying, 'this is it and we want it',"" said Sibylle Rizk, director of public policies at Kulluna Irada, a Lebanese civil society group, some of whose members attended the meeting.
Ghajar said in a written response to Reuters the meeting was ""an opportunity to inform the international community about the reality of things about Selaata instead of hearing fake news from here and there."" He said he had not noticed ""anybody being surprised.""
""YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN""
Selaata has even become an unlikely topic of conversation on prime-time TV. A shouting match erupted on a widely-watched talk show in July when a pro-Aoun pundit yelled that Christians deserved their own power station.
In Selaata, too, there has been controversy since the energy ministry decided last year to move the site a few kilometres along the coast to another parcel of land by a deep water port and local factories. The change has triggered local opposition in the mainly Christian village and has angered the municipal council, which says the proposed location is too close to homes and will cut off access to the port for local businesses.
Elias Taleb, a Free Patriotic Movement activist in Selaata, says he doesn't want a power plant near his house, increasing the risk of pollution. Still, he believes it's important to have one a few kilometres away in the Christian district, reflecting the type of factional thinking that endures in Lebanon, a country that was fractured into sectarian cantons during the civil war.
""You never know what might happen in the country… Somebody could turn off the power switch,"" said Taleb, adding this was his personal view. ""Why should the Sunnis get a plant in Deir Ammar and the Shi'ites in Zahrani, for example? Why shouldn't there be one in the Christian area? Unfortunately, this is the way the country is.""
Asked by Reuters whether his party was promoting a plant at Selaata for sectarian reasons, Free Patriotic Movement leader Bassil replied: ""When you want to talk, in Lebanon, about balanced development and the (geographical) distribution of projects, this cannot apply to one side and not the others. Why don't you say this about those who want a plant in Zahrani? Why don't you say this about those who want a plant in Deir Ammar? Only for Selaata?""
Defending its record in running the energy ministry, the Free Patriotic Movement blames parties that held the energy brief in the past and accuses others of standing in its way. Nada Boustani, energy minister for the Free Patriotic Movement in the previous government, says the party has no problem with building a plant at Zahrani as well as at Selaata. ""But we're saying commit to both because you need both if the final goal is 24-hour electricity.""
Donors acknowledge Lebanon's right to choose where to put new generating capacity, but the country needs their money, and they are frustrated by the logjam. ""Financing two power plants will be difficult, and they want us to finance a third without any credible explanation … Everyone told them no to Selaata,"" said one of the international sources close to the issue.
Camille Abou Suleiman, a former labour minister allied with the second biggest Christian bloc in parliament, a rival to the Free Patriotic Movement, said the FPM's intransigence was wasting valuable time. There was no need to totally rule out Selaata, he said, ""but why hold up the whole process? Why not start with one power station - Zahrani - which is easier, and, if successful, proceed with others at what surely would be a cheaper cost and see what happens? It's not the time to take a (Christian) community stand on this because we can't afford it.""
For Daniel Younes, whose family owns a minimarket in a Beirut suburb, change can't come soon enough. The worst power cuts he has ever seen are wiping out the family's small profit, said Younes, who is nearly 60 and lived through Lebanon's civil war. Not only are they forced to throw out spoiled dairy and frozen foods, but they have to pay more and more for the generator they use.

""The ice cream fridge, you come at night, there's no electricity, it's all a loss. And then you have to throw them out, and the yoghurt and cheese, in this heat,"" he said. ""This is the worst year, in everything. Sorry, but this is the most failing power grid in the world, the most failing ministry in history. We've never seen a year like this.""

Trump has been at loggerheads with other G-7 countries including France and Germany over his push to include Russia in the group. The nations have also argued over the role of the World Health Organization, which Trump has accused of favoring China.
Speaking Monday at a White House news conference, Trump reiterated his wish to invite Vladimir Putin to the summit, calling the Russian president an “important factor.”
Trump had previously postponed the meeting, originally scheduled for June, until September amid the pandemic. It was also planned to take place at Camp David, but later changed to a teleconference because of the virus’s spread.
The U.S. currently holds the rotating presidency of the group, which includes Japan, Canada, the U.K., Italy, France and Germany.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's government said on Monday it had ordered police and military to protect key installations and the transport of medical oxygen after clashes broke out over protests and roadblocks by opposition supporters demanding a quick election.
Tensions are brewing as the South American nation heads for a key presidential election on Oct. 18, which has been delayed due to COVID-19. Supporters of unseated former leftist leader Evo Morales are demanding the vote be held on Sept. 6.
The standoff threatens to convulse the landlocked country and revive memories of last year's deadly clashes following a disputed election that led to the resignation of Morales, dozens of people being killed and buildings being set on fire.
The election is being fought between Morales' Movement for Socialism (MAS) party and a fragmented conservative opposition, including interim President Jeanine Anez, who took over in a power vacuum last year promising swift new election.
""It is important to put an end to these mobilizations,"" Presidency Minister Yerko Núñez said, blaming ""radical"" groups allied with MAS who ""seek death among Bolivians""
""From today, the Armed Forces and the police will fulfill the mission of safeguarding public institutions ..., safeguarding the provision of oxygen, medical supplies, medicines and health personnel.""
Morales, currently in Argentina, has criticized the interim government, which he accuses of leading a coup, and encouraged mobilizations to protest against the election delay. The protesters, mostly in rural areas, have blocked access to some main cities using stones, rubble and earth.
The Ombudsman's Office recorded at least three gunshot wounds after clashes during the unblocking of a road in eastern Bolivia, while the health ministry has recorded over 30 deaths due to lack of oxygen as of last week.
Josep Borrell, EU High Representative, urged ""political dialogue"" to ensure peace was maintained and said tensions were hitting Bolivians already ""impacted by the coronavirus pandemic with an already collapsed healthcare system.""
Defense Minister Fernando López told reporters that violence needed to be avoided. ""We do not want more deaths. COVID-19 is already taking too many,"" he said.

The federal district passed a police reform law in July after weeks of protests in the nation's capital and across the globe against systemic racism and police brutality, sparked by the killing of African-American George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis.
Floyd's death, as well as other high-profile incidents of police brutality, led three dozen states to introduce initiatives to change or study policing, according https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/legislative-responses-for-policing.aspx to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Washington's emergency legislation requires the Metropolitan Police Department to release the names of officers and body camera footage within five days of an officer-involved shooting or the use of serious force, among other measures. 
Records of previous incidents, dating back to the beginning of the body-camera program in October 2014, were to be released by Aug. 15. The police union argued in its court filing, made on Aug. 7, that releasing those records could harm officers' reputations. 
""The release of the body-camera footage and names of officers will unjustly malign and permanently tarnish the reputation and good name of any officer that is later cleared of misconduct concerning the use of force,"" the union said in a statement. 
Nationwide data on police discipline is limited. A Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-unions found that many police union contracts call for disciplinary records to be kept private or erased and make it difficult for citizens to file complaints.
Experts have said body-worn cameras or bystander footage can increase the likelihood of attention to or discipline for police misconduct. [L1N2DO0YI]
On July 31, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser released footage related to killings in three officer-involved deaths.
The mayor's office did not respond to a request for comment. The district's attorney general's office declined to comment.
Arthur Spitzer, senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, said the organization agreed with the union that there was a right to privacy, but said it did not apply to officer-involved shootings. He noted that some of the issues the union brought up with the law are already addressed with certain checks.
""We don't think that the identity of a law enforcement officer who's engaged in official conduct is a matter of sensitive personal information at all,"" Spitzer said.
The union's latest move comes on the heels of a separate lawsuit it filed, which argued that the portion of the reform law that stripped it of the right to negotiate with management over the discipline of members was unconstitutional.

KARACHI/QUETTA/PESHAWAR/LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistanis flocked to gyms, salons and restaurants that opened on Monday for the first time in five months after being shut to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
The South Asian country has recorded more than 280,000 cases of COVID-19 and nearly 6,100 deaths, but has seen a slowing of numbers since June, when it recorded nearly 7,000 infections and 118 deaths in a single day. 
On Sunday, Pakistan recorded 539 new infections and 15 deaths. New daily cases have been under a thousand throughout August.
“Thank God, the government has allowed dine-in; we were managing through take-away, but now business will improve,” said Sher Khan, owner of a tea stall in a bustling area of Karachi, Pakistan's largest city.
The government allowed a partial resumption of commercial activities in May. Despite reopening the remaining businesses, it urged people take precautions including wearing masks. 
In Lahore's Bazar Mozang, shops were packed and few wore masks. 
At a clothing and cosmetics shop, Nadeem Sheikh said he was reluctant to turn away customers who did not adhere to the rules for fear of the financial loss.
At a packed salon in the southwestern city of Quetta, Muhammad Usman was happy to shed locks of hair that had grown unruly over the months.
Pointing to his long hair and laughing, Usman said people had started to think he was an ascetic hermit and had approached him with charity, asking him to pray for them.
Gyms opened in the city of Peshawar, with customers relieved they no longer had to train at home. 
""I gained 20 kg (44 pounds) because of the closure of gyms,"" said Najeeb Ullah Achakzai, 27. ""That destroyed all my personality... My marriage was postponed due to my becoming overweight.”

The meeting between Macron and Merkel, fresh from striking a game-changing deal for the European Union to raise debt for the first time to fund recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, is another sign of renewed vigour for the Franco-German engine.
Some European diplomats have said a reinvigorated relationship between the EU's two most powerful leaders could help bring new momentum to other stumbling blocks in the EU, such as a digital tax or U.S. tariffs.
But others have questioned whether much could be achieved while Merkel neared the end of her mandate next year.

""According to information from the Slovak intelligence services, their activities were in contradiction with the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations,"" a Slovak foreign ministry spokesman said in an emailed statement.
""On the top of that, there had been an abuse of visas issued at the Slovak general consulate in St. Petersburg, and in this connection a serious crime was committed on the territory of another EU and NATO member state,"" he said.
The ministry did not provide further details but the justification brings the expulsions into connection with the murder of a former Chechen rebel with Georgian citizenship in Berlin last summer.
Slovak media, as well as investigative website bellingcat.com, have reported that one of people suspected of involvement in the killing, though not the shooting itself, had travelled to Europe on a Slovak visa.
Slovak Foreign Minister Ivan Korcok ordered a probe into visa issuance at the St. Petersburg consulate last month. 
German federal prosecutors accused Russia in June of ordering the killing of the Georgian and indicted a Russian man for the murder.
Germany expelled two members of the Russian embassy in December in connection with the case. 
The Kremlin has categorically rejected the idea that there was any link between the killing and the Russian government.
The Slovak foreign ministry said the Russian diplomats must leave the country this week.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least 10 people died in clashes between protesters and security forces in Ethiopia’s southern region on Monday, health officials said, the latest violence as myriad ethnic groups clamour for more autonomy. 
The protests were sparked by Sunday's arrest of local officials and activists seeking a new autonomous region for their Wolaita ethnic group, said Matheos Balcha, spokesman of the opposition party Wolaita National Movement Party. One of their party members was arrested, he said.
Security forces shot dead at least six people in Boditi on Monday, a town 295 km (180 miles) southwest of the capital Addis Ababa, said Temesgen Hilina, a senior official at Boditi health center. 
“They were shot in the head, abdomen, and their chest,"" he said. “I was the one who gave them the first treatment and later they died.""
A 14-year-old boy was among the dead, he said, and 34 people injured.
In Sodo town, 315 km southwest of Addis, a health officer from Wolaita Sodo University teaching hospital said he saw four dead gunshot victims and heard of eight others from colleagues. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
The regional government spokeswoman did not return a call seeking comment. 
Like many ethnic groups, the Wolaita - currently part of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Regional state - want their own state, which would give them greater powers over security and taxation. 
Ethiopia currently has 10 states and around 80 ethnic groups. Its federal system allows any ethnic group to demand a referendum on establishing their own autonomous region - but the previous administration never permitted such votes. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who came to power in 2018, oversaw democratic reforms that included holding one such referendum last year. But Abiy has struggled to reign in the forces he unleashed as regional strongmen build their bases with appeals to ethnic nationalism.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's prime minister-designate said on Monday he would form a purely technocratic government following wrangling among political parties over the formation of the country's next administration.
The decision by Hichem Mechichi will likely put him in confrontation with the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party, the largest political group in parliament, which announced it would oppose the formation of a non-political government.
However, the proposal for a government of independent technocrats without political parties will win support from the powerful UGTT trade union and some other parties, including Tahya Tounes and Dustoury el Hor.
Mechichi said that the government’s focus would mainly be on social hardship and the weak economy, explaining that ""while the political dispute continues, some Tunisians have not found drinking water"".
Protests have erupted in the country's interior this year over widespread unemployment, lack of development and poor public services in health, electricity and water.
Mechichi, who was proposed by President Kais Saied last month to succeed Elyes Fakhfakh, said his priority would also be to rescue the struggling public finances. Fakhfakh resigned over allegations of a conflict of interest. 
Tunisia is struggling to revive its collapsed economy since a 2011 revolution that ended the rule of former president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and sparked the Arab Spring.
The government said last month it had asked four creditor countries to delay debt repayments, as it announced more pessimistic economic and budget forecasts for 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The request on debt repayments underscores the dire condition of the public finances, already a source of concern before the coronavirus crisis pummelled the global economy.
Mechichi, 46, an independent, needs this month to form a government capable of winning a confidence vote in parliament by a simple majority, or the president will dissolve parliament and call for another election.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanian activist and diaspora groups called on state institutions on Monday to investigate riot police for using violence to quell an anti-corruption rally two years ago.
One group, Diaspora for Romania, laid out dozens of sneakers, sandals, boots and stilettos outside government headquarters in Victory Square, the venue for anti-corruption protests, on the anniversary of the rally. Another group paraded a giant pink elephant around the city and a third drew chalk outlines and reenacted riot police violence.
The Aug. 10, 2018 protest saw riot police repeatedly fire tear gas into the crowd, use water canons and beat non-violent protesters.
Hundreds required medical assistance, in the only violent protest in a series of peaceful anti-corruption rallies triggered by attempts by the then ruling Social Democrat Party to decriminalize several graft offences. 
On Monday, Diaspora for Romania, a civic action group of Romanians living abroad, said it wanted to make its point while respecting curbs on public gatherings imposed to contain the coronavirus, which has killed 2,729 people in the EU member country.
""This pair of shoes also holds the place of several of my friends who are in the diaspora and cannot be here today,"" said Mihai Munteanu as he laid out a pair of blue trainers.
""I am here today not only to commemorate () but also to let the government know that we will not forget.""
Laurentiu Dumitru, who has been living abroad for 12 years and attended the 2018 protest, was in Bucharest on Monday. 
""The shoes represent the symbolic participation of those who could not be here,"" he said.
Prosecutors opened an investigation into the handling of the 2018 protest, but earlier this year decided to close it. Activist groups challenged the decision and a Bucharest court must rule on whether to reopen the case.
Online community activist group Declic paraded a giant pink elephant inscribed with the slogans ""We won't forget"" and ""Justice for all"" outside the offices of several state institutions. 
Another activist group drew chalkboard outlines of hurt protesters in Victory Square.
The 2018 protest was partially organised by groups of Romanians working abroad, disillusioned by what they said was entrenched corruption and weak public administration in their home country.

An estimated 3 to 5 million Romanians live and work abroad, according to the World Bank, or about a quarter of the country's population. In 2019, they sent home an estimated record high $7.24 billion, a lifeline for many families in Romania.

The country's supreme court in recent months put Democratic Action and two other opposition parties in the hands of politicians expelled from those parties on accusations they were in cahoots with socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
Rank-and-file members of opposition parties overwhelmingly dismissed the court-appointed leaders as Maduro's stooges, which the appointees have denied.
The takeover of Democratic Action's headquarters, which began on Sunday, is part of an effort to give the court-appointed party leaders access to its buildings, legislator Williams (NYSE:WMB) Davila said in a statement.
""Democratic Action is being taken over because Maduro wants to create confusion. He's trying to create a false opposition to make people believe that he has democratic support that doesn't exist,"" Davila said.
The party published a video of men inside the headquarters throwing what appeared to be improvised fireworks and later a tear gas canister onto the sidewalk where party members had gathered.
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The supreme court in June ruled that Democratic Action should be put in the hands of politician Bernabe Gutierrez. He was then immediately expelled from the party.
Gutierrez in a tweet said two Democratic Action buildings had been ""rescued from abandonment and laziness in which they had been found.""
Two other opposition parties, Popular Will and First Justice, now also have expelled party members who have been installed as party leaders.
Democratic Action, which was created in the 1940s, is a crucial element of the opposition coalition led by legislative chief Juan Guaido.
The opposition agreed to boycott the Dec. 6 legislative election on the grounds that it is rigged to maximize Maduro's control over the legislature.
The court-appointed opposition party leaders are struggling to find candidates to run under their leadership due to broad mistrust among the opposition's rank and file.

Those targeted were six Republican lawmakers - Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley and Pat Toomey and Representative Chris Smith - as well as individuals at non-profit and rights groups. 
""In response to that wrong U.S. behaviour, China has decided to impose sanctions on individuals who have behaved egregiously on Hong Kong-related issues,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a press briefing on Monday.
He did not specify what the sanctions entail. 
White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said the Chinese sanctions were ""symbolic and ineffectual"", but declined to say if the U.S. government would respond.
""A growing number of nations around the globe are demanding real action from Beijing"", she told reporters, citing widespread concerns about the national security law imposed on Hong Kong. ""This President has stood strongly against China and will continue to do so.""
Relations between the world's two largest economies have deteriorated sharply in recent months over issues ranging from trade, to Hong Kong and China's handling of the novel coronavirus. Trump has made tough talk against China a feature of his campaign for re-election.
China's sanctions are the latest in a tit-for-tat round of measures between Beijing and Washington over accusations of rights abuses and interference. 
The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the city's current and former police chiefs.
The U.S. lawmakers targeted by China on Monday have been among vocal critics of a new national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in late June.
Members of Congress typically take sanctions from U.S. adversaries as compliments, not problems. Hawley's office issued a statement that he would not ""back down"" and that he would ""continue defending America's interests.""
It was the second time recently China has announced sanctions against Republicans. Last month, Beijing targeted Cruz, Rubio and Smith after Washington penalized Chinese officials over the treatment of Uighur Muslims.

Beijing's latest measure includes sanctions against the heads of five U.S.-based, non-government organizations. All five groups had been subjected to sanctions in December in connection with their positions on Hong Kong.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Spain defends pandemic response as case numbers overtake Britain,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's government defended its response to the coronavirus pandemic on Monday after official data showed the country had overtaken Britain to register the highest total number of cases in Western Europe.
""Appropriate measures are being taken to control the pandemic in coordination"" with the regions, the government said in a statement, after experts questioned its policies. ""The data shows that we are being very active in tracking and detecting the virus.""
Health ministry data showed 1,486 new cases were diagnosed in the past day, bringing the cumulative total to 322,980, compared with 311,641 in Britain. 
The disease claimed 65 lives in Spain over the past seven days. More than 28,000 people have died from the disease in Spain, while more than 46,000 have died in Britain.
The government also said it had tested nearly 7.5 million people since the start of the pandemic, with over 400,000 tested in the past week alone.
In the first half of April, Spain was second only to the United States in total cases before reining in its soaring infection rate through a strict nationwide lockdown. 
However, the virus has rebounded sharply since the state of emergency was lifted six weeks ago, with average daily infections surging from 132 in June to nearly 1,500 in the first 10 days of August.
In a letter published in the journal the Lancet last week, a group of Spanish health experts called for an independent evaluation of the government's handling of the crisis and highlighted a litany of flaws.
One signatory, Ildefonso Hernandez Aguado, a public health professor at Alicante's Miguel Hernandez University, said a lack of qualified tracing staff was allowing the disease to spread unseen.
""Some regions have not understood that this was the key in the months after the lockdown and in the long term,"" he said, stressing that authorities should begin hiring and training new personnel as soon as possible. 

He also pointed the finger at Spain's highly social culture: ""This is a country that doesn't understand holding a celebration, or taking a holiday if you're not going to share them"".

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands joined an anti-government demonstration at a Thai university on Monday, the largest such protest by students, challenging the government and conservative establishment even as royalist rivals held their own rally.
About 3,000 to 4,000 protesters chanted ""Long live democracy"" at Thammasat University on Bangkok's outskirts, with fiery speeches calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who first seized power in a 2014 coup.
Earlier on Monday, dozens of government supporters rallied in front of Parliament House on Monday, saying the student protests could threaten Thailand's monarchy, which they consider a sacred institution.
In a sign of a more coordinated opposition to the students, nationalist activist Sumet Trakulwoonnoo, 46, announced a new pro-government group, the Coordination Center of Vocational Students for the Protection of National Institutions (CVPI).
""We're setting up to remind youth groups, parents, teachers and officials about the danger to the nation from these people who are instigating youth to become godless and obsessed with Western culture, do drugs and hate their parents and teachers,"" Sumet told reporters.
The anti-government protesters have made a growing number of references to the monarchy, a highly sensitive topic, and one speaker at a recent rally called for its reform.
The students accused the pro-government demonstrators of trying to create confrontation that could lead to another military intervention.
""We do not want this and will oppose it,"" Nick Thanawit, a student activist from Maha Sarakham University, told the crowd.
Two activists involved in the student protests were arrested on Friday on charges of sedition and breaking restrictions to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. They were later released on bail.
Human Rights Watch said that several other protesters around the country had been harassed.
""Legal action and harassment are intensifying despite Prime Minister Prayuth's promises that the government would listen to the dissenters' demands and concerns,"" said Sunai Phasuk, senior researcher on Thailand for Human Rights Watch.
Government deputy spokeswoman Rachada Dhnadirek denied blocking student activism.

""We don't want to see violence or expressions beyond the bounds of the law,"" Rachada told Reuters.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 02:22PM ET</span>",New clashes in Belarus as West condemns crackdown after election,"By Andrei Makhovsky
MINSK (Reuters) - New clashes between police and protesters broke out in Belarus on Monday after the opposition accused President Alexander Lukashenko of rigging his re-election victory to a chorus of criticism from Western leaders.
A Reuters witness saw police dragging protesters out of a crowd and beating them with truncheons in Minsk, and dozens of people detained. Police also blocked off roads in the capital.
Official results handed Lukashenko, in power for more than a quarter of a century, an 80% share of the vote in Sunday's election, while Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, who emerged from obscurity to become his main rival, took just 9.9%.
""The authorities are not listening to us. The authorities need to think about peaceful ways to hand over power,"" said Tikhanouskaya, a former English teacher who entered the race after her blogger husband was jailed.
""Of course we do not recognise the results.""
Foreign observers have not judged an election to be free and fair in Belarus since 1995, and the run-up to the vote saw authorities jail Lukashenko's rivals and open criminal investigations into others who voiced opposition.
Events are being closely watched by Russia, whose oil exports run through Belarus to the West and which has long regarded the country as a buffer zone against NATO, and by the West, which has tried to lure Minsk from Moscow's orbit. 
Germany called for the European Union to discuss sanctions on Belarus that were lifted in 2016 to foster better relations.
Russian President Vladimir Putin used a congratulatory telegram to nudge Lukashenko to accept deeper ties between the two nations, which the Belarusian leader has previously rejected as an assault on his country's independence.
Riot police used force on Sunday night to disperse thousands of protesters who had gathered to denounce what they said was an electoral farce.
Tikhanouskaya, whose campaign rallies drew some of the biggest crowds since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, told reporters she considered herself the election winner. She said the poll had been massively rigged.
The opposition said they were ready to hold talks with the authorities.
'NO REVOLUTION'
There was no immediate response to that offer from Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm manager who has kept Belarus under tight control since 1994. He faces his biggest challenge in years to hold onto power amid discontent over his handling of the economy, the COVID-19 pandemic, and human rights abuses. 
But Lukashenko signalled he would not step down.
""The response will be appropriate. We won't allow the country to be torn apart,"" the 65-year-old leader was quoted by the Belta news agency as saying.
Lukashenko repeated allegations that shadowy forces abroad were trying to manipulate protesters he called ""sheep"" in order to topple him, something he said he'd never allow.
""They are trying to orchestrate mayhem,"" said Lukashenko. ""But I have already warned: there will be no revolution.""
The European Union's foreign policy chief and its commissioner for enlargement said the election had been marred by ""disproportionate and unacceptable state violence against peaceful protesters"". 
""We condemn the violence and call for the immediate release of all (those) detained during last night,"" Josep Borrell and Oliver Varhelyi said in a joint statement. 
Neighbouring Poland said it wants a special EU summit on Belarus.

Russia's RIA news agency cited the Belarusian Interior Ministry as saying that police had detained around 3,000 people during post-election protests.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's prime minister announced the government's resignation on Monday, saying a huge explosion that devastated Beirut and triggered public outrage was the result of endemic corruption.
The Aug. 4 detonation at a port warehouse of more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate killed at least 163 people, injured more than 6,000 and destroyed swathes of the Mediterranean capital, compounding months of political and economic meltdown.
""Today we follow the will of the people in their demand to hold accountable those responsible for the disaster that has been in hiding for seven years, and their desire for real change,"" Prime Minister Hassan Diab said in a speech announcing the resignation.
President Michel Aoun accepted the resignation and asked Diab's government - formed in January with the backing of Iran's powerful Hezbollah group and its allies - to stay as a caretaker until a new cabinet is formed, a televised announcement said.
Ahead of Diab's announcement, demonstrations broke out for a third day in central Beirut, with some protesters hurling rocks at security forces guarding an entrance leading to the parliament building, who responded with tear gas. 
For many ordinary Lebanese, the explosion was the last straw in a protracted crisis over the collapse of the economy, corruption, waste and dysfunctional governance, and they have taken to the streets demanding root-and-branch change. 
""The entire regime needs to change. It will make no difference if there is a new government,"" Joe Haddad, a Beirut engineer, told Reuters. ""We need quick elections.""
The system of government requires Aoun to consult with parliamentary blocs on who should be the next prime minister, and he is obliged to designate the candidate with the greatest level of support among parliamentarians.
Diab's government was under severe pressure to step down. Some ministers had already resigned over the weekend and Monday while others, including the finance minister, were set to follow suit, ministerial and political sources said.
Diab said on Saturday he would request early parliamentary elections. 
ACCOUNTABILITY
Aoun has said explosive material was stored unsafely for years at the port. In later comments, he said the investigation would consider whether the cause was external interference as well as negligence or an accident.
The cabinet decided to refer the investigation of the blast to the judicial council, the highest legal authority whose rulings cannot be appealed, a ministerial source and state news agency NNA said. The council usually handles top security cases.
Lebanese, meanwhile, are struggling to come to terms with the scale of losses after the blast wrecked entire areas. 
""The economy was already a disaster and now I have no way of making money again,"" said Eli Abi Hanna, whose house and car repair shop were destroyed. ""It was easier to make money during the civil war. The politicians and the economic disaster have ruined everything.""
The Lebanese army said on Monday that another five bodies were pulled from the rubble, raising the death toll to 163. Search and rescue operations continued.
Anti-government protests in the past two days have been the biggest since October, when angry demonstrations spread over an economic crisis rooted in pervasive graft, mismanagement and high-level unaccountability.
An international donor conference on Sunday raised pledges worth nearly 253 million euros ($298 million) for immediate humanitarian relief, but foreign countries are demanding transparency over how the aid is used.
Some Lebanese doubt change is possible in a country where sectarian politicians have dominated since the 1975-90 conflict. 

""It won't work, it's just the same people. It's a mafia,"" said Antoinette Baaklini, an employee of an electricity company that was demolished in the blast.

(Reuters) - A gas explosion ripped through a Baltimore neighborhood on Monday, killing at least one person, injuring four and trapping children as the blast destroyed at least three homes, firefighters said.
Fire officials described it as a natural gas explosion but said the exact cause was under investigation.
The blast destroyed three brick row homes and ripped open the wall of another, spreading debris throughout the neighborhood. Rescuers picked through the rubble, searching for victims with their hands and hand tools, Baltimore City Fire Department spokeswoman Blair Adams told reporters at the scene.
One woman was killed, four people were hospitalized in serious condition, and firefighters were trying to rescue a sixth person, fire officials said.
At one point at least five people were trapped, some of them children, the Baltimore Firefighters IAFF Local 734 said on Twitter.
Neighbors responding to the blast dug through rubble and called out for victims.
One neighbor told the Baltimore Sun he could hear shouts from trapped children.
""Come get us! We're stuck!"" came the cries, Kevin Matthews told the Sun.
Matthews found one person buried from the neck down and another sheltering in a closet, the Sun said.
""You knew it was something catastrophic,"" Dean Jones told WBFF television about hearing the blast. ""I didn't think. I didn't grab shoes. I took off running. I followed the smoke. I started yelling to come help.""
Jones and several other neighbors freed at least one woman from the scene.
""Once they said a kid was in there, I lost it. I said I had to get in there now,"" Jones told WBAL television.
But he also wanted no special accolades, saying, ""I am not a hero, I'm a human."" 

Neighbors said their windows were blown out and doors blasted off the hinges, the Sun reported.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Belarusian protester who was reported to have died during bloody clashes with police after Sunday's presidential election told Reuters he had survived a brutal police beating and that he expected to be detained shortly. 
The shirtless body of Yevgeny Zaichkin, 35, could be seen in Reuters images of protests in Minsk lying on a grassy patch of ground next to a street with a riot police officer in body armour standing over him and gesturing. 
Belarusian opposition media outlet Nexta reported in the early hours of Monday that he had died according to preliminary information and that it was seeking further information. 
Reached by phone on Monday, Zaichkin said he had been taken to hospital after the beating and discharged earlier in the day with concussion, four stitches and bruising across his body. 
He said at least three or four riot police officers had beaten him over his head and body with truncheons. 
The Belarusian Interior Ministry could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Belarusian authorities deny anyone was killed during the protests, but say that dozens of officers and protesters were hurt. Police detained around 3,000 people, the ministry said. 
The protests broke out after the opposition accused President Alexander Lukashenko of rigging the election to secure a landslide victory. 
A representative of the Spring 96 rights group said on Monday that at least one person had been killed during the protests after being knocked over by a police truck. 
The identity and fate of that person could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters. 

More protests were expected later on Monday.

LONDON (Reuters) - England's COVID-19 Test and Trace scheme is to become more locally targeted, the government said on Monday, after data suggested it was not reaching as many contacts of infected people as needed to avoid a second wave of infections.
Launched in late May, the scheme jointly operated by the National Health Service (NHS) and private contractors Serco and Sitel has had setbacks ranging from scrapping a promised homegrown mobile app to reports of contact tracers with nothing to do.
The scheme will lose 6,000 people on Aug. 24, out of a total of 18,000 currently employed by Serco and Sitel to call people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and trace anyone with whom they have been in recent contact.
""As the approach becomes more locally targeted the national service will adjust. NHS Test and Trace will reduce current extra capacity and reduce the number of non-NHS call handlers,"" the health ministry said in a statement.
The new approach will give more responsibility to local authorities and public health teams to track people down, with back-up from teams from the national scheme who will be allocated specific local areas to work on.
""If the dedicated national team cannot make contact with a resident within a set period of time, the local public health officials can use the data provided by NHS Test and Trace to follow up,"" the health ministry said.
The scheme had been criticised by some in the medical and scientific communities for relying too much on contact tracers hired at speed by the private firms and given basic training, as opposed to experienced public health teams with local knowledge.
Last week, a scientific report warned that Britain risked a second wave twice as large as the initial outbreak if it went ahead with plans to reopen schools full-time in September without improving the Test and Trace scheme.
The latest data shows that between Aug. 23 and 29, contact tracers reached just under 80% of people referred to the system after a positive test, and just under 80% of those provided recent contacts. 
Of the 19,150 people who were identified as recent close contacts of infected people, 72% were reached, down from 76% in the previous week.
The scheme covers England, which accounts for about 85% of the UK population. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the health systems are run by semi-autonomous governments.

More than 46,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, the highest death toll in Europe.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",Cairo's Tahrir Square gets a contested makeover,"By Aidan Lewis and Nadeen Ebrahim
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's government has revamped Tahrir Square, dotting the space occupied nearly a decade ago by throngs of anti-regime protesters with Pharaonic monuments and private security guards. 
Officials say they are improving the square in line with famous plazas in Europe, and its facelift - which includes new lighting on repainted buildings - has attracted some praise on social media for its grandiose effect.
Critics say the project appears designed to tighten control of a symbolic public space and prevent future protests. Some archaeologists worry about the preservation of four sandstone sphinxes placed on a busy roundabout.
""I think the main message is that people do not belong to the square and the square does not belong to the people. This is a square that belongs to the state,"" said Khaled Fahmy, a history professor at Cambridge University who participated in the 2011 uprising and ran a short-lived official committee to document it. 
Egypt's state press centre did not respond to questions about the square's redesign. 
Tahrir Square is charged with political symbolism. It gained global renown as the cradle of the revolt that toppled Hosni Mubarak in 2011. 
Two years later, huge crowds massed in the square once again to push for and later celebrate the removal of Mohamed Mursi, Egypt's first freely elected president, by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the then army chief.
Sisi's supporters see 2013 as a correction that allowed him to gain the presidency a year later and stabilise the country. 
A short inscription on the ancient obelisk recently installed in the centre of the square hints at official thinking. Tahrir Square came to symbolise the Egyptian people's ""freedom and steadfastness"" after witnessing the anti-colonial revolution in 1919 and the events of 2011, but ""became a symbol of the Egyptians and their freedom by the June 30th (2013) revolution"", it says.
For Sisi's opponents, 2013 marked the start of a sweeping, crackdown that ended the free-flowing atmosphere of the uprising and its aftermath. 
The authorities view the discussions, meetings, and placards of 2011 as ""deeply subversive"", said Fahmy. 
LOCKDOWN
Rare anti-Sisi protests in September last year triggered a security lockdown around Tahrir Square and a wave of arrests. Spot checks of pedestrians in and around the square became more common. 
In recent weeks, security guards from the Egyptian company Falcon Group appeared as the square's renovation progressed. They hurried on passers-by who approached the monuments.
Falcon declined to comment.
Some people said the renovation made them feel proud. But Mohamed Abdo, a 25-year-old Uber (NYSE:UBER) driver, said the square's overhaul seemed wasteful and deprived ordinary people of space to sit and rest. 
""You are closing it off, saying you cannot do this or that, or sit there,"" he said. ""Before, it was open for everyone."" 
Some are concerned about four ram-headed, sandstone sphinxes placed round the obelisk in the centre of the square. The sphinxes were relocated from the Karnak Temple complex in Luxor, a UNESCO world heritage site 500km (300 miles) south of Cairo. 
Though the granite obelisk should withstand the climate and the pollution, ""it will be more dangerous for the sphinxes as they are made of sandstone, and the rain, mixed in with pollutants could prove damaging"", said Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo. 

Mostafa al-Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the project had allowed the obelisk to be salvaged from an area north-east of Cairo and repaired, and that the sphinxes should resist pollution.

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 11:26AM ET</span>","Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai arrested under security law, bearing out 'worst fears'","By Greg Torode and James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai became the highest-profile person arrested under a new national security law on Monday, detained over suspected collusion with foreign forces as around 200 police searched the offices of his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper.
Mainland-born Lai, who was smuggled into Hong Kong on a fishing boat when he was a penniless 12-year-old, has been one of the most prominent democracy activists in the Chinese-ruled city and an ardent critic of Beijing. 
His arrest comes amid Beijing's crackdown against pro-democracy opposition in the city and further stokes concerns about media and other freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to China in 1997. China imposed the sweeping new security law on Hong Kong on June 30, drawing condemnation from Western countries.
The arrest ""bears out the worst fears that Hong Kong's National Security Law would be used to suppress critical pro-democracy opinion and restrict press freedom"", said Steven Butler, the Committee to Protect Journalists' Asia programme coordinator.
Ryan Law, chief editor of Apple Daily, a staunch anti-government tabloid that also does investigative work, told Reuters the paper would not be intimidated.
""Business as usual,"" he said.
The security law punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. Critics say it crushes freedoms, while supporters say it will bring stability after prolonged pro-democracy protests last year.
Beijing said it supported Lai's arrest.
A spokesman for China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office told the official Xinhua news agency Lai was a representative of people who were ""anti-China, anti-Hong Kong,"" and that he planned and instigated ""illegal"" protests, funded pro-independence forces and used his media group to spread rumours. 
Lai, 71, had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor"". 
Hong Kong police said they had arrested nine men and one woman, aged between 23 and 72, without naming them, adding that further arrests were possible.
Suspected offences included ""collusion with a foreign country/external elements to endanger national security, conspiracy to defraud"" and others, the police said.
Apple Daily posted on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page a livestream of police officers roaming through its newsroom and rifling through files, and asking staff for identity documents.
Some executive offices were sealed off with red cordons. The police later wheeled in stacks of empty plastic containers. Lai himself was brought back to the office, initially in handcuffs. 
""We can't worry that much, we can only go with the flow,"" Lai said, before being escorted into a police vehicle.
Police said around 200 officers entered the premises with a court warrant and collected 25 boxes of evidence after finishing the search. The law allows police to search premises without one ""under exceptional circumstances.""
In major cases in Hong Kong, the central government in Beijing can claim jurisdiction. The legislation allows agents to take suspects across the border for trials in Communist Party-controlled courts.
Apple Daily reported that one of Lai's sons, Ian, had also been arrested at his home and later showed his restaurant, Cafe Seasons, being raided by police.
Shares in Lai's media company Next Digital (HK:0282), which publishes Apple Daily, plunged 16.7% before rebounding to trade 344% higher at one point as online pro-democracy forums called on investors to buy shares to show support.
'THIRD-WORLD'
Other senior Apple Daily staff, including Executive Director Cheung Kim-hung, were also arrested.
""We see this as straight harassment,"" an Apple Daily source said, adding that Lai was arrested on suspicion of sedition, criminal fraud and colluding with foreign forces.
Next Media Trade Union called the search ""an extremely rare and serious incident in Hong Kong history"", with a ""catastrophic"" impact. It said journalists ""will continue to guard their posts until the last minute"". 
Britain said the arrest was further evidence the security law was ""a pretext to silence opposition.""
Hong Kong Journalists Association chairman Chris Yeung said the search was akin to ""third-world"" press freedom suppression.
Apple Daily executive Chan Pui-man said the newspaper will be published on Tuesday.
""Even if Apple Daily publish a pile of blank paper tomorrow, we would go and buy a copy,"" prominent young activist Joshua Wong said on Twitter.
Wong's longtime colleague Agnes Chow and two other activists were among those arrested on Monday, local media reported.
In a Reuters interview in May, Lai pledged to stay in Hong Kong and continue to fight for democracy.
Before Monday, 15 people, including teenagers, had been arrested under the new law.
The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and other officials, drawing mockery and condemnation from Beijing.

The arrest shows Hong Kong ""wasn't intimidated"" by sanctions, Global Times editor Hu Xijin said in a tweet. Global Times is published by China's official Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Monday signed a decree to release a final batch of ""hardcore"" Taliban prisoners demanded by the militants, sources told Reuters, paving the way for long-awaited peace talks to begin in Qatar.
""It is signed,"" a presidential palace source said.
Afghanistan's grand assembly, or Loya Jirga, on Sunday approved the release, under election-year pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump for a deal allowing him to bring home American troops.
The war has ground on since U.S.-backed Afghan forces ousted the Islamist Taliban government in late 2001. 
""We are ready to sit for talks within a week from when we see our prisoners released. We are ready,” Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told Reuters.
It was not immediately clear when the release would happen.
""The original plan is to travel to Doha on Wednesday and the talks will begin on Sunday,"" a government source told Reuters before the decree was signed.
U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who reached an agreement with the Taliban in February for the withdrawal of the last U.S. troops, welcomed the development, having spent months trying to bring the militant movement to the negotiating table with the government. 
""In the next few days, we expect the completion of prisoner releases, then travel of the Islamic Republic team to Doha, & from there the immediate start of intra-Afghan negotiations,"" he said on Twitter.
The Taliban had demanded the release of the last 400 of 5,000 in total as a condition for joining the peace talks.
But the government had been hesitant as these prisoners were involved in some of the worst violence, including a 2017 truck bombing near the German embassy in Kabul that killed more than 150 people - the deadliest attack in the 19-year insurgency. 

The Taliban, in power from 1996-2001, previously refused to talk to the Afghan government, dismissing it as a puppet of the United States.

Police Superintendent David Brown called the outbreak ""pure criminality,"" and Mayor Lori Lightfoot sought to distance the incident from the ""righteous uprising"" in response to the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police on May 25.
""This was not an organized protest. Rather this was an incident of pure criminality,"" Brown told a news conference.
At least 13 officers were injured, and a security guard and a civilian were struck by gunfire, Brown said.
Social media images showed storefronts bashed in and people fleeing stores with arms full of goods, with much of the action taking place along Michigan Avenue, the upscale commercial district known as the Magnificent Mile.
People were drawn by a number of social media posts encouraging looting in central Chicago after tensions flared following the police shooting of a man with a gun, Brown said.
As police questioned a 20-year-old suspect, he fled, firing at the pursuing officers, Brown said. Police returned fire and shot the man, who was hospitalized and expected to survive.
""After the shooting, a crowd gathered. ... Tempers flared, fueled by misinformation as the afternoon turned into evening,"" Brown said.
In response to the social media posts, police sent 400 officers into the area, where they were met by caravans of people arriving in cars, Brown said.
As officers arrested one man carrying a cash register, shots were fired at them from a passing vehicle, and police fired back, Brown said.

Brown pledged a police crackdown in central Chicago, assigning officers to 12-hour shifts and canceling days off.

Attackers on motorbikes ambushed the group on Sunday while driving through the reserve, a popular destination for expatriates 65 km (40 miles) from Niger's capital Niamey in an area considered safe by the government.
Former colonial power France and other countries have warned people against travelling to parts of Niger where militants including Boko Haram and an affiliate of Islamic State operate in rural areas much further from the capital than the reserve. 
""Military operations are ongoing today,"" including the use of air support, the source said. 
""This heinous crime must not go unpunished, nor will it distract us from our commitment to support the people of Niger,"" said a statement from the charity ACTED, which employed the aid workers. 
'THE FIGHT CONTINUES'
Marie-Pierre Caley, ACTED's director and co-founder, told reporters in Paris that the group, following security protocol, left Niamey at 0830 (0730 GMT) on Sunday and reported their arrival at the reserve an hour later.
An internal army memo seen by Reuters suggests the attack likely took place within an hour of arrival. 
ACTED's development director Frederic Roussel said four men and four women, aged between 25 and 50, died. 
""Until yesterday, the area had not known any security incident, that is why the main road and the park are in the yellow zone,"" he said, referring to a colour system for risk. 
No one has claimed responsibility.
The office of France's anti-terrorism prosecutor said it was launching an investigation. ""Our determination to combat armed terrorist groups is resolute. The fight continues,"" French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted.
The reserve southeast of Niamey, where acacia bushes dot sandy plains, is home to West Africa's last sizeable population of giraffe in the wild. 

France has 5,100 troops deployed in the arid region south of the Sahara desert, and the United States also has soldiers based in Niger. Nonetheless, militant violence has been on the rise.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Mauritians are making floating booms of human hair and leaves in a round-the-clock scramble to mop up oil leaking from a grounded Japanese ship onto their pristine Indian Ocean beaches. 
The MV Wakashio, owned by the Nagashiki Shipping Company and operated by Mitsui OSK Line, began oozing fuel into turquoise sea waters last week after hitting a reef off the island.
Mauritius has declared a state of emergency and former colonial ruler France has sent aid in what environmental group Greenpeace said could be a major ecological crisis.
Romina Tello, 30-year-old founder of eco-tourism agency Mauritius Conscious, spent the weekend helping clean black sludge from mangrove swamps. She said Mauritians were making booms to float on the sea out of sugar cane leaves, plastic bottles and hair that people were voluntarily cutting off.
""Hair absorbs oil but not water,"" Tello explained by phone. ""There's been a big campaign around the island to get the hair."" 
Videos online show volunteers sewing leaves and hair into nets to float on the surface and corral the oil until it can be sucked up by hoses. 
Diving centres, fishermen and others have all joined in the cleanup effort, with some providing sandwiches, guesthouses offering free accommodation to volunteers and hair salons offering discounts to those donating hair, Tello said. 
The oil spill is near the Blue Bay Marine Park, known for its spectacular corals and myriad fish species. 
""It is really moving – everyone is doing what we can. It breaks our hearts to see the damage,"" Tello said. 
Mauritius relies on tourism as a major contributor to its economy, 63 billion rupees ($1.6 billion) last year.
""We apologise profusely and deeply for the great trouble we have caused,"" Akihiko Ono, executive vice president of Mitsui OSK Lines, told reporters in Tokyo on Sunday, pledging to do everything possible to stem the spill.

At least 1,000 tonnes of oil is estimated to have leaked, with 500 tonnes salvaged and some 2,500 tonnes remaining.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Monday he wanted neighbouring Belarus to reactivate stalled plans for more integration with Russia after a contested election win left Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, an on-off Russian ally, on the defensive.
Putin made his suggestion as the opposition in Belarus rejected official election results handing Lukashenko a landslide re-election victory, saying that talks needed to begin on a peaceful transfer of power.
Thousands of people unhappy with the results clashed with police across Belarus on Sunday night. 
The Russian leader has long pushed for closer ties with Minsk under the auspices of a unified state, something Lukashenko has so far rejected, accusing Russia of wanting to swallow up his country of 9.5 million people.
Belarus is a key transit country for Russian oil flowing to the West, and Moscow has long viewed it as a useful buffer zone between itself and NATO.
""I hope your state activity will facilitate mutually beneficial Russian-Belarusian relations in all areas, deepen cooperation within the Union State, and build up integration processes,"" Putin said in a congratulatory telegram to Lukashenko. 
Putin said he hoped Belarus would opt, too, for closer military-political ties with Russia inside a defence bloc that they both belong to.
There was no immediate response from Lukashenko, a 65-year-old former collective farm manager who has spent years trying to play Russia off against the West and China, blowing hot and cold on closer ties to Moscow.
He has previously baulked at closer ties after Russia scaled back subsidies to the Belarusian energy sector, and in a pre-election speech excoriated Russia, saying Moscow had downgraded formerly brotherly relations to those of a partnership.
Lukashenko said last week that oil disputes with Russia had deprived his country of $700 million after the two countries failed to agree an oil supply contract earlier this year.
He has also rejected Russian overtures to open an air base on Belarusian soil and accused a group of detained Russian private security contractors of flying into Belarus before the election to help bring about a revolution, something Moscow has flatly denied.
Putin is not the only one watching events in Russia's tiny neighbour.
The anti-Kremlin opposition say they are following closely to see how effective the Belarusian opposition play-book is, saying they believe Russia will face a similar scenario to Belarus when Putin is next up for re-election in 2024.

Disagreements between Britain's constituent nations - Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England - over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic have damaged relations already badly strained by Brexit.
That is particularly the case in Scotland, which voted against leaving the European Union and where opinion polls show support for independence narrowly outweighs support for its 300-year union with England.
""The union of the United Kingdom is, for me, it's the greatest political partnership the world has ever seen,"" Johnson told broadcasters, when asked what the union meant to him.
""It would be such a shame to lose the power, the magic of that union."" 
Scotland voted 55 percent to 45 percent against independence in a 2014 referendum, but the Scottish National Party which runs the semi-autonomous nation wants another vote. Although voters there backed staying in the EU, Britain as a whole voted to leave.
Johnson's Conservative Party, which governs all of Britain and decides policy in areas that have not been devolved to Scotland, is a strong supporter of the union and dismisses any call for another vote.
However, Johnson and other senior ministers have visited Scotland in recent weeks, talking at length about the strength and benefits of the relationship.

The court in the capital, Algiers, also handed a four-month jail sentence to two other activists for the same charges, according to the National Committee for the Release of Detainees. Justice Ministry officials could not be reached for comment.
The sentences against jounalist Khaled Drareni and activists Samir Benlarbi and Slimane Hamitouche are linked to protests that toppled President Abdelaziz Bouteflika last year.
The protests broke out in February 2019 to reject Bouteflika's plan to seek a fifth term in power, and demand the departure of the ruling elite.
The authorities banned the demonstrations earlier this year to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
Drareni has been in detention since late March, while Benlarbi and Hamitouche were released in July after being detained for more than two months.
The authorities, as part of appeasement measures, have released several protesters since the election of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune last December.

France and Germany have quit talks on reforming the WHO in frustration at attempts by the United States to lead the negotiations, despite its decision to leave the WHO, three officials told Reuters.
The move is a setback for President Donald Trump as Washington, which holds the rotating chair of the G7, had hoped to issue a joint roadmap for a sweeping overhaul of the WHO in September, two months before the U.S. presidential election.

""We are all vulnerable to risks, we need to find global solutions,"" Ryan said. ""...We trust the G7 will play a major part in that in the months and years to come.""

Mnangagwa, during a Heroes Day speech in Harare, said the allegations were ""unjustified attacks by our perennial detractors, both inside and outside our border"".
""The divisive falsehoods and concoctions by renegades and supremacists who want to pounce on our natural resources will never win the day. Truth shall triumph over lies, and good over evil,"" said Mnangagwa, who replaced Robert Mugabe after a 2017 coup. 
Hopes that Mnangagwa would unite a polarised country and revive a stricken economy following the Mugabe era have been dashed. Like his predecessor, Mnangagwa accuses the West of funding the opposition to destabilise the country.
Human rights groups and lawyers say activists are being arrested, abducted and tortured after they called for street demonstrations on July 31, which the government snuffed out by deploying security forces.
The main opposition Movement for Democratic Change says about 30 of its members have fled their homes fearing abduction or arrest by state security agents.
The events in Zimbabwe have worried South Africa enough that President Cyril Ramaphosa send two veteran politicians Sydney Mufamadi and Baleka Mbete to Harare.
The envoys arrived on Monday and were expected to meet Mnangagwa later in the day, a government official said.
Critics also say Mnangagwa is using the cover of a COVID-19 lockdown to silence critics as anger grows over 737% inflation - which has brought back memories of hyperinflation under Mugabe a decade ago - a collapsing health sector and shortage of public transport.
Mnangagwa, however, said his government had set a firm foundation ""for a thriving constitutional democracy, and a just, open, accountable and prosperous society"".

""The Ukrainian plane is insured by European companies in Ukraine and not by Iranian (insurance) companies,"" said Gholamreza Soleimani, according to the Young Journalists Club news website affiliated with state TV. ""Therefore, compensation should be paid by those European companies.""
Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards shot down the Ukraine International Airlines flight with a ground-to-air missile on Jan. 8 just after the plane took off from Tehran, in what Tehran later acknowledged as a “disastrous mistake” by forces who were on high alert during a confrontation with the United States.
Soleimani's comments concerned the aircraft and did not address potential compensation for victims' families. There was no immediate comment from European aviation insurers.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in February that Ukraine was not satisfied with the size of compensation Iran had offered to families of Ukrainians killed in the incident. Ukrainian officials have said that Ukraine would make every effort to maximise the amount of restitution.
Last month, Iranian and Ukrainian officials held talks on the compensation, with another round set for October.
In a July report, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation blamed a chain of mistakes - such as a misalignment of a radar system and lack of communication between the air defence operator and his commanders - for the plane crash that killed 176 aboard, including 57 Canadians.
The downing occurred at a time of high tension between longtime foes Iran and the United States. 
Iran was on alert for attacks after it fired missiles at Iraqi bases housing U.S. forces in retaliation for the killing on Jan. 3 of its most powerful military commander, Qassem Soleimani, in a U.S. missile strike at Baghdad airport.

MAASAI MARA,Kenya (Reuters) - Normally, the magnificent plains of Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve are crowded with international tourists hoping to see a lion hunt during the annual wildebeest migration - but this year COVID-19 means Kenyans had it all to themselves. 
That's good news for animal watchers but bad for conservationists who rely on the funds to pay for rangers and protection. By June, Kenya had already lost 80 billion Kenyan shillings ($740 million)in tourism revenue, about half of last year's total, due to the coronavirus crisis.
This weekend, thousands of mostly Kenyan visitors travelled to the park to witness the migration. There were few foreigners - Kenya shut down international flights in March and only resumed them on Aug. 1. 
""Once I came here, my thought and my view about everything has changed. I am actually embarrassed that I have not come here the 29 years I have been alive,"" tourist Patience Mumo said.
So far Kenya has just over 26,000 confirmed cases of the disease and 420 deaths. Tourist resorts are required to observe strict social distancing and hygiene measures but have been allowed to reopen. 
""We are trying to revive the sector through the domestic tourism strategy. And that is why we ask Kenyans ... to support tourism,"" Tourism and Wildlife Minister Najib Balala said.
As part of that push, the government was using celebrities like Eliud Kipchoge, world marathon record holder, to showcase local attractions like the Mara. 

""What has impressed me is the terrain, the environment, the good air, the presence of animals,"" Kipchoge told Reuters after having a jog with game rangers.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Six weeks after China imposed sweeping national security laws on Hong Kong, police moved in on media tycoon Jimmy Lai, one of the most outspoken critics of Beijing in the city.
Lai, 71, was whisked away from his home early on Monday morning by national security police, part of a citywide operation that also saw eight other men arrested, including several of his senior executives.
Then, just before 10 a.m., hundreds of police descended on Lai's corporate Next Digital (HK:0282) headquarters, where his flagship Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily is produced and published. 
Staffers said they asked police what legal grounds they had for entering. But these questions were largely ignored as more than 200 police streamed in, according to a live feed of the unfolding drama.
Apple Daily's Editor-in-Chief Ryan Law, who was helping film and comment on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) live feed, could be seen rushing about the building as he tried to report on events breaking in his own newsroom.
""This is, I believe, the first time in Hong Kong that police have initiated a mass search on a media outlet like this,"" he said, panting, as he scaled a back staircase with a colleague to get around the mass of police officers. 
As news of the raid spread, more than 10,000 people tuned in, watching as Law defied police warnings to stop filming. 
The newsroom was lightly staffed at the time.
But the few employees there, some clad in shorts and sneakers, were told to produce identity documents and register with the police. Some demanded to first see a search warrant.
Some desks were festooned with poster art in support of pro-democracy protests last year, and the Umbrella movement of 2014. One read: ""Who's afraid of the truth!"" 
More police began arriving, and fanned across the newsroom, following by Law as they meandered through the unmanned cubicles in scattershot fashion, lifting a paper here, plucking a folder from a cabinet there.
""What is the scope of your search area?"" one voice was heard shouting off camera. A male officer replied that such inquiries should be put to his supervisors.
Several executive offices, including Lai's, were sealed off with a red cordon and guarded by police.
PREPARED FOR RAID
Two months before, in an interview with Reuters in one of those sealed rooms, Lai said he was bracing for just such a day: shifting assets abroad and making preparations with lawyers.
""Everything will be piled on us,"" he had said. 
At around 11 a.m., police led the crew-cut Lai into his office in handcuffs. When he went to the toilet, an entourage of around 20 officers followed. Several other senior executives were also shown being taken into the building.
The police said in a statement that they had a court-issued warrant for their search, and that the nine men had all been arrested for suspected national security law violations, including collusion with foreign powers. 
The police did not reveal the names or any specific charges for any of those arrested. 
The raid, though expected, rattled some staffers.
Months before the law took effect, the newspaper had shredded documents, uploaded digitised files to overseas servers and safeguarded sources, two senior reporters told Reuters, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the situation.
""I had prepared myself mentally for this,"" one said. ""But emotionally I feel a little conflicted. It's happened so quickly. The government is finally taking this drastic step to destroy the city's media freedoms.""
Police carted 25 boxes of evidence from the building and blocked reporters from other outlets from entering.
Senior police on the scene tried at one point to prevent Apple Daily reporters working at their desks, but relented upon fierce objections from staff present. 
Law, Apple Daily's chief editor, said the paper would continue to be published no matter what.

""Business as usual,"" he said in a text message to Reuters.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Chinese air force jets briefly crossed the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait on Monday and were tracked by Taiwanese missiles, Taiwan's government said, as U.S. health chief Alex Azar visited the island to offer President Donald Trump's support.
Azar arrived in Taiwan on Sunday, the highest-level U.S. official to visit in four decades. 
China, which claims the island as its own, condemned the visit which comes after a period of sharply deteriorating relations between China and the United States.
China, which had promised unspecified retaliation to the trip, flew J-11 and J-10 fighter aircraft briefly onto Taiwan's side of the sensitive and narrow strait that separates it from its giant neighbour, at around 9 am (0100 GMT), shortly before Azar met Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's air force said.
The aircraft were tracked by land-based Taiwanese anti-aircraft missiles and were ""driven out"" by patrolling Taiwanese aircraft, the air force said in a statement released by the defence ministry. 
China's defence ministry did not immediately comment.
A senior Taiwan official familiar with the government's security planning told Reuters that China was obviously ""targeting"" Azar's visit with a ""very risky"" move given the Chinese jets were in range of Taiwan's missiles.
The incursion was only the third time since 2016 that Taiwan has said Chinese jets had crossed the strait's median line.
The Trump administration has made strengthening its support for the democratic island a priority, amid deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing, and has boosted arms sales.
""It's a true honour to be here to convey a message of strong support and friendship from President Trump to Taiwan,"" Azar told Tsai in the Presidential Office, standing in front of two Taiwanese flags.
Washington broke off official ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing. 
'HUGE STEP'
Azar is visiting to strengthen economic and public-health cooperation with Taiwan and support its international role in fighting the novel coronavirus.
""Taiwan's response to COVID-19 has been among the most successful in the world, and that is a tribute to the open, transparent, democratic nature of Taiwan's society and culture,"" he told Tsai.
Taiwan's early and effective steps to fight the disease have kept its case numbers far lower than those of its neighbours, with 480 infections and seven deaths. Most cases have been imported.
The United States, which has had more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country, has repeatedly clashed with China over the pandemic, accusing Beijing of lacking transparency.
Tsai told Azar his visit represented ""a huge step forward in anti-pandemic collaborations between our countries"", mentioning areas of cooperation including vaccine and drug research and production.
Taiwan has been particularly grateful for U.S. support to permit its attendance at the World Health Organization's decision-making body the World Health Assembly (WHA), and to allow it greater access to the organisation.
Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to China's objections. China considers Taiwan a Chinese province.
""I'd like to reiterate that political considerations should never take precedence over the rights to health. The decision to bar Taiwan from participating in the WHA is a violation of the universal rights to health,"" Tsai said.
Azar later told reporters that at Trump's direction, he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had sought to restore Taiwan's status as an observer at the WHA.

""But the Chinese Communist Party and the World Health Organization have prevented that. This has been one of the major frustrations that the Trump administration has had with the World Health Organization and its inability to reform.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in replaced some of his senior aides on Monday as part of a shake-up aimed at jacking up approval ratings amid criticism over skyrocketing home prices.
Moon swapped out his senior secretary for political affairs, senior secretary on civil affairs, and an aide who oversees policy on civic society cooperation. 
The three replaced officials are part of a team led by Moon's chief of staff, Noh Young-min. They had offered to resign last week amid mounting criticism over housing policy.
There is speculation that Moon will also remove Noh and others in the coming days, but opposition lawmakers have called for the sacking of officials more closely responsible for the real estate policies, including Moon's economic policy chief and the finance and land ministers.
Home prices in Seoul have soared more than 50% since 2017, the fastest pace in the world, according to statistics site Numbeo, despite more than 20 cooling policies introduced under Moon.
Moon's approval ratings have plunged to a near nine-month low of 43.1%, wiping out an earlier surge, according to pollster Realmeter on Monday. Approval of Moon's handling of the coronavirus crisis had help his rating reach to 64% and party clinched a landslide victory in the parliamentary election in April.
The main opposition party trailed the ruling party by just 0.5%, the smallest gap in the approval ratings during Moon's tenure.

The decision marks a comeback for the former Hamburg mayor, who was last year defeated in the race to lead his party by two left-wing outsiders. Now, Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans have nominated their erstwhile rival.
""Now it's official,"" Scholz wrote on Twitter. ""The party leadership have unanimously nominated me as chancellor candidate. I look forward to a fun, fair and successful campaign.""
But Scholz, who has been turned by the coronavirus crisis from an austere-minded custodian of the public purse to the free-spending paymaster in charge of massive stimulus and healthcare spending to sustain Europe's largest economy through the pandemic, faces a stiff challenge.
The party, which for decades vied with Merkel's Christian Democrats to dominate the political scene, has not won a national election since 2002 and now languishes a distant third in most polls behind the conservatives and the upstart Greens.

In what some saw as a recognition of this reality, party co-leader Walter-Borjans on Sunday conceded what had once been anathema: that alongside the Greens, the party would be open to govern in coalition with the Left party, heirs to the Communist Party of the former East Germany.

AUBENCHEUL-AU-BAC, France (Reuters) - On a farm in France, firefighters beat down the flames that had turned a field of wheat black, but they were too late to save the combine harvester. Caught in the blaze, it belched out flames and thick smoke while the farmer looked on helpless.
Crop and forest fires are a ritual of summer in France, but a warming climate has meant the risk has increased and the danger zone has expanded from southern France to the north, scientists say.
The blaze in July that destroyed the combine harvester was in a district near the border with Belgium where, farmers say, worrying about wildfires is something new.
“It’s an occurrence that we weren’t seeing four or five years ago here,"" said Benoit Vaillant, who with his family runs a different farm in the same region of northern France.
Scientists who track forest and crop fires in France say that last year saw a small decline in the surface area affected, and this year has not seen any exceptional increase.
But they say that is largely down to good fortune; while this July was the driest in about 60 years in France, that has not coincided with the winds that stoke fires.
“But if the drought persists and if there is a lot of wind, the situation could quickly get worse,” said Eric Martin of France's National Institute of Agriculture Research.
The fundamental precursor for fires, according to scientists, is how much moisture there is in vegetation. And studies show that the moisture level has been dropping year by year, in step with rising temperatures.
Vaillant said last year the moisture content of the straw he grows on his farm dropped to 9%.

""That means that the straw is drier than the Sahara air,"" he said. ""And so you put a spark in there and it catches fire, and with a bit of wind, it’s fanned and stoked.”

The distinctive brown and white mud brick houses of Sanaa's historic neighbourhoods, which date from before the 11th century, have long been under threat from conflict and neglect. 
Muhammad Ali al-Talhi's house partially collapsed on Friday as heavy rain battered Sanaa, leaving the six women and six children of his family homeless. 
""Everything we had is buried,"" he said surrounded by ancient debris and mud, appealing for help to find shelter.
Aqeel Saleh Nassar, deputy head of the Historic Cities Preservation Authority, said citizens today do not maintain these old buildings as in the past, leading to cracks and weakness.
Around 5,000 of the towering buildings in the old city have leaky roofs and 107 have partially collapsed roofs, he said. The authority has been working with UNESCO and other funds to preserve some. 
This year's exceptionally heavy rains, which began mid-April and last into early September, have added to what the United Nations describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. 
Five years of war have killed more than 100,000 people, and left 80% of the population reliant on aid and millions on the brink of famine. 
On top of the new coronavirus, which is believed to be spreading largely undetected, heavy rains spread diseases like cholera, dengue fever and malaria. 
The Iran-aligned Houthi authorities who have controlled Sanaa since ousting the internationally recognised Saudi-backed Yemeni government in late 2014, appealed this week to UNESCO to save the city's heritage. 
They said around 111 houses had partly or completely collapsed in recent weeks. 
Sanaa resident Adel San'ani on Saturday told Reuters he saw five houses severely damaged this weekend. 

""The families have no shelter. A local bank launched a campaign to distribute plastic sheeting to act as roofs,"" he said.

The GCC, made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, said on Sunday that Iran's continued interference in neighbouring countries made an extension necessary. 
The arms embargo is currently set to end on Oct. 18 as part of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which the United States quit in 2018.
""The GCC is currently at the apex of its incompetence and its unrealistic policies have rendered it ineffective,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told a televised news conference.
""The council, swayed by the wrong and destructive policies and behaviour of certain member states, has turned into a mouthpiece for anti-Iran elements inside and outside the region.""
U. S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that the United Nations Security Council will vote this week on a U.S. bid to extend the arms embargo on Iran, despite warnings by some diplomats that the measure lacks support.
If the United States is unsuccessful in extending the embargo, it has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran under a process agreed in the 2015 deal. 
In May, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani threatened a ""crushing response"" if the embargo on Iranian trade of conventional arms was extended. 
Iran has breached parts of the nuclear deal in response to the 2018 U.S. withdrawal and Washington’s reimposition of sanctions.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 12:01AM ET</span>",Testing royal taboos: inside Thailand's new youth protests,"By Panu Wongcha-um and Kay Johnson
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Over two days of video calls earlier this month, about a dozen students from Thailand’s Kasetsart and Mahanakorn universities debated whether to break a taboo that could land them in jail: openly challenging the country’s powerful monarchy, according to two people on the calls.
Protesters on the streets and online have made a growing number of veiled references to King Maha Vajiralongkorn over the last few months as they push for greater democracy, but nobody had dared make a public call for changes at the palace.
The students discussed on the calls a Harry Potter wizard-themed protest and considered stopping short of open confrontation by only mentioning ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,"" a reference to Potter’s archenemy in the J.K. Rowling books, the two participants said. 
The argument for a clearer – but riskier – statement won out.
On the evening of Monday, Aug. 3, human rights lawyer Anon Nampa, 35, took the stage at Bangkok's Democracy Monument and called for the palace's powers to be curbed, an extremely rare event.
“No other democratic countries allow the king to have this much power over the military,” he told about 200 protesters, with police standing by as he spoke. “This increases the risk that a monarchy in a democracy could become an absolute monarchy.”
While the country has been roiled by decades of political turmoil, street protesters have not previously sought changes to the monarchy, which the constitution says must be held ""in a position of revered worship."" 
Any form of challenge to the monarchy was extremely rare under Vajiralongkorn's father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016 after 70 years on the throne. 
Neither Anon nor any of the protesters have been charged with breaking Thailand’s ‘lese majeste’ law, which punishes criticism of the monarchy by up to 15 years in prison. 
However, on Friday Aug. 7 police said Anon was taken into custody and charged with several offences relating to a separate protest on July 18, including ""raising unrest and disaffection amongst the people,” which carries a maximum seven-year sentence.
Anon has denied all charges, said his lawyer Weeranan Huadsri. He was freed on bail on Saturday.
The Royal Palace declined to comment on the protests or the more outspoken calls for royal powers to be curbed.
Defence Ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantrawanit said: “Don't draw the monarchy into conflict, it is not appropriate. The monarchy is a centre of unity for the Thai people.”  
SWEPT UNDER THE RUG
Anon’s open call for reform underscored the scale and speed of change in Thailand as some members of a new generation take on an establishment tied to the close relationship between the palace and the army. The king, a former army officer, is officially commander-in-chief of the armed forces. 
“This is an issue that people want to talk about,” said Patsalawalee Tanakitwiboonpon, a 24-year-old engineering student at Mahanakorn University who helped plan and spoke at the protest on Monday. “It has been swept under the rug for so long. So we think it is better if we can talk about this issue rationally and in the open.”
The latest series of protests have grown from a handful of peaceful, online-organized flash mobs, mostly on university campuses, to dozens of street demonstrations across Thailand and millions of people following hashtags online such as #FreeYouth.
The reaction from authorities, so far, has been limited. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who first took power in a 2014 military coup, told reporters on Aug. 4, the day after Anon’s speech, that the government was open to talking to the students. He said on June 15 that the king had requested no prosecutions under the lese majeste law. 
Army chief Apirat Kongsompong was not so conciliatory. In a speech to cadets on Aug. 5, he said:  ""COVID is a curable disease, but hating the nation, hating one's own country, this a disease that is not curable."" 
On Aug. 4, the day after the protest, Anon told Reuters he was “not too worried” about being arrested. He had planned to speak out about the monarchy at two further protests in coming days, according to his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
The police said in a statement on Friday that Anon and another organizer were arrested because it had received complaints about the July 18 protest and that an investigation was under way. Police declined to say who had complained or describe the nature of the complaints. 
The police did not explain why Anon had not been charged under the lese majeste law for his speech at the Aug. 3 protest. 
BOUND IN HISTORY  
Even though King Vajiralongkorn spends much of his time in Germany, his image is pervasive in Thailand. Gold-framed royal portraits look down on city streets. Cinemas play a royal anthem at which audiences are traditionally expected to stand. 
Many Thai conservatives say the bond between the monarchy and army is a guarantee of stability. The military strongly supports the palace's position as Thailand’s highest moral authority, with its head taking an unprecedented public oath last year to only support a government that backs the monarchy. 
Some analysts say the military uses its close association with the monarchy to justify its prominent role in Thai politics. Ex-army chief Prayuth has appointed three retired military leaders to cabinet positions and more than a third of Senate seats are held by current or former military officers.
Meanwhile, the king has strengthened his constitutional powers since he took the throne in 2016. In his speech, Anon gave two examples of the king accruing powers he described as incompatible with democracy: Prayuth’s government transferring two army units to the king’s personal control in 2019 and moving the crown’s vast property holdings into the king’s name in 2017. 
""Yes, I am afraid, but if we don't come out to talk about what is necessary then the problems will continue,” said student Thanapol Panngam, 27, one of the organizers of Monday’s protest.
So far, only a handful of the dozens of student protest groups have openly criticised the monarchy, but they are united in demanding change after a disputed election last year which allowed former junta leader Prayuth to retain power. Critics say the election was pre-determined by rules written by the military that automatically gave Prayuth a significant number of votes. Prayuth says the vote was fair. 
""Our main ideology is to promote democracy,"" said Jutatip Sirikhan, 21, president of the Student Union of Thailand, which has helped organise the protests and has not criticised the palace. 
The protests took off around the beginning of this year after courts banned the opposition Future Forward party, which had emerged from obscurity to a surprisingly strong third place in elections, helped by wide youth support for its call to end the military’s dominance over the country’s politics. 
""How's the weather in Germany?"" read one placard at one of the first campus protests in Bangkok in February, a seemingly innocuous question but one that most Thais would recognise as a reference to Vajiralongkorn spending more time in Bavaria than Bangkok.
Then the new coronavirus halted the protests as Thailand locked down.
But from their phones and laptops back home, the activists kept up the pressure online - and with it the questioning of the monarchy. 
In March, #whydoweneedaking? was used more than 1 million times on Thai-language Twitter. A Thai-language Facebook group that often mocks the monarchy has attracted more than 850,000 members. 
During the lockdown, the students were also planning their next moves. ""There were Zoom meetings that would include more than a dozen people, and they would go on for hours,"" recalled Jutatip.
Protesters reappeared on the streets in force on July 18, spurred on by anger at economic pain caused by the collapse in tourism due to the coronavirus and the apparent kidnapping of an exiled Thai activist - the latest of several to disappear. Human rights groups say Wanchalearm Satsaksit, 37, was grabbed by unknown assailants in Cambodia in June and has not been seen since. The government and military have denied involvement.
BACK TO THE 70s
The latest youth-led demonstrations resemble pro-democracy student movements of the 1970s, some analysts say. 
Thailand has seen repeated cycles of military intervention: there have been 13 successful coups since the end of absolute royal rule in 1932. King Bhumibol intervened in 1973 and 1992 to quell tensions after crackdowns by military rulers killed protesters. 
Not all young Thais are on the same side. Pro-democracy protests have been met with royalist defenders of the government staging their own, smaller rallies.
“Many Thais have been concerned about offensive things against the monarchy,” said Totsapol Manoonyarat, a royalist former vocational student who said he was inspired by love of the king to join a counter-protest in Bangkok.
Stark divisions pose a dilemma for the government, some analysts say.

""If they crack down on critics, they risk creating a backlash,"" said Matthew Wheeler, senior Southeast Asia analyst for the International Crisis Group. ""But if they let it slide, there's a risk the taboo will crumble.""

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese police fired tear gas to try to disperse rock-throwing protesters blocking a road near parliament in Beirut on Sunday in a second day of anti-government demonstrations triggered by last week's devastating explosion.
Fire broke out at an entrance to Parliament Square as demonstrators tried to break into a cordoned-off area, TV footage showed. Protesters also broke into the housing and transport ministry offices.
Two government ministers resigned amid the political fallout of the blast and months of economic crisis, saying the government had failed to reform.
Tuesday's explosion of more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate killed 158 people and injured more than 6,000, compounding months of political and economic collapse and prompting furious calls for the government to quit.
Riot police wearing body armour and carrying batons clashed with demonstrators as thousands converged on Parliament Square and nearby Martyrs' Square, a Reuters correspondent said.
""We gave these leaders so many chances to help us and they always failed. We want them all out, especially Hezbollah, because it's a militia and just intimidates people with its weapons,"" Walid Jamal, an unemployed demonstrator, said, referring to the country's most influential Iran-backed armed grouping that has ministers in the government.
The country's top Christian Maronite cleric, Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, said the cabinet should resign as it cannot ""change the way it governs"".
""The resignation of an MP or a minister is not enough ... the whole government should resign as it is unable to help the country recover,"" he said in his Sunday sermon.
Lebanon's environment minister resigned on Sunday, saying the government had lost a number of opportunities to reform, a statement said.
Damianos Kattar's departure follows the resignation of Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad earlier on Sunday
in the wake of the explosion.
Anger boiled over into violent scenes in central Beirut on Saturday. Those protests were the biggest since October when thousands of people took to the streets to demand an end to corruption, bad governance and mismanagement.
About 10,000 people gathered at Martyrs' Square, which was transformed into a battle zone in the evening between police and protesters who tried to break down a barrier along a road leading to parliament. Some demonstrators stormed government ministries and the Association of Lebanese Banks. 
One policeman was killed and the Red Cross said more than 170 people were injured in clashes.
'CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT'
""The police fired at me. But that won't stop us from demonstrating until we change the government from top to bottom,"" Younis Flayti, 55, a retired army officer, said on Sunday.
Nearby, mechanic Sabir Jamali sat beside a noose attached to a wooden frame in Martyrs' Square, intended as a symbolic warning to Lebanese leaders to resign or face hanging.
""Every leader who oppresses us should be hanged,"" he said, adding he will protest again.
Lawyer Maya Habli surveyed the demolished port.
""People should sleep in the streets and demonstrate against the government until it falls,"" she said.
The prime minister and presidency have said 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, which is used in making fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years without safety measures at the port warehouse. 
The government has said it will hold those responsible to account.
An emergency donor conference in France raised pledges worth nearly 253 million euros ($298 million) for immediate humanitarian relief, the French presidency said.
For many, the blast was a dreadful reminder of the 1975-1990 civil war that tore the nation apart and destroyed swathes of Beirut, much of which has since been rebuilt.
""I worked in Kuwait for 15 years in sanitation to save money and build a gift shop in Lebanon and it was destroyed by the explosion,"" said Maroun Shehadi.

""Nothing will change until our leaders just leave.""

A Newspoll conducted for The Australian newspaper showed Morrison enjoyed the best approval rating over an opposition leader in more than five years.
Morrison's popularity fell over his handling of bush fires late last year but he has improved his standing with his response to the pandemic, as the country battles a new wave of infections in Victoria state.
Morrison jettisoned his conservative government's aversion to deficits to pledge spending worth about A$100 billion ($71.50 billion) to employers to keep staff they might otherwise have let go.
The government last week eased rules to qualify for its wage subsidy scheme as a flare-up in infections in Victoria forced large parts of the economy to close.
With just over 21,400 infections and 314 deaths from the virus, Australia has fared better than many other developed nations, helped by strict lockdowns that are expected to push unemployment up towards 10%.
Australia's central bank downgraded its outlook for the national economy on Friday and warned unemployment would stay high for several years.
Morrison's approval ratings remained at a high of 68% against a two-point rise among those dissatisfied with his performance, the poll showed.

The poll was based on surveys of just over 1,500 voters across the capital city of Canberra and other regions from Wednesday to Saturday.

ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Faisal Khan, a 15-year-old Pakistani, beams for selfies with lawyers and police. Thousands hail him in the streets as a ""holy warrior."" 
His claim to adulation? Allegedly gunning down in open court an American accused of blasphemy, a capital crime in this Islamic republic.
Khan is charged with murder, which also carries a death sentence. But while lawyers line up to defend him, the attorney for Tahir Naseem, the U.S. citizen, has gone into hiding.
The teen, according to officials and witnesses, got through three security checkpoints on his way into a courtroom in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar on July 29, pulled out a pistol and fired multiple shots into Naseem, 57, at a bail hearing.
Naseem died on the spot, onlookers spattered with his blood.
His killing grabbed global headlines, put a fresh spotlight on Pakistan's blasphemy laws and drew criticism from abroad, even as many in the country praised the shooter. The United States and human rights groups decried the killing and urged changes to Pakistan's blasphemy statutes, among the harshest in the world.
Closer to home, Khan is a hero.
""It's one of those cases where everyone wants to be his lawyer,"" Inamullah Yusufzai, who represented Khan at his first court hearing last week, told Reuters. Yusufzai said lawyers from across Pakistan had called to defend Khan for free, to support what they see as the justified killing of a heretic. 
The case has not reached the stage for Khan to enter a plea.
Thousands rallied, calling for Khan's release. Delegations of well-wishers - lawyers, clerics, local politicians - have visited the Khan family home in Peshawar to congratulate the family. He has received messages of support from the Pakistani Taliban.
A selfie shot by Elite Force police guards in a van escorting Khan to court after his arrest was shared widely on social media. Wearing all white, the teen grins broadly. Several officers smile, one gives a thumbs-up. 
A senior police official, who said the force had looked the photo, said it was authentic. Reuters could not independently confirm its authenticity. 
Another selfie shows a crowd, some black-clad lawyers, escorting a beaming Khan into court.
BLASPHEMY
The U.S. State Department, in an unusually blunt statement, said Naseem ""had been lured to Pakistan from his home in Illinois by individuals who then used Pakistan’s blasphemy laws to entrap him."" 
It called on Pakistan to reform its blasphemy laws and prosecuting Naseem's killing.
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry says a special team is investigating the case and it ""will be dealt with in accordance with the law.""
But prosecuting Khan and any potential accomplices will be an immense challenge. 
In blasphemy cases in Pakistan, ""an accusation becomes a death sentence, whether carried out by the state or by mobs or vigilantes,"" Omar Waraich, head of South Asia for Amnesty International, told Reuters.
The rights group said in a 2016 report, ""Pakistan’s blasphemy laws are often used against religious minorities and others who are the target of false accusations, while emboldening vigilantes prepared to threaten or kill the accused.""
In 2011, the governor of Punjab, Pakistan's largest province, was killed by his own police guard for offering support to a Christian woman facing blasphemy charges. His killer was tried and awarded the death penalty, but not before thousands rallied for his release and rioted after he was executed. 
            
SELF-STYLED 'PROPHET'
Naseem was born in a village outside Peshawar but had long lived in the United States, according to clerics and locals who knew him. 
He often visited his village, where he expressed views that ""upset locals,"" said Wajid Ali, a cleric who runs a seminary there.
Naseem's statements landed him in prison several times, said Ali and another local who knew him Naseem. In those cases, they said, the intervention of locals, who believed Naseem was mentally unstable, got him released. 
""On the internet, he kept saying things like, 'I'm a messiah, or a prophet,' and that caused great trouble in our village,"" Ali said.
Naseem set up a website proclaiming himself a messiah, with a link for people to pledge allegiance to him. On LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), he described himself as ""Jesus's second coming, reviver, Prophet."" 
His distance from Pakistan kept him safe, even as he reached out to its Islamic seminary students to preach his messianic call. 
In 2018 one of those students convinced Naseem to travel to Pakistan, where they met at a Peshawar shopping mall, according to court documents seen by Reuters.
""He came thinking this student will believe him and others will join his call,"" Ali said. ""But the student had already told the police. They were standing nearby in plainclothes and they arrested him."" 
Naseem was charged with denigrating the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad. Two years later, awaiting his bail hearing surrounded by police and lawyers, he was gunned down.

PetroTal announced it had halted operations at its production field in the Loreto region of northeast Peru, where it usually extracts about 12,000 barrels of crude daily.
The clash between local tribesmen and police occurred in the early hours of Sunday near the oil field after about 70 residents equipped with spears arrived at the scene demanding a stop to production at Lot 95, the minister said.
""We regret the events that occurred. The initial figure we have is that there are three dead residents, in addition to 11 injured. On the police side we have six injured,"" Montoya told local television station Canal N.
PetroTal said in a statement that ""the attempted takeover"" of its facilities was carried out by the same group of residents that recently invaded a station of the state-owned Petroperu pipeline, which had to stop pumping.
Representatives of the protesters were not immediately available to comment on the events.
Local indigenous rights organization ORPIO said in a statement that natives of the area demand assistance from oil companies amid an outbreak of coronavirus infections in their Amazon communities.

The group was attacked in a giraffe reserve just 65 km (40 miles) from the West African country's capital Niamey, the governor of Tillaberi region, Tidjani Ibrahim Katiella, told Reuters. ""They were intercepted and killed,"" he said.
The six worked for an international aid group, Niger's Defence Minister Issoufou Katambé told Reuters. Officials had earlier described them as tourists.
Separately, a spokesman for French humanitarian aid group ACTED said its staff members were involved.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the assault. But France and other countries have warned people against travelling to parts of Niger where militants including Boko Haram and an affiliate of Islamic State operate.
French President Emmanuel Macron's office confirmed that French nationals had been killed in Niger. It said Macron spoke on the phone with Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou, but provided no further details.
The Association of Koure Giraffe Reserve Guides issued a statement describing the attackers as a ""unit of terrorists"" and saying the dead included its president, Kadri Abdou.
France's TF1 television channel broadcast images that it said were taken from the scene showing the burnt-out remains of a 4x4 vehicle with bullet holes in the side.
The reserve southeast of the capital is a popular attraction in Niger, a huge country that borders seven states in an unstable region including Libya, Mali, Chad, Algeria and Nigeria.
Militants linked to Islamic State killed four U.S. soldiers in an ambush in Niger near the border with Mali in Oct. 2017, an attack that increased scrutiny of U.S. counter-terrorism operations there.
France, a former colonial power in the region, also launched a coalition of West African and European allies in June to fight Islamist militants in the Sahel region that includes Niger.

It has deployed thousands of troops in the arid region south of the Sahara desert since 2013. But militant violence has been on the rise.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Before he went missing on Aug. 4, Ghassan Hasrouty, an employee of Beirut's giant grain silos for 38 years, thought he was working in the safest place in the city.
The reinforced concrete walls and underground rooms were his shelter for many days during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. 
He used to tell his family that he was more worried for them than himself when he set out to work each morning.
At 1730 on Tuesday, Hasrouty called his wife, Ibtissam, saying he would be sleeping at the silos that night because a shipment of grains was arriving and he could not leave.
He told her to send him a blanket and pillow.
She has not heard from him since.
Tuesday's explosion in the port of Beirut, the biggest ever to hit the city, destroyed the silos, killed at least 158 people and injured more than 6,000. It left an estimated 300,000 Lebanese effectively homeless as shockwaves ripped miles inland.
The health ministry on Saturday said 21 people were still missing. 
Officials have said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a substance used in manufacturing fertilizers and bombs, which had been stored for six years in a nearby warehouse without adequate safety measures.
The government has promised to hold those responsible to account, but residents are seething with anger.
Hasrouty's family believe that he and six of his colleagues are somewhere under the silos and they are holding out hope that they are alive.
They say the rescue response has been too slow and disorganised and that whatever chance there was for finding them alive is being lost. 
The family says that despite giving the authorities the exact location of where he was believed to have been at the time of the explosion, the rescue effort did not start until 40 hours later.
At their home in Beirut, the family has gathered every day, anxiously awaiting information.
""These people who are missing are not just numbers,"" says Elie, 35, Hasrouty's son.
""We need to highlight the mediocrity of management of this disaster, of this situation, how bad it is managed... not to repeat such a horrible disaster and horrible management.""
Hasrouty, whose own father worked at the same silos for 40 years, was dedicated to his job, his family says.
His daughter Tatiana, 19, flits between resignation and hope.

""We did not even get a chance to say goodbye,"" she says. ""But we are still waiting for them... to all come back.""

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Curtains flutter through broken windows, piles of debris block the streets and top-floor apartments with their roofs blown off are exposed to the sky.
As the residents of Beirut try to pick up their lives after an explosion that shook the country to its core, they are doing so with their surroundings utterly transformed.
They have tales of terror, loss - and lucky escapes.
Elsa Saade was at work in a pharmacy in the famous night life district of Mar Mikhael at the moment of the blast, which was caused by explosives stored at the port a few hundred metres away. 
""At first we heard a deep sound then a roar, as if it were a tsunami for a few seconds ... It was like an earthquake that would destroy the whole universe. Truly the end of the world.
""There were two people inside (the pharmacy) at the time and the ceiling caved in, the medicine and the countertops fell on top of us but we weren't hurt, thank God. It was like divine protection.""
Tuesday's blast, the biggest ever to hit Beirut, injured more than 6,000 people and left an estimated 300,000 Lebanese effectively homeless as shockwaves ripped miles inland.
Joseph al-Jebeily, 60, says he lost consciousness after he was flung back from his sixth-floor balcony. When he came to, he shouted desperately for his wife, only to find she had fallen to a neighbour's balcony two floors below. 
""She was badly injured, but her condition is stable and she's still alive,"" he said. ""It's a miracle, really.""
Most homes in this officially designated ""disaster city"", with its memories of civil war, no longer have windows. The cracks and scars will last for years.
A walk through Beirut's central neighbourhoods revealed mangled buildings and heaps of debris sometimes piled so high that they blocked the narrow streets, hampering cleanup operations.
Some areas are virtually unrecognizable. Streets are littered with books, medicines, clothes, furniture and the remains of antique tiled ceilings.
'I CRIED OVER MY CAT'
Volunteers equipped with shovels help as best they can as people pick through the rubble, trying to salvage belongings from the remains of their shops and homes.
Those in the historic district of Gemmayze, which received a visit from French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday, have their own harrowing tales. 
""I lost my house and my store and I was injured, but I cried over my cat which died between the glass and steel,"" said Laura, who owns a vintage clothing store.
""It's sad that people died in their homes, the place where they're meant to feel safe.""
Following Macron's visit, Lebanese celebrities and public figures flocked to Gemmayze to support the cleanup efforts taking place under the watchful eye of Rose, a 90-year-old resident who has become a local symbol of resilience.
Sitting on a white plastic chair on a veranda at risk of collapsing, Rose is adamant about not leaving her home and uttered what some residents and media consider a slogan for the ravished neighbourhood: ""Can you believe this?"" 
Officials have said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, a substance used in manufacturing fertilizers and bombs, which had been stored for six years in a port warehouse without adequate safety measures. 
The government has promised to hold those responsible to account, but residents are seething with anger. 
""We lived through all of the periods of civil war and other conflicts between parties, and the Israeli war, and never did we reach this level of catastrophe,"" said Nasib al-Dana, as he worked to clean up what was left of his small store in Mar Mikhael. 

""Every time we used to flee to one area from the other, or from one district in Beirut to the other. But this time, it's over. We've reached a dead end. The sea is in front of us and the destruction is behind us.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. (Reuters) - At least three shooters opened fire during a large, unauthorized gathering of people in Washington early on Sunday, killing a teenager and wounding 20 others, including a critically injured police officer, authorities said.
The gunfire broke out during a gathering of hundreds of people in a southeast district of the nation's capital, D.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a press conference.
Local media called the event an ""unsanctioned block party"" in a residential neighborhood. Bowser said it violated the city's coronavirus-induced ban on large public meetings of more than 50 people.
""There were certainly was too many people out there, you know, with the COVID-19,"" Newsham said.
""We can't tolerate these types of gatherings in our city during COVID-19. It's just too dangerous,"" he added.
Newsham said at least three shooters opened fire when a dispute broke out at about 12:20 a.m. EDT (0420 GMT), striking 21 people, including an off-duty police officer.
""She is struggling for her life right now at a local hospital,"" Newsham said, saying the officer was among at least 11 women hurt. 
Killed was Christopher Brown, 17, who was pronounced dead at a local hospital, Newsham added.
""I really don't understand how my child's life is just gone,"" his mother Artecka Brown told Reuters.
Most of the victims were adults and, aside from the police officer, none of the injuries were considered life-threatening, Newsham said.
Bowser, wearing a face mask like Newsham, noted that people cooped up at home, as advised by medical experts to stop disease spread during the coronavirus pandemic, were starting to break rules, like those limiting the size of gatherings to allow for social distancing.
""There are cookouts that have happened peacefully for years and years that are just spinning out of control,"" Bowser said. 
""Sadly, several people who have no regard for human life opened fire at what had been people gathered together, enjoying themselves,"" she said.
Newsham said police had tried to break up the gathering but apparently lacked the manpower to do so. ""It doesn't sound like we had enough officers to disperse the crowd,"" he said.
No details were immediately available on the suspected shooters. Multiple weapons, including handguns, were confiscated from the scene, Newsham said.

ABOARD ECUADOREAN NAVY AIRCRAFT (Reuters) - Ecuador's navy is conducting surveillance of a massive Chinese fishing fleet that is operating near the protected waters of the Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG) Islands, amid concerns about the environmental impact of fishing in the area of the ecologically sensitive islands.
The navy conducted a patrol mission on Friday that included a flyover of the region where the hulking vessels are fishing, as well as reconnaissance by military patrol ships. A total of 340 vessels are currently in the area, the navy said, compared with some 260 reported last month.
Images taken as part of the flyover, which included journalists, showed that at least one of the vessels appeared to be ageing and in need of maintenance.
Ecuador's Navy Commander, Rear Admiral Darwin Jarrin, said the navy has approached Colombia and Peru to share information and seek a regional response to the vessels, most of which can hold up to 1,000 tonnes of catch.
The fleet generally spends several weeks fishing off the coast of Peru before approaching the Galapagos.
The fishing fleet has since 2017 been arriving in the summer months and fishing just outside the Galapagos territorial waters, drawn by marine species such as the endangered hammerhead shark.
Such fishing is not illegal because it takes place in international waters. But environmental activists say it allows fleets to take advantage of the abundant marine species that spill over from the Galapagos and cross into the unprotected waters. 
""This is not something that will change overnight,"" said Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Luis Gallegos in a television interview on Sunday. ""It is necessary to ... generate bilateral agreements with other countries with regards to illegal fishing, to monitor every ship that's in the South Pacific.""
A Chinese vessel in 2017 was captured in the Galapagos Marine Reserve carrying 300 tons of marine wildlife.
China has promised a ""zero tolerance"" approach to illegal fishing and has proposed a moratorium on fishing in the area between September and November. The fishing fleets usually leave the area before that period.

The Galapagos Islands, which lie some 1,000 km (620 miles) from Ecuador's coast, are home to many unique species, including giant tortoises, and served as inspiration for 19th century British scientist Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.

O'Brien's comments appeared to go beyond a statement released on Friday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence which said China ""has been expanding its influence efforts,"" and that Russia was already trying to undercut Democratic candidate Joe Biden. But did not specifically accuse Beijing of hacking attempts against U.S. election-related systems.
""They'd like to see the President lose,"" O'Brien said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""China - like Russia, like Iran - they've engaged in cyberattacks and phishing and that sort of thing with respect to our election infrastructure, with respect to websites and that sort of thing."" 
China has consistently denied U.S. government claims that it hacks U.S. companies, politicians or government agencies. ""The U.S. presidential election is an internal affair, we have no interest in interfering in it,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in April.
O'Brien said the United States had seen hackers try to infiltrate websites belonging to Secretary of State offices around the country, which are responsible for administering elections at the local level, and collecting data on Americans. 
""It is a real concern and it's not just Russia,"" he said. ""There will be severe consequences for any country that attempts to interfere in our free and fair elections."" 
The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ODNI declined to comment or clarify whether O'Brien's comments contradicted their own. 
The ODNI previously said that ""adversaries"" seek to compromise the private communications of American political candidates and penetrate U.S. election systems ahead of November's election. And that China would prefer President Donald Trump does not win reelection. 

Multiple reviews by U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia acted to boost Trump's 2016 campaign and undercut his rival Hillary Clinton's chances in that election.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese protesters hurled rocks at security forces blocking a road near parliament on Sunday in a second day of anti-government demonstrations after the devastating explosion in Beirut last Tuesday.
Riot police wearing body armour and carrying batons clashed with demonstrators in chaotic scenes in central Beirut.
Thousands of demonstrators were converging on Parliament Square and nearby Martyrs' Square, a Reuters correspondent said.
""We want the entire government to leave, we want elections now,"" demonstrator Yusef Dour said. 
The explosion in the port killed dozens of people, injured thousands and gutted swathes of the city. Protesters, already angry over the country's deep economic crisis, have called on the government to quit over what they say was negligence that led to the blast. 
""We want to destroy and kill the government. They gave us no jobs nor rights,"" said Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Ghrawi, a 19-year-old unemployed demonstrator. 
The country's top Christian Maronite cleric, Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, earlier said the cabinet should resign as it cannot ""change the way it governs"".
""The resignation of an MP or a minister is not enough ... the whole government should resign as it is unable to help the country recover,"" he said in his Sunday sermon.
Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad said she was resigning on Sunday, citing the explosion and the failure of the government to carry out reforms.
Anger boiled over into violent scenes in central Beirut on Saturday. Those protests were the biggest since October when thousands of people took to the streets to demand an end to corruption, bad governance and mismanagement.
About 10,000 people gathered at Martyrs' Square, which was transformed into a battle zone in the evening between police and protesters who tried to break down a barrier along a road leading to parliament. Some demonstrators stormed government ministries and the Association of Lebanese Banks. 
One policeman was killed and the Red Cross said more than 170 people were injured in clashes.
'CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT'
""The police fired at me. But that won't stop us from demonstrating until we change the government from top to bottom,"" Younis Flayti, 55, a retired army officer, said on Sunday.
Nearby, mechanic Sabir Jamali sat beside a noose attached to a wooden frame in Martyrs' Square, intended as a symbolic warning to Lebanese leaders to resign or face hanging.
""Every leader who oppresses us should be hanged,"" he said, adding he will protest again.
Tuesday's explosion, which killed 158 people and injured more than 6,000, compounded months of political and economic meltdown. 
The army said hope was fading of finding more survivors, Al Jadeed TV channel reported. The health ministry said on Saturday 21 people were missing.
""People should sleep in the streets and demonstrate against the government until it falls,"" said lawyer Maya Habli, as she surveyed the demolished port where the blast erupted.
The prime minister and presidency have said 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, which is used in making fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years without safety measures at the port warehouse. 
The government has said it will hold those responsible to account.
World powers agreed at an emergency donor conference on Sunday to provide ""major resources"" to help Beirut recover, pledging not to fail Lebanon's people.
The explosion hit a city reeling from economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. For many it was a dreadful reminder of the 1975-1990 civil war that tore the nation apart and destroyed swathes of Beirut, much of which has since been rebuilt.
""I worked in Kuwait for 15 years in sanitation to save money and build a gift shop in Lebanon and it was destroyed by the explosion,"" said Maroun Shehadi.

""Nothing will change until our leaders just leave.""

Taking advantage of calm sea conditions, hundreds of people including children and pregnant women have made the dangerous crossing in recent days in rubber dinghies and small vessels.
On Sunday, the UK's Border Force said it was dealing with ""ongoing small boat incidents"" off the coast of Kent in southern England, 33-km (21-mile) across the Channel from France.
Interior minister Priti Patel said the UK was working to make the Channel route ""unviable"" and named Dan O'Mahoney, a former Royal Marine, as Britain's Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, creating a new role to deal with the issue. 
He will ""urgently explore tougher action in France"", a statement from the interior ministry said on Sunday, referring to plans to intercept boats at sea and try to return them. 
The government asked Britain's armed forces to help deal with the boats carrying migrants on Saturday, when the interior ministry said 15 vessels were brought to the UK carrying 151 migrants.
UK and French officials are set to hold talks next week and Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper said France was set to ask Britain to pay 30 million pounds ($40 million) to bolster its policing of the maritime border in the Channel.
A French interior ministry spokesman neither confirmed nor denied the report. 
""There will be discussions this week to continue the strengthening of bilateral cooperation in the fight against illegal crossings of the English Channel,” the spokesman said.
O'Mahoney said he wanted to focus on ending the ""heinous crime"" of people smuggling across the Channel. He has previously worked as director of the UK's Joint Maritime Security Centre and held a senior position at the National Crime Agency.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan agreed on Sunday to release 400 ""hard-core"" Taliban prisoners, paving the way for peace talks aimed at ending almost two decades of war.
Under election-year pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump for a deal allowing him to bring home American troops, the war-torn country's grand assembly, or Loya Jirga, on Sunday approved the release, a controversial condition raised by the Taliban militants to join peace talks.
""In order to remove an obstacle, allow the start of the peace process and an end of bloodshed, the Loya Jirga approves the release of 400 Taliban,"" the assembly said in a resolution.
Minutes later, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced, ""Today, I will sign the release order of these 400 prisoners.""
Last week Ghani invited some 3,200 Afghan community leaders and politicians to Kabul amid tight security and concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, to advise the government on whether the prisoners should be freed. 
Among the 400 are Taliban members accused of major attacks against civilians and foreigners, including a 2017 truck bombing near the German embassy in Kabul that killed more than 150 - the deadliest attack in the 19-year insurgency. Taliban and official sources have told Reuters the group includes members of the militant Haqqani network, which has ties to the Taliban. 
With the release, the Afghan government will fulfil its pledge to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners.
Talks between the warring Taliban and government will start in Doha this week, Western diplomats said. Ghani appealed to the hardline Islamist group to pledge to a complete ceasefire ahead of talks.
The Taliban have not commented on the decision to release the remaining prisoners.
Deliberation over the release of last batch of Taliban prisoners, accused of conducting some of the bloodiest attacks across Afghanistan, had triggered outrage among civilians and rights groups who questioned the morality of the peace process.
It has also proved wrenching for the families of the more than 100,000 Afghan civilians thought to have been killed or injured in the past decade, more than 10,000 last year alone. The Loya Jirga had urged the government to seek forgiveness from the families for their killers, important under many interpretations of Islamic law.
Sunday's decision caps more than five months of fitful talks after Washington and the Taliban agreed on the release of the Taliban prisoners as a condition for the talks with Kabul. 
U.S. officials had encouraged the Loya Jirga in recent days to support the release of the prisoners despite the drawbacks in order to get the peace process moving. 
Neighbouring Pakistan, seen as key to helping pave the way to talks, welcomed Sunday's decision.
""We hope that with implementation of this step relating to the prisoners’ release, as envisaged in the U.S.-Taliban Peace Agreement, the Intra-Afghan Negotiations will commence at the earliest,"" Pakistan's foreign office said in a statement.
Ahead of the Loya Jirga, Human Rights Watch cautioned that many of the prisoners had been jailed under ""overly broad terrorism laws that provide for indefinite preventive detention"".
With November elections looming, Trump, behind in the polls, is eager to fulfil a major campaign promise to end America's longest war.

The drawdown will bring the number of U.S. troops to ""a number less than 5,000"" by the end of November, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in an interview broadcast on Saturday, down from current levels of around 8,600.

1085,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2020 08:56AM ET</span>",Belarus holds election as street protests rattle long-ruling president,"By Andrei Makhovsky
MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus voted in an election on Sunday pitting President Alexander Lukashenko against a former teacher who emerged from obscurity to lead the biggest challenge in years against the man who has ruled the country for a quarter of century.
The 65-year-old Lukashenko is almost certain to win a sixth consecutive term but could face a new wave of protests amid anger over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy and his human rights record. 
A crackdown on the opposition could hurt Lukashenko's attempts to mend fences with the West amid fraying ties with traditional ally Russia, which has tried to press Belarus into closer economic and political union.
A former Soviet collective farm manager, Lukashenko has ruled since 1994.
He faces a surprise rival in Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, a former English teacher who entered the race after her husband, an anti-government blogger who intended to run, was jailed.
Her rallies have drawn some of the biggest crowds since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and on Sunday she arrived at a polling station with hundreds of supporters chanting her name.
She expressed hope for a free election. 
Human rights groups say more than 1,300 people have been detained in the crackdown, including independent election observers and members of Tikhanouskaya's campaign team.
After casting his vote, Lukashenko denied imposing repressive measures as ""fake news or far-fetched accusations"" and said he did not regard Tikhanouskaya's camp as a threat. 
""They are not worth enough to carry out any repression against them,"" he said. 
'POWER AT ANY COST'
Foreign observers have not judged an election to be free and fair in Belarus for a quarter of a century and Lukashenko has warned protesters against taking to the streets after the vote.
In possible anticipation of unrest, local media reported squares being blocked off by the authorities in Minsk and the presence of some soldiers on the capital's outskirts.
Social media networks experienced disruption. 
Queues also formed outside the Belarusian embassies in Moscow and Kyiv for voters casting their ballot abroad. 
""It is unbearable to have him in power for so many years. The man should understand himself that he must just leave,"" said Yuri Kanifatov in Moscow, who voted against Lukashenko.
Portraying himself as a guarantor of stability but criticised by the West as dictatorial, Lukashenko says the opposition protesters are in cahoots with foreign backers to destabilise the country. 
""Lukashenko a priori made it clear that he intends to retain his power at any cost. The question remains what the price will be,"" said political analyst Alexander Klaskovsky.
Wedded to a Soviet-style economic model, Lukashenko has struggled to raise incomes and living standards in recent years. He also faced anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which he dismissed as a ""psychosis"" while suggesting drinking vodka and playing ice hockey as remedies. 

Ignoring jibes about a woman's fitness to run for office, Tikhanouskaya launched her campaign with the support of the wives of two other candidates, Viktor Babariko, who was jailed, and Valery Tsepkalo, who had fled abroad fearing arrest.

On Saturday, more than 1,000 protested in Bangkok after a human rights lawyer Anon Nampa and student activist Panupong Jadnok were arrested and held overnight. They were later released on bail.
Demonstrations have returned to Thailand's streets, calling for the removal of the government of 2014 coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha after a disputed election last year. 
The Student Union of Thailand in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post said that three student activists were being held at a police station to prevent them from joining activities in the northern province of Phitsanulok. The authorities denied this.
""There is nothing here, who can hold them? On what authority can we hold them?"" Wisarnpong Soikunbodi, director of Border Patrol Police Sub Division 31, which oversees the station, told Reuters.
In the northern province of Chiang Mai, where Anon is due to speak on Sunday, some 50 police were observing the protest, legal group, Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said in a Tweet. 

Students said they plan more protests in Bangkok on Monday.

KABUL/GERDAW VILLAGE, Afghanistan - At the age of 17, Mohammed Jafar married three women, widows of his three brothers killed in a suicide bombing in 2016 in Afghanistan's eastern Kunar province, as he decided to make peace with the diktats of local Pasthun tribal elders.
On Sunday, Jafar said he made peace for a second time after he heard about the government's decision to release 400 Taliban prisoners accused of conducting some of bloodiest attacks on civilians, including the deaths of his brothers.
""This idea to forgive and forget war criminals is very depressing for me,"" Jafar told Reuters after the decision by the Loya Jirga, a grand assembly of more than 3,200 Afghan community leaders and politicians, to approve the release of Taliban fighters. It was a step toward peace talks with the Islamist group aimed at ending two decades of war.
Jafar's decision to marry his brothers' wives and care for a combined 10 children on his monthly income of $300 - and similar decisions by families of some of the more than 100,000 Afghan civilians thought to have been killed or injured in the last decade - was key to Kabul's controversial decision to release the prisoners and seek peace.
Although the Loya Jirga resolution did not mention forgiveness, the council had suggested on its opening day, Friday, that the government reach out to those affected by Taliban violence, take them into confidence and get their approval for the release of the insurgents. In many interpretations of Islamic sharia law, only the family of victims can forgive killers.
The government and Taliban were under pressure from the administration of President Donald Trump, who is keen for progress toward peace so he can bring more U.S. soldiers home before the November U.S. presidential election, where he is trailing in the polls.
Jafar and others asked to forgive the killers of their loved ones were under a different kind of pressure.
Eight survivors of some of the most brutal Taliban attacks told Reuters they feared clashes would intensify if Taliban prisoners were not released.
""Honest, simple Afghans are still expected to pay a price for peace. We have been told to forgive Taliban,"" Jafar said, adding that civilians are expected to pretend nothing ever happened in order to get on with their lives.
Seven of Jafar's children belonged to his deceased brothers in Gerdaw, 280 km (170 miles) east of the capital Kabul and near the border with Pakistan. The remote mountain village is the only place where he feels secure as clashes between the government and Taliban drag on across the war-torn country.
In 2016 a suicide bomber killed a local militia commander and at least 12 civilians, including Jafar's brothers.
The Taliban did not take responsibility for the blast. Afghan and Western security officials say the militants often use denial as a tactic when civilian casualties are high. 
More than 10,000 civilians were killed last year alone, according to a United Nations report. Taliban leaders say their mujahideen fighters, in what they call a jihad or holy war, have never intentionally harmed civilians.
""The Afghan and foreign forces have also accidentally killed many civilians. They should apologise too,"" said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.
Rights groups say the process should be driven by considerations other than the U.S. election cycle.
""The priorities should be the rights of victims for justice, and due process rights of those in detention,"" said the Human Rights Watch in a statement. 
Back in Gerdaw, Jafar indicated his forgiveness was still conditional on progress toward an end to the violence that upended his family's lives.

""If peace comes to this country, then here I am, forgiving those who killed my brothers,"" he said.

The secretariat of the GCC, made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, said in a statement on Sunday that Iran's continued interference in neighbouring countries made an extension necessary. 
The arms embargo on Iran is currently set to end on Oct. 18 under Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which Washington quit in 2018.
The request, in a letter to the United Nations, is a show of unity from the GCC. In mid-2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed political, trade and transport ties with Qatar over accusations it had been supporting terrorism and cosying up to Iran. Qatar denies the accusations. 
""It is inappropriate to lift restrictions on the supply of weapons from and to Iran until Iran gives up its destabilising activities in the region and stops supplying terrorist and sectarian organisations with weapons,"" a statement from GCC Secretary General Nayef Falah Mubarak al-Hajraf said. 
If the United States is unsuccessful in extending the embargo, it has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran under a process agreed in the 2015 deal. 
The U.S.-drafted resolution needs at least nine votes in favour to force Russia and China to use their vetoes, which Moscow and Beijing have signalled they will do. Some diplomats question whether Washington can even secure those nine, however.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian investigators on Sunday began examining the black box of a Boeing-737 that overshot a runway on its second attempt, killing 18 people in the country's worst aviation accident in a decade.
The Air India Express plane, which was repatriating Indians stranded in Dubai due to the coronavirus pandemic, overshot the runway of the Calicut International Airport in heavy rain near the southern city of Kozhikode on Friday.
The aircraft fell into a valley and broke in half.
In an interview with Reuters partner ANI on Sunday, Arun Kumar, head of India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation, said the country would open the recovered transcripts to international investigators, as well as manufacturer Boeing (N:BA).
""Only after conducting a thorough and unbiased probe, can we tell what exactly happened,"" Kumar said. 
The 2,700 metre runway at the airport is known as a ""table-top"", an aviation term for runways with steep drops at one or both ends.
They leave little room for error should a pilot overshoot the runway, either through human error or mechanical failure.
Late on Saturday, Kumar told CNN-News18 in an interview that the pilot made an aborted landing attempt into a headwind and then made a second approach with a tail wind, landing 1,000 metres down the runway. 
An air traffic control official familiar with the crash confirmed this version of events, adding it is unusual to attempt a landing at the airport with a tailwind, which is typically used for takeoffs. 
""The length of the runway in Calicut is around 2,700 metres and the plane touched the ground after crossing 1,000 metres of the length, leaving less room to bring the aircraft to a halt,"" the official, who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media, told Reuters. 
""It was windy and rainy and the runway surface was wet. In such instances the weather is dynamic."" 
""An aircraft typically lands and departs in a headwind as a tailwind increases the plane's speed.""
A spokesman for Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has already said it will pay compensation to the families of the deceased.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared an emergency and imposed a lockdown on the small border town last month after a person, who defected to South Korea in 2017, returned to Kaesong across the highly fortified border showing coronavirus symptoms.
Pyongyang has not confirmed any coronavirus infections but has been taking strict quarantine measures and screening the town, while providing food, test kits and other medical equipment, according to state media. 
State television on Sunday showed a train arriving at the Kaesong station and trucks delivering supplies to residents. 
Separately, hundreds of people wearing masks and sitting apart from one another gathered at a party auditorium to thank authorities for the aid, with some breaking down in tears, footage showed. 
The official KCNA news agency said the shipments arrived on Friday to help the residents cope with the lockdown, which ""may lead to a deadly and destructive disaster."" 
North Korea has not formally confirmed that the man in question tested positive for the virus. Seoul officials have said the 24-year-old returned to the North after facing a sexual assault investigation in the South.
South Korean health officials said there was no sign he was infected before he crossed the border, and at least two people who were in close contact with him have tested negative.

India has accelerated military purchases in the wake of a June border clash between Indian and Chinese troops, with the government approving the purchase of 33 Russian fighter jets and upgrades to 59 other planes in July.
Tensions between India and China are at their highest in years following the clash in a disputed stretch of border in the western Himalayas in which India lost 20 soldiers.
Military experts say India is short of combat planes, helicopters and field guns because of years of low funding. 
""The embargo on imports is planned to be progressively implemented between 2020 to 2024,"" Singh wrote in a series of tweets.
""Our aim is to apprise the Indian defence industry about the anticipated requirements of the Armed Forces so that they are better prepared to realise the goal of indigenisation.""
India traditionally buys military equipment from Russia, but is increasingly purchasing from the United States and Israel. Modi has repeatedly called for cutting the military's dependence of expensive imports.
Between April 2015 and August 2020, the Indian defence services had contracted around 3.5 trillion rupees worth of items that are now on the hold list.
The government estimates around 4 trillion rupees worth of orders will now be placed with the domestic industry over the next five to seven years. 
The list of embargoed items includes high technology weapon systems, artillery guns, sonar systems, transport aircrafts, light combat helicopters (LCHs), Singh said.
The defence ministry has also split the capital procurement budget for 2020/21 between domestic and foreign procurement routes, he added.
""A separate budget head has been created with an outlay of nearly 520 billion rupees for domestic capital procurement in the current financial year.""

Washington broke off official ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing. The Trump administration has made strengthening its support for the democratic island a priority, and boosted arms sales.
Beijing, already arguing with Washington over everything from human rights and trade to the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, has threatened unspecified countermeasures to Azar's visit. China considers Taiwan a wayward province, to be brought under its control by force if needed.
Azar arrived at Taipei's downtown Songshan airport on a U.S. government aircraft late in the afternoon, and was met by Brent Christensen, the de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan, and by Taiwan Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang.
In accordance with COVID-19 rules, there were no handshakes and all officials wore masks, including Azar, as seen in images broadcast live on Taiwanese television.
Azar is coming to strengthen economic and public-health cooperation with Taiwan and support Taiwan's international role in fighting the pandemic. 
On Monday he will sign a health cooperation memorandum of understanding with Taiwan's government and visit Taiwan's Centres for Disease Control. 
He is also scheduled to meet President Tsai Ing-wen during his visit.
Azar and his team had to be tested for the coronavirus before and upon arrival. They will have to wear face masks throughout their visit and practice social distancing.
Taiwan's early and effective steps to fight the disease have kept its case numbers far lower than those of its neighbours, with 480 infections, including seven deaths. Most cases have been imported.

The United States has had more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country, and the wearing of masks has become a heated political issue, with some people objecting to what they see as an infringement of personal freedom.

1095,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",UK PM says schools must open in September,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said reopening schools in September was a social, economic and moral imperative and insisted they would be able to operate safely despite the ongoing threat from the pandemic.
His comments follow a study earlier this month which warned that Britain risks a second wave of COVID-19 this winter twice as large as the initial outbreak if schools open without an improved test-and-trace system.
Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Johnson said restarting schools was a national priority. Schools would be the last places to close in future local lockdowns, he was quoted by another newspaper as telling a meeting on Thursday.
Schools in England closed in March during a national lockdown, except for the children of key workers, and reopened in June for a small number of pupils. 
The government wants all pupils to return to school by early September in what Johnson has called a ""national priority"".
""Keeping our schools closed a moment longer than absolutely necessary is socially intolerable, economically unsustainable and morally indefensible,"" Johnson wrote.
The economic costs for parents who cannot work if schools are shut are spiralling, and the country faces big problems if children miss out on education, the prime minister warned.
""This pandemic isn’t over, and the last thing any of us can afford to do is become complacent. But now that we know enough to reopen schools to all pupils safely, we have a moral duty to do so,"" he wrote. 

The Sunday Times newspaper reported that he has ordered a public relations campaign to ensure schools open on time and told the meeting last week that they should be the last places to close behind restaurants, pubs and shops.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Nearly two-thirds of Spaniards believe former King Juan Carlos, who left the country this week amid a financial scandal, should not have gone abroad, according to an opinion poll published on Sunday. 
Juan Carlos, who abdicated in 2014 in favour of his son Felipe, abruptly announced his decision to leave on Monday but there has been no official confirmation of where he went, setting off an international guessing game.
The poll by SigmaDos for the conservative newspaper El Mundo found 63.3% of those questioned felt it was a bad idea for the 82-year-old ex-monarch to have left, while 27.2% agreed with his departure.
Some 80.3% said they thought Juan Carlos should face any potential legal proceedings. The poll, carried out between Aug. 4-6 after he left, found 12.4% said he had nothing to answer for and 7.3% did not voice an opinion. 
In June, Spain's Supreme Court opened a preliminary investigation into Juan Carlos' involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia, after Switzerland's La Tribune de Geneve newspaper reported he had received $100 million from the late Saudi king. Switzerland has also opened an investigation.
The former monarch is not formally under investigation and has repeatedly declined to comment on the allegations.
Juan Carlos's lawyer said on Monday his client was at the Spanish prosecutor's disposal despite his decision to leave.
ROLE IN TRANSITION
Despite the disapproval, reflecting Juan Carlos' sinking popularity in recent years, some 69.2% of those questioned in Sunday's poll said he played an important role in the transition from dictatorship to democracy after the death of Francisco Franco in 1975, while 24.4% said he played ""little or no"" role.
The pro-monarchist newspaper ABC reported on Friday that Juan Carlos had travelled by private plane from Spain to the United Arab Emirates on Monday. 
Other media have said he is in the Dominican Republic or in Portugal. Officials there have said they have no knowledge of him arriving.
A Spanish government spokeswoman declined on Sunday to comment on his whereabouts. His lawyer and the royal palace have all this week declined to say where Juan Carlos is.
News website Niusdiario.es posted a photograph https://www.niusdiario.es/nacional/casa-real/exclusiva-nius-foto-llegada-rey-emerito-juan-carlos-aeropuerto-abu-dabi-emiratos-arabes-unidos_18_2990670271.html on Saturday that it said showed him walking down the steps of a plane at an airport in Abu Dhabi. If confirmed, it would be the first image published of the ex-king since his departure. 
The blurred shot appears to show Juan Carlos wearing a white face mask and talking to an official, but there were no signs or other details in the frame to confirm the location or date. Niusdiario.es gave no details on who took the picture.

United Arab Emirates officials and the Emirates Palace Hotel did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday.

Lebanon was already mired in deep political and economic crisis when the blast ripped through its main port on Tuesday, killing 158 people, injuring more than 6,000 and destroying a swathe of the city.
Rebuilding Beirut could run into the billions of dollars. Economists forecast the blast could wipe up to 25% off of the country's GDP. 
Many Lebanese are angry at the government's response and say the disaster highlighted the negligence of a corrupt political elite. Protesters stormed government ministries in Beirut and trashed the offices of the Association of Lebanese Banks on Saturday.
Macron visited Beirut on Thursday, the first world leader to do so after the explosion, and promised the Lebanese people humanitarian aid would come but that profound political reform was needed to resolve the country's problems and secure longer term support.
""I guarantee you, this (reconstruction) aid will not go to corrupt hands,"" Macron told the throngs who greeted him.
There has been an outpouring of sympathy for Lebanon from around the world this week and many countries have sent immediate humanitarian support such as a medical supplies, but there has been an absence of aid commitments so far.
Trump will participate in the video-link conference.
""Everyone wants to help!"" he tweeted.
Germany will commit an additional 10 million euros ($11.79 million) in emergency aid on top of the rescue contributions already underway, its foreign minister said.
A Macron aide declined on Saturday to set a target for the conference. Emergency aid was needed for reconstruction, food aid, medical equipment and schools and hospitals, the official said.
Representatives of Britain, the European Union, China, Russia, Egypt and Jordan are expected to join the conference, hosted by Macron from his summer retreat on the French Riviera. Israel and Iran will not take part, the Elysee Palace official said.

The shrine, dedicated to Japanese who have died during past wars including World War Two, is seen as a potent symbol of the controversy that persists over the conflict's legacy in East Asia.
""He will make a ritual offering to the shrine out of his personal expenses as the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, as he has done in previous years,"" sources close to the matter said, according to the report.
Since 1978, the shrine has also honoured leaders convicted as ""Class A"" war criminals at an allied tribunal in 1948, making it deeply controversial at home and abroad.

Abe's last visit to the shrine, shortly after he took office in December 2013, caused outrage in China and South Korea, who see the visits as a sign that Japan has not repented for its militarist past and war atrocities.

Maria Kolesnikova was detained in what police said was a case of mistaken identity, the campaign team said in a statement. Police declined to comment immediately. 
Lukashenko, who has ruled the country for over a quarter of a century, has cracked down to try to snuff out rare and sustained protests against him ahead of Sunday's presidential vote, jailing rivals and arresting dissenters.
He faces his biggest challenge in years due to frustration over his hands-off handling of the coronavirus pandemic and grievances over the economy and human rights.
Kolesnikova was originally a member of the campaign team for Viktor Babariko, the former head of a local bank who was detained after he launched his presidential bid. 

After Babariko's arrest, Kolesnikova became the joint face of the opposition campaign backing Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, a former English teacher who entered the race after her husband, an anti-government blogger who intended to run, was jailed.

""Never, under any circumstances, it's acceptable to meddle in another country's sovereign elections,"" Zelenskiy wrote.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese protesters stormed government ministries in Beirut and trashed the offices of the Association of Lebanese Banks on Saturday as shots rang out in increasingly angry demonstrations over this week's devastating explosion.
The protesters said their politicians should resign and be punished for negligence they say led to Tuesday’s blast, the biggest ever to hit Beirut, that killed 158 people and injured more than 6,000, compounding months of political and economic meltdown.
A policeman was killed during the clashes, a spokesman said. A policeman at the scene said the officer died when he fell into an elevator shaft in a nearby building after being chased by protesters.
The Red Cross said it had treated 117 people for injuries on the scene while another 55 were taken to hospital. Policemen wounded by stones were treated by ambulance workers. A fire broke out in central Martyrs' Square. 
Dozens of protesters broke into the foreign ministry where they burnt a portrait of President Michel Aoun, representative for many of a political class that has ruled Lebanon for decades and that they say is to blame for its current mess.
""We are staying here. We call on the Lebanese people to occupy all the ministries,"" a demonstrator said by megaphone.
About 10,000 people gathered in Martyrs' Square, some throwing stones. Police fired tear gas when some protesters tried to break through the barrier blocking a street leading to parliament, a Reuters journalist said.
Police confirmed shots and rubber bullets had been fired. It was not immediately clear who fired the shots. Riot police shot dozens of teargas canisters at protesters, who hit back with firecrackers and stones.
TV footage showed protesters also breaking into the energy and economy ministries.
They chanted ""the people want the fall of the regime"", reprising a popular chant from the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. They held posters saying ""Leave, you are all killers"".
The U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the U.S. government supported the demonstrators' right to peaceful protest and urged all involved to refrain from violence.
The embassy also said in a tweet that the Lebanese people ""deserved leaders who listen to them and change course to respond to popular demands for transparency and accountability"".
Prime Minister Hassan Diab said the only way out was early parliamentary elections.
'GO HOME!'
The protests were the biggest since October when thousands of people took to the streets in protest against corruption, bad governance and mismanagement.
“You have no conscience, you have no morality. Go home! Leave! Resign, Enough is enough,” shouted one of the protesters. “What else do you want? You brought us poverty, death and destruction,” said another.
Soldiers in vehicles mounted with machine guns patrolled the area. Ambulances rushed to the scene. 
""Really the army is here? Are you here to shoot us? Join us and we can fight the government together,"" a woman yelled.
Tuesday's blast was the biggest in Beirut's history. Twenty-one people were still reported as missing from the explosion, which gutted entire neighbourhoods.
The government has promised to hold those responsible to account. But few Lebanese are convinced. Some set up nooses on wooden frames as a symbolic warning to Lebanese leaders.
""Resign or hang,"" said one banner at the demonstration.
The prime minister and presidency have said 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, which is used in making fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years without safety measures at the port warehouse.
ECONOMIC MELTDOWN
The explosion hit a city still scarred by civil war and reeling from an economic meltdown and a surge in coronavirus infections. 
For many, it was a dreadful reminder of the 1975-1990 civil war that tore the nation apart and destroyed swathes of Beirut, much of which had since been rebuilt.
Some residents, struggling to clean up shattered homes, complain the government has let them down again.
""We have no trust in our government,"" said university student Celine Dibo as she scrubbed blood off the walls of her shattered apartment building. ""I wish the United Nations would take over Lebanon."" 
Many people denounced their leaders, saying none of them visited the site of the blast to comfort them or assess the damage while French President Emmanuel Macron flew from Paris and went straight to the scene to pay his tribute.
Macron, who visited Beirut on Thursday, promised aid to rebuild the city would not fall into ""corrupt hands"". He will host a donor conference for Lebanon via video link on Sunday, his office said. U.S. President Donald Trump said that he will join.
""We don't want any government to help us,"" said unemployed protester Mahmoud Rifai. ""The money will just go into the pockets of our leaders.""
Aoun said on Friday an investigation would examine whether the blast was caused by a bomb or other external interference. He said the investigation would also weigh if it was due to negligence or an accident. Twenty people had been detained so far, he added.
    
'WE CAN'T AFFORD TO REBUILD'
Officials have said the blast could have caused losses amounting to $15 billion. That is a bill that Lebanon cannot pay after already defaulting on a mountain of debt - exceeding 150% of economic output - and with talks stalled on an IMF lifeline.
For ordinary Lebanese, the scale of destruction is overwhelming. Marita Abou Jawda was handing out bread and cheese to victims of the blast. 

""Macron offered to help and our government has not done anything. It has always been like that,"" she said. ""After Macron visited I played the French national anthem all day in my car.""

The issue of how British police use ""stop and search"" powers, particularly allegations that Black people are disproportionately targeted, has come into sharp focus in recent months due to Black Lives Matter protests.
Black people are over nine times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, according to civil rights group Liberty.
Ryan Colaco, a rapper and Black Lives Matter supporter, had just been interviewed by Channel 4 television in May about a recent experience of being stopped and searched, only to be stopped and searched again while driving home.
Colaco filmed the incident and posted parts of the video on social media. In the footage, he is heard saying ""why does this keep happening?"" and ""this can't keep happening to me, man"" before an officer smashes his car window with a baton.
In a statement, the City of London Police said officers noticed Colaco's car parked on the side of the road and suspected its presence was linked to the sale of drugs.
""One of the specialist officers identified behaviour from the occupant which warranted a stop and search of the man,"" it said, without elaborating.
The police said Colaco refused to step out of his car after several requests spanning some 10 minutes, despite officers making it clear they would use force if he failed to comply.
No drugs were found in the car, which was returned to Colaco with shattered glass still strewn inside.
The police force said it had investigated Colaco's complaint and found ""the level of service was acceptable"", apart from the condition of the car when it was returned to him - for which it has now apologised to him.

PARIS (Reuters) - Parisians and holidaymakers strolling along the banks of the River Seine or browsing open-air markets in Paris must wear a face mask from Monday after authorities imposed new measures to curb a rise in coronavirus infections.
The order, which applies to people aged 11 and over, covers busy outdoor areas in the French capital, although tourist sites such as the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe and Champs-Elysees boulevard were not listed.
Data showed the virus had begun circulating more widely in Paris and its lower-income suburbs since mid-July.
The rate of positive tests in the greater Paris region now stood at 2.4% compared with a national average of 1.6%, it said.
After tough lockdown measures slowed infection rates, many European countries are now watching new clusters flare up after easing restrictions to try to limit the economic damage and alleviate public frustration.
France has made it compulsory to wear a face mask in closed public spaces such as shops and banks since July 21, and Paris joins a growing list of cities ordering people to wear masks in busy zones outdoors, including Toulouse, Lille and Biarritz.
Those breaching the order face a fine of 135 euros. The penalty rises to six months in prison for anyone violating it more than three times in the space of a month. The Paris order will last a month.

The number of people in France infected with coronavirus rose by 2,288 on Friday, a new post-lockdown high.

The MV Wakashio, owned by the Nagashiki Shipping Company, struck the reef on Mauritius' southeast coast on July 25.
On Thursday, the government said fuel was leaking from a crack in the vessel's hull and Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth declared a state of environmental emergency, pleading for international help.
""The sinking of the #Wakashio represents a danger for Mauritius,"" Jugnauth said.
Environmental group Greenpeace said the spill was to likely to be one of the most terrible ecological crises that Mauritius has ever seen.
""Thousands of species around the pristine lagoons of Blue Bay, Pointe d'Esny and Mahebourg are at risk of drowning in a sea of pollution, with dire consequences for Mauritius’ economy, food security and health,"" Greenpeace said in a statement. 
Satellite images released on Friday showed a slick spreading out into the turquoise waters surrounding the stricken vessel. Some fuel has washed ashore.
France was sending specialist teams and equipment to help Mauritius deal with the spill, French President Emmanuel Macron said.
A French military aircraft from the neighbouring island of Reunion, a French overseas territory, carrying pollution-control equipment would make two flights over the spill site on Saturday. A naval vessel carrying booms and absorbents would also set sail, authorities on Reunion said.
""When biodiversity is in danger, there is an urgent need to act,"" Macron said. ""You can count on our support."" 
Nagashiki Shipping Company said it had tried to free the 
the tanker but the effort was hampered by persistent bad weather.
""We will do our utmost working with the Mauritius authorities and relevant Japanese organizations to offload the oil still in the ship, clean up the spill and safely remove the vessel,"" Nagashiki said in a statement.
The tanker is 299.5 meters long and 50 meters wide and has a crew of 20, it said. It is flagged in Panama with Okiyo Marine, an affiliate of Nagashiki Shipping, listed as the owner. 
It is grounded at what the ministry of the environment has described as a sensitive zone with the leaking fuel spreading a black stain in the azure water endangering the diverse marine life that attracts tourists from around the world.
Videos posted on social media showed residents near where the ship was grounded dipping sticks into the ocean that glistened with the black stain of the spilled oil.
Mauritius, famous for its pristine beaches, is popular with tourists who last year contributed 63 billion Mauritius rupees ($1.6 billion) to the economy.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan pop star and presidential hopeful, Bobi Wine, said some of his supporters were injured on Saturday after police fired teargas and live bullets to disperse a crowd in the country's east. 
Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is seeking to end the 34-year-rule of aging President Yoweri Museveni in polls due to be held early next year.
Police spokesman Fred Enanga did not reply to Reuters' repeated calls seeking comment. 
In a post on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account, Wine said he had travelled to the eastern Ugandan town of Mbale to appear on a radio talk show but that security personnel from both police and the military blocked him. 
Police personnel then ""started firing teargas and live bullets. Many comrades were injured and are nursing wounds,"" he said but did not state the number of supporters injured.
Wine joined politics in 2017 after winning a parliamentary by-election and subsequently declared he would stand for president. 
Wine's candidacy has stirred significant support especially among the country's youth drawn by his use of music to spotlight rampant rights abuses, corruption and Museveni's long rule. 
His large youth following has rattled the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party and drawn a security crackdown that has included dispersing his rallies with teargas and bullets, beatings and detaining some of his supporters. 
At least two of his supporters, including one who was abducted and tortured, have been killed while an allied lawmaker was also once beaten and temporarily blinded.
Wine himself was in 2018 beaten by security forces so badly he had to travel to the United States for treatment.

Last month the NRM declared Museveni its flagbearer in the forthcoming polls. Should he win another term, he could extend his rule to 40 years, making him one of the longest serving leaders in Africa.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Riot police fired tear gas at demonstrators trying to break through a barrier to get to the parliament building in Beirut on Saturday during a protest over the government's handling of this week's devastating explosion in the city.
About 5,000 people gathered in Martyrs' Square in the city centre, some throwing stones. Police fired tear gas when some protesters tried to break through the barrier blocking a street leading to parliament, a Reuters journalist said.
The protesters chanted ""the people want the fall of the regime,"" and held posters saying ""Leave, you are all killers.""
""We want a future with dignity, we don’t want the blood of the victims of the explosion wasted,"" said Rose Sirour, one of the demonstrators.
Tuesday's blast in the port, the biggest explosion in Beirut's history, killed 154 people, injured 5,000 and destroyed a swathe of the city.
The government has promised to hold those responsible to account. 
Some residents, struggling to clean up shattered homes, complain the government they see as corrupt - there had been months of protests against its handling of a deep economic crisis before this week's disaster - has let them down again.
""We have no trust in our government,"" said university student Celine Dibo as she scrubbed blood off the walls of her shattered apartment building. ""I wish the United Nations would take over Lebanon."" 
Several people said they were not at all surprised that French President Emmanuel Macron had visited their gutted neighbourhoods this week while Lebanese leaders had not.
""We are living in ground zero. I hope another country would just take us over. Our leaders are a bunch of corrupt people,"" said psychologist Maryse Hayek, 48, whose parents' house was destroyed in the explosion.
Lebanon's Kataeb Party, a Christian group that opposes the government backed by the Iran-aligned Hezbollah, announced on Saturday the resignation of its three lawmakers from parliament.
""I invite all honourable (lawmakers) to resign so that the people can decide who will govern them, without anybody imposing anything to them,"" said party chief Samy Gemayel, announcing the move during the funeral of a leading member of the group who died in the explosion.
Macron, who visited Beirut on Thursday, promised angry crowds that aid to rebuild the city would not fall into ""corrupt hands"". He will host a donor conference for Lebanon via video-link on Sunday, his office said.
The prime minister and presidency have said 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, which is used in making fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years without safety measures at the port warehouse.
President Michel Aoun said on Friday an investigation would examine whether it was caused by a bomb or other external interference. Aoun said the investigation would also weigh if the blast was due to negligence or an accident. Twenty people had been detained so far, he added.
'WE CAN'T AFFORD TO REBUILD'
Some residents wondered how they would ever rebuild their lives.
Tearing up, Bilal Hassan used his bare hands to try to remove debris from his home. He has been sleeping on a dusty couch besides pieces of splintered glass.
When his three wounded teenage children ran for their lives they left blood stains on the staircase and walls.
""There is really nothing we can do. We can't afford to rebuild and no one is helping us,"" he said, standing beside a large teddy bear that was blown across his home, and a damaged photograph of him and his wife.
Bulldozers ploughed through the wreckage of mangled homes and long rows of flattened cars as soldiers stood by. Volunteers with shovels streamed through streets.
Danielle Chemaly said her charity organisation, whose headquarters was destroyed, had provided assistance to 70 families who were left homeless.
""We have given people initial help but we don't know what we can do for families in the future. It requires major projects,"" she said. 
Officials have said the blast could have caused losses amounting to $15 billion. That is a bill that Lebanon cannot pay after already defaulting on a mountain of debt - exceeding 150% of economic output - and with talks stalled on a lifeline from the International Monetary Fund.
AID FROM ABROAD
France and other countries have rushed emergency aid to Lebanon, including doctors, and tons of health equipment and food. The blast destroyed Lebanon's only major grain silo and U.N. agencies are helping provide emergency food and medical aid. 
Arab League Chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said after a meeting with Aoun on Saturday he would seek to mobilise Arab efforts to provide support to Lebanon. Also speaking after meeting Aoun, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said his country is ready to help rebuild the port.
For ordinary Lebanese, the scale of destruction is overwhelming.
""It felt like a mini atomic bomb,"" said George Rohana, sitting beside a supermarket that was demolished. 
Marita Abou Jawda was handing out bread and cheese to victims of the blast. 

""Macron offered to help and our government has not done anything. It has always been like that,"" she said. ""After Macron visited I played the French national anthem all day in my car.""

Former Green Berets Luke Denman, 34, and Airan Berry, 41, admitted to participating in the May 4 operation, Saab wrote on his Twitter account.
""Said gentlemen ADMITTED to having committed the crimes,"" he wrote, adding that the trials were ongoing for dozens of others captured. 
Denman and Berry were charged with conspiracy, terrorism and illicit weapons trafficking, Saab wrote. 
Alfonso Medina, a lawyer for the two, said their legal team was not allowed into the courtroom. The two men were not available for comment. 
The sea incursion launched from Colombia, known as Operation Gideon, left at least eight dead. 
Maduro's government said it arrested a group of conspirators that included Denman and Berry near the isolated coastal town of Chuao. 
U.S. special forces veteran Jordan Goudreau, who ran Silvercorp USA, a private Florida-based security firm, has claimed responsibility for the raid. 
Denman appeared in a video on Venezuelan state TV days after their capture, saying they had been contracted by Silvercorp USA to train 50 to 60 Venezuelans in Colombia, seize control of Caracas' airport and bring in a plane to fly Maduro to the United States.
Opposition leader Juan Guaido's office said Guaido had known about the operation since October, but did not finance or order it. 
Maduro, who describes Guaido as a Washington puppet, has said that President Donald Trump's government backed the operation.
The Trump administration has denied any direct involvement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the U.S. government would use ""every tool"" to secure the U.S. citizens' return.

NEW DELHI/KOCHI, India (Reuters) - Seated on the last row of the plane, Muhammed Junaid sensed something was amiss when Air India Express flight IX 1344 from Dubai was jerked around by strong winds as it approached the southern Indian city of Kozhikode late on Friday. 
After an aborted attempt, the aircraft swung around and touched down on the runway, said Junaid, who like many others onboard worked in the Middle East but was forced to return home when his salary halved because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Instead of slowing down, Junaid said, the Boeing-737 appeared to pick up speed, overshooting the runway slickened by heavy rains, hurtling down a sharp slope and breaking in two.
""All these things happened in 15 seconds,"" he told Reuters by phone on Saturday.
Eighteen of the 190 passengers and crew, including both pilots, died, officials said on Saturday, in India's worst passenger aircraft accident since 2010. Sixteen people were severely injured.
But Junaid and several other passengers, seated at the back of the aircraft, walked away from the wreckage at Calicut International Airport near Kozhikode almost unscathed.
By midnight, Junaid said, he had driven himself home to Elathur, an hour from the airport.
Only his head was sore from bumping into the ceiling and his lips bled a little after he bit into them. ""Nothing happened to me, thank God,"" he said.
ESCAPING A PANDEMIC
Junaid, 25, moved to Dubai three years ago to work as an accountant at a trading firm.
The only breadwinner in his four-member family, he would send home around half the 4,000 dirhams ($1,000) he made a month, he said.
But after the pandemic took hold this year, his firm's business dried up and he was only paid half his salary from May.
""My boss told me to take two or three months' leave and come back when everything is OK,"" he said.
Finding a way home was not easy because India had closed its international borders in March. Junaid said he registered for the Indian government's repatriation flight program in May but did not hear back for two months.
On Aug. 1, he was told flights would be available between Dubai and Kerala state, where Kozhikode is located, during a two-week period. 
He paid 880 dirhams for Friday's flight.
""I was coming back to India after almost two years, so I was very excited to meet my family and everyone,"" he said.
CABIN CREW
A few seats ahead of Junaid, 28-year-old Muhammad Shafaf was also returning home from Dubai after spending seven months there unsuccessfully looking for a job.
When the aircraft careened off the runway and plunged off a hill, Shafaf said he thought it was the end, fearing a fire would break out and engulf him.
""A cabin crew from the back assured us that there was no need to worry about a fire. She said that the engine was off,"" said Shafaf, who suffered only bruises on his nose and feet.
As he sat dazed near the tail of the wrecked aircraft, Junaid, too, said he remembered cabin crew calming down passengers and helping those scrunched between mangled seats.
After a 45-minute wait, during which emergency workers helped passengers out of the wrecked front of the plane, Junaid and the rest at the back were helped down.
Now resting at home and awaiting a coronavirus test, Junaid said he wants to stay away from aircraft. 
""I am really afraid,"" he said. ""I don't want to fly again.""

They were detained on Friday night and are being held at the border guards station in Bielsko-Biala, a spokesman for the regional border guards service in southern Poland Szymon Moscicki said.
He said the detainees were thought to be citizens of Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Kurds from Turkey. It was not immediately clear where they ultimately aimed to travel.
Even though migrant flows to Poland never reached the same scale as in neighboring Germany, immigration was a campaign topic ahead of the 2015 general election, helping the Law and Justice (PiS) party to take over power.
The conservative-nationalist government has said it has restricted entry to refugees due to security concerns. Politicians often use the word ""migrants"" as a blanket term, rather than ""refugees"". 
Last month the U.N. Refugee Agency urged Poland to help people fleeing war and persecution after Europe's human rights court ruled Warsaw had broken an international convention by denying asylum procedures to refugees.
Since 2016 the annual number of asylum applications has fallen to 4,000 a year from 8,000-14,000 before, according to one non-governmental organization in Poland.

Residents of Khabarovsk, around 3,800 miles (6,110 km) and seven time zones east of Moscow, are protesting for a fifth consecutive weekend against the detention of Sergei Furgal, the wider region's popular governor.
Furgal was arrested on July 9 in connection with murder charges he denies.
His supporters say the detention is politically motivated. It has triggered weeks of street protests, creating a headache for the Kremlin facing a sharp drop in real incomes as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and trying to keep a lid on unrest as the economy stutters.
Regional authorities estimated around 2,800 people took part in the latest march, a smaller turnout than previous weeks.

Reuters images showed people marching with posters reading, ""Give us back Furgal"" and, ""Away with the repressions"".

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","Ceasefire offers opportunity for eastern Ukraine peace push, says president","By Natalia Zinets
TARAMCHUK, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine wants to build on a lull in fighting in the eastern Donbass region to push for a lasting peace settlement at a new round of four-way talks with Russia, France and Germany, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Reuters. 
Dressed in a T-shirt and khaki trousers, Zelenskiy was speaking on a visit to the area on the 12th day of what Kyiv hopes will be a permanent ceasefire agreed with Russian-backed forces on July 27.
Zelenskiy, 42, was a comic actor when he won a landslide election last year promising to end the conflict that has killed more than 13,000 people and brought Western sanctions on Russia. 
Once a political novice, he has since secured prisoner exchanges with Russia and phased troop withdrawals at selected hotspots. 
""This is an opportunity to save our guys and continue the diplomatic dialogue,"" he said on Friday during a whistle-stop tour along more than 100 km (62 miles) of the frontline.
If the ceasefire holds, ""the first big step has been taken, it is necessary to meet in the Normandy Format,"" he said, referring to the four-way talks named after the French region where they were first held.
HOLDING FIRE 
Zelenskiy inherited the conflict that began after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula six years ago. Ukraine says Russia then engineered quasi-separatist uprisings across a belt of eastern Ukraine that escalated into a full-scale war. Moscow denies the claim. 
A ceasefire agreed under Zelenskiy's predecessor in Belarus in 2015 stopped the worst of the fighting, but soldiers and civilians were still regularly killed in flare-ups. 
The July 27 truce broke down within hours. But Kyiv says the shooting has been sporadic and on Thursday international monitors for the first time recorded no ceasefire violations within a daily reporting period.
The next round of peace talks is due in Berlin but there is no date fixed. Kyiv wants to press for Red Cross access to its prisoners and a timeline for Russian-backed forces to withdraw.
Zelenskiy said Ukraine was willing to show flexibility on a key sticking point – giving legal special status to the Donbass region after holding local elections there, providing this stopped short of federalisation. 
But local elections could only take place once Russian-backed forces withdraw.
""I think this issue is very important: first security, then elections,"" he said.
The first year of Zelenskiy's presidency was overshadowed by Ukraine's unwitting involvement in events that led to the impeachment trial of U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Trump had pressed Ukraine to launch an investigation into his Democratic rival for the 2020 presidential race, former Vice President Joe Biden. 
Zelenskiy said bilateral support for Ukraine would remain strong regardless of who won the upcoming election.

""They are our partners indeed,"" he said. ""I believe that their strategic course does not change, regardless of who is the president.""

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A huge blast rocked a military base in Somalia's capital Mogadishu near a stadium on Saturday, killing at least eight people and injuring 14, emergency workers said, and the militant group al Shabaab claimed responsiblity.
Soldiers opened fire after the explosion which sent clouds of smoke into the sky, said Halima Abdisalan, a mother of three who lives near the area.
""We ran indoors in fear,"" she told Reuters. ""Soon I could see a military pickup speeding and carrying many soldiers covered with blood. I do not know if they were all dead or injured.""
Army officer Major Abdullahi Mohamud said it was an attack. ""It must be a suicide car bomb, I am now transporting casualties,"" he said.
Claiming responsibility for the incident, the military operations spokesman of the al Shabaab group, Abdiasis Abu Musab, said: ""We conducted a successful martyrdom operation on a major apostate military base in Mogadishu.""
""The enemy suffered many casualties and wounded, military vehicles destroyed.""
Somalia has been embroiled in deadly violence since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew leader Siad Barre and then turned on each other.

Since 2008, al Shabaab has been fighting to overthrow the internationally-recognised central government and establish its rule based on its own interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.

JABALIA, Gaza Strip (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of children walked through the streets of the Gaza Strip on Saturday to return to classes after five months of shutdown - though authorities said they were ready to close schools again if coronavirus cases spike.
Pupils mingled freely before heading into playgrounds for roll call and filing into classrooms. At one school in the northern Jabalia refugee camp, teachers wearing face masks welcomed children and offered to sanitise their hands.
Gaza, mostly cut off from the world by an Israeli-led blockade, has not recorded any COVID-19 cases in the towns and refugee camps where around two million Palestinians live. 
Just 78 infections and one death have been recorded in quarantine centres. But, fearing any outbreak would overwhelm the health system, the territory's Islamist Hamas-run education ministry shut down schools in March and students completed the remainder of the school year online.
""We want everyone to realise that education amid (the) corona pandemic is different, and things don't proceed as they normally would,"" said Farid Abu-Athra, an education official with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza.
""So far in Gaza the situation is better, and it allows us to open schools normally,"" he told Reuters.
Health workers will sanitise Gaza's 751 schools twice a day, officials said. Children do not have to wear masks but must bring their own lunch and outdoor breaks are banned.
Plans were already in place to halt classes should the virus spread into Gaza's densely-populated towns, Abu-Athra said. 
About 40 km (25 miles) away in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which has reported a spike in COVID-19 cases, high school classes began this week but elementary schools remain closed. 

West Bank health officials have reported 94 deaths and 13,600 cases, most of them in the last two months.

(Reuters) - Imagine what it's like to be flung to the floor by a gigantic explosion, dodge a falling wardrobe in your home, be cut in the forehead by flying glass - and then brush off the blood and start filming the news.
Reuters senior television producer Ayat Basma provided the world with some of the first images of the damage caused when 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, stored at the Beirut port, ignited and caused a blast that would end up killing at least 150 people and destroying a swathe of the city.
""I was lying on the ground, and all I could hear was the sirens of the car alarms,"" said Basma, who had taken a day off work on Tuesday. ""I thought, I don't want to die.""
""Then the adrenaline kicked in.""
Bleeding from a gash in her head, with wet hair and hastily dressed, Basma rushed into the street and began filming with the only camera she had at hand - her smartphone.
Around her, bleeding and stunned residents clambered over glass and debris. Some people carried injured relatives and begged drivers in nearby cars to take them to the hospital. 
In the building adjoining hers, the roof had blown off. Those who had looked up described a fireball in the distance that turned the sky into an orange and white mushroom cloud.
""Everything was down, the neighbours were shouting, the kids were crying,"" said Basma. ""All you could hear was the sound of cars driving on smashed glass.""
But I just kept saying to myself, ""Film and send. Film and send.""
As journalists, we typically document and observe through a lens or behind a notebook. But this week, our colleagues in the Reuters Beirut bureau, our regional headquarters, were catapulted into the news even as they rushed to cover it. Several spent hours on the streets, while their families at home were injured and in shock.
Television producer Yara Abi Nader was driving when the blast happened. She had rolled down her car window to get some evening air, which helped her avoid getting shattered glass in her face. A shard sliced into her forehead, but she too immediately shot video on her phone to send to colleagues.
""I was focused on just one thing: getting my footage out,"" said Abi Nader. ""It was a form of denial – I didn't really want to look at my face.""
Photographer Mohamed Azakir thought it was an earthquake when he first felt the ground shaking. When he reached the port area, there were bodies everywhere. He saw a man pinned from the torso downwards under a car, covered in dirt and blood. Azakir thought the man was dead, but he opened his eyes and waved his arms when the photographer approached.
Azakir called over some rescuers and helped them move the car to free the man. See his photos here: https://reut.rs/2EZUrzL
RAZED TO THE GROUND
Even before Tuesday's explosion, the once elegant and beautiful Beirut city centre had already been ravaged by months of protests, and a crippling economic downturn. The blast delivered the final blow, smashing store windows long barricaded and forlorn.
Reuters downtown offices were also destroyed. Senior correspondent Ellen Francis hid under her desk as chunks of the ceiling crashed to the ground and window glass rocketed into computers.
Francis took out her phone to tell colleagues to send a news alert, or a ""snap"" in Reuters lingo. ""I tried sending the message 'Big Explosion' and 'Please Snap (NYSE:SNAP),' but the letters came out jumbled because I was shaking so hard.""
""Are you OK?"" screamed Bureau Chief Tom Perry, who had also sought refuge under the desk. He too tried alerting editors, and calling his wife and son. ""We need to get out of here.""
Outside the office, Perry and Francis noticed a woman running towards them with open arms and blood streaming down her face. It was Abi Nader trying to get to the office. 
""There is no office,"" Francis said, as Perry led them to his apartment, where they worked throughout the night amid debris and bashed in walls.
Reuters Middle East Editor Samia Nakhoul has covered the Lebanese civil war, the invasion of Iraq, in which she was severely wounded, and the Arab Spring. When the explosion struck, she was in the car with her two teenage children.
With instincts from years of war reporting kicking in, Nakhoul told her kids to duck down and then left the car and ran for cover. ""As long as I live I will never forget the trauma and the terror in the eyes of my children and the fear that gripped me of seeing them harmed. This tragedy rekindled memories I spent my life trying to forget.""
Nakhoul and her children ran home. She switched on her laptop.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Beijing's top representative office in Hong Kong said on Saturday that sanctions imposed by Washington on senior Hong Kong and Chinese officials were ""clowning actions"" that would not frighten or intimidate Chinese people. 
Separately, the Hong Kong government said the sanctions were ""shameless and despicable"" and represented ""blatant and barbaric"" interference in China's internal affairs.
""We will not be intimidated,"" a government spokesman said.
The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Luo Huining, the head of China's Liaison Office, as well as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and other current and former officials that Washington accuses of curtailing political freedoms in the global financial hub.
The move accelerates rapidly deteriorating Sino-U.S. ties, more than a month after Beijing imposed sweeping national security legislation on Hong Kong that drew condemnation from Western governments and sent a chill across the city.
""The unscrupulous intentions of the U.S. politicians to support the anti-China chaos in Hong Kong have been revealed, and their clowning actions are really ridiculous,"" the Liaison Office said in a statement. ""Intimidation and threats cannot frighten the Chinese people."" 
Luo, the most senior mainland political official based in the Chinese-controlled territory, said U.S. sanctions on him indicated he was doing what he ""should be doing for my country and Hong Kong"", according to the statement.
Luo has oversight over the implementation of the contentious security law that allows mainland security agents to be officially based in China's freest city for the first time.
As well as Luo and Lam, the sanctions target Hong Kong police commissioner Chris Tang and his predecessor Stephen Lo; John Lee, Hong Kong's secretary of security, and Teresa Cheng,
the justice secretary. Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing, was also named. 
Police chief Tang told local media on Saturday that maintaining the security of the country and Hong Kong was his responsibility, and foreign sanctions were meaningless.
The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets of the officials, prohibit them from carrying out business in the country and generally bar Americans from doing business with them.
Beijing-backed leader Lam has previously told local media she has no assets in the United States.
Hong Kong financial regulators moved to calm market fears on Saturday, as banks in the city grappled with the implications of the sanctions. The markets watchdog said it was not aware of any aspect of the sanctions that would affect how financial firms carry out their normal operations in the city.
""DRACONIAN"" SECURITY LAW
Washington said the ""draconian"" security law had undermined its autonomy and set ""the groundwork for censorship of any individuals or outlets that are deemed unfriendly to China."" 
The U.S. sanctions come a week after Hong Kong postponed a Sept. 6 election to the Chinese-ruled city's legislature by a year, citing a spike in coronavirus cases, prompting democracy activists to question whether the pandemic was the real reason. 
Washington said the election delay was the latest example of Beijing undermining ""the democratic processes and freedoms that have underpinned Hong Kong's prosperity."" 
The security legislation targets what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Beijing and the Hong Kong government have said the law will not affect rights and freedoms, and that it is needed to plug security loopholes. They said it will only target a small minority of ""troublemakers.""
Fifteen people have been arrested under the law so far, including four aged 16-21 who were detained last week.
Beijing imposed the legislation directly on Hong Kong just before midnight on June 30, circumventing the city's legislature, and leaving the city's officials in the dark on the details of the law until it was implemented.
The law has steered China further on a collision course with the West, prompting countries including Australia, Canada and Britain to suspend extradition treaties with Hong Kong.
The legislation allows agents to take suspects across the border for trials in Communist Party-controlled courts, one issue that has raised alarm at home and overseas. 
Some Hong Kong people have fled the city to set up home overseas, while immigration consultants have reported a surge in inquiries of people looking to leave.
Hong Kong authorities have issued arrest warrants for six pro-democracy activists who fled the city and were suspected of violating the new security.
Some political analysts say the security law coming directly from Beijing and bypassing Hong Kong's legislature signals the start of a more authoritarian rule in the semi-autonomous city and a march toward mainland control.
Critics of the law say it erodes basic rights and freedoms, guaranteed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, while supporters say it will bring stability after a year of often-violent anti-government and anti-China unrest.

More than 3,000 people had been evacuated as of 6 a.m. local time on Saturday (2100 GMT Friday), according to Ministry of the Interior and Safety data, as rains battered the southern part of the Korean peninsula. Eleven people are missing.
About 100 metres (109.36 yards) of levee collapsed at the Seomjin River in the southern edge of the peninsula on Saturday and flooded the area, an official at the South Jeolla province said, with about 1,900 people evacuated in the province including about 500 from around the river. 
The country's forestry agency has raised landslide warnings to its highest level in every region except the holiday island of Jeju. 
Five homes were buried in a landslide on Friday from a mountain behind a village in Gokseong, South Jeolla province, killing five people. Three people have been rescued.

In neighbouring North Korea, state media KCNA reported that Premier Pak Pong Ju, the country's third-highest ranking official, inspected flood damage to submerged fields and crops in southwest regions of the country.

Cases of plague are not uncommon in China, although outbreaks have become increasingly rare. From 2009 to 2018, China reported 26 cases and 11 deaths.
The patient was confirmed to have bubonic plague, the People's Daily reported, citing an announcement from the health committee of the Bayan Nur city. The bubonic plague, known as the ""Black Death"" in the Middle Ages, is a highly infectious and often fatal disease that is spread mostly by rodents.
The committee issued a third-level alert, the second lowest in a four-level system, effective Friday to the end of 2020 to prevent the spread of the disease, the People's Daily reported.
This marks the second death of a plague patient reported this month in the Inner Mongolia region. 
On Thursday, authorities in Baotou city, which is adjacent to Bayan Nur city, reported that a patient with an ""intestinal-type plague"" died of circulatory system failure.
Bayan Nur authorities have locked down the area where the dead patient lived and quarantined seven close contacts of the patient, who have tested negative for the disease so far and taken preventive medicines.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - As COVID-19 cases spike and hospital bed space dwindles in Alaska's largest city, Anchorage officials on Friday won a key ruling in favor of a ban on indoor restaurant dining after a standoff over the issue moved to court.
Anchorage city officials this week sued to halt indoor dining at Kriner’s Diner, a popular eatery that defied an emergency ordinance issued on July 31 restricting restaurants to outdoor service and take-out due to a surge in coronavirus infections.
On Friday, following two days of court hearings, state Superior Court Judge Eric Aarseth sided with city officials and issued a temporary restraining order against the restaurant. 
The city demonstrated the risks of indoor dining and showed that “the potential harm to the Anchorage public is of such significant importance that the closure of a business would be warranted,” Aarseth said in his order. ""A property interest cannot outweigh a person's interest in life."" 
The diner, however, remained open on Friday afternoon, its tables packed with customers two hours after the judge issued his order. Owner Andy Kriner and at least one server were seen working without masks or gloves.
The diner's earlier defiance of the city's directive had won them hundreds of supporters. Customers filled the restaurant for days, rallied outside the eatery and distributed “We Support Kriner’s Diner” bumper stickers. 
“We have so much support we are absolutely blown away and we feel your love!” the diner said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Thursday.
A handful of other restaurants followed Kriner's example, and the city has sued a second diner.
The spread of COVID-19 in Alaska, which seemed to be in check, climbed in midsummer. Anchorage, home to about 40% of Alaskans, now accounts for more than half of the state's 4,200-plus confirmed cases.
Nearly 86% of Anchorage’s hospital beds were occupied as of Friday, state data showed, and city officials say medical services are on the brink of being overwhelmed. Anchorage hospitals serve patients from across the state.

Tourism to Alaska remains hard hit. The first and only Alaska cruise ship of the season was forced to return to its port in Juneau, the state capital, earlier this week because a passenger came down with COVID-19.

KOZHIKODE, India (Reuters) - The death toll from an Indian passenger aircraft accident has risen to 18, while 16 people have been severely injured, a senior government official said on Saturday.
The Air India Express plane, which was repatriating Indians stranded in Dubai due to the coronavirus pandemic, overshot the runway of the Calicut International Airport in heavy rain near the southern city of Kozhikode on Friday. This was India's worst passenger aircraft accident since 2010.
The flight was carrying 190 passengers and crew.
The plane's pilot and the co-pilot were killed in the accident, K Gopalakrishnan, chief of the Malappuram district in the southern state of Kerala, told Reuters.
""All passengers have been admitted to various hospitals, and they are also being tested for COVID-19,"" Gopalakrishnan said, adding autopsy of the bodies would be carried out according to the COVID-19 protocol.
The Boeing-737 the plane skidded off the table-top runway of Calicut, crashing nose-first into the ground. Such runways are located at an altitude and have steep drops at one or both ends.
In 2010, another Air India Express flight from Dubai overshot the table-top runway at Mangalore, a city in the south, and slid down a hill, killing 158 people
Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri last night told national broadcaster DD News that only an investigation would reveal the cause of the crash.
Puri said authorities managed to rescue most of the passengers because the plane did not catch fire while descending the slope at the end of the runway.
India, which shut down all air travel in late March to try to contain the novel coronavirus, has restarted limited international air travel.
Air India Express AXB1344 was a government-operated repatriation flight for Indians previously unable to return home because of travel restrictions.

Human rights lawyer Anon Nampa, 35, and student activist Panupong Jasnok, 23, were arrested on Friday and held overnight in connection with recent protests demanding greater democracy.
""Whom does the court serve in this country?,"" Parit Cheewarak, a student leader widely known by the nickname Penguin, told 60 to 100 protesters in front of Bangkok's Criminal Court. 
""No matter how senior you are, you are not above the taxes that pay your salaries,"" he said as police watched. 
Protesters have returned to Thailand's streets to call for the ouster of the government of 2014 coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha after a disputed general election last year that activists say was engineered to ensure his hold on power.
Charges against Anon and Panupong include sedition and violating an emergency decree imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
The court declined to process a police request to jail the two men on Friday because it was filed too late. They were instead held overnight at a police station. 

At a protest on Monday, Anon had called for reforms to the monarchy in an extremely rare public challenge to the powerful institution. He was not charged over that protest.

Trump said on Twitter that he spoke separately with Lebanese President Michel Aoun and French President Emmanuel Macron, who also will join the call.
""We will be having a conference call on Sunday with President Macron, leaders of Lebanon, and leaders from various other parts of the world. Everyone wants to help!"" Trump tweeted.
He said he told Aoun that three large U.S. aircraft were en route to Lebanon to deliver supplies and personnel.
At a news conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump said the United States was working with Lebanese officials to identify health and humanitarian needs and ""we will provide further assistance in the period to come"".
Trump and Macron spoke by phone and ""expressed their deep sadness over the loss of life and devastation in Beirut,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere (NYSE:DE) said in a statement. 
The explosion in the Lebanese capital's port on Tuesday killed 154 people and injured 5,000.
France and other countries have rushed emergency aid to Lebanon, including doctors, and tons of health equipment and food.
The U.S. Agency for International Development on Friday said it would provide more than $15 million in assistance, including food aid for 50,000 people for three months. It said it had also asked the U.S. military to transport enough medical supplies and pharmaceuticals to support up to 60,000 people for three months.
Senior Trump administration officials have been meeting to hammer out additional assistance, a senior administration source said, adding continued concern about the underlying governance issues plaguing Lebanon.
On Thursday, Macron visited Beirut and assured angry crowds that aid to rebuild the city would not go to ""corrupt hands.""
The cause of the blast is being investigated. Initial Lebanese probes have pointed to an ammonium nitrate cargo, which was abandoned in Beirut, as the source of the blast.
U.S. agencies are considering both the possibility that it was an accident and the possibility that it was somehow deliberately triggered, intelligence sources said.

The charismatic 40-year-old leader is on track for a comfortable victory in the Sept. 19 election, according to opinion polls, having won global praise for her leadership during the coronavirus pandemic. 
It has been 99 days since New Zealand had any domestic transmission of COVID-19, a rare achievement as the pandemic rages globally, and it has re-opened the economy after undergoing a complete shutdown to eradicate the coronavirus.
""When people ask, is this a COVID election, my answer is yes, it is,"" Ardern told her supporters gathered in Auckland for the launch of her Labour Party's re-election campaign.
In her first campaign speech, Ardern pledged a NZ$311 million ($205.32 million) scheme aimed at getting 40,000 Kiwis back in work, if her party wins the Sept 19 polls.
The funding will allow businesses a subsidy of on average NZ$7500, and up to NZ$22,000, to hire unemployed New Zealanders. 
""The new Flexi-wage scheme is a key plank of our economic plan to support businesses to recover and to provide jobs to those who have lost work due to Covid,"" Ardern said.
New Zealand has been an envy of the world, having eliminated COVID-19 from its shores and successfully re-opening its economy when most of the world is still shuttered.
Recent data suggests unemployment due to COVID-19 was not as dire as expected, and business confidence had improved due to the government's hard and early response to the pandemic.
Introduced to the stage by her partner and fiancé Clark Gayford, Ardern spoke of her unexpected rise to power in 2017, and her handling of a series of tragedies -- a mass shooting at Christchurch mosques, the deadly White Island volcanic eruption and the coronavirus this year.
""If you had told me then that our launch in 2020 would be in the midst of a global pandemic with our borders closed – I would have found that very hard to fathom,"" she said.
Ardern’s stratospheric rise in 2017 to become New Zealand’s youngest prime minister and third woman to hold the office has been dubbed “Jacinda-mania” by some.

(Reuters) - Jerry Falwell Jr., a leading evangelical ally of President Donald Trump, has taken an indefinite leave of absence from his posts as president and chancellor of Liberty University, the Christian school he has run for more than a decade, its board of trustees said on Friday.
Falwell's departure, announced in a one-sentence statement from the board, came days after he had posted, then deleted, a Instagram photo of himself standing with his pants unzipped and an arm around a young woman, a drink in his other hand.
The woman's pants were also partially undone.
The caption of the photo, a screenshot of which went viral after it was posted by a Houston Chronicle reporter on Sunday, read: ""more vacation shots. Lots of good friends visited us on the yacht. I promise that's just black water in my glass. It was a prop only.""
In an interview on Thursday with radio station WLNI-FM in Lynchburg, where the university is based, Falwell apologized and said the picture was staged as a good-natured joke.
The woman was his wife' assistant, who is pregnant, he said, according a WLNI clip from the interview. 
""She couldn't get her pants zipped, and I was like trying to like ... I had a pair of jeans I haven't worn in a long time and, I couldn't get mine zipped either. So, I just put my belly out like hers,"" he told WLNI. 
""I should never have put (the photo) up and embarrassed her. ... I've apologized to everybody. I promised my kids I will try to be a good boy from here on out,"" Falwell said.
The board moved on Friday to oust Falwell, issuing a statement that read: ""The Executive Committee of Liberty University’s Board of Trustees, acting on behalf of the full Board, met today and requested that Jerry Falwell, Jr. take an indefinite leave of absence from his roles as President and Chancellor of Liberty University, to which he has agreed, effective immediately.""
No further details were given.
Falwell, who has emerged as a prominent supporter of Trump in evangelical Christian circles - an important constituency for the president - came under fire in April in a lawsuit brought by Liberty University students.
The complaint, filed against Falwell and the school, sought a refund of fees for room, board and other expenses due to restrictions placed on campus life arising from the coronavirus pandemic, which the students accused Falwell of downplaying.
He also has been dogged by a series of stories last year about his private dealings and his stewardship of Liberty, which was founded by his father, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a powerful and outspoken figure in conservative politics for decades. 
Among those stories - his ties to Trump's convicted lawyer Michael Cohen; his business venture with a former Miami hotel pool attendant; and his role in steering a $1.2 million piece of university property to his personal fitness trainer.

He also came under scrutiny for emails, reviewed by Reuters in 2019, showing he regularly disparaged students, staff and parents in correspondence with Liberty administrators over the years. He became president of the school in 2008.

WASHINGTON/BEDMINSTER, N.J. (Reuters) - The top U.S. counterintelligence official on Friday warned that Russia, China and Iran will all try to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, with Russia already trying to undercut Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
In an unusual public statement, William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said the three countries were using online disinformation and other means to try to influence voters, stir up disorder and undermine American voters' confidence in the democratic process.
President Donald Trump, asked at a news conference in New Jersey how he would respond to interference in the Nov. 3 vote, said: ""We're going to watch all of them, we have to be very careful.""
He added that he believed Russia, China and Iran all wanted him to lose the election.
Foreign adversaries also may try to interfere with U.S. election systems by trying to sabotage the voting process, stealing election data, or calling into question the validity of election results.
""It would be difficult for our adversaries to interfere with or manipulate voting results at scale,"" Evanina said.
Trump repeated his refrain that the biggest risk to the integrity of the election was mail-in ballots. 
""It's much easier for them to forge ballots and send them in, it's much easier for them to cheat with universal mail-in ballots,"" he said, referring to foreign countries.
Trump has been attacking the idea of voting by mail ever since a resurgence in coronavirus infections made it less likely that people will want to vote in person in November, saying despite research to the contrary that mail-in voting is vulnerable to fraud.
Multiple reviews by U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia acted to boost Trump's 2016 campaign and undercut his rival Hillary Clinton's chances in that election. Trump has long bristled at that finding, which Russia denies.
Evanina warned on Friday that Russia is already going after former Vice President Biden and what it regards as an anti-Russia U.S. ""establishment.""
In a statement, the Biden campaign said Trump ""publicly and repeatedly invited, emboldened, and even tried to coerce foreign interference in American elections.""
Evanina said Andriy Derkach, a pro-Russia Ukrainian politician, has been ""spreading claims about corruption - including through publicized leaked phone calls"" to undermine Biden's campaign and the Democratic Party. 
Trump supporters in the U.S. Senate have launched investigations questioning Biden's son Hunter's involvement in alleged business activities in Ukraine.
Evanina said ""Kremlin-linked actors"" also are trying to ""boost President Trump's candidacy via social media and Russian television."" 
He said his agency assessed that China would prefer that Trump not win re-election, because Beijing regards him as too unpredictable. 
He said China has been expanding efforts to influence U.S. politics ahead of the election to try to shape U.S. policy, exert pressure on U.S. politicians it regards as anti-China, and deflect criticism of China.
Evanina said Iran is likely to use online tactics such as spreading disinformation to discredit U.S. institutions and President Trump and to stir up U.S. voters' discontent. 
The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Mark Warner, thanked Evanina for his warning in a statement and added that all Americans ""should endeavor to prevent outside actors from being able to interfere in our elections, influence our politics, and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions.""
Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump's re-election campaign, insisted that Trump has been ""tougher on Russia than any administration in history."" 
""We don’t need or want foreign interference, and President Trump will beat Joe Biden fair and square,"" Murtaugh added.

Many officials who oversee U.S. election technology and outside security experts now worry less about hacking in the elections than about misinformation and logistics such as a shortage of poll workers and slowdowns at the U.S. postal service.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's president said on Friday its investigation into the biggest blast in Beirut's history would examine whether it was caused by a bomb or other external interference, as residents sought to rebuild shattered homes and lives.
Rescuers sifted rubble in a race to find anyone still alive after Tuesday's port explosion that killed 154 people, injured 5,000, destroyed a swathe of the Mediterranean city and sent seismic shockwaves around the region.
""The cause has not been determined yet. There is a possibility of external interference through a rocket or bomb or other act,"" President Michel Aoun told local media.
Aoun, who had previously said explosive material was stored unsafely for years at the port, said the investigation would also weigh if the blast was due to negligence or an accident. Twenty people had been detained so far, he added. 
One source said an initial probe blamed negligence.
While the United States has said it did not rule out an attack, Israel, which has fought several wars with Lebanon, has denied any role. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the cause was unclear, but compared the blast to a 2005 bombing that killed former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri.
Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Lebanon's powerful Shi'ite group Hezbollah, denied what he said were ""preconceived"" comments both domestically and abroad that the Iran-backed group had arms stored at the port.
He called for a fair investigation and strict accountability for anyone responsible without any political cover.
""Even if a plane struck, or if it was an intentional act, if it turns out this nitrate had been at the port for years in this way, it means part of the case is absolutely negligence and corruption,"" he said.
The customs director and a predecessor were arrested later on Friday.
At Beirut's Mohammad Al-Amin mosque, next to Hariri's grave, chief cleric Amin Al Kurdi told worshippers in a Friday sermon that Lebanese leaders bore responsibility.
""Who is the criminal, who is the killer behind the Beirut explosion?"" he said. ""Only God can protect, not the corrupt ... The army only protects the leaders.""
Security forces fired tear gas at a crowd in Beirut on Thursday, as anger boiled over at the ruling elite, who have presided over an economic collapse. The small crowd, some hurling stones, marked a return to the kind of protests that had become a feature of life as Lebanese watched their savings evaporate and currency disintegrate, while government decision-making floundered.
'WHERE IS THE STATE?'
""There is no way we can rebuild this house. Where is the state?"" said Tony Abdou, an unemployed 60-year-old.
His family home is in Gemmayze, a district a few hundred metres from the warehouses where 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were stored for years near a densely populated area.
A security source and local media previously said the fire that caused the blast was ignited by welding work.
Volunteers swept up debris from the streets of Beirut, which still bears scars from a 1975-1990 civil war.
""Do we actually have a government here?"" said taxi driver Nassim Abiaad, 66, whose cab was crushed by wreckage as he was about to get in. ""There is no way to make money anymore.""
For many, the explosion was symptomatic of years of neglect and corruption. ""The problem is this government and all governments before it,"" said Dr. Mohammed Kalifa, 31.
Officials have said the blast, whose impact was recorded hundreds of miles (kms) away, might have caused losses amounting to $15 billion. That is a bill Lebanon cannot pay after already defaulting on a mountain of debt - exceeding 150% of economic output - and with talks stalled on a lifeline from the International Monetary Fund.
Hospitals, many heavily damaged as shockwaves ripped out windows and ceilings, have been overwhelmed. 
""I lived through part of the civil war. I saw people being shot in front of me. But never has there been such a horror,"" said Dr. Assem Al Hajj at Beirut’s Clemenceau hospital, which he said had treated 400 victims.
HUNTING THE MISSING
As exhausted rescuers combed wreckage to find any survivors, grieving families camped outside the port where their loved ones were last seen. Some victims were hurled into the sea because of the explosive force.
""We would like to go inside the port to look for my son but we can't get permission,"" said Elias Marouni, describing his son George, a 30-year-old army officer.
One weeping mother called a prime-time TV programme to plead with authorities to find her son, Joe. He was found hours later: dead.
Dozens are still unaccounted for.
In Beirut’s Karantina district, a Polish rescue team took a break near a once three-storey building that was completely flattened. One woman and her two teenage daughters were killed, a neighbour said.
Charbel Abreeni, who trained port employees, showed Reuters pictures on his phone of killed colleagues. He was sitting in a church where the head of a Virgin Mary statue was blown off.
""I know 30 port employees who died, two of them are my close friends and a third is missing,"" said the 62-year-old, whose home was wrecked and his shin wrapped in a bandage.
""I have nowhere to go except my wife's family,"" he said. ""How can you survive here? The economy is zero.""
After the blast destroyed Lebanon's only major grain silo, U.N. agencies helped provide emergency food and medical aid.

Aid offers have also poured in from Arab states, Western nations, the Vatican and beyond. But none, so far, addresses the bigger challenges facing a bankrupt nation.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - A former Honduran presidential candidate who confessed to laundering drug money arrived in his home country on Friday afternoon, after serving a three-year sentence in a U.S. prison. 
Some members of former minister Yani Rosenthal's opposition Liberal Party said he should run in the November 2021 election. 
A banker and former lawmaker, Rosenthal landed in the northern city of San Pedro Sula on a private plane and was greeted by supporters, some with banners that read ""Yani for president""
Honduras' political elite has become entangled with traffickers that use the Central American nation as a staging post for cocaine moving from Colombia to the United States. 
""I spent the past six months locked up in a six-foot-by-six-foot cell,"" Rosenthal said. ""I don't know what's happening here in Honduras, so I'm going to take a bit of time.""
President Juan Orlando Hernandez's brother, a former lawmaker, last year was convicted of drug trafficking in a U.S. trial in which accusations were aired linking the president to cartels. Hernandez has denied wrongdoing. 
Rosenthal, 55, a member of a prominent and politically connected business family, held the post of minister of the presidency from 2006 to 2008. 
Legislator Christian Saavedra said Rosenthal was the best to unite the Liberal Party, one of the country's two traditional ruling forces, and that some 14 of its 26 congress members support him. 
In 2017, a New York federal court sentenced Rosenthal to three years imprisonment and issued a $2.5 million fine after he pleaded guilty to laundering money for the Los Cachiros gang through companies of the Inversiones Continental group his family owned. Most have since shut.

His cousin Yankel Rosenthal, a former minister for Hernandez, was sentenced to five months for the same offense.

The Treasury Department in a statement said it had blacklisted Abass, leader of the Central African Republic-based militia group Return, Reclamation, Rehabilitation, or 3R, which it said ""has killed, tortured, raped, or displaced thousands of people since 2015.""
The U.S. sanctions come after the United Nations Security Council Central African Republic sanctions committee imposed sanctions on the militia leader on Wednesday.
Friday's action freezes any of Abass' U.S. assets and generally bars Americans from dealing with him, in addition to the U.N. sanctions that obligate member states to impose an asset freeze and travel ban, the Treasury said.
""Today's action signals that the United States will not tolerate those who commit human rights abuses and will prevent such actors from benefiting from the U.S. financial system,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a separate statement. 
In February 2019, the 3R signed a peace deal in Central African Republic, but it has violated the agreement and remains a threat to the peace, stability and security of the country, the Security Council committee said.
The United States supports the agreement, Pompeo said, adding that it holds the ""best hope for a future free of violence and instability for Central Africans.""
The U.N. committee said the 3R in 2019 killed 34 unarmed civilians in three villages and said that Abass ""openly confirmed to a U.N. Entity that he had ordered 3R elements to the villages on the date of the attacks, but did not admit to giving the orders for 3R to kill.""

BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia's regional parliament on Friday passed a non-binding motion condemning the monarchy in the wake of the abrupt departure abroad by Spain's former king Juan Carlos amid a cloud of scandals.
Three separatist parties, which hold a majority of seats in the parliament, voted in favor of the motion which criticized the decision of Juan Carlos to go into exile. The separatists do not recognize King Felipe VI, the serving monarch. 
The proposal ""Catalonia is a republic and does not want a king"" was passed by 69 votes in favor and 65 against. 
Spain's royal palace said four days ago that the former monarch had decided to leave the country. His whereabouts have yet to be officially confirmed since he left Spain aboard a private jet on Monday.
This has left the door open to an international guessing game about where the 82-year-old could be, with Spanish media placing him in Portugal, the Dominican Republic and Abu Dhabi.
""Neither Spaniards nor Catalans deserve such a loud and ridiculous scandal on an international scale,"" Catalan leader Quim Torra told the regional parliament in a special session that he called to discuss the monarchy.
The northeastern Spanish region's separatist leaders want to build a Catalan republic that would break away from Spain, and the latest scandal is an opportunity for them to push their anti-monarchy agenda. Catalans are split over independence.
""We Catalans do not have a king and we do not want one,"" Torra said. ""What authority will we have to enforce the rules against corruption if we accept a royal family that escapes when they are investigated after taking millions and millions of euros in terrible business commissions?""
In a letter published on Monday by the royal palace, Juan Carlos said he was leaving the country so that his son King Felipe's reign would not be troubled by his woes.
While not formally under investigation, Juan Carlos is at the heart of two probes in Spain and Switzerland over suspicions surrounding a multi-billion high-speed Saudi train contract won by Spanish firms. 
Spain's supreme court prosecutor opened a preliminary probe in June to decide whether to extend a corruption investigation into the train contract to the former monarch.

Via his lawyer, Juan Carlos has repeatedly denied to comment on the allegations.

KOZHIKODE, India (Reuters) - At least 17 people were killed and more than 100 injured when an Air India Express passenger plane repatriating Indians stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic overshot the runway in heavy rain near the southern city of Kozhikode on Friday, officials said.
The Boeing-737 flight from Dubai to Calicut International Airport was carrying 190 passengers and crew, the civil aviation ministry said in a statement. Among them were 10 infants.
Television footage showed rescue workers moving around the wreckage in pouring rain. The aircraft lay split into at least two chunks after the plane's fuselage sheared apart as it fell into a valley 35 feet below, authorities said.
""Because of the weather conditions, he could not land the first time, so he did a turnaround and tried to approach it from a different direction,"" Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told national broadcaster DD News, adding that only an investigation would reveal the cause of the crash.
Puri said authorities managed to rescue most of the passengers because the plane did not catch fire while descending the slope at the end of the table-top runway. Such runways are located at an altitude and have steep drops at one or both ends.
""The good news is that the plane broke up and we were able to access the passengers,"" Puri said. He said rescue operations had been completed.
The office of the chief minister of Kerala state, where the airport is located and which is home to a large number of Indians working in the Middle East, said that in addition to the 17 dead, 173 others had been hospitalised.
It was India's worst passenger aircraft accident since 2010, when another Air India Express flight from Dubai overshot the table-top runway at Mangalore, a city in the south, and slid down a hill, killing 158 people.
Media reports suggested the plane skidded off the runway of Calicut, crashing nose-first into the ground.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) said it was gathering more information about the incident, closely monitoring the situation and offering assistance to its customer.
India, which shut down all air travel in late March to try to contain the novel coronavirus, has restarted limited international air travel. Air India Express AXB1344 was a government-operated repatriation flight for Indians previously unable to return home because of the travel restrictions. 
TV visuals showed the aircraft's nose smashed into a brick wall, with much of the middle of the plane pulverised. 
Local TV news channels showed passengers, some of them lying motionless on stretchers, brought into a hospital surrounded by health workers wearing masks because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Pained by the plane accident in Kozhikode"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted. ""My thoughts are with those who lost their loved ones. May the injured recover at the earliest.""

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 03:56PM ET</span>","NRA dissidents cautiously welcome lawsuit, see overhaul as long overdue","By Daniel Trotta
(Reuters) - National Rifle Association members who have been alleging corruption within the gun lobby's leadership for years have cautiously welcomed a lawsuit from New York state that threatens to dissolve the foremost champion of gun rights in the United States.
New York Attorney General Letitia James sued on Thursday to break up the NRA, alleging senior leaders of the non-profit group wasted millions of dollars of members' money on their own luxury travel, personal gifts from retailers like Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, family vacations to the Bahamas and big game hunts in Africa.
""Honestly, this is the best thing for the NRA,"" said Stephen Bozich, a lifetime NRA and NRA safety instructor. ""It will end up resulting in the kind of action a lot of people in the gun community have been looking for, which is new leadership.""
Like other NRA members, Bozich wants the NRA to remain intact. With the presidential election three months away, he is also skeptical about the political motives of James, a liberal Democrat who ran for attorney general in 2018 on anti-NRA rhetoric. 
But within the NRA's 5 million members are dissidents who have been clamoring for reform, only to be defeated as NRA leadership and its 76-member board of directors closed ranks behind Executive Vice-President Wayne LaPierre.
The dissidents have tried to speak for lower-income members who send some of their scarce disposable income to the NRA to defend their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.
The lawsuit details how LaPierre squandered more than $1 million of that money on private jet travel for his wife and family over four years when he was not even a passenger. Such mismanagement shrank NRA assets by $64 million over three years, the suit said.
""I've been trying to wake people up for years as to the corruption,"" said Tim Harmsen, a lifetime NRA member and host of the Military Arms Channel online. ""The NRA is broken on the inside. It needs new leadership. Wayne has to go. It's almost as if he's purposely trying to run the organization into the ground.""
In depositions cited by the lawsuit, LaPierre does not deny the expenditures but justifies them as legitimate expenses.
The NRA has dismissed the suit as a baseless and politically motivated attack. It did not immediately respond to a Reuters request to address the internal criticism.
The NRA's internal critics complain that years of inaction only jeopardized gun rights and invited someone like James to step in, using the state's authority to regulate a non-profit organization that is registered in New York.
Richard Feldman, a former NRA lobbyist who remains a member, said LaPierre should take an immediate, unpaid leave and board members who were on the oversight committees should resign.

""Those in the know were aware for years about improprieties and outrageous expenditures with the top leadership at NRA,"" Feldman said. ""But the extensively detailed allegations of double dealing, sweetheart contracts and engorged salaries coupled with board payoffs are depressingly staggering.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations has not received any requests to investigate the deadly explosion in Beirut's port, a U.N. spokesman said on Friday after French President Emmanuel Macron called for an international inquiry.
Dozens are still missing after Tuesday's blast in the Lebanese capital that killed at least 154 people, injured 5,000 and left up to 250,000 without habitable homes, hammering a nation already staggering from economic meltdown and a surge in coronavirus cases.
Initial Lebanese probes have pointed to an ammonium nitrate cargo, which was abandoned in Beirut, as the source of the blast. During a visit to Beirut on Thursday, Macron said that a transparent international inquiry was needed.
""We would be willing to consider such a request if we were to receive one. Nothing like that has been received, however,"" U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could also establish an inquiry if mandated by a U.N. legislative body such as the 193-member General Assembly or the 15-member Security Council.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on Friday that a Lebanese investigation into the blast would examine whether it was caused by a bomb or other external interference or if it was due to negligence or an accident.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters surrounded a police van on Friday in central Warsaw to try to block it from driving away after officers detained an activist who hung LGBT flags on statues in the city last week. 
The protesters shouted ""Shame, disgrace!"" before the police pushed the protesters away and the van sped off, a Reuters witness said. An ambulance arrived at the scene soon afterwards, but the nature of any injuries was not immediately clear.
Activists from anti-homophobia group ""Stop Bzdurom"" who claimed responsibility for the flag campaign said it was part of a fight in honour of LGBT rights, an issue thrust into the heart of public debate in Poland during last month's presidential election.
Earlier this week, the activists, including the one detained on Friday, were held for around 40 hours in connection with the flag campaign before being freed, a police spokesman said.
But the spokesman said the decision to detain the activist, under which she would be held for two months pending further investigations, was not tied to the statue campaign but related to another incident.
""There was damaged property, damage to health and an illegal gathering,"" Warsaw police spokesman Sylwester Marczak said. 
A protest in solidarity with the activists and with LGBT people is being organised in Warsaw on Saturday. 
Government figures from the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party condemned the activists after the flag stunt, with some supporting their detention.
PiS has argued that LGBT rights are part of an invasive foreign ideology that undermines Polish values and the traditional family. 

""This is the strong nation in all its glory. Why fight with exclusion and coronavirus when you can fight with the rainbow and human rights defenders. Shame!"" tweeted Magda Biejat, a member of parliament allied with the opposition Left group.

Destruction reached 1,654 square kilometers, down from 2,255 square kilometers in July 2019, the data showed.
Vice President Hamilton Mourao, who leads the government's Amazon Council, hailed the data as a sign that military intervention in the region was curbing illegal logging.
""There was an inflection point,"" Mourao told journalists in Brasilia. ""That's just the start. We have to keep at it until we hit our target of getting deforestation to an acceptable minimum.""
However, environmental advocates including Márcio Astrini of the Climate Observatory argued that a reversion from the worst July on record last year was no cause for celebration, citing a broader rise in deforestation under President Jair Bolsonaro.
Between August 2019 and July 2020, INPE's rapid monitoring system showed 9,205 square kilometers of forest were cleared, up from 6,844 square kilometers between August 2018 and July 2019 in the same data set.
Brazil's official deforestation statistics track annual destruction from August to July, and more accurate figures for the cycle are typically released later in the year. 
Researchers and environmentalists blame far-right populist Bolsonaro for emboldening illegal loggers, ranchers and land speculators by weakening environmental enforcement and calling for more commercial mining and farming in the Amazon.
Bolsonaro says he has been unfairly demonized and Brazil has an exemplary environmental track record, pointing to vast swathes of forest that remain standing. Nonetheless, following global pressure, especially from foreign investment firms, Bolsonaro has deployed the military to combat deforestation.

Although deforestation fell in July, the number of fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest jumped 28% in July from a year ago, INPE data showed earlier this month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic senators say they are increasingly concerned about the targeting of Congress by foreign actors in an effort to ""launder and amplify disinformation"" ahead of the November U.S. presidential election.
In a letter sent on Friday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, senators Richard Durbin, Robert Menendez, and Jack Reed said recent classified briefings they had received from the intelligence community had done little to allay their worries.
""Our concerns with respect to this targeting have only grown,"" the letter says.
In an apparent reference to their Republican colleagues, the senators said ""members must understand the risks inherent in accepting information generated by foreign sources, especially those committees currently conducting investigations."" 
Few details were provided in the missive. But pro-Russian Ukrainian sources recently have said they provided material to aid an investigation, led by Republican Senator Ron Johnson, centered around Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter, who served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma.
The disinformation campaign cited by the Democratic lawmakers echoes President Donald Trump's alleged effort to extort negative information from Ukraine about the Biden family - a maneuver that shocked several of his own subordinates and formed the basis for the failed effort to remove Trump from office that ended earlier this year. 
Johnson's office did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The senator recently told a local television station he received information from ""a variety of sources"" but that allegations he was serving Russian interests to attack Biden were ""completely false.""

The FBI said in a written statement that election security was a top priority - and that it would continue to brief members of Congress as well political campaign staff.

""We have many fewer problems with the pandemic than the problems that, unfortunately, they are facing,"" Lopez Obrador said during a Friday morning press conference.
""Our situation is better,"" he said.
The United States on Thursday lifted a global health advisory imposed in March that advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel because of the coronavirus pandemic.
But the stringent Level 4 advisory, usually reserved for countries at war, remained in place for Mexico, with U.S. ambassador to Mexico Christopher Landau citing the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. 
Several other countries remain on Level 4.
Lopez Obrador also criticized media outlets for focusing on the country's ranking as third place globally for overall COVID-19 deaths, rather than deaths per capita.
By the second measure, which allows a comparison of deaths accounting for a country's population, Mexico is in 13th place globally, according to data analysis by Johns Hopkins University of Medicine.
In Mexico, 40 people per every 100,000 have died from COVID-19 - a lower number than the United States, which is at 49 deaths per 100,000 - according to Johns Hopkins. 
It also has fewer per capita deaths than Latin American peers Chile, Peru, Brazil and several European nations.
However, more in Mexico have died than in Russia, Japan and Bangladesh, which have similar populations.
Total deaths in Mexico surpassed 50,000 on Thursday, behind only the United States, which has 160,000 deaths, and Brazil, which is approaching 100,000. 
Similar to other countries, health officials in Mexico admit the number of fatalities caused by coronavirus is likely much higher than the official tally, because of errors and delays in classifying causes of death. 
The virus is still spreading quickly; just over two weeks ago, the health ministry reported 40,000 deaths.

On Friday, Lopez Obrador said ""the curve has flattened.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. authorities have discovered an unfinished 1,300-foot (400-meter) tunnel under the U.S.-Mexico border, calling it an unusually sophisticated smuggling route complete with ventilation and a rail system.
The tunnel was found on Tuesday in the desert near San Luis, Arizona by federal agents led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's investigative arm, the agency said in a press release Friday.
Authorities have located hundreds of tunnels over the years under the Southwest border, saying they are used by drug cartels and criminal organizations to smuggle narcotics, people and weapons back and forth between the two countries.
The tunnel found this week measured 3 feet by 4 feet (91 cm by 1.22 meters) and included a ""ventilation system, water lines, electrical wiring, rail system, (and) extensive reinforcement,"" ICE (NYSE:ICE) said. 
Federal agents drilled and used underground cameras to investigate the tunnel after discovering a sinkhole near cross-border fencing in mid-July, ICE said.
Carl Landrum, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official, said the tunnel ""appears to be the most sophisticated tunnel in U.S. history, and certainly the most sophisticated I've seen in my career."" Landrum started with Border Patrol in 1996, according to the agency's website.
In January this year, CBP announced federal agents had discovered the longest cross-border smuggling tunnel ever found along the Southwest border, originating in Baja California, Mexico. It measured 4,309 feet (1,300 meters).

President Donald Trump has pledged to build a wall on the border with Mexico to stop illegal crossings and drug trafficking, but critics point to tunnels as one way people can get around such a barrier.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union removed Morocco from its safe list of countries from which the bloc allows non-essential travel, after a review by EU ambassadors on Friday.
The move leaves 10 countries on the new list, which takes effect August 8, after the EU also excluded Algeria last week. 
The safe countries deemed to have the coronavirus pandemic largely under control are Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay.
China has also been approved, although travel would only open up if Chinese authorities also allowed in EU visitors.
Morocco recorded a record high of 6,385 new cases of the virus in the past week, according to a tally by the Johns Hopkins University. The country has reported a total of 29,644 cases and 449 deaths.
The list serves as a guideline rather than a rule for the EU's 27 members, with the idea that no EU country would open its borders to countries not on the list. 

It is based on criteria including the number of new COVID-19 cases recorded in a country over the last 14 days, whether its case load per 100,000 people is in line with the EU average, and testing capacities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the territory's current and former police chiefs and eight other top officials for what Washington says is their role in curtailing political freedoms in the territory.
The sanctions were imposed under an executive order President Donald Trump signed last month to punish China for its moves against dissent in Hong Kong and are the latest dramatic action by his administration against Beijing in the run-up to his November re-election bid.
As well as Lam, the sanctions target Hong Kong Police commissioner Chris Tang and his predecessor Stephen Lo; John Lee Ka-chiu, Hong Kong's secretary of security, and Teresa Cheng, the justice secretary.
Among six other officials targeted were Luo Huining, mainland China's top official in Hong Kong, and Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing. 
The Treasury Department said Beijing's imposition of ""draconian"" national security legislation had undermined Hong Kong's autonomy and set ""the groundwork for censorship of any individuals or outlets that are deemed unfriendly to China.""""Carrie Lam is the chief executive directly responsible for implementing Beijing’s policies of suppression of freedom and democratic processes,"" it said.
In a separate statement, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the moves ""send a clear message that the Hong Kong authorities’ actions are unacceptable"" and in contravention of China's ""one country, two systems"" commitments.
""We will not stand by while the people of Hong Kong suffer brutal oppression at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party or its enablers,"" he added in a tweet.
The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets of the officials and generally bar Americans from doing business with them.
U.S.-China tensions have been increasing daily and ties have deteriorated to what analysts say is their worst level in decades.
China's foreign ministry said on Friday it firmly opposes executive orders that Trump announced this week to ban U.S. transactions with the Chinese owners of the WeChat and TikTok apps.
Trump responded to Beijing's new national security law for Hong Kong by ordering an end to the privileged status the former British colony has enjoyed under U.S. law compared with the mainland, prompting Beijing to accuse Washington of ""gangster logic and bullying behavior.""
A source familiar with the matter said U.S. deliberations on the sanctions intensified after Lam postponed a Sept. 6 election to Hong Kong's legislature by a year because of a rise in coronavirus cases, dealing a blow to the pro-democracy opposition that had hoped to make huge gains.
Peter Harrell, a former U.S. official and sanctions expert at the Center for a New American Security, said the latest action, taken via Trump's executive orders on TikTok and WeChat and sanctions over China's alleged abuses against Muslims, showed a ""dramatic escalation in U.S. policy towards China.""
The Hong Kong move could cause angst among banks, Harrell said, as they try to determine what transactions would be allowed under the sanctions, even though the action did not appear to block dealings with the Hong Kong government. 
""Given the range of people here ... banks are going to have to figure out what exactly their risk tolerance for transactions with the government are, how can they be sure that some transaction they're doing is not somehow prohibited because it's at Carrie Lam's request,"" he said.

On Wednesday, Trump said U.S. stock exchanges would likely pick up more business after he ended Hong Kong's special status. ""Hong Kong will not be a successful exchange anymore... we're going to make a lot more money now,"" he told Fox News.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday said that all school districts in his state, once the epicenter of the nation's COVID-19 crisis, could open for in-person learning in the fall based on their current low infection rates of the virus.
All New York regions have met the reopening threshold that Cuomo set in July, the governor said on Friday, with infection rates of the disease below 5% over on a 14-day average.
The rate of COVID-19 tests that came back positive on Thursday was 1% statewide, Cuomo said.
""If you look at our infection rate we are probably in the best situation in the country right now,"" Cuomo said. ""If anybody can open schools, we can open schools.""
Cuomo said school districts will have the flexibility to decide whether to invite students back to the classroom full-time or do partially remote learning, saying there is no ""one-size-fits-all."" 
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has set a stricter threshold of a 3% infection rate for schools in the largest school district in the country to open, and last month released a ""blended"" reopening plan where students would spend two days at school and three learning at home, and then reverse the sequence in the following week.
Cuomo said he wanted school districts to post reopening plans by the end of next week and explain how remote learning, COVID-19 testing and tracing would work under their proposed plans. The governor, who said he has been ""deluged"" with calls from worried parents, urged districts to hold talks with parents and teachers to assuage those concerns and keep all parties informed. 
The Trump administration has adamantly pushed for schools to reopen for in-person learning in the fall, but coronavirus outbreaks around the country have thwarted efforts to do so safely.

Chicago Public Schools, the third largest school district in the U.S. will be holding all classes online to start the school year after the city has seen an uptick in COVID-19 cases, the district said on Wednesday. Los Angeles Unified Schools District, the country's second largest, will also be holding classes remotely this fall.

Caesar, the six-year-old ""No Drama Llama,"" has become a fixture in the city, extending his woolly neck to nuzzle both Black Lives Matter activists and law enforcement officers in body armor lining up to take selfies with him.
The former Argentine grand champion show animal, standing 5 feet 8 inches at about 350 lbs, is unusually friendly for a llama, making him a natural peacemaker, said his owner, Larry McCool, who runs the Mystic Llama Farm in Jefferson, Oregon.
Caesar may not speak, but knows more than you think, McCool said. This was clear on June 9 when about 5,000 people laid down or knelt at bridge near downtown Portland for nearly nine minutes of silence to honor George Floyd, a Black man who died on May 25 after a white police officer knelt on his neck.
""Caesar stood there, motionless, just like this. He understood the moment. He understood the importance of what we were doing,"" McCool said. ""(He) did not move an inch that whole time.""
Caesar guides everyone to a higher path by showing up at various social justice rallies, McCool said, as the therapy llama posed for photos near a memorial to African-Americans harmed by police violence.

Wearing a green face mask and a crisply pressed traditional white suit, he carefully selects a matching white kufi cap on his way to join fellow Muslims at a mosque for the first time in four months in Nigeria's commercial capital.
""I am very happy today,"" Babatunde told Reuters. ""We have been praying at home all this while due to the pandemic. There was nothing we could do about it.""
Lagos state is allowing in-person religious services from Friday for the first time since it implemented a lockdown in March to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Services can be no more than 50% full, and only held once per week.
Lagos is the epicentre of the outbreak in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. The state, which is home to the 20-million-strong megacity of the same name, currently has 15,627 confirmed cases and 192 deaths. 
Religious services have been linked to mass outbreaks elsewhere in the world, including France and the United States.
But religion plays a large role in the lives of most Nigerians, who are broadly split between Christianity and Islam. Many are keen to return to the services and communities they left at the start of the outbreak. 
In the streets surrounding the mosque, where worshippers prayed at a distance, there was little space between the vendors and shoppers. So some felt the mosque, with its restrictions, was safe.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Germany and France quit WHO reform talks amid tension with Washington - sources,"By Elvira Pollina, Andreas Rinke and Francesco Guarascio
(Reuters) - France and Germany have quit talks on reforming the World Health Organization in frustration at attempts by the United States to lead the negotiations, despite its decision to leave the WHO, three officials told Reuters.
The move is a setback for President Donald Trump as Washington, which holds the rotating chair of the G7, had hoped to issue a common roadmap for a sweeping overhaul of the WHO in September, two months before the U.S. presidential election.
The United States gave the WHO a year's notice in July that it is leaving the U.N. agency - which was created to improve health globally - after Trump accused it of being too close to China and having mishandled the coronavirus pandemic.
The WHO has dismissed his accusations. European governments have also criticised the WHO but do not go as far as the United States in their criticism, and the decision by Paris and Berlin to leave the talks follows tensions over what they say are Washington's attempts to dominate the negotiations.
""Nobody wants to be dragged into a reform process and getting an outline for it from a country which itself just left the WHO,"" a senior European official involved in the talks said.
The German and French health ministries confirmed to Reuters that the two countries were opposed to the United States leading the talks after announcing their intention to leave the organisation.
A spokesman for the Italian health ministry said that work on the reform document was still underway, adding however that Italy's position was in line with Paris and Berlin.
Asked about the position of France and Germany, a senior Trump administration official said: ""All members of the G7 explicitly supported the substance of the WHO reform ideas.""
""Notwithstanding, it is regrettable that Germany and France ultimately chose not to join the group in endorsing the roadmap,"" he said.
A spokesman for the British government declined to comment on the latest developments but added that Britain supported the WHO and urged a reform of the body ""to ensure it remains flexible and responsive"".
The talks on WHO reform began about four months ago. There have been nearly 20 teleconferences between health ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised nations, and dozens of meetings of diplomats and other officials.
A deal by the G7, which also includes Japan and Canada, would facilitate talks at the G20 and United Nations, where any changes would have to be agreed with China, Russia and other major governments not in the G7.
It is unclear whether a G7 summit in the United States, at which Trump hopes leaders will endorse the roadmap, will now go ahead in September as planned.
U.S. officials have not said what reforms Washington has sought. But an initial reform roadmap proposed by Washington was seen by many of its allies as too critical, with one European official involved in the negotiations describing it as ""rude"". 
Despite changes to the original text, Washington's push remained unacceptable, mainly to Germany, sources familiar with the negotiations said. 
FUNDING AND ""POLITICIZED MANAGEMENT"" 
In the weeks before the collapse of the talks, negotiators had told Reuters positions were getting closer as Washington softened its approach and European negotiators started to see the reform process as a means to make the WHO more independent from political pressure..
European governments had also began to make sceptical remarks about the WHO in public, with Germany's health minister urging the WHO to hasten a review of its handling of COVID-19.. 
In private, some Europeans have supported a tougher line, with some criticising WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and what they see as politicised management of the pandemic.
""Everybody has been critical of Tedros,"" a negotiator from a European G7 country told Reuters. 
A German government source said: ""It must ... be ensured in future that the WHO can react neutrally and on the basis of facts to global health events.""
But European governments want to make the WHO stronger, better funded and more independent, whereas the U.S. withdrawal of funds is likely to weaken it - Washington is the single largest contributor, providing 15% of the budget.
Some Europeans see Trump's criticism of the WHO as an attempt in the run-up to the U.S. election to distract attention from his handling of COVID-19, and Berlin's ties with Washington have been strained by his decision in July to withdraw thousands of U.S. troops from Germany. 

Plans to reform the WHO are unlikely to be definitively shelved, especially if Trump is defeated in the November election. European governments want Washington to remain a WHO member and a financial supporter, and they have shown an interest in boosting their own funding to the body.

The royal palace said four days ago that the former monarch had decided to leave the country amid a cloud of scandals.
This has left the door open to an international guessing game about where the 82-year-old could be, with Spanish media placing him in Portugal, the Dominican Republic and Abu Dhabi.
""Neither Spaniards nor Catalans deserve such a loud and ridiculous scandal on an international scale,"" Catalonia's leader, Quim Torra, told the regional parliament in a special session that he called to discuss the monarchy.
The northeastern Spanish region's separatist leaders want to build a Catalan republic that would break away from Spain, and the latest scandal is an opportunity for them to push their anti-monarchy agenda. Catalans are split over independence.
""We Catalans do not have a king and we do not want one,"" Torra said. ""What authority will we have to enforce the rules against corruption if we accept a royal family that escapes when they are investigated after taking millions and millions of euros in terrible business commissions?""
In a letter published on Monday by the royal palace, Juan Carlos said he was leaving the country so that his son King Felipe's reign would not be troubled by his woes.
While not formally under investigation, Juan Carlos is at the heart of two probes in Spain and Switzerland over suspicions surrounding a multi-billion high-speed Saudi train contract won by Spanish firms. 
Spain's supreme court prosecutor opened a preliminary probe in June to decide whether to extend a corruption investigation into the train contract to the former monarch.

Via his lawyer, Juan Carlos has repeatedly denied to comment on the allegations.

Now she is posting billboards of the slain emergency room technician, seeking criminal charges for the police who killed the Black woman in her own apartment.
O, The Oprah Magazine said it is posting 26 billboards with Taylor's image around Louisville, the Kentucky city where Taylor was killed in her home on March 13 in a case that has motivated activists for racial equality across the United States.
""Demand that the police involved in the killing of Breonna Taylor be arrested and charged,"" reads the billboard, which is similar to the cover of the September issue of O going on newsstands on Aug. 11. It will be the first time in 20 years that a photo of Winfrey has not graced the cover of her own magazine.
The cover and billboard also feature a quote by Winfrey, the actress and entertainment and lifestyle mogul, which reads: ""If you turn a blind eye to racism, you become an accomplice to it.""
The billboards began going up on Thursday and will be installed by Monday, the magazine said. They will stay up for a month.
Taylor was killed by Louisville police executing a no-knock search warrant who burst into her home with a battering ram. Taylor's boyfriend fired his gun at the intruders, who returned fire, killing Taylor.
Activists, including a number of NBA players and celebrities, are protesting that no criminal charges have been filed, a cause that was amplified by the international reaction to the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

One Louisville police officer was fired and two others were placed on administrative assignment for the Taylor incident.

1166,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>","Poland to push ahead with limits on foreign media ownership, sources say","By Joanna Plucinska
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland is ready to craft rules to reduce foreign ownership of media outlets such as newspapers and TV channels, while making further changes to the judiciary, Poland's de facto leader has signaled, raising the prospect of fresh battles with the EU.
The leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party Jaroslaw Kaczynski made the comments at a strategy meeting on Thursday in Jachranka, a tourist spot outside Warsaw, two sources in attendance and one with knowledge of the meeting told Reuters.
PiS didn't respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The meeting was held after PiS candidate Andrzej Duda won re-election in a July presidential vote, triggering plans for a government reconstruction and a new political programme set to be introduced in September or October. 
PiS has long insisted that foreign-owned outlets distort the public debate and are unfairly critical of its government. 
While judiciary reforms have gone forward since PiS came to power in 2015, bringing Poland into conflict with the EU over perceived interference in the independence of the judiciary, PiS's desire to restrict foreign ownership of the media has remained no more than a topic of debate.
The sources did not say if Kaczynski had mentioned any specific media outlets as possible targets of any reform, but the issue came into focus during the presidential election campaign in July after partly German-owned tabloid Fakt reported on a pardon Duda granted to a man who had served his sentence in a paedophilia case.
Duda asked if this meant Germany was trying to meddle in the election. Fakt denied any political meddling and said it is run by Polish journalists and editors. 
A fear of igniting further fights with the EU as well as a focus on other political priorities stopped the government from pushing ahead with media ownership reforms in the past, officials have told Reuters. 
But the recent PiS electoral win, likely cementing its power until parliamentary elections in 2023, bolstered the debate to finally push ahead with media reforms, party insiders indicated. 
""If he said it, there is a big chance that it'll go ahead,"" one source allied with PiS said. 
Officials said the reforms would focus on reducing the proportion of foreign ownership allowed in media companies and would be modeled on existing legislation in France and Germany. 
""The current situation can't be reconciled with a pro-nation policy,"" another PiS politician told Reuters. ""We realise we will start a huge fight with the European Union, we have to be prepared for this."" 
PiS officials have also discussed in the past the possibility of purchasing a chain of German-owned regional newspapers by a state-owned company, although it's unclear if this would be part of the current media push. 

The topic of the meeting was first reported on Friday by Polish private radio RMF FM.

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",Former U.S. national security adviser Scowcroft is dead at 95,"By Will Dunham
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Brent Scowcroft, a pragmatic three-star general who served as national security adviser to Republican U.S. Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush and later criticized President George W. Bush's Iraq war policies, died on Thursday. He was 95.
Scowcroft, a member of the presidential commission that investigated the biggest scandal of Ronald Reagan's presidency and an architect of the 1991 Gulf War under the elder Bush, died of natural causes, according to a statement on Friday from a spokesman for the Bush family.
Scowcroft reached the rank of Air Force lieutenant general during a 29-year military career and was an influential voice on U.S. national security for decades. He was a cautious internationalist - he called himself a realist - closely aligned with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Scowcroft served as chief military aide to Republican President Richard Nixon during a time when the United States was looking to extricate itself from the Vietnam War, then became Ford's national security adviser from 1975 to 1977 and George H.W. Bush's national security adviser from 1989 to 1993.
""He's just marvelous and he never asks for one ounce of credit,"" the elder Bush said of Scowcroft after the Gulf War was won in March 1991.
Scowcroft, a soft-spoken man with the manner of a genial Westerner, remained close to Bush and co-authored a 1998 book with him. But he took exception to his son George W. Bush's ""unilateral"" approach to world affairs as president.
Scowcroft was a key adviser to the elder Bush during the 1991 Gulf War in which U.S. forces, along with a coalition of allies, expelled Iraqi troops that had invaded oil-rich neighbor Kuwait in August 1990..
The war ended with Bush's team opting to leave Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in power after Iraq's forces were quickly swept out of Kuwait. Twelve years later Bush's son ordered an invasion of Iraq that ousted Saddam and led to his execution but left American troops fighting a messy war in Iraq from 2003 to 2011.
Scowcroft, in a PBS interview five years later, explained the first Bush administration's decision not to send U.S. forces to Baghdad in 1991 to overthrow Saddam.
""It was never our objective to get Saddam Hussein. Indeed, had we tried we still might be occupying Baghdad. That would have turned a great success into a very messy, probable defeat,"" Scowcroft said.
'FAILING VENTURE'
Before the younger Bush launched his Iraq war in 2003, Scowcroft publicly opposed it, doubted the U.S. justifications for it and called it an unwise diversion from the fight against terrorism following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by al Qaeda.
In 2004, Scowcroft called Bush's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan a ""failing venture"" and faulted Bush for becoming ""mesmerized"" by hawkish Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
In 2005, Scowcroft said the continued American presence in Iraq was inflaming the Middle East. He advocated handing over the U.S. operation in Iraq to NATO or the United Nations.
His criticisms were particularly stinging, considering he was a mentor to Condoleezza Rice, who served Bush as national security adviser and then secretary of state. Scowcroft had served under Bush as chairman of the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board but was removed in 2005.
During Ford's presidency, Scowcroft closely advised the president, alongside Kissinger, on the 1975 evacuation of the last U.S. forces in Vietnam. The chaotic scene in Saigon - with helicopters plucking people off rooftops - became a symbol of America's debacle in Vietnam that left 58,000 U.S. troops dead.
In 1987, Scowcroft was one of three members of the Tower Commission that investigated the biggest scandal of Republican Reagan's presidency - the sale of arms to Iran in exchange for U.S. hostages in Lebanon, with proceeds diverted to fund ""contra"" rebels in Nicaragua in violation of U.S. law.
Born on March 19, 1925, in Ogden, Utah, Scowcroft graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1947 and later earned a doctorate in international relations from Columbia University. His career as a military pilot ended in 1949 when his P-51 Mustang crashed in New Hampshire, breaking his back.
He taught Russian history at West Point and headed the U.S. Air Force Academy's political science department before taking a series of jobs at the Pentagon in the 1960s.

Scowcroft had one daughter with his late wife, Marian.

Field reports indicate that as many as nine children were killed and seven children and two women were injured, humanitarian coordination agency UNOCHA said in a statement on Friday about strikes that hit al-Jawf governorate. 
This is the fourth such attack since June causing multiple civilian casualties. 
The U.N.'s Yemen envoy called for a transparent investigation into the incident. 
The health ministry for Houthi-held parts of Yemen said 9 children had died and 12 children and women had been injured in a number of strikes by aircraft of the Saudi-led coalition. 
Medical and civilian sources told Reuters a number of civilians had been killed by strikes in Jawf and transferred to hospitals. 
The coalition, which is fighting the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement, said on Thursday it shot down an explosive-laden drone heading towards Saudi Arabia. 
Cross-border attacks by Houthi forces have escalated since late May when a truce prompted by the coronavirus pandemic expired. In late June, missiles reached the Saudi capital Riyadh. The coalition has retaliated with air strikes.
""I remind all actors that they have obligations under international law to protect civilians and civilian objects. We continue to work with the parties to reach an agreement on a nationwide ceasefire,"" envoy Martin Griffiths said. 
""Yemenis deserve better than a life of perpetual war."" 
The coalition, which receives weapons and intelligence from Western allies including the United States and Britain, was last month removed from a U.N. blacklist several years after it was first accused of killing and injuring children in Yemen.
The conflict has killed more than 100,000 people since the alliance intervened in Yemen in March 2015 shortly after the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government from power in Sanaa.
The conflict is largely seen regionally as a proxy war between Saudi and Iran. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>","Beirut blast a wake-up call on dangers of ammonium nitrate, experts warn","By Maayan Lubell, Rami Ayyub and Katharine Houreld
(Reuters) - The devastating explosion in Beirut should be a wake-up call for countries on the dangers of ammonium nitrate, which caused the blast, experts say. 
Lebanese authorities said 2,750 tonnes of the industrial chemical had been stored for six years at Beirut port without safety measures. That stockpile exploded on Tuesday, killing more than 150 people, injuring thousands and leaving about a quarter of a million people homeless. 
Commonly used in fertilizers and as an industrial explosive, ammonium nitrate is considered relatively safe if handled properly, but it has proved lethal.
In one of the world's deadliest industrial accidents, 567 people were killed in Texas in 1947 when 2,300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate detonated aboard a ship.
""Beirut, like Texas, is a wake-up call. We should learn from these catastrophes and make sure they don't happen again,"" said Stewart Walker, of the school of Forensic, Environmental and Analytical Chemistry at Flinders University in Adelaide.
Some countries have banned ammonium nitrate as a fertilizer because it has been used by militant bomb-makers and since Tuesday's blast, some governments have been urged to relocate stockpiles. 
Chris Owen, a U.N. explosives adviser, said few countries make ammonium nitrate but many use it, often importing it by sea. Since many ports have had cities develop around them, large quantities are moving through cities on a regular basis. ""If it’s managed properly, it’s no risk,"" Owen said.
In terms of safety, experts say, quantity, ventilation and proximity to flammables are critical, as is distance from population centres.
Anger has been mounting in Lebanon at the authorities for allowing huge quantities of the chemical to be stored near a residential area for years in unsafe conditions.
The United Nations has issued guidelines on safe storage and transportation but regulations vary from country to country, experts said. 
Global variation on regulation is a concern, said Julia Meehan, the managing editor of ICIS Fertilizers, a trade publication. ""There’s no global body that looks across it, it's country to country or regional,"" said Meehan. ""It can even differ from port to port."" 
One expert, who asked not to be identified, said political instability was a major factor in enforcement. He cited Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan and South American countries. ""If the country is at war, or struggling with an insurgency or other problems, they have other issues to deal with,"" he said.
Global data on storage is spotty, said Hans Reuvers, a German-based expert on ammonium nitrate and fertiliser technology and executive committee member at the Ammonium Nitrate/Nitric Acid Producers Study Group (ANNA).
Germany only allows 25 tonnes of pure ammonium nitrate to be stored in one place, Reuvers said. France toughened its regulations after a 2001 explosion in Toulouse killed 31 people.
""You have to store it in non-flammable bins, keep them far away from flammable materials. There are similar regulations across Europe as well as in East Asia,"" Reuvers said.
GLOBAL TRADE 
Worldwide trade in ammonium nitrate in 2018 was worth $2.14 billion, with Russia the leading exporter, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, and Brazil the largest importer.
The United States and Europe are the leading consumers of ammonium nitrates, according to London-based IHS Markit, accounting for just over half of global consumption in 2019.
Countries with large stockpiles tend to have large mining or industrial agriculture industries, said Roger Read, of the School of Chemistry at the University of New South Wales.
""Those would tend to be most large, industrialized countries - Britain, the U.S., Russia, China - as well as India and other smaller countries in Europe,"" Read said.
The United States in 2019 eased chemical-safety regulations implemented after a deadly ammonium nitrate blast in 2013. The move cut costly regulations but still kept safety measures, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
    Rick Engler, a former member of the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, said the EPA should add ammonium nitrate to a list of regulated chemicals needing increased oversight, calling present U.S. regulations ""thoroughly inadequate.""
The United States does not maintain a public database on the locations of ammonium nitrate, meaning people do not know if they live near one, said Elena Craft, of the Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group.  

    ""There are a lot of unknowns about how much of this material exists and where,"" Craft said. ""You don't know the magnitude of that risk because of the lack of information that's available.""

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Thursday that the top U.S. envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, was leaving his post and the U.S. special representative for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, would add Iran to his role.
Hook’s surprise departure comes at a critical time when Washington has been intensely lobbying at the United Nations to extend an arms embargo on Iran and as the U.N. Security Council prepares to hold a vote on the U.S. resolution next week.
Pompeo did not give a reason for the change but wrote in a tweet that Hook was moving on to the private sector. 
“There’s no difference between John Bolton, Brian Hook or Elliott Abrams,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said in a tweet under the hashtag #BankruptUSPolicy.
“When U.S. policy concerns Iran, American officials have been biting off more than they can chew. This applies to Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump and their successors,” Mousavi added.
President Donald Trump last year fired his national security adviser John Bolton, a veteran hardliner on Iran who advocated military action to destroy Tehran's nuclear programme.
Hook, 52, was named to the top Iran role at the State Department in late 2018 and has been instrumental in the Trump administration's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Tehran since Trump pulled Washington out of world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic.

PARIS (Reuters) - The armed man who seized six hostages in a French bank on Thursday spoke to negotiators of hardships facing Palestinians and called himself a mujahid but made no reference to Islamist groups, a police source involved in the operation said.
The 34-year-old suspect had a history of mental health illness and spent time in a psychiatric hospital after taking several hostages in another bank in 2013, two security sources said.
On that occasion, he demanded social housing for himself and a handicapped son, they added.
During the six hour-long negotiations with police in Le Havre on Thursday, the suspect referred to the Prophet Mohammed and at times spoke in Arabic. But he never expressed support for Islamic State or other jihadist groups, the police source familiar with the negotiations said.
""He constantly asked for Palestinian children to be freed from Israeli jails, and Palestinians under 40 to pray in Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem,"" the source said. 
The man was known to law enforcement agencies. He was on a ""Fiche S"" security agency watch list that includes individuals the authorities consider susceptible to religious radicalisation, two police sources said on Thursday.
Investigators say there has been a trend of mental illness and religious radicalisation in some attacks that have shaken France in recent years, making predicting behaviour difficult.
""These are hazardous profiles, you never know what to expect from them,"" the police source close to the negotiations said.
The suspect lived in Paris at the time of the 2013 incident and later moved to the northern Seine-Maritime department.
He told the police trying to coax him out of the bank in Le Havre that he was carrying a bomb and threatened to use it if police came closer. 
""But he never physically or verbally abused his hostages and negotiations never broke down,"" the source said, adding that no explosives were found.
The man had wanted to surrender at dawn, after the first Muslim prayer of the day, but walked out shortly after 22:45 (2045 GMT) with the green flag of Palestinian militant group Hamas wrapped around his shoulders, the source close to the negotiations said.
All six hostages were freed unharmed. 

Reuters was not immediately able to ascertain whether the suspect had a lawyer.

NATO members Turkey and Greece have long been at loggerheads over overlapping claims for hydrocarbon resources and tensions flared up last month, prompting German Chancellor Angela Merkel to hold talks with the country's leaders to ease tensions.
""We have started drilling work again,"" Erdogan told reporters after participating in Friday prayers at the Hagia Sophia mosque. ""We don't feel obliged to talk with those who do not have rights in maritime jurisdiction zones.""
He said Turkey's Barbaros Hayreddin Pasa, a seismic survey vessel, had been sent to the region to carry out its duties. The ship moved into waters off Cyprus in late July and remains in that region. 
Erdogan made the comments when asked about an accord signed by Egypt and Greece on Thursday designating an exclusive economic zone between the two nations in the east Mediterranean.
Diplomats in Greece said their agreement nullified an accord reached last year between Turkey and the internationally recognised government of Libya.
However, Erdogan said the Egypt-Greece accord was of no value and that Turkey would sustain its agreement with Libya ""decisively"". The Turkish Foreign Ministry has said the Egypt-Greece zone falls in the area of Turkey's continental shelf.

Turkey and Greece are also at odds over a range of issues from flights over each other's territory in the Aegean Sea to ethnically divided Cyprus.

The U.S. Justice Department filed two lawsuits on Thursday seeking to seize $70 million worth of property. Federal prosecutors in a Miami court alleged that Kolomoisky and Gennadiy Boholiubov stole billions of dollars from Privatbank, the Ukrainian institution which they owned.
""All investments in the USA were made from our own funds received in 2007-2008 from the deal with Evraz and from the income of other businesses stored in PrivatBank. Anything else is categorically rejected,"" Interfax Ukraine quoted Kolomoisky as saying.
Boholiubov has not commented on the matter.
U.S. prosecutors said that between 2008 and 2016, Kolomoisky and Boholiubov obtained fraudulent loans and lines of credit, some of whose proceeds they laundered through shell company accounts at PrivatBank's Cyprus office before transferring the money to the United States.

Kolomoisky is one of the most prominent tycoons in Ukraine and is regarded as a key political backer of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Mahathir, 95, quit in February in a political gamble to strengthen his hand but it backfired and Muhyiddin Yassin, who had been part of his government, unexpectedly emerged as prime minister after forging an alliance with the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) to gain a parliamentary majority. 
Mahathir has since pushed for a confidence vote in parliament to oust Muhyiddin for what he said was bringing back to power the graft-tainted UMNO party rejected by voters in an historic election two years ago.
His new party aimed ""to redeem the dignity of the Malays tainted by treachery, cheating, lying, corruption and greed due to the deeds of other Malay party leaders"", Mahathir told reporters, adding it would not be aligned with any existing coalition.
Malays make up more than two-thirds of the population, followed by ethnic Chinese, Indians and other minority groups.
Having led Malaysia for 22 years until 2003, Mahathir came out of retirement to join hands with former foes to oust then Prime Minister Najib Razak, who last month was found guilty of corruption in the first trial over a multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB. 
Mahathir, who was the world's oldest head of government after his surprise comeback in 2018, said his party had been hijacked by Muhyiddin and a new independent party was necessary. Mahathir has yet to give the party a name.

""This party will be inclusive and moderate and will show to other ethnicities that the Malays are not treasonous, able to keep promises and do not refuse sincere and principled cooperation,"" he said, calling on the government not to hinder its registration.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara's decision to run for a third term in office violates the constitution and will destabilise a country still recovering from civil war, his opponents said on Friday.
In a speech on Thursday evening, Ouattara went back on an earlier pledge and said he would run in the Oct. 31 election, drawing accusations that he is following in the footsteps of other African leaders who have manipulated constitutions to hang onto power.
Ivory Coast law limits presidential terms to two, but Ouattara says that a new constitution adopted in 2016 acted as a reset button, allowing him to run again.
Even before Ouattara's announcement, the vote was seen as a stern test of Ivory Coast's stability. Ouattara's first win in 2010 sparked a brief civil war that killed about 3,000 people when his predecessor Laurent Gbagbo refused to accept his loss.
Politicians from that era, including Gbagbo, are still vying for power and influence, which has revived old political tensions.
""President Ouattara is sowing the seeds of the destabilisation of Ivory Coast,"" Maurice Kakou Guikaoué, the executive secretary of the opposing Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI), told Radio France Internationale (RFI).
A leading civil society coalition called for nationwide protests, but opposition politicians did not, instead suggesting they would use peaceful, democratic means to block Ouattara's path.
Jean-Louis Billion, another senior official from the PDCI, whose presidential candidate is former President Henri Konan Bedie, told RFI it would be up to the Constitutional Council to determine whether Ouattara could run.
Barring some small, isolated protests, the streets of Ivory Coast's commercial capital Abidjan were calm on Friday morning.
Ouattara said he was forced to run and that his decision was not a power grab. His handpicked candidate to represent the ruling party in October, Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, died unexpectedly last month, leading party members to urge Ouattara to run again.
Ouattara's tenure has seen relative stability return to Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, while the economy has grown at one of the fastest clips in Africa. 
A banking executive said investors view Ouattara, a former senior official with the International Monetary Fund, as someone who could ensure stability.

""With Ouattara, it's not a leap in the dark. He inspires confidence and that reassures investors,"" said the executive, who asked not to be named.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - India has shifted scores of village and municipality leaders, mostly from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party, to secure locations in Kashmir after a spate of militant attacks, police and two security officials said on Friday.
Separatists fighting Indian rule in the disputed region have stepped up attacks on lower level politicians, many of whom do not have personal security guards, in recent weeks.
""It is a temporary arrangement,"" Kashmir valley's police chief Vijay Kumar told Reuters. ""We will devise a strategy to provide security to those who are vulnerable.""
Two security officials, asking not to be named, said that around 500 politicians had been moved since Thursday, after militants shot dead a village council leader from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in southern Kashmir.
Many of those under protection have been housed in hotels and government buildings guarded by paramilitary troops, one official said. ""We don't want to take any chances,"" he said.
Sofi Yousuf, a BJP vice-president in Kashmir, said that his colleagues were being targeted to prevent the party from expanding in the Himalayan region, where insurgents have waged war against New Delhi since the late 1980s.
""They want to create a fear psychosis on the ground,"" Yousuf said.
The federal government has been trying to promote political activities since it revoked Kashmir's special status in an attempt to draw it closer to the rest of the country. 
But the loss of special privileges stoked anger across the region and this week authorities imposed a strict lockdown on the first anniversary of that decision. 

Underlining the difficulties the government faces in restoring normalcy to Kashmir, around a dozen BJP members resigned from the party this week, fearing militant attacks.

Protesters, led by student groups, are returning to Thailand's streets calling for the ousting of a conservative government led by pro-military politicians less than two years after a general election.
Police arrested Anon Nampa, 35, a human rights lawyer, and student leader Panupong Jadnok, who have both featured prominently in student-led rallies around the country since July 18, a lawyer from the group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights told Reuters.
Anon called for reforms of Thailand's powerful monarchy, a highly sensitive topic, at a protest on Monday, but the arrest warrant, seen by Reuters, did not refer to that. 
It said that Anon was wanted for breaching article 116 of the criminal code by ""raising unrest and disaffection"" in a manner likely to cause a disturbance and lead to people breaking the law on July 18, when protesters gathered at Bangkok's Democracy Monument.
It also said Anon breached the communicable disease control act over the protest, referring to coronavirus restrictions on public gatherings.
""The police showed Anon an arrest warrant in front of his house and took him to the police station,"" Weeranan Huadsri, a lawyer from the lawyers' rights group, told Reuters.
He said that student leader Panupong had also been arrested but did not give details.
Police spokesman Kritsana Pattanacharoen confirmed the two arrests.
""The arrest of protest leaders came as they brought out people to demonstrate, the police received complaints,"" Kritsana said.
Student leaders urged supporters to gather in Bangkok on Friday evening to call for the release of the two.
Earlier on Friday, leaders of several student groups held a news conference at Democracy Monument to launch a ""Free People"" movement in the hope of getting people other than students to join their demonstrations to press for reform of a military-backed constitution and new elections.

They also said they were planning a big protest for Aug. 16.

The alarm was raised on Wednesday afternoon when experts in helicopters realised that the Planpincieux glacier, at an altitude of about 2,800 metres in the Ferret Valley in the Mont Blanc massif, was slipping dangerously.
A heatwave has created a layer of water under the glacier, which is made up of about 500 cubic metres of ice - roughly the size of the Milan cathedral - making it more prone to a break.
""There is an enormous block of ice resting on the rock and the danger is that it could detach in an instant,"" glacier expert Fabrizio Troilo told the Corriere della Sera newspaper's website.
About 75 residents and tourists in homes or hotels in hamlets in the threatened part of the valley were evacuated and police threw up roadblocks to prevent others from entering.
The threatened part of the valley was divided into a ""red zone"" that could take a direct hit and a ""yellow zone"" that could suffer from shock waves caused by the displacement of air and other secondary effects.
Many tourists in parts of the valley not directly threatened by an eventual collapse had already opted to leave, local officials said.
""The season was going well despite the COVID pandemic,"" Jacopo Nitri, who owns a small hotel in the area, told the Corriere. ""I had to send away 25 clients and cancel some reservations. If the situation is not resolved in the next few days it will be a disaster.""

A similar evacuation took place last September when the same glacier showed signs of instability and lasted several days.

The United States and Mexico have close commercial ties and share the world's busiest land border, crossed by many of their citizens for work, travel or family visits. 
Mexico's health ministry reported 6,590 new infections and 819 more deaths, taking its virus tally to 462,690 confirmed cases and 50,517 fatalities.
On Twitter, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, said his country had issued a ""Level 4: Do not travel,"" warning for all nations at the beginning of the pandemic in March.
But the stringent advisory, usually reserved for countries at war, was not lifted for Mexico, because of the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. 
""Its own government recognizes that contagion rates are still high,"" Landau added. 
The state department said, ""Travelers (NYSE:TRV) to Mexico may experience border closures, airport closures, travel prohibitions, stay at home orders, business closures, and other emergency conditions within Mexico due to COVID-19."" 
Reiterating earlier concerns about crime, its website said the Level 4 warning covered Mexico and many other countries.
Also citing the spread of COVID-19, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention  (CDC)  issued a separate ""Level 3 Travel Health Notice.""

Andrej Hermlin finished his last live in-person performance in tears back in March when he realised the crisis would bring an abrupt end to his concerts. 
""Never in 35 years of my career has that happened to me - I was in tears. I sat at the piano and played and cried because I knew what was coming,"" Hermlin told Reuters Television.
But despair turned into a resolve to keep playing.
""We don't stop, we play every night, always at 7 pm for as long as the crisis lasts,"" he said.
On the first night alone, his band had an audience of 15,000, he said. Ever since, The Swingin' Hermlins have offered a daily live concert stream called The Music Goes Round 'N Round, mostly straight from the family living room.
His wife Joyce controls the recording, their children Rachel, 16, and David, 19, are the stars, and the band can generate some revenue by selling CDs or through donations.
The ensemble has already gone on air more than 140 times, and while small outdoor performances are now possible again, Hermlin thinks bands should explore new ways of reaching their audiences during the pandemic.

United Arab Emirates officials and the Emirates Palace Hotel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Dogged by mounting corruption allegations, Juan Carlos, 82, abruptly announced his decision to leave Spain on Monday but there has been no official confirmation of his whereabouts, setting off an international guessing game. 
ABC said a private plane en route from Paris to Abu Dhabi stopped off in the northwestern Spanish city of Vigo to pick up Juan Carlos, four security guards and one other person on Monday morning.
Upon arrival at Abu Dhabi's Al Bateen airport, the ex-king and his entourage were flown by helicopter to the government-owned Hotel Emirates Palace, according to ABC, a pro-monarchy Spanish daily.
A palace spokesman said he did not know where Juan Carlos was. The former king's lawyer did not immediately reply to a request for comment. His lawyer, the royal palace and the government have all declined to say where Juan Carlos is.
Some media have speculated Juan Carlos is in a luxury resort in the Dominican Republic and others place him in Portugal, where he spent much of his youth. But officials in both countries have said they have no knowledge of him arriving. 
In June, Spain's Supreme Court opened a preliminary investigation into Juan Carlos' involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia, after Switzerland's La Tribune de Geneve newspaper reported he had received $100 million from the late Saudi king. Switzerland has also opened an investigation.
The former monarch is not formally under investigation and has repeatedly declined to comment on the allegations. 
The lawyer said on Monday his client was at the Spanish prosecutor's disposal despite his decision to leave. 

Spain and Abu Dhabi have an extradition agreement, signed by Juan Carlos himself in 2010.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean farmers' cooperative said on Thursday it has clinched a 150 million won ($127,000) deal to barter sugar for North Korean liquor and food products, bypassing sanctions banning cash transfers. 
The deal, brokered by a Chinese company, was signed in June with five North Korean trading firms, an official for the cooperative said, though it still needs approval from Seoul's Unification Ministry, which oversees inter-Korean affairs.
Under the terms, North Korea would swap 240 products -including its signature ginseng and blueberry liquors, crackers, candies, teas and health supplements - for 167 tonnes of sugar from the South, said Oh Hyun-kyung, the cooperative official. 
""The North wanted sugar as they were having difficulty importing raw materials due to sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic,"" Oh told Reuters, saying shipments could begin later this month. 
Oh said Korea Kaesong Koryo Insam Trading Corporation, a North Korean firm specialising in ginseng and health products, was one of the parties in the deal. 
Unification Minister Lee In-young had suggested before taking office late last month that bartering South Korean food and medicines for North Korean liquor and mineral water could be a first step toward normalising exchanges. 
South Korea is pushing to restart inter-Korean cooperation without breaching international sanctions banning financial transactions with North Korea, imposed over its nuclear and missile programmes. 
South Korea on Thursday approved plans to donate $10 million to fund U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) efforts to aid North Korean children and women. 
Heavy rain across the Korean peninsula has brought flooding to both North and South Korea in recent days, sparking concerns about crop damage in the impoverished North and its potential impact on food supplies.
""The decision would be a starting point for our plans to consistently pursue humanitarian cooperation without linking it to political and military issues,"" Lee said. 
Seoul has bankrolled various WFP and U.N. Children's Fund projects in the North in recent years.

KABUL (Reuters) - Thousands of Afghan elders, community leaders and politicians gathered on Friday to debate whether the government should release 400 hard-core Taliban prisoners, a move that would likely quickly clear the path for peace talks. 
Some 3,200 people have been invited to the grand assembly, known as a Loya Jirga, in Kabul amid tight security and the coronavirus pandemic, to debate for at least three days and then advise the government on whether the prisoners should be freed.
President Ashraf Ghani addressed the meeting as it opened, saying that the Taliban had said once the 400 prisoners were released they would start negotiations within three days and commit to a ceasefire. 
The Taliban did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of this.
As part of a February pact between the United States and the Taliban allowing for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, it was agreed that some 5,000 Taliban prisoners should be released from Afghan jails as a condition for talks between the militants and the U.S.-backed government.
The government has released all but some 400 militants it says have been involved in some of the worst crimes including major attacks such as the 2017 truck bombing near the Germany Embassy in Kabul.
Six Loya Jirga committee leaders and members told Reuters that based on preliminary conversations they expected the majority to vote in favour of freeing the prisoners, though they would only be able to confirm that after the meetings took place. 
""If releasing 400 would result in stopping bloodshed, then so be it,"" said a Jirga member who heads one of the committees.
The three-day Loya Jirga has the power to advise the government but its decision is not binding.
CONCERNS ABOUT THE TALIBAN
While many Afghans see the peace effort as the best hope for ending the 19-year war with the Taliban, some question how committed the militants are to reconciliation, especially after the United States completes its troop withdrawal.
Washington has been urgently trying to ease the deadlock over prisoners as it withdraws troops and President Donald Trump seeks to fulfil a major campaign promise to end the war in Afghanistan. 
""The U.S. wants peace talks to begin as soon as possible, so it doesn't have to deal with the bad optics of withdrawing forces while the war is still raging with no end in sight,"" said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center.
""For Ghani, the advantage of a Jirga is that he can't be fully blamed for whatever decision is made, given that it would reflect a wide consensus."" 

Abdullah Abdullah, a former presidential candidate, was appointed the new head of the Loya Jirga on Friday. A post-election feud between him and Ghani, resolved in May, contributed to delays getting the peace talks going.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Citizens of Thailand were surprised and bemused on Friday to discover their country's name had become a social media meme after U.S. President Donald Trump mispronounced it. 
Though Trump quickly switched to the correct pronunciation, people quickly seized on the slip to mock the U.S. leader online as #Thighland became one of the top-trending Twitter hashtags in Thailand with 32,000 tweets and in the top 25 in the United States with over 156,000, according to the tracking site Twitscoop. 
The English-language online newspaper Thai Enquirer changed its Twitter name to ""Thigh Enquirer"" early Friday morning and ran an article on the mistake. TNN Online also reported the news https://www.tnnthailand.com/content/50485, as did Thailand's Voice TV, and Matichon newspaper.
One online joker wrote that Thighland was located on a cartographic leg between ""Kneepal"" and ""Ankola"".
The American president made the gaffe during a speech in Ohio while explaining how his trade war with China had forced factories to move production to Southeast Asian countries, Vietnam and, as he pronounced it, ""Thi-land"".
In the next breath, Trump got it right, saying: ""Thailand and Vietnam - two places that I like their leaders very much.""
The meme escalated when conservative American pundit and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, who was pardoned by Trump after a conviction of violating campaign finance law, argued in a series of tweets that ""Thighland"" is in fact the correct pronunciation.
Rikker Dockum, a professor of linguistics at Swarthmore College, told Reuters that Trump's second pronunciation - with an aspirated hard ""t"" instead of a soft ""th"" sound - is the widely used one in both Thai and English.

""Among English speakers around the world, this is not a disputed pronunciation,"" he added.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Looking for a new way to communicate during the pandemic? A Los Angeles company has created phone booth-sized machines to beam live holograms into your living room.
The device made by PORTL Inc lets users talk in real time with a life-sized hologram of another person. 
The machines also can be equipped with technology to enable interaction with recorded holograms of historical figures or relatives who have passed away.
Each PORTL device is seven feet (2.1m) tall, five feet (1.5m) wide and two feet (0.6m) deep, and can be plugged into a standard wall outlet. Anyone with a camera and a white background can send a hologram to the machine in what Chief Executive David Nussbaum calls ""holoportation."" 
""We say if you can't be there, you can beam there,"" said Nussbaum, who previously worked at a company that developed a hologram of Ronald Reagan for the former president's library and digitally resurrected rapper Tupac Shakur. 
""We are able to connect military families that haven't seen each other in months, people from opposite coasts,"" or anyone who is social distancing to fight the coronavirus, Nussbaum added.
Prices for the machine start at $60,000, a cost that Nussbaum expects will drop over the next three to five years. The company also plans a smaller tabletop device with a lower price tag early next year.
The devices can be equipped with artificial intelligence technology from Los Angeles-based company StoryFile to produce hologram recordings that can be archived. Adding that to the current device brings the cost to at least $85,000.
The companies are promoting to museums, which could let visitors question a hologram of a historical figure, and to families to record information for future generations. 
People can feel like they are having a conversation with a recorded hologram, said StoryFile Chief Executive Heather Smith. 

""(You) feel their presence, see their body language, see all their non-verbal cues,"" she said. ""You feel like you've actually talked to that individual even though they were not there.""

OURÉM, Portugal (Reuters) - Giving a new life to plastic trash gets Carlos Bento out of bed every morning. But the coronavirus pandemic has seen revenues drop up to 40% at Micronipol, the large recycling facility he runs in central Portugal, and it faces an uncertain future.
Micronipol produces recycled polyethylene, the base for plastic bags and bottles. The product is piling up at its warehouses as clients, facing their own economic struggles, shelve their recycling goals. They are opting for cheaper alternatives: non-recycled plastics made from hydrocarbons. 
As lockdowns were put in place worldwide, a drop in demand for oil pushed prices to historic lows, making virgin plastics - already becoming cheaper than the recycled equivalent - even more affordable. 
""If we are no longer competitive and if we lose cash we have two options: either someone has to subsidise us so we can keep working or we have to shut down,"" said Bento, as he stood near a pile of colourful recycled plastic bales.     
Lower virgin plastic prices could spell disaster for the future of European recyclers like Micronipol.
In Europe, virgin polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was over 7%, or 60 euros ($71) per tonne, cheaper than the recycled equivalent last month, data from S&P Global Platts showed.
Industry group Plastic Recyclers Europe said firms in most European Union member states have signalled their recycling facilities have drastically reduced their operations and, in many cases, closed their lines for at least a few months. 
""Without well-functioning and profitable plastics recycling there is no alternative, no environmentally sound option for plastic waste management,"" said Antonino Furfari, the group's managing director. ""This waste will be incinerated or dumped."" 
VIRGIN PLASTICS TAX?
Piotr Barczak, senior policy officer for waste at the European Environment Bureau, called for a tax to be slapped on all virgin plastics to eliminate the price gap. 
The impact of the pandemic on recyclers is especially concerning at a time when consumption of plastics is expected to double to 600 million tonnes per year in the coming two decades, according to a report by Zero Waste Europe NGO.
And as countries struggle to cope with the economic impact of the health crisis, fears abound that environmental policies are being left behind. 
EU Environment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius told Reuters in a written interview that while the Commission had received relatively few requests for extensions or exemptions from EU environmental rules due to the pandemic, the crisis had a ""significant impact"" on countries' administrative capacities. 
The EU is to ban a range of single-use plastic items by 2021, a huge ambition which could now be under threat as more and more consumers and restaurants become more dependent on disposable plastic products due to contagion fears. 
Portugal's Environment Secretary of State Ines dos Santos Costa said her government's ambition to cut disposable plastic products ""still stands"" but the pandemic has transformed models of production and consumption worldwide.
Not far from Portugal's capital Lisbon, recycling sorting facility Amarsul has raised concerns about the vast amounts of plastic gloves and masks it has been receiving. 
""If the ongoing habit of using disposables continues, we may take a step back we will have to fix later,"" said chief executive Sandra Silva, adding that a recycling-based economic model ""cannot stop because there is a pandemic.""
'ACT NOW'
Europe generates around 26 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, but less than 30% of that is collected for recycling. Experts say existing targets to improve plastic recycling could be in danger of not being met.
Sandra Castro, head of Extruplas firm that makes wooden-like outdoor furniture from plastics it recycles, is hoping the current situation is no more than a temporary bump in the road.
""We need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce,"" Castro said. 
But for Sirpa Pietikainen, Finnish member of the European Parliament, the only way to tackle plastic pollution, which some scientists say is fuelling climate change through greenhouse gas emissions, is to produce less waste. 
""If you thought the coronavirus crisis was bad for the economy, climate change will be 100 times worse - and then you will not only talk about losing GDP points, you will talk about access to medication, water and food,"" she said. 

""We really need to act now.""

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 04:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Taiwan in talks to make first purchase of sophisticated U.S. drones - sources,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is negotiating the sale of at least four sophisticated aerial drones to Taiwan for the first time, according to six U.S. sources familiar with the negotiations, aircraft that can keep watch over huge swathes of sea and land.
The SeaGuardian surveillance drones have a range of 6,000 nautical miles (11,100 km), far greater than the 160-mile range of Taiwan's current fleet of drones, potentially giving the island greater capacity to peer into China, observing its air force, missiles and other facilities.
While the State Department tacitly authorized the sale of the unmanned aerial vehicles, two of the people said, it is not known whether the U.S. officials have approved exporting the drones with weapons attached, one of them said.
The deal must be approved by members of Congress, who may receive formal notification as soon as next month, two of the people said. Congress could block a final agreement.
Such a sale would most likely anger China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory.
Republican and Democratic U.S. senators introduced legislation on Thursday that would block the export, transfer or trade of many advanced drones to countries that are not close U.S. allies. Sales would be allowed to NATO members, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and Israel. 
A deal with Taiwan would be the first drone sale after President Donald Trump's administration moved ahead with its plan to sell more drones to more countries by reinterpreting an international arms control agreement called the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).
Taiwan's Defense Ministry declined to comment.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin reiterated his country's opposition to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, saying Washington should stop to them to prevent damage to bilateral ties. 
While Taiwan's military is well-trained and well-equipped with mostly U.S.-made hardware, China has a huge numerical advantage and is adding advanced equipment of its own, including stealthy fighters, anti-satellite missiles and aircraft carriers.
Taiwan submitted its request to buy armed drones early this year, one of the people familiar with the talks said. The United States last week sent Taiwan the pricing and availability data for the deal, a key step that denotes official approval to advance the sale. It is, however, non-binding and could be reversed. 
A deal for the four drones, ground stations, spares, training and support could be worth around $600 million using previous sales as a guide. There could also be options for additional units in the future, one of the people said. 
The island is bolstering its defenses in the face of what it sees as increasingly threatening moves by Beijing, such as regular Chinese air force and naval exercises near Taiwan
Taiwan unveiled its largest defense spending increase in more than a decade last year. President Tsai Ing-wen has made defense modernization a priority, including building new submarines and upgrading Taiwan's F-16 fighter fleet.
Relations between Beijing and Washington - already at their lowest point in decades over accusations of spying, a trade war, the coronavirus and Hong Kong - could fray more if the deal gets the final go-ahead from U.S. officials. The Pentagon has said arms sales to Taiwan will continue, and the Trump administration has kept a steady pace of Navy warships passing through the Taiwan Strait. 
China has never renounced the use of force to bring the democratic island under its control. Beijing has denounced the Trump administration's increased support for Taiwan. 
    China's sophisticated air defenses could likely shoot down a handful of drones, according to Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at CSIS, a Washington think tank. But she still expects ""China to scream about even the smallest arms sale that the U.S. makes to Taiwan because any sale challenges the 'One China' principle."" 
    ""They get particularly agitated if they think it's an offensive capability,"" she said, adding that she expected the Trump administration to be less cautious than its predecessors.
""As a matter of policy we do not comment on or confirm proposed defense sales or transfers until they have been formally notified to Congress,"" a State Department spokesman said.
ONLY FOR FEW U.S. ALLIES
The U.S. has been eager to sell Taiwan tanks and fighter jets, but the deal to sell drones would be notable since only a few close allies - including Britain, Italy, Australia, Japan and South Korea - have been allowed to purchase the largest U.S.-made drones.
Currently, the Taiwanese government has a fleet of 26 Albatross drones made by Taiwan's National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, a quasi-defense ministry research agency, that can fly 160 nautical miles (300 km), or 80 before returning to base, according to records kept by the Bard Center for the Study of the Drone.
General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc's SeaGuardian has an airframe that can handle carrying weapons - but only if contractually allowed by the U.S. government. 
The United States has sold France unarmed MQ-9 Reapers which are similar to SeaGuardians, and later https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-drones/france-turns-to-armed-drones-in-fight-against-sahel-militants-idUSKCN1BG2K2 gave permission to arm them.
Last year, the United States approved a potential sale to Taiwan of 108 General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) M1A2 Abrams tanks worth around $2 billion as well as anti-tank and anti-aircraft munitions. A separate sale of 66 Lockheed Martin-made fighter jets also made it through the State Department's process.
In recent weeks, China said it will sanction  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co for involvement in the latest U.S. arms sale to Taiwan.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 04:26AM ET</span>",Egypt's sex assault accusations spotlight social stigmas,"By Mai Shams Eldin
CAIRO (Reuters) - When dozens of Egyptians began posting accounts of sexual assault on social media last month, activists sensed a ""#MeToo"" moment in a nation where women have long felt disadvantaged.
Like high-profile trials in the United States where the now global women's rights hashtag took off, prosecutors launched charges in Egypt's best-known recent case: a student from a wealthy background facing multiple accusations. 
To encourage victims to come forward, the government approved a bill to better protect their identity.
Yet when the administrator of the Instagram page that attracted the first testimonies tried to expose a second high-profile case, death threats came and she suspended the account at the end of July out of fear, she said. 
Furthermore, in what activists see as a move undercutting women's rights, prosecutors have recently charged several women for ""inciting debauchery"" with songs and dances in TikTok videos.
One had posted a video saying she had been raped and blackmailed and appealing for help.
Campaigners say there remains a deep-rooted bias in the conservative, Muslim-majority nation to place more blame on women for behaviour deemed provocative than on men for sex crimes. 
A United Nations' survey in 2013 found that 99% of Egyptian women had experienced harassment. 
""We are always told that we are the reason for all the wrongdoing happening to us ... whether it's because of what you are wearing or the place you went to,"" said Amina Salah El-Din, a 25-year-old internet content creator who says she was a victim of assault last year. 
The recent testimonies stemmed from the case of Ahmed Bassam Zaki, a former student at the American University in Cairo (AUC) in his early 20s, who was charged last month with indecent assault against at least three women.
Allegations against Zaki were posted in previous years on a private Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group run by AUC students. Authorities reacted after the accusations surfaced on an Instagram account named @assaultpolice.
The volume of testimonies, and the fact they targeted someone from an elite background, was unusual.
""There is this stereotype that sexual harassment only happens in certain (poorer) environments,"" said Azza Solaiman, an activist and lawyer who helped document the complaints.
Zaki has not addressed the accusations publicly but denied some of them during questioning, according to a prosecution statement. Contacted by Reuters, his father declined comment.
GROWING CASELOAD
After Egypt's top Sunni Muslim authority - known as Al-Azhar - and the state-run National Council for Women urged more victims to come forward, accusations surfaced against three rights activists, one of whom publicly confessed and was fired, and a Coptic Church priest who was also dismissed.
Attention also fell on an alleged gang rape at a luxury Cairo hotel in 2014, with more testimonies on @assaultpolice, before it was taken down. Accounts continued on other pages, however, and the public prosecutor's office announced an investigation on Wednesday.
Even so, judicial authorities remain ill-equipped to deal with harassment and assault crimes, according to activists, some of whom have been highlighting Egypt's assault problems since long before #MeToo trended in the West. 
Egypt did introduce jail terms of at least six months or fines of at least 3,000 Egyptian pounds ($188) for harassment in 2014, after attacks on women near Cairo's Tahrir Square during celebrations for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s inauguration. 
Female police officers now patrol on public holidays or celebrations. But the definitions of rape, assault and harassment still often let defendants get off lightly, campaigners say. 
Only forced vaginal intercourse is considered rape, with other forms defined as sexual assault.
""The problem is largely related to the legislative environment, which makes the system unable to deal with this issue,"" said Mohamed Fouad, a member of parliament who pressed for action on Zaki's case. 
A Justice Ministry spokesman was unavailable to comment and Egypt's state press centre and an Interior Ministry spokesman did not respond to questions.
With their pursuit of the TikTok stars, prosecutors have called themselves ""guardians of social morality"" in targeting women deemed to be wearing suggestive clothes. Activists say the prosecutions violate freedom of expression.
Salah El-Din's case shows how women who confront social stigma by coming forward seldom have it easy.
Chasing the man who assaulted her outside her apartment in a working-class Cairo neighbourhood, she said she had to accuse him of theft to encourage bystanders to catch him.
She then battled to persuade police to take on the case, though the man eventually got a three-year prison sentence.

""They see it's rare for women to report sexual harassment and that no one follows this through to the end, so they thought it only natural that I would drop it, or file a robbery complaint instead,"" she said at an interview at a friend's home.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Gracefully spinning among a group of dancers clad in pink, 11-year-old Anthony Mmesoma Madu stands out in black leggings, a white turtleneck and poise beyond his years.
His parents in Lagos, Nigeria's teeming lagoon city, wanted him to become a priest. Instead, he has captivated millions with his ballet.
""When I am dancing, I feel as if I am on top of the world,"" he told Reuters.
A video of him dancing barefoot in the rain on concrete outside the studio where he trains, the Leap of Dance Academy, went viral last month.
More than 15 million people have watched his joyful leaps and pirouettes, undeterred by the rain and coarse surface.
The video caught the eye of the elite American Ballet Theatre, which gave him a scholarship and arranged internet access for virtual training this summer.
Next year, he will train in the United States on a scholarship from Ballet Beyond Borders. 
""When my friends see me dancing, they feel like, what is this boy doing, is he doing a foreign dance?"" he said. ""Now I have won a grand prize to go to the U.S. ... I will be in the plane and this is what I am waiting for, and ballet has done it for me.""
The video also sparked a flood of donations to the academy, which teaches its students for free. Founder Daniel Ajala Owoseni said he will use the money, and fame, to promote ballet in Nigeria, a country where it is not yet widely practised.

""I saw the need to bring a form of art that shows discipline, dedication and commitment,"" he said. ""Students who are able to learn all of these can ... transfer (them) into other spheres of their lives.""

CHENNAI (Reuters) - Indian customs authorities have seized a container with 740 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, the chemical that caused this week's deadly blast in Lebanon's capital.
Nearly 150 people were killed and more than 5,000 were injured when a large stock of the chemical exploded at Beirut's port on Tuesday. Dozens of people are missing and up to 250,000 are without habitable homes. 
Customs authorities in the south Indian port city of Chennai said a large consignment of the chemical had been stored at a site about 20 km from the city. 
""The seized cargo is securely stored and safety of the cargo and public is ensured considering the hazardous nature of the cargo,"" they said in a statement late on Thursday.
There was no residential area within 2 km of the freight station where the consignment has been stored, they said.
Ammonium nitrate is used to make fertilizers and explosives, mainly used by the quarrying industry in India. 
The consignment was imported in 2015 by Amman Chemicals, a company based in Tamil Nadu state, and was confiscated on arrival due to an alleged violation of import rules, a customs official said. 
""The company has been served a show cause notice and a case was booked,"" the official said.

Relations between China and Canada deteriorated sharply after Canadian police detained Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a warrant from the United States.
Ye Jianhui, a Canadian national, was sentenced after a trial in the southern city of Foshan, the Foshan Intermediate People's Court said in a notice on its website.
Police found 218 kilograms (481 pounds) of white crystals containing MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, in the room used by Ye and five other men, according to a local media report.
Of the other five men, all Chinese nationals, one was sentenced to death, while the rest were given jail sentences ranging from seven years to life, according to the court notice.
The sentencing of Ye and his accomplices came just one day after another Chinese court sentenced Canadian Xu Weihong to death for making drugs.
China last year sentenced Canadians Robert Lloyd Schellenberg and Fan Wei to death on drug charges in separate cases. Both men have lodged appeals.

AMMAN/IDLIB/BERLIN (Reuters) - Some families say it is better to know and mourn. Others say finally learning what happened is worse than dying themselves.
Hundreds of victims of Syria's torture chambers are only now being discovered, thanks to a new effort to identify bodies from tens of thousands of photos smuggled out of Damascus seven years ago. For their families, an image of a broken body with a number tag is all that lies at the end of the quest.
""They died starved and naked,"" said Um Munzer Yaseen, 58, who, after sifting through countless photos of emaciated corpses, finally found her son, Jamil, last month.
A computer engineer, Jamil had been missing since one night in June, 2011, when he was taken by secret police from the family flat in Damascus. In the picture his mother found of his body, his eyes had been gouged out and his legs were broken.
""If they had shot my son it would have been better to die with a bullet than go through this hell,"" she said in Amman, where she and her husband have found sanctuary since fleeing Syria in 2013.
Her husband, a doctor, said: ""They killed us twice: when they arrested him and took him, and the second time when we saw the pictures."" He asked: ""Are we not human?""
Jamil's image was among 53,275 photos smuggled on discs and thumb drives out of Syria by a former Syrian army photographer, codenamed Caesar, who fled in August 2013. It was his job to record the deaths in military prisons.
Caesar in hiding in an undisclosed country out of fear of reprisals against him and his family, some friends said. Reuters could not immediately reach him for comment.
Now, years after Caesar's photos first came to public attention, they are back in the spotlight. The toughest U.S. sanctions yet came into force in June for alleged war crimes against the civilian population, under a law named after Caesar.
President Bashar al-Assad has not commented directly on the Caesar photographs since a 2015 interview, when he dismissed them as ""allegations without evidence"".
The Syrian information ministry and the Syrian U.N. mission did not respond to Reuters emailed requests for comment about the Caesar photographs and evidence of systematic torture.
Human rights groups believe Caesar's photos contain images of 6,785 detainees, most tortured to death by the Syrian authorities in the early months of the uprising that evolved into Syria's civil war, now in its ninth year. 
The state of the tortured, mutilated and starved bodies makes it hard to identify them, said Fadel Abdel Ghani, the Doha-based chairman of a group, the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which says it has identified 900 victims so far.
With the renewed attention, campaigners have launched a new push to identify the dead.
The images first came to light in 2014, the year after Caesar defected, but after the sanctions were imposed they have been re-released on activists’ social media platforms, giving families a fresh chance to find missing loved ones.
    
WE MOURNED HIM AGAIN
For Syrian artist and teacher Fida Al Waer, whose 19-year-old brother Mohammad Mukhtar was taken at a checkpoint in Homs in 2012, finding his photo ended hope the family had of seeing him alive.
""I would see him in my dreams alive and that he would return,"" said the young artist, who now lives in a flat in the Lebanese capital. ""We mourned him again when the photo was found. We always had hope he would be released.""
She recalls how the family had implored the young man not to go to an area of the city where demonstrators were protesting against Assad's rule, in the early days of the uprising when security forces were arresting youths at random at checkpoints.
""For them, he is just a number. A number is on his forehead. He was just a number.""
After nine years of war that killed more than half a million people and made more than half the population homeless, Assad's government, backed in recent years by Russia and Iran, has recaptured most territory once held by rebel fighters.
Assad and his allies argue that the war has largely been won, and it is time for the world to allow Syria to rebuild. The new U.S. sanctions, which apply to any countries doing business with Damascus, make that difficult if not impossible.
Sara Kayyali, a lawyer and Syria expert at U.S-based Human Rights Watch who has researched the photos, says they make it impossible to deny the systematic use of torture in the Syrian security prison system.
""They have shown us irrefutable proof the Syrian government had truly detained and tortured thousands who disappeared -- and denied they exist -- and that it has tortured them to death,"" Kayyali said in Amman.
For Mariam Alhallak, identifying the photo of her son, Ayham, 25, a postgraduate dentistry student abducted on the campus of Damascus University in November 2012, ended years of doubt. She had spent more than 17 months knocking at the doors of every government bureau looking for a certificate of death.
""Thank God he died early and did not get ... starved until he became a skeleton,"" said Mariam from her flat in Berlin.
A faculty colleague detained with her son and later released told her Ayham was tortured for at least two hours before losing consciousness after being hit on the head with a metal bar, after which the torture stopped.
He died five days after his arrest, in his colleague's arms. In Caesar's photograph of his corpse there was a sticker on his forehead that read: ""corpse 320 belonging to detention facility 215"".
In a camp for displaced people in opposition-held Idlib, 74-year-old Jouriya Ali finally found an image of her son Jumaa, who was taken off a public bus near Qutaifa on the edge of Damascus on his way to work in the capital.
""I wish I had died and not seen this picture. There is no one who was more caring than him,"" the mother said. Every day since he disappeared eight years ago she would glance at the door in fleeting hope he would one day show up. 

""God deprive them of their youth, as they have deprived my son of his youth.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hundreds of South Korean trainee doctors went on strike on Friday to protest a government plan to boost the number of medical students in the country, arguing it would be a poor use of additional funding for the sector.
The government said its goal to increase the number of medical students by 4,000 over the next 10 years is necessary to better prepare for public health crises like the coronavirus pandemic. 
The student doctors, however, say that funding would be better spent improving the salaries of existing trainees, which would encourage them to move out of Seoul to rural areas where more professionals are needed.
Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun had urged the intern and resident doctors to call off the 24-hour strike, which comes as South Korea battles smaller but persistent clusters of COVID-19 infections.
""It is very concerning that medical gap will occur in ERs and ICUs that have direct links with the citizens' lives"", Chung said in remarks posted online.
Chung asked the striking doctors to instead talk with the government, although did not offer any concessions.
Severance Hospital, one of the big five hospitals in Seoul, told Reuters a majority of its 90 interns and 370 residents were taking part in the strike. It added that other doctors would fill the gap to prevent disruptions.
The government announced in July that it planned to boost the usual medical school quota of 3,058 admissions each year by around 400, or 13%, over the next decade. The quota had been fixed since 2006.
Incentives will be offered for students majoring in less lucrative specialities such as epidemiology and those who volunteer for public health work in rural areas.
The country has fewer than 300 infectious disease specialists, representing less than 1% of its 100,000 doctors. And while Seoul has three doctors for every 1,000 people on average, the ratio in North Gyeongsang province, for example, falls to 1.4, said Health Minister Park Neung-hoo.
""The main reason for promoting this policy is to secure doctors where they are needed,"" Park said. ""Our goal is to first increase the number of doctors in rural provinces, so that those who live in even the countryside could get proper treatment.""
The government plans to send three quarters of the additional trainees to rural provinces, in exchange for tuition waivers and scholarships. If the 10-year stint is not completed, their medical license will be revoked.
""NOTHING TO LOSE""
The trainee doctors taking strike action maintain South Korea already has enough medical professionals, and they should be better paid to encourage a wider geographical spread.
""We, young doctors, are paid at the minimum wage and work 80 hours a week, twice what the labour law stipulates,"" the Korean Intern Resident Association (KIRA) said. ""We have nothing to lose.""
The association, which has 16,000 members, estimated it costs up to 300 million won ($253,000) to train a doctor, meaning the government's program will cost more than 1 trillion won.
Park Jee-hyun, 29, KIRA president and a fourth-year resident in general surgery, said the government ""should arrange more meetings with young doctors to listen to their demands before drafting medical legislation.""
Park Yoon-hyung, professor of preventive medicine at Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine, said more efficient use of military doctors already assigned to regional areas - but mostly not actively involved in public hospitals or health centres - would also help.
A petition with almost 20,000 signatures calls for funding to be diverted to financially strained rural hospitals so they can offer stronger job security to medical staff. It also urges the government to make use of the around 700 doctors who retire from university hospitals and private clinics each year.
Trainee doctors are planning a second strike next weekend.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>","Factbox: Taiwan, China and the United States","(Reuters) - The United States is negotiating the sale of at least four sophisticated aerial drones to Taiwan for the first time, sources told Reuters, in a deal that is likely to further ratchet up Sino-U.S. tensions.
Here are some facts about Taiwan's relations with China and the United States, and why the issue is so sensitive.
CHINA'S POSITION ON TAIWAN
China views democratic Taiwan as merely a wayward Chinese province and its ""sacred"" territory, awaiting the day the island can be brought under its control - peacefully or militarily - with no right to state-to-state relations.
China enacted an anti-secession law in 2005 that mandates the use of force if the government judges Taiwan to have declared independence, though it says ""peaceful reunification"" is its aim.
TAIWAN'S POSITION
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party supports the island's separate identity from China and the right of Taiwan's people to decide their own future. President Tsai Ing-wen says Taiwan already is an independent country called the Republic of China, the island's formal name.
The party says that the People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan and that its unelected government has no right to speak for Taiwan's people, who choose their own leaders.
CHINA-U.S. TIES
Relations between Beijing and Washington have soured since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in 2017, with Taiwan just one of a number of destabilising factors.
The two sides have argued over trade, human rights, China's response to the new coronavirus pandemic and more recently the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok.
China calls Taiwan the most important, most sensitive issue in its relations with the United States.
TAIWAN-U.S. RELATIONS
The United States has ramped up arms sales to Taiwan, including tanks and fighter jets, and has taken an increasingly strident position in supporting Taiwan's role on the international stage, particularly at the World Health Organization (WHO). 
Next week, U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar visits Taipei, the highest-level visit in four decades. 
TAIWAN-CHINA MILITARY TENSIONS
China maintains a massive numerical military advantage over Taiwan, and is adding advanced weaponry like stealthy fighters and aircraft carriers Taiwan cannot hope to match directly.
But Taiwan's armed forces are well trained and President Tsai has made their modernisation a priority.
Chinese jets and aircraft make regular forays into the airspace and seas around Taiwan, which Taipei denounces as attempts at intimidation. The two have not fired a shot in anger in decades.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong filed a court challenge on Friday against his disqualification from district polls, in a move which may have implications for this year's removals of opposition candidates for the city's legislature.
Wong, 23, was the only candidate in district council elections last year to have been disqualified, with authorities saying his candidacy contravened electoral laws that bar ""advocating or promoting self-determination.""
Wong, who China calls a ""black hand"" of foreign forces, said at the time he supported the idea of a non-binding referendum for people to have a say over Hong Kong’s future status within China. But he is against independence which is anathema for Beijing.
""The reason I apply for judicial review is to make clear that the power of the returning officer keeps enlarging, they are just (pursuing a) political mission,"" said Wong, referring to officials who vet candidates.
Wong, who became an international figure after leading protests as a teenager in 2012 and 2014, was also among 12 opposition candidates recently disqualified from running in elections for seats in the city's legislature.
Those polls have been postponed by a year to Sept 2021, with the government citing coronavirus risks.
Grounds for disqualification included perceived subversive intentions, ""opposition in principle"" to a new national security law imposed by Beijing, and intentions to form a majority that could block government legislation.
If Wong's court challenge on Friday is accepted, it could pave the way for legal challenges to the latest round of disqualifications.
The Hong Kong government's decision to postpone the elections has been criticised by Western governments as an attempt to weaken the pro-democracy opposition in the Chinese-ruled, semi-autonomous city. Hong Kong authorities said the only consideration was public health.
Pro-democracy candidates won more than 80% of the district council seats last year and hoped to win an unprecedented majority in the legislature, riding momentum built on protests in 2019 and fuelled by resentment over the new security law.
Wong faces multiple charges for taking part in unlawful assemblies related to protests last year and on June 4, 2020 at a vigil commemorating China's 1989 bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square. 
Beijing imposed the new security legislation on June 30 in response to last year's protests to punish anything China considers to be secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.

Critics of the legislation say it erodes the freedoms the former British colony was promised when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, while supporters say it will bring stability after a year of unrest and safeguard China from foreign interference.

A report by the commission attributes the low water level to two years of reduced rainfall and the operations of 13 Mekong hydropower dams - two in Laos and 11 in China - as well as dams on Mekong tributaries in Laos. The Mekong also flows through part of Myanmar.
The report said the low flow could have severe impacts on communities in its member countries - Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam - due to loss of fisheries and irrigation potential. 
""We call on the six Mekong countries to increase their sharing of data and information on their dam and water infrastructure operations in a transparent and speedy manner with the MRC,"" said An Pich Hatda, chief executive officer of the MRC's secretariat.
The report addressed a second year of delayed seasonal water flow into Cambodia's Tonle Sap, Southeast Asia's largest lake, which has severely disrupted fishing and threatened the food supply of more than a million people.
The Mekong typically swells in rainy season where it converges with the Tonle Sap River, causing a rare reversed flow of the river into the lake around June.
This year's reverse flow began this week, said Chan Yutha, spokesman of Cambodia's Water Resources Ministry.
A tropical storm has hit parts of the Mekong this month, bringing large rainfall and rapidly increasing water levels in some stretches.
The MRC said Mekong countries should implement drought plans and request that water storage operators release more water and irrigators use less of it.

It also suggests they ask China to water supplement, or discharge water from dams and reservoirs, if current conditions persist.

The raid by environmental protection agency Ibama began on Wednesday, destroying excavators and water pumps used by wildcat miners prospecting for gold on rivers inside the reservation in Para state.
Indigenous organizations have denounced the deforestation and poisoning of rivers caused by illegal miners, who have invaded reservations in growing numbers encouraged by right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's plan to develop the Amazon, including protected tribal lands.
The suspension ordered by the Defense Ministry followed a visit to the Munduruku reservation by Environment Minister Ricardo Salles to meet with miners and tribe members who favor mining.
A Defense Ministry statement said the operations on Munduruku lands were suspended ""to evaluate the results in response to a request from indigenous people.""
Munduruku representatives were flown to Brasilia in an Air Force plane for a meeting at the Environment Ministry, the statement added.
Environmental protection agency Ibama did not reply to a request for comment.
Bolsonaro, who has said he plans to legalize mining on indigenous reservations currently protected by Brazil's law, has in the past criticized the destruction of mining equipment used by wildcat miners.
Deforestation within indigenous territories in the Amazon rainforest skyrocketed in the first four months of 2020, increasing by 59% compared with the same period last year, according to a Greenpeace analysis of official data.
The environmental organization said 72% of the illegal mining in the Amazon in the first four months of this year occurred on indigenous lands or conservation areas.

In the northern Amazon, an ongoing gold rush has seen 20,000 miners invade the Yanomami reservation, threatening the environment and health of Brazil's last major isolated tribe.

TAICHUNG, Taiwan (Reuters) - Standing amid rows of metal-bound barrels in a vineyard, Chen Chien-hao holds up a glass of wine to scrutinise its golden hue.
Well may the bespectacled 52-year-old cheer after the red and white wines he helped develop in central Taiwan took gold medals at a prestigious competition in Paris this year.
""I'm initiating a revolution called the Taiwan wine spirit renaissance,"" Chen told Reuters, describing his efforts to rejuvenate a tradition that has nearly died out on the sub-tropical island.
""We are trying to give new life to Taiwan's wine culture,"" he added. ""Because now we have new equipment, new wine-making techniques, we will revive this culture."" 
Taiwan is famed for a thriving food scene centred on traditional night markets that draw flocks of tourists, and it makes an award-winning whisky, Kavalan, but is scarcely known to wine enthusiasts. 
Asian consumers probably know the island best for Kaoliang, a sorghum-based firewater that tends to win few fans beyond the region.
Until 2002, alcohol production was a government monopoly that kept out private firms, yielding wine that was ""very local"", for domestic consumption, said Chen.
Now the picture is set to change, after Chen worked with grower Hung Chi-pei at the Shu-sheng Leisure Domaine in Taichung to develop the wines that took laurels at France's Vinalies Internationales competition that ended in March.
""Of course I was very happy. I never expected this and didn't know we would win,"" said Hung, standing in front of the vines at the vineyard that dates from 1957, and where barrels are stacked beside a traditional red-walled shrine.
Workers plucked bunches of green and red grapes, sorting them before placing the fruit on steel conveyors to be crushed.
Just 6,000 bottles are produced every year of the award-winning wines, based on a Black Queen varietal first developed by Japanese scientists, and priced at T$3,000 ($102) each, or far beyond most imported wine available in Taiwan.
Competitions offer a platform to boost international visibility, added Chen, who studied wine-making techniques at France's University of Burgundy. 
""The style of the wine has to have local authenticity and it needs to meet certain standards. That's why I always think that we need to prove our quality through competitions.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Bells tolled in Hiroshima on Thursday for the 75th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing, with ceremonies downsized due to the coronavirus and the city's mayor urging nations to reject selfish nationalism and unite to fight all threats.
Though thousands usually pack the Peace Park in the centre of the Japanese city to pray, sing and offer paper cranes as a symbol of peace, entrance was sharply limited and only survivors and their families could attend the memorial ceremony.
The city said the significance of the anniversary of the bombing that killed 140,000 people before the end of 1945 had prompted its decision to hold the ceremony despite the spread of the virus, but taking strict precautions.
""On August 6, 1945, a single atomic bomb destroyed our city. Rumor at the time had it that 'Nothing will grow here for 75 years,'"" said mayor Kazumi Matsui.
""And yet, Hiroshima recovered, becoming a symbol of peace."" 
At 8:15 a.m. on Aug 6, 1945, U.S. B-29 warplane Enola Gay dropped a bomb nicknamed ""Little Boy"" and obliterated the city with an estimated population of 350,000, where thousands more died later from injuries and radiation-related illnesses.
On Thursday, as cicadas shrilled in the heavy summer heat and the Peace Bell sounded, the crowd stood to observe a moment of silence at the exact time the bomb exploded.
""When the 1918 flu pandemic attacked a century ago, it took tens of millions of lives and terrorised the world because nations fighting World War I were unable to meet the threat together,"" Matsui added.
""A subsequent upsurge in nationalism led to World War Two and the atomic bombings. We must never allow this painful past to repeat itself. Civil society must reject self-centered nationalism and unite against all threats.""
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attended as usual, but the number of foreign visitors was down. Overall attendance was scaled back to less than a tenth of the usual figure, with chairs spaced far apart and most people wearing masks. 
Matsui urged Japan to ratify a 2017 United Nations pact banning nuclear arms, but Abe avoided any direct reference, saying Japan would ""work as a bridge between nations"" to abolish nuclear weapons.
Keiko Ogura, who was eight when the bomb blast knocked her off her feet, has dedicated her life to working for peace.
""The nuclear danger is spreading around the world, and under that mushroom cloud, no one can escape,"" she told a recent news conference.
The anniversary was a top trending topic on Japanese Twitter as most users offered prayers for world peace, although one drew a parallel with this week's huge blast that killed at least 135 in Beirut, the Lebanese capital.
""I really hadn't been able to imagine it before, but looking at the damage from the Beirut explosion and imagining something several times more powerful, I was struck with a huge sense of fear,"" wrote the commenter, identified as ""Sato-san.""

The bombing of Hiroshima was followed by the bombing of Nagasaki on Aug. 9, instantly killing more than 75,000 people. Japan surrendered six days later, ending World War Two.

1226,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 08:12PM ET</span>",Macron says aid to blast-stricken Lebanon will not go to 'corrupt hands',"By Samia Nakhoul and Ellen Francis
BEIRUT (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday promised aid to Lebanon but reassured angry citizens reeling from a blast that killed 145 people that no blank cheques will be given to its leaders unless they enact reforms and end rife corruption.
Speaking at a news conference at the end of a dramatic visit to Beirut, Macron called for an international inquiry into the devastating explosion that generated a seismic shock felt across the region, saying it was an urgent signal to carry out anti-corruption reforms demanded by a furious population.
Dozens are still missing after Tuesday's explosion at the port that injured 5,000 people and left up to 250,000 without habitable homes, hammering a nation already staggering from economic meltdown and a surge in coronavirus cases.
A security source said the death toll had reached 145, and officials said the figure was likely to rise.
Macron said he proposed to the Lebanese authorities a roadmap of urgent reforms to unlock billions of dollars in funds from the international community, and that he would return to Lebanon in September to follow up. 
""If reforms are not carried out, Lebanon will continue to sink,"" Macron said. ""What is also needed here is political change. This explosion should be the start of a new era.""
He said France will organise an international aid conference for Lebanon, and he promised ""transparent governance"" so the aid goes to the people, NGOs and relief groups and not to the ruling elite which has been accused of corruption and mismanagement.
He told reporters that an audit was needed on the Lebanese central bank, among other urgent changes, and that the World Bank and United Nations would play a role in any Lebanese reforms. Talks with the IMF on a rescue package have stalled over the failure of the government to enact serious reforms.
During his visit Macron met all Lebanese political factions, including the powerful Iranian-backed Hezbollah group which dominates Lebanese politics. He urged Hezbollah to use its influence to press the government to carry out reforms and think of Lebanon's interest rather that Iran's.
Earlier, wearing a black tie in mourning, Macron toured the blast site and Beirut's shattered streets where angry crowds demanded an end to a ""regime"" of Lebanese politicians they blame for dragging Lebanon into disaster.
""I guarantee you, this (reconstruction) aid will not go to corrupt hands,"" Macron told the throngs who greeted him.
""I see the emotion on your face, the sadness, the pain. This is why I'm here,"" he told one group, pledging to deliver ""home truths"" to Lebanon's leaders.
At the French ambassador's residence, where a French general declared the creation of the state of Lebanon exactly 100 years ago, Macron said it was no longer up to France to tell Lebanese leaders what to do, but that he could apply ""pressure"".
In an interview with French news channel BFM, he said if France did not play its part, ""that is of a power that believes in multilateralism and believes in the interests of the Lebanese people, other powers may interfere whether it be Iran, Saudi Arabia or Turkey.""
MELTDOWN
The government's failure to tackle a runaway budget, mounting debt and endemic corruption has prompted Western donors to demand reform. Gulf Arab states who once helped have baulked at bailing out a nation they say is increasingly influenced by their rival Iran and Hezbollah.
At the port, destroyed by Tuesday's giant mushroom cloud and fireball, families sought news of the missing, amid mounting anger at the authorities for allowing huge quantities of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, used in making fertilisers and bombs, to be stored there for years in unsafe conditions.
There was a small but violent protest near an entrance to parliament in central Beirut, where riot police deployed after some demonstrators burned objects and hurled rocks at security forces, footage from local broadcasters showed. 
The government has ordered some port officials be put under house arrest. State news agency NNA said 16 people were taken into custody. A judicial source and local media said Beirut Port General Manager Hassan Koraytem was among them. The central bank said it had decided to freeze the accounts of Koraytem and the head of Lebanese customs along with five others.
""They will scapegoat somebody to defer responsibility,"" said Rabee Azar, a 33-year-old construction worker, speaking near the smashed remains of the port's grain silo, surrounded by other mangled masonry and flattened buildings.
With banks in crisis, a collapsing currency and one of the world's biggest debt burdens, Economy Minister Raoul Nehme said Lebanon had ""very limited"" resources to deal with the disaster, which by some estimates may have cost the nation up to $15 billion.
International offers of medical and other immediate aid have poured in, as officials have said hospitals, some heavily damaged in the blast, do not have enough beds and equipment.
Many Lebanese, who have lost jobs and watched savings evaporate in the financial crisis, say the blast is symptomatic of political cronyism and rampant graft among the ruling elite.
'CROOKS AND LIARS'
""Our leaders are crooks and liars. I don't believe any investigation they will do,"" said Jean Abi Hanna, 80, a retired port worker whose home was damaged and daughter and granddaughter injured in the blast.
An official source familiar with preliminary investigations blamed ""inaction and negligence"" for the blast.
People who felt the explosive force said they had witnessed nothing comparable in years of conflict and upheaval in Beirut, which was devastated by a 1975-1990 civil war and since then has experienced big bomb attacks, unrest and a war with Israel.
""All hell broke loose,"" said Ibrahim Zoobi, who works near the port. ""I saw people thrown five or six metres.""
Seismic tremors from the blast were recorded in Eilat on Israel's Red Sea coast, about 580 km (360 miles) away.

Operations have been paralysed at Beirut port, Lebanon's main route for imports needed to feed a nation of more than 6 million people, forcing ships to divert to smaller ports.

The call came as U.S.-China ties have rapidly deteriorated this year over a range of issues, including Beijing's handling of the coronavirus, telecommunications equipment maker Huawei [HWT.UL], China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its clamp-down on Hong Kong.
""Secretary Esper also communicated the importance that the PRC (People's Republic of China) abide by international laws, rules and norms and meet its international commitments,"" Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman told reporters, adding that the call lasted for an hour and a half. 
A separate Pentagon statement said both sides agreed on ""developing the systems necessary for crisis communications and risk reduction.""
Esper has said previously that he hopes to visit China by the end of the year to improve “crisis-communications” channels and address other areas of mutual interest.
The United States has long opposed China's expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea and has sent warships regularly through the strategic waterway.
""Wei ... urged the U.S. side to stop erroneous words and deeds, improve the management and control of maritime risks, avoid taking dangerous moves that may escalate the situation, and safeguard regional peace and stability,"" China's official Xinhua news agency said.
China on Thursday threatened to take countermeasures over a trip to Taiwan by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, as the Chinese-claimed island country geared up for its highest-level U.S. official visit in four decades.
In June, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Hawaii but a senior U.S. official said that China was not forthcoming in those talks.

Northern Ireland has Britain's only land border with the EU, making it a focal point for complex questions about how a new system of cross-border trade will work when more than 45 years of market integration with mainland Europe ends.
Senior minister Michael Gove will set out the new Trader Support Service during a visit to Northern Ireland on Friday, promising a free end-to-end service to deal with import and safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.
""It is a unique service that will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost,"" Gove said in a statement ahead of the visit.
An additional 155 million pounds will be invested in the technology needed to make it work.
The support scheme is due to start in September and will help traders navigate the paperwork required under the terms of Britain's exit, which mean Northern Ireland is subject to both British and EU customs regulations.
The complex arrangement threatened to derail exit negotiations last year, with Brussels concerned that goods should not flow unchecked into the bloc via Britain. 
Both sides agreed a compromise that avoids the need for a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - something many feared could have threatened the peace deal that ended decades of sectarian violence in the region.

Gove and Northern Ireland Minister Brandon Lewis will also announce 300 million pounds of funding to programmes promoting peace and reconciliation.

The plight of Kyoto and other cities in the western Kansai region has exposed the vulnerability of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's strategy that sought to revive local economies with an influx of foreign tourists – among key pillars of his ""Abenomics"" stimulus policy.
Abe's administration set a target to lure 40 million overseas visitors per year and encouraged regional cities to open new ports, increase international flights and approve new hotel construction to accommodate the influx.
Cities such as Kyoto and nearby Osaka - whose manufacturers were being hit by intensifying competition with China - became reliant on tourists, making them victims of their own success.
Since the launch of Abenomics in late 2012, the number of overseas visitors rose steadily to exceed 30 million last year, triple the level in 2013.
Over 2.7 million visited Japan in January but as the country closed its borders to contain the virus, the flow trickled to a meagre 2,600 in June.
HOTELS HIT
Hardest hit are the hotels, which are suffering not just from a plunge in overseas visitors but shrinking domestic business travel as more companies shift to online meetings.
""The hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops expanded business, perhaps too much, since inbound tourism was bringing in so much money,"" said Nobuhiro Doi, president of major regional lender Bank of Kyoto.
Kyoto is now short of parking lots because many of them have been replaced with hotels during a construction boom in the past few years.
The city now has 664 hotels, up 25% from five years ago. The number of smaller guest houses spiked by nearly five-fold to 3,299, according to the city.
""We'll probably see more hotels go under,"" said Doi. ""Things will never be the same.""
Things are no better in nearby Osaka, a popular destination for its food culture and imposing castle.
The evaporation of tourism demand hit when the city's hotel supply was already in excess with available rooms surging to 90,000 this year, up 80% from five years ago.
Hotel Nikko Osaka, among the city's biggest luxury hotels, saw less than 20% of its rooms filled on average in July, down from over 90% before COVID-19 hit.
""I've never seen anything this bad and can't see how all these hotels in the area can survive,"" Hiroaki Gofuku, president of Hotel Nikko Osaka, told Reuters, adding his hotel was bleeding losses since the virus struck.
""There will be more bankruptcies and job losses. Things won't get better for another two to three years.""
Osaka already saw 147 companies go under in June, exceeding Tokyo as the hardest hit area in Japan, with roughly another 100 likely to have followed in July, think tank Tokyo Shoko Research said.
Top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga conceded Japan's tourism industry had been hit hard, but said a $16 billion campaign launched in July to encourage domestic travel will help offset some of the pain.
""Local tourist destinations are in an extremely severe state,"" Suga told reporters last month. ""By helping tourist and retail industries, we hope the campaign will pull companies out from their plight."" 
Yoshihiko Nitta, a researcher at Tokyo Shoko Research's Kansai branch, said government safety nets were keeping many companies alive. 
""But things may change from around September, when immediate loans they took start to expire,"" he said. ""If there's a huge second wave of infections, more businesses could go under including some of the big firms.""

In a visit to a county in North Hwanghae Province that borders South Korea, leader Kim “clarified tasks” for the recovery work as he inspected the damage, KCNA said. 
Consecutive days of torrential rains inundated over 730 single-story houses and a vast rice field in Taechong-ri of Unpha County, northwest of the capital Pyongyang, with 179 houses destroyed, KCNA said.
KCNA did not give more specific reports of overall damages throughout North Korea. There were no casualties in the county.
“It is of priority importance to quickly supply sleeping materials, daily commodities, medicines and other necessities to the flood-affected people to stabilize their living as early as possible,"" Kim said in a statement carried by KCNA.
Kim also decided to urgently mobilize the army for the rehabilitation work “to give precedence to the arrangement of the wrecked houses, roads and the zones with the people of the county.”
This year's heavy rains come during the summer harvest season, raising concerns about food security as the rain appears to be hitting some of the major rice-growing areas of North Korea.
Citing unidentified South Korean government officials, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said North Korea opened the floodgates of a border dam on Monday without advance notice to its neighbor.
South Korea on Thursday approved plans to donate $10 million to help fund the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) efforts to aid North Korean children and women. 

Parts of South Korea have seen over 40 consecutive days of rain, the longest monsoon since 2013, and continued precipitation across the Korean peninsula threatens to bring new floods and landslides.

1231,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 06:55PM ET</span>",U.S. Iran envoy Brian Hook stepping down as key U.N. arms embargo vote looms,"By Humeyra Pamuk and Michelle Nichols
(Reuters) - The top U.S. envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, is leaving his post and U.S. special representative for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, will add Iran to his role ""following a transition period"" with Hook, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday.
Hook's surprise departure comes at a critical time when Washington has been intensely lobbying at the United Nations to extend an arms embargo on Iran and as the U.N. Security Council prepares to hold a vote on the U.S. resolution next week.
""We're going to continue to make the case for this,"" Hook told reporters on Thursday morning, hours before his departure was announced. ""We hope that the council can find a way.""
A senior administration official said the transition would take a couple of weeks and Abrams was expected to retain both the Iran and Venezuela roles for the remainder of President Donald Trump's term. 
Pompeo did not give a reason for the change but wrote in a tweet that Hook was moving on to the private sector. He described him as a ""trusted adviser and a good friend"" who had achieved ""historic results"" in countering Tehran and securing the release of U.S. citizens detained by Iran.
Hook, 52, was appointed to the top Iran role at the State Department in late 2018 and has been instrumental in Washington's intensifying pressure campaign on Tehran after Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers.
Opponents criticized Hook and the administration for overly harsh and indiscriminate sanctions, which they said were hurting ordinary Iranians and failing to change the behavior of the Iranian government.
Hook's departure ""does not concern us and is not something we consider as a game-changer,"" Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York, told Reuters. 
""The so-called 'maximum pressure' campaign waged by the U.S. government has failed,"" he said. ""Iran is not on its knees, and will not do so regardless of who is in charge of implementing this bankrupt policy.""
The U.S. bid at the Security Council to extend the arms embargo is a key test that some diplomats say will likely fail as it lacks the necessary support, and veto powers Russia and China have already signaled their opposition. 
If the United States is unsuccessful in its bid, it has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions under a process known as snapback. Some diplomats have suggested Washington will likely start the snapback process, which could take up to 30 days, by the end of August.
Abrams, 72, a Republican foreign policy veteran, was named U.S. special representative for Venezuela in January 2019 and has led a hard-line approach aimed at ousting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. 
U.S. officials have said privately that Trump has been frustrated by the failure to remove Maduro, who retains the support of the Venezuelan military, as well as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran.

Abrams has recently been dealing with U.S. concerns about a growing alliance between Iran and Venezuela, both OPEC members under heavy U.S. sanctions. Iran in recent months has sent fuel tankers to gasoline-short Venezuela, drawing U.S. ire.

LE HAVRE, France (Reuters) - A gunman who took six people hostage in a bank in northern France on Thursday surrendered to elite police after a six-hour operation to free his captives.
The hostage-taker, a 34-year-old with a history of mental illness, emerged slowly from the building wearing a balaclava and with his hands turned palms-up, before officers with their weapons raised moved in and handcuffed him. 
All the hostages were unharmed, though in shock, said Denis Jacob of the Alternative police trade union.
Bomb squad officers acted after the man told officers there were explosives in a bag. He had been armed with a handgun, a national police representative told Reuters. 
The man initially took six people hostage. Five were subsequently released and the sixth taken to safety after the man was arrested, according to Jacob.
The hostage-taker was believed to have Islamist sympathies, two police union officials said, but there was no official confirmation of this. 
Militant attacks have shaken France in recent years, with four police officers killed in an October 2019 knife rampage in Paris and 130 people killed by coordinated bombings and shootings in the capital in November 2015.
Yves Lefebvre, head of another police union, SGP Unite, said the hostage-taker in Le Havre, a town of around 170,000 people on the English Channel, was known to law enforcement authorities and on a security service watch list. 
""We know that he has been radicalised and suffers a serious psychiatric illness,"" he said.
Another source, a senior police official, said that during the incident the man spoke in support of the Palestinian cause. He walked out of the bank with what appeared to be a green-coloured flag draped around his shoulders.
Police had cordoned off the area around the bank on Boulevard de Strasbourg, a wide thoroughfare in the centre of Le Havre.
An employee at a Burger King outlet about 100 metres from the bank said police had told them to lock an entrance on the same street as the hostage-taking but not ordered them to shut. 
When the fifth hostage was freed, a man in a pink shirt could be seen in Reuters television footage being led away from the bank by a police officer in full protective gear.
""Very proud and grateful,"" former prime minister Edouard Philippe, now Le Havre's mayor, wrote on Twitter in praise of the police. 

The hostages were seized in a branch of Bred bank, a mid-sized lender, on the ground floor of a six-storey residential building.

Saad al-Jabri was a long-time aide to Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. The crown prince - known as MbS - ousted Nayef as heir to the throne in a 2017 palace coup that left him the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally.
People with knowledge of the situation told Reuters earlier this year that Jabri has access to documents containing sensitive information that MbS fears could be compromising.
In a 107-page lawsuit against MbS and 24 others filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, Jabri said the crown prince ""dispatched a hit squad"" to Canada in October 2018.
""(A) team of Saudi nationals traveled across the Atlantic Ocean from Saudi Arabia ... with the intention of killing Dr. Saad,"" said the lawsuit, which seeks punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial. 
The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. The Saudi embassy in Ottawa was not immediately available for comment.
The ""hit squad"" was comprised of members of a group close to MbS called the Tiger Squad, and they carried two bags of forensic tools and included someone who knew how to clean up crime scenes, according to the lawsuit.
The men ""attempted to enter Canada covertly, traveling on tourist visas"" and pretending not to know each other. Suspicious border agents found a photo showing several of the men together, ""revealing their lie and thwarting their mission,"" it said.
The alleged incident took place less than two weeks after Saudi agents murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate. Turkish sources told Reuters a bone saw was used to dismember the journalist.
MbS came under international criticism over Khashoggi's killing, which U.S. government sources say the Central Intelligence Agency believes MbS approved and may have ordered.
The crown prince has denied ordered Khashoggi's killing but said he ultimately bears ""full responsibility"" as the kingdom's de facto leader.
Jabri's family says MbS has detained two of his adult children and his brother to try to force his return.
Jabri, who described himself as a long-time ally of U.S. intelligence services, said he filed the suit in the United States in part because the alleged plot against him ""involved substantial conduct inside the United States"".
Canadian Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said he could not comment on allegations before the courts.
""We are aware of incidents in which foreign actors have attempted to monitor, intimidate or threaten Canadians and those living in Canada. It is completely unacceptable,"" Blair said in a statement sent to Reuters.
Canada's relations with Saudi Arabia have been poor since August 2018, when Ottawa criticized Riyadh over human rights.

Ouattara, who has governed since 2011, said in March he would not run again. But his preferred successor, then-prime minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, died in July, leading the party to ask Ouattara to reconsider.
""I have decided to respond favourably to the call of my fellow citizens,"" Ouattara said in a televised speech. ""Given my previous promise, this decision represents a real sacrifice for me.""
The election is seen as the greatest test yet of the tenuous stability achieved since a brief civil war in 2010 and 2011 killed about 3,000 people following Ouattara's first election win. 

Ouattara's opponents say the two-term limit in the constitution bars him from running again, but Ouattara has said his first two mandates do not count under the new constitution adopted in 2016.

Then he heard the explosion.
Grabbing his camera, Azakir rushed out into the streets, trying to locate the source of the blast.
When he reached the port, he realized he was close. Dead bodies lay everywhere, and people were screaming.
Azakir saw one man, pinned under a vehicle, covered in a thick film of rubble and blood. At first, Azakir thought the man was dead. But then the man opened his eyes and began waving his arms and asking for help.
Azakir called over some rescuers who were nearby. In a series of dramatic photographs, he recorded the rescue of the man, while also helping the rescuers move the car to free him. He took pictures of the man being transferred to a stretcher and taken away, black smoke still billowing from wrecked silos in the background.
Azakir was told by the rescuers that the man was being taken to a hospital. Reuters has not been able to ascertain the identity of the man or to which hospital he was taken.
Beirut's deadliest peace-time explosion was caused after ammonium nitrate being stored near the port ignited. The blast on Tuesday killed at least 145 people, injured 5,000, and left a quarter of a million homeless.
""It was like a horror movie filmed in a devastated city,"" said Azakir, who has covered Lebanon since 1981.

MINSK (Reuters) - Thousands of opposition supporters clapped, cheered and chanted at a rally in Minsk on Thursday evening, defying a crackdown by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko's government ahead of a presidential election this weekend.
Lukashenko, a 65-year-old former Soviet collective farm manager, is facing the biggest challenge in years to his rule and accuses protesters of being in cahoots with foreign backers to destabilise the country. 
Protests have swelled in support of his main challenger Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, a former English teacher who launched her bid after her husband, who planned to run, was jailed.
Her campaign was forbidden from staging a planned rally on Thursday evening, so her supporters gathered at a government-sanctioned outdoor concert at a separate venue. 
Riot police arrested DJs after they played a song called ""Changes"" favoured by the opposition. 
""This is an amazing atmosphere, amazing people, I want to be with them. And I want changes,"" said Irina, a 47-year-old teacher who gave only her first name. 
Lukashenko earlier announced that a number of U.S. nationals had been detained but did not say when or why. 
Belarus has sought to mend fences with Washington as ties fray with traditional ally Moscow, and in February hosted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the most senior U.S. official to visit in more than two decades. 
""Some people were detained with American passports, married to Americans, working in the State Department,"" the Belta news agency quoted Lukashenko as saying.
The U.S. embassy in the capital Minsk did not reply to a request for comment.
Belarus and Russia also traded barbs again over a group of suspected Russian mercenaries who were detained in Belarus in July and accused of plotting to foment unrest. 
Russia has said the men were employees of a private security firm and were passing through Belarus on their way to Latin America. Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman said the men should be returned to Russia. 
Lukashenko said they had broken the law.

""A hybrid war is going on against Belarus and we should expect dirty tricks from any side,"" he said.

(Reuters) - New York state's attorney general sued to dissolve the National Rifle Association on Thursday, alleging senior leaders of the non-profit group diverted millions of dollars for personal use and to buy the silence and loyalty of former employees.
The lawsuit filed in a Manhattan court by Attorney General Letitia James alleges NRA leaders paid for family trips to the Bahamas, private jets and expensive meals that contributed to a $64 million reduction in the NRA's balance sheet in three years, turning a surplus into a deficit.
The NRA responded by suing James in federal court, saying she had violated the NRA's right to free speech and seeking to block her investigation.
James alleged in a statement that NRA leaders ""used millions upon millions from NRA reserves for personal use,"" failing to comply with the NRA's own internal policies in addition to state and federal law.
She told reporters the NRA ""has operated as a breeding ground for greed, abuse and brazen illegality,"" adding that ""no one is above the law."" 
The lawsuit names the NRA and four leaders including Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice-president who has been atop the leadership for nearly three decades.
The confrontation pits James, a Democrat, against the largest and most powerful gun organization in the United States, one closely aligned with President Donald Trump's Republican Party.
The actions are certain to further polarize a country where the NRA is revered by conservatives as a champion of the U.S. Constitution and its Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms while at the same time it is vilified by liberals as an enabler of rampant gun violence.
Trump sought to make it an issue for his re-election on Nov. 3 against Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
""Just like Radical Left New York is trying to destroy the NRA, if Biden becomes President your GREAT SECOND AMENDMENT doesn't have a chance,"" Trump said on Twitter. ""Your guns will be taken away, immediately and without notice. No police, no guns!""
Biden has not called for confiscating guns. He has said he would seek to ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, let people who own assault weapons sell them back voluntarily, and expand background checks.
'POWER GRAB'
The NRA branded the lawsuit a ""baseless, premeditated attack"" and a ""power grab"" tied to the campaign.
""We not only will not shrink from this fight – we will confront it and prevail,"" NRA President Carolyn Meadows said in a statement.
Apparently expecting James' suit, the NRA fought back with the suit of its own in the Northern District of New York, saying James had been targeting the NRA politically ever since she ran for attorney general in 2018, vowing to take on the NRA which she called a ""criminal enterprise.""
The NRA is subject to New York law because it is registered there as a non-profit. Its physical headquarters are in Fairfax, Virginia, near Washington, D.C.
James' suit coincided with another one filed against the NRA and its foundation by the attorney general for Washington, D.C., in the district's Superior Court, alleging the misuse of charitable funds and wasteful spending.
Briefing reporters, James denied the New York suit was motivated by the NRA's support for Trump. Her written statement said the NRA's power had gone unchecked for decades, ""which is why, today, we seek to dissolve the NRA.""
Gun control groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action, both funded by billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, praised the suit.
""We have been warning regulators and the public about this corruption for years,"" Everytown said on Twitter.

Moms Demand Action sarcastically offered that ""our thoughts and prayers are with Wayne LaPierre and his cronies at the NRA,"" mocking the common refrain used following mass shootings.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Arsonists burned more than a dozen trucks late on Wednesday during an attack on a factory in Chile´s Araucania, authorities said, in a region long convulsed by simmering conflict between the indigenous Mapuche and the Chilean government.
Local police said at least 14 trucks had been burned, as well as some heavy machinery. A group that says it fights for indigenous rights, Weichan Auka Mapu, claimed credit for the attack, Hector Bravo of Chile´s investigative police told reporters.
Images on local television showed flames engulfing the vehicles and enormous plumes of smoke as emergency workers sought to control the fire.
About 1.7 million Mapuche live in Chile, mainly in Araucania, a rugged, forested zone of snow-capped volcanoes 400 miles south of the nation’s capital city of Santiago. The region has a relatively high poverty rate.
Indigenous activists say their lands are increasingly threatened by agriculture, forestry and other industries, and blame the state for failing to uphold their historical rights.
The conflict in the Araucania region has spiked in recent weeks, aggravated by increasing economic angst caused by lockdown measures designed to stem the spread of coronavirus. 
Interior Minister Victor Perez said the group was clearly well organized and that the attack was pre-meditated.
""There is no doubt that a group that organizes an attack like this ... has resources,"" Perez told reporters.
Last weekend, around 50 people were arrested, authorities said, after clashes and fires broke out near the region's municipal headquarters. Mapuche protesters had been demonstrating in support of community members who have been incarcerated and on hunger strike.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>",Arrest of Colombia's Uribe will not curb his power but has focused party on reform,"By Julia Symmes Cobb
BOGOTA (Reuters) - The house arrest of former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe in a witness tampering case is unlikely to dim his influence, but has focused his party on justice reform proposals they say will bring more consistency to the judicial process, according to politicians and analysts.
Uribe, perhaps the country's most divisive politician, was placed under detention by the Supreme Court in a unanimous Tuesday decision that cited potential for obstruction of justice.
The ex-president, who now serves as a senator, has repeatedly declared his innocence amid accusations his allies undertook witness tampering in an attempt to discredit allegations that Uribe had ties to right-wing paramilitaries.
It is the first time ever a Colombian court has detained a former president. Uribe supporters say the case is a set-up and that the high courts are biased against him.
Kingmaker Uribe has shepherded two successors to power since the end of his second term in 2010, including current President Ivan Duque. Uribe also founded his own political party, the Democratic Center, which now holds more than 50 seats out of 280 in Colombia's bicameral legislature.
The court has so far not barred Uribe from his congressional seat and he is still his party's guiding light, said Democratic Center senator Santiago Valencia.
""He remains our leader,"" Valencia told Reuters in a video interview. ""Of course it's a hard hit for the party.""
Uribe's detention will laser focus the party on a judicial reform already under initial discussion in Congress, said political analyst Sergio Guzman of Colombia Risk Analysis. The proposal seeks to consolidate the high courts into one and give courts budgetary autonomy, among other things.
That could be to the detriment of other government plans - from labor to tax reform, Guzman said.
Duque and other Uribe allies have said his house arrest is unfair, comparing it to former rebel leaders who have been allowed to remain free by another court while their war crimes proceedings move ahead. The guerrillas received special terms under a peace deal reviled by Uribe.
The party argues the courts' approach is inconsistent, and believes the proposed reform would reduce such inconsistencies.
The Democratic Center is using Uribe's detention as a ""pretext"" to push the judicial reform and to begin campaigning for the 2022 elections even amid the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout, said leftist senator Jorge Robledo.
""It is the completely wrong moment (for a justice reform),"" Robledo said. ""What will citizens who are dying of hunger, who are sick, whose children don't have education, who don't have anything with which to pay rent think when they see the Democratic Center looking to win elections?"" 
Senator Valencia said the justice reform push had been inspired not only by the ex-president's case but by corruption allegations and long case delays. The bulk of the government's reform agenda should not change, he added.
Duque has been grappling with low approval ratings and congressional resistance for much of his term, which ends in 2022. He has vociferously defended Uribe, saying he is a man of honor who should be allowed to defend himself while free.
""We were seeing that COVID and COVID recovery were going to greatly determine President Duque's legacy, and how he would be seen by Colombians and by history,"" Guzman said. ""I think now President Duque's legacy is much more tied to how Uribe fares judicially than any other thing.""
The president's defense of Uribe ""is yet another stain on the legacy of Ivan Duque,"" Robledo said.
Uribe faces a prison term of up to 12 years. A conviction would put him in the ranks of other former Latin American presidents who have served time, including Brazil's Lula da Silva and Peru's Alberto Fujimori.
Uribe is best known for mounting an aggressive offensive against Marxist guerrillas during his tenure. He and his family have long been accused of links to right-wing paramilitaries, and his brother Santiago is facing a paramilitary-related murder charge, which he denies.
Uribe's opponents hailed the court's decision as a long-awaited victory for judicial independence and celebrated with gatherings and on social media. But they many not want to count their chickens just yet.
The case does not mark the beginning of the end of Uribe as a towering political figure, Guzman said.
""Uribe has many lives.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile on Thursday said it favors postponing the election of a new Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) president to avoid ""tensions"" following the selection of the first-ever U.S. candidate.
The current favorite to win is U.S. President Donald Trump's pick and adviser, Mauricio Claver-Carone, known for his tough stance on Venezuela and Cuba.
Claver-Carone would be the first person from outside Latin America to lead the Washington-based IDB, a smaller cousin of the IMF that has been led by Latin Americans since its founding in 1959.
Foreign Minister Andrés Allamand, speaking before lawmakers, said Chile, currently led by center-right President Sebastian Pinera, considers ""there is a tradition to preserve"" with respect to choosing a Latin American president for the institution.
""We must avoid tensions from external factors ... so that [the bank] can turn all its energy to the reactivation of the region,"" Allamand said.
The IDB declined to comment on his statement.
Allamand added that the IDB has always preferred a Latin American president and a vice president from the United States, and he said he saw no reason to change.
His comments were the latest from a regional government official voicing concern over Claver-Carone's candidacy.
""We're glad that countries in the region and in other continents are raising their voice with what we believe it is an unusual situation that goes against the spirit of the balances in the international credit organizations,"" said an official from Argentina, which has its own candidate.
In a July 30 letter, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also called for a postponement.
The vote, scheduled for Sept. 12, reflects a wider geopolitical struggle in Latin America. Long seen dependent on the United States and firmly within its sphere of influence, the region has been pulled closer into the orbit of Beijing in recent years.
China is the main consumer of Latin America's commodities and an increasingly active lender to the region.

CHASIV YAR, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine expects to exchange around 100 prisoners on each side with Russian-backed separatists within weeks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's chief of staff told Reuters on Thursday on a visit to eastern Ukraine. 
Ukraine has pushed prisoner exchanges in a series of confidence-building measures to break the deadlock over a conflict in the eastern Donbass region that has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014.
The swap would be second this year and the fourth since Zelenskiy became president in 2019.
Andriy Yermak, the head of the president's office and a key Ukrainian negotiator, told Reuters that Kyiv had submitted a list of about 100 people to mediators at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). 
He said the separatists submitted around the same number. While there was no date for the exchange, he said ""I hope that it will be soon. I think it's within weeks.""
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Moscow's annexation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014 and support for fighters in the Donbass. 
Major combat ended with a ceasefire agreed in the Belarus capital Minsk in 2015, but sporadic clashes still regularly kill civilians, Ukrainian soldiers and separatists. 
The latest attempt to get the ceasefire to stick in July broke down within hours. 
But on Thursday, OSCE monitors recorded no ceasefire violations within a daily reporting period for the first time since they began systematically collecting such data, an OSCE statement said.
Yermak was accompanying Zelenskiy on a visit to the frontline where he met soldiers and civilians in the area.
He also said Ukraine and the separatists would agree at least three new areas of troop disengagement in selected hotspots - another confidence-building measure pushed under Zelenskiy's presidency.
""Today we are very close to agreeing on three and maybe five new sections,"" he said. 
Zelenskiy also pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin to release prisoners during a recent bilateral phone call. 

""It was agreed that a list would be provided, it has already been handed over - these are mainly Crimean Tatars who are illegally detained in Crimea. We are waiting for an answer,"" he said.

The perilous sea passage from West Africa to the Canary Islands was once a major route for migrants seeking jobs and a better life in Europe. Attempts became scarcer when Spain stepped up patrols in the mid-2000s, but the route is seeing a fresh surge. 
""New shipwreck off the coast of Nouadhibou #Mauritania of approximately 40 persons on board, there is one survivor (from Guinea),"" tweeted UNHCR special envoy Vincent Cochetel.
UNHCR ""along with authorities & partners are trying to step up efforts to prevent such tragedies, but traffickers keep lying to their clients,"" he said.
The boat was carrying migrants and refugees, a UNHCR spokesman confirmed.
Nearly 2,800 illegal migrants arrived by boat in the Canary Islands between Jan. 1 and July 14, Spanish Interior Ministry data show, five times as many as in the same period in 2019.
Late last year, at least 62 people drowned off the Mauritanian coast and around 80 had to swim for shore after the boat carrying them northwards from Gambia sank - one of the deadliest incidents along the route in recent years.

As part of the Denmark's gradual reopening following a lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the government had planned to raise the limit on public gatherings to 200 people on August 8, up from the current limit of 100 people.
""It is crucial that we maintain the good position Denmark is in, where we have the epidemic under control,"" health minister Magnus Heunicke said. 
The Nordic country's authority on infectious diseases, Statens Serum Institut, would not recommend lifting the limit, the ministry said, as any easing of public gatherings would increase infection risk. 
On Tuesday, Denmark's state epidemiologist had advised against going through with the planned fourth reopening phase, which includes allowing music venues and night clubs to reopen, due to the current infection pressure. 
In a response, health minister Heunicke said the government would not propose any moves, which were not responsible from a healthcare perspective. 
""If that is the authorities' recommendation, then we will not do it,"" Heunicke told public broadcaster DR on Tuesday.
The government and parliament are due to discuss the fourth phase of reopening on Aug. 12.
Denmark, which has had daily increases in COVID-19 cases in the past two weeks, was one of the first countries in Europe to gradually lift lockdown restrictions in April after seeing infection rates decline steadily.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 01:56PM ET</span>",Beirut's accidental cargo: how an unscheduled port visit led to disaster,"By Maria Vasilyeva
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The chemicals that went up in flames in Beirut's deadliest peace-time explosion arrived in the Lebanese capital seven years ago on a leaky Russian-leased cargo ship that, according to its captain, should never have stopped there.
""They were being greedy,"" said Boris Prokoshev, who was captain of the Rhosus in 2013 when he says the owner told him to make an unscheduled stop in Lebanon to pick up extra cargo.
Prokoshev said the ship was carrying 2,750 tonnes of a highly combustible chemical from Georgia to Mozambique when the order came to divert to Beirut on its way through the Mediterranean.
The crew were asked to load some heavy road equipment and take it to Jordan's Port of Aqaba before resuming their journey onto Africa, where the ammonium nitrate was to be delivered to an explosives manufacturer.
But the ship was never to leave Beirut, having tried and failed to safely load the additional cargo before becoming embroiled in a lengthy legal dispute over port fees.
""It was impossible,"" Prokoshev, 70, told Reuters of the operation to try and load the extra cargo. ""It could have ruined the whole ship and I said no,"" he said by 'phone from his home in the Russian resort town of Sochi on the Black Sea coast.
The captain and lawyers acting for some creditors accused the ship's owner of abandoning the vessel and succeeded in having it arrested. Months later, for safety reasons, the ammonium nitrate was unloaded and put in a dock warehouse.
On Tuesday, that stockpile caught fire and exploded not far from a built-up residential area of the city. The huge blast killed 145 people, injured 5,000, flattened buildings and made more than a quarter of a million people homeless.
The ship might have succeeded in leaving Beirut, had it managed to load the additional cargo.
The crew had stacked the equipment, including excavators and road-rollers, on top of the doors to the cargo hold which held the ammonium nitrate below, according to the ship's Ukrainian boatswain, Boris Musinchak. But the hold doors buckled.
""The ship was old and the cover of the hold bent,"" Musinchak said by 'phone. ""We decided not to take risks.""
The captain and three crew spent 11 months on the ship while the legal dispute dragged on, without wages and with only limited supplies of food. Once they left, the ammonium nitrate was unloaded.
""The cargo was highly explosive. That's why it was kept on board when we were there ... That ammonium nitrate had a very high concentration,"" Prokoshev said.
BOUND FOR MOZAMBIQUE
Prokoshev identified the ship's owner as Russian businessman Igor Grechushkin. Attempts to contact Grechushkin were unsuccessful.
Cypriot police questioned Grechushkin at his home in Cyprus on Thursday, a security source said. A Cyprus police spokesman said an individual, whom he did not name, had been questioned at the request of Interpol Beirut in relation to the cargo.
The ammonium nitrate was sold by Georgian fertiliser maker Rustavi Azot LLC, and was to be delivered to a Mozambique explosives maker, Fabrica de Explosivos.
A senior representative for Fabrica de Explosivos did not immediately respond when sent a request for comment on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
Levan Burdiladze, the Rustavi Azot plant director, told Reuters that his company had only operated the chemical factory for the last three years and so he could not confirm whether the ammonium nitrate was produced there.
He called the decision to store the material in Beirut port a ""gross violation of safe storage measures, considering that ammonium nitrate loses its useful properties in six months.""
Initial Lebanese investigations into what happened have pointed to inaction and negligence in the handling of the potentially dangerous chemical.
Lebanon's cabinet on Wednesday agreed to place all Beirut port officials who have overseen storage and security since 2014 under house arrest, ministerial sources said.
The head of Beirut port and the head of customs said that several letters were sent to the judiciary asking for the material be removed, but no action was taken.
Reuters could not immediately reach Lebanon's justice minister for comment. The Justice Ministry is closed for three days of national mourning.
According to Prokoshev, the ship had been leaking but was seaworthy when it sailed into Beirut in September 2013. However, he said Lebanese authorities paid little attention to the ammonium nitrate, which had been stacked in the hull in large sacks.
""I feel sorry for the people (killed or injured in the blast). But local authorities, the Lebanese, should be punished. They did not care about the cargo at all,"" he said.

The abandoned Rhosus sank where she was moored in Beirut harbour, according to a May, 2018 email from a lawyer to Prokoshev, which said it had gone down ""recently"".

Reuters broke the news in June that President Donald Trump's administration planned to reinterpret the Missile Technology Control Regime, a Cold Wars arms agreement between 35 nations, with the goal of allowing U.S. defense contractors to sell more drones to an array of nations.
Republican Senator Mike Lee, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, are introducing the measure, the aide said.
U.S. lawmakers have tried before to rein in Trump administration plans for arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia for use in the war in Yemen. The measures have passed with bipartisan support, but failed to get enough Republican support to override Trump's vetoes.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Economic recovery around the world could come faster if any COVID-19 vaccine is made available to all as a public good, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday.
He was speaking in an online panel discussion with members of the Aspen Security Forum in the United States moderated by the NBC network.
""Sharing vaccines or sharing other tools actually helps the world to recover together. The economic recovery can be faster and the damage from COVID-19 could be less,"" Tedros said.
""Vaccine nationalism is not good, it will not help us,"" he said in an allusion to the competitive scramble of nations and pharmaceutical researchers to come up with an effective vaccine and order as many doses as possible in advance.
Tedros had said on Monday that while the coronavirus was the biggest health emergency since the early 20th century, the international race for a vaccine was also ""unprecedented"".
""We must seize this moment to come together in national unity and global solidarity to control COVID-19,"" he told Thursday's forum. ""No country will be safe until we are all safe.""
WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan, asked about a proposed Russian vaccine, told the panel that trial data was needed to ensure any vaccines are safe and effective.
Ryan also said authorities should be able to demonstrate the efficacy of a coronavirus vaccine via traditional clinical trials rather than ""human challenge"" studies. 
He was referring to the intentional exposure of vaccinated volunteers to a virus to see whether the vaccine works.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday it was possible the United States would have a coronavirus vaccine before the Nov. 3 election - a more optimistic forecast than timing put forth by his own White House health experts.
Trump has accused the WHO of becoming a puppet for China - where the coronavirus outbreak first surfaced late last year - during the COVID-19 pandemic and given notice that the United States will quit the agency in a year's time.
The United States is the biggest overall donor to the WHO and had contributed more than $800 million by the end of 2019 for the 2018-19 biennial funding period. 
But Tedros, who has denied that the WHO answers to China or any other country, told the panel that the main damage from the Trump administration's move to exit the Geneva-based agency would not be the loss of funding.
""The problem is not about the money, it's not the financing..., it's actually the relationship with the U.S. That is more important for the WHO - the void, not the financial. And we hope then U.S. will reconsider its position,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A German man whom investigators suspect of murdering British toddler Madeleine McCann can be extradited to Germany on a separate rape charge after German authorities received the go-ahead from Italy for the extradition, an adviser to Europe's top court said on Thursday.
Christian B, who lived in the Algarve region of Portugal when 3-year-old Madeleine vanished from her bedroom in 2007, had challenged the validity of the European arrest warrant issued by Germany because it cited a drugs conviction but not the 2005 rape charge.
His appeal came even though Germany had in 2018 obtained Italy's agreement for his extradition to be prosecuted and tried for rape and extortion.
The 43-year-old German was extradited to Germany from Italy under the warrant in 2018 and subsequently convicted and sentenced for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in December 2019. 
A German court later sought guidance from the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
CJEU Advocate General Michal Bobek affirmed the procedures for extraditions.
German authorities are required to get the consent of the Italian authorities for the rape charge so that the former can carry out their proceedings lawfully, he said in a non-binding opinion.
The Court, which will rule in the coming months, follows such non-binding recommendations in four out of five cases.
Christian B is currently serving a sentence for drug dealing in the prison in Kiel in the north of Germany but could be freed any day now as he has already served two-thirds of his sentence.
Under German law, police have not released the suspect's surname and media in Germany are not permitted to report it, although it has appeared in some British outlets.

The measure will take effect from Monday, and people returning to Austria will be required to present a negative test for COVID-19, the ministry said.
Austria's measures are the latest blow to Spain's tourism-dependent economy after Britain, Germany and Switzerland recently warned their citizens against summer holidays on Spanish beaches or at least in certain regions of the country.
The spread of the disease in Spain slowed after the government imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. However, new cases have started rising again and hit a post-lockdown record of 1,772 new cases on Wednesday.
Austria has weathered the coronavirus crisis quite well so far but also saw infections increase with the summer holiday season. 
The state of 8.9 million has reported 21,689 COVID-19 cases and 719 deaths as of Thursday. It counted 148 new cases on Wednesday, the highest increase since July 30.
Austria already imposed tight testing requirements for arrivals from the Balkans after it saw an increase in infections among people returning from the region. 

It has travel warnings for Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia in place, as well as for European Union member states Bulgaria and Romania.

The MPs, from Poland's ""Left"" grouping, wore rainbow masks and outfits in shades of the rainbow, sitting in rows, as Duda was sworn in on Thursday in the lower house of parliament, the Sejm. They also posed in and outside parliament with rainbow and white and red Polish flags. 
""We wanted to remind President Andrzej Duda that ... in the constitution there is a guarantee of equality for all,"" Left MP Anna Maria Zukowska said. 
""We don't want a similar situation during his next term as there was during his campaign, when the president dehumanized LGBT people by denying them the right to be people.""
PiS has argued that LGBT rights are part of an invasive foreign ideology that undermines Polish values and the traditional family.

MADRID (Reuters) - Frustrated Spaniards are demanding to know the whereabouts of former king Juan Carlos after he abruptly left the country amid a cloud of scandal.
With no word from officials on where he is, the 82-year old's dramatic exit, announced on Monday, has triggered an international guessing game, but also anger at home at the mystery. 
""They should come clean, they should say where he is,"" said Jorge Llubero, an 18-year-old student in Madrid. ""There shouldn't be so much secrecy.""
Spanish media have reported the ex-king, who abdicated in favour of his son Felipe in 2014, may have left the country as early as Sunday.
Some say he is now in the Dominican Republic and others have placed him in Portugal, where he spent much of his youth. But officials in both countries have said they have no knowledge of him arriving.
""We should be more aware of his situation, I think it's pretty serious,"" said Madrid tour guide Gabriel Alonso.
Juan Carlos said he was leaving Spain so that his son's reign wouldn't be troubled by his personal affairs.
In June, Spain's Supreme Court opened a preliminary probe into Juan Carlos' involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia, after Switzerland's La Tribune de Geneve newspaper reported he had received $100 million from the late Saudi king over a multi-billion high-speed rail contract. Switzerland has also opened a probe.
A steady drip feed of leaks followed, with Spain's El Confidencial news site publishing documents that appeared to show regular cash withdrawals of hundreds of thousands of euros from a Swiss account signed by Juan Carlos.
The former monarch is not formally under investigation and through his lawyer has repeatedly declined to comment on the allegatons. His lawyer, the royal palace and the government have all declined to say where he is.
""It goes against the goal of calming the situation,"" Ignacio Jurado, a political science professor at Madrid's Carlos III University, said of the secrecy.
""Probably the king (Felipe) would have liked to handle it another way but out of respect for his father he wanted to let him have the final say,"" said Jurado, suggesting the secrecy was likely the result of internal palace dynamics. 

Juan Carlos came to the throne in 1975 after the death of General Francisco Franco and was widely respected for his role in helping guide Spain from dictatorship to democracy. But his popularity sank in later years.

Lim, a senior opposition leader, will be charged in court on Friday, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission said in a statement, although it did not immediately comment on the arrest.
His arrest follows a months-long investigation into graft allegations over an undersea tunnel project in the state of Penang, which he led as chief minister from 2008 until his appointment as finance minister in 2018.
Lim was part of the Mahathir Mohamad-led administration that collapsed in February. 
He was one of the key leaders from the Mahathir administration who was involved in Malaysia's efforts to recover billions allegedly stolen from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
In 2016, Lim was charged with two counts of abuse of power for approving a land deal and in the purchase of a bungalow at a below market price, a move critics said was part of a crackdown on those opposed to then Prime Minister Najib Razak's administration.
The charges were dismissed after Najib was ousted in the 2018 election by the Mahathir-led coalition.

LONDON (Reuters) - Leading container lines are diverting ships to Lebanon's smaller terminal of Tripoli after the devastating explosion at Beirut's port that killed 145 people also paralysed vital trade.
Lebanon, which imports almost all it uses, relies on container ships to bring in everything from refrigerated food cargoes to clothing and other consumer goods.
There is no firm date for Beirut port to re-open, and this is a strain on supply chains.
Data from shipping intelligence platform MarineTraffic showed three container ships had arrived in Tripoli in the past 24 hours after being diverted from Beirut, with a further container vessel expected later on Thursday and another due on Saturday.
Germany's Hapag Lloyd said it was diverting its services to Tripoli, about 70 km (43 miles) up the Mediterranean coast from the capital, to discharge cargo bound for Beirut. 
""Lebanon is dependent on imports and exports for their needs and we will be diverting services for the moment to Tripoli, which is a smaller port,"" a Hapag Lloyd spokesman said.
The spokesman said the company's office in Beirut had been completely destroyed but staff were unharmed. 
""Access to the port is not allowed at present so we cannot assess how many of our containers were either damaged or destroyed,"" he said. 
Beirut's container port has an annual average capacity of just over 1 million TEUs (20 foot equivalent units), compared with Tripoli's 400,000 TEUs, which could be enlarged to 600,000 TEUs and a maximum of 750,000 TEUs if more cranes are installed, shipping data shows. 
Denmark's AP Moller Maersk said it was working with Tripoli port to enable its vessels to call there. 
Maersk's Beirut office was damaged and three of its staff slightly hurt. Potential damage to its containers in the port is being assessed. 
Switzerland's MSC said it was working on alternative cargo routings, including stops in Turkey and Greece. 
Ship insurer Gard said: ""According to our correspondents, the port of Beirut is closed for a minimum period of 14 days which could be extended until port facilities have been restored."" 

The International Transport Workers' Federation, which represents seafarers, quoted its representatives in Lebanon as saying at least 12 dockers and seven separate seafarers had been killed in the port. The figure could not be independently confirmed.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it blacklisted Faysal al-Wadi, accusing the Libyan national of having smuggled drugs and Libyan fuel into Malta.
Also blacklisted were two associates, Musbah Mohamad M Wadi and Nourddin Milood M Musbah, Malta-based company Alwefaq Ltd, and the vessel Maraya, which the Treasury said Wadi used in his alleged smuggling operations.
The Treasury said that ""competition for control of smuggling routes, oil facilities, and transport nodes is a key driver of conflict in Libya and deprives the Libyan people of economic resources.""
Thursday's action freezes any U.S. assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.
""Faysal al-Wadi and his associates have smuggled fuel from Libya and used Libya as a transit zone to smuggle illicit drugs,"" said Deputy Treasury Secretary Justin Muzinich. 
""The United States is committed to exposing illicit networks exploiting Libya’s resources for their own profit while hurting the Libyan people,"" he added.
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Since 2014, it has been split, with an internationally recognized government controlling the capital, Tripoli, and the northwest, while military leader Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi rules the east.

Bilal's appointment was announced in a statement from the presidency following the resignation of his predecessor Ismail Ould Cheikh Sidiya and his entire government. 
The political system in Mauritania has been rocked this year by a parliamentary investigation into alleged corruption in the government of former President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who stepped down last year after a decade in power. 
His close ally Ghazouani won the election to succeed him, but Abdel Aziz quickly found his government's actions, including deals involving offshore oil projects, under scrutiny by parliament. 
The investigators on Wednesday gave a report documenting their findings to the public prosecutor. Several current ministers were questioned about suspected graft that occurred on their watch while serving in senior positions in Abdel Aziz's government. 
In brief remarks to reporters on Thursday morning, Cheikh Sidiya said he had submitted the government's resignation to Ghazouani but did not provide an explanation. 
Hours later, the presidency announced the appointment of Bilal, who has served as the head of the country's national water agency, a presidential aide and a cabinet minister. 
Abdel Aziz came to power in a 2008 coup and was an important ally of Western powers in the fight against Islamist insurgents in the Sahel region. 
The inauguration last August of Ghazouani, a former general and defence minister, marked the mostly desert nation's first peaceful transfer of power since independence from France in 1960.

The president has said he would deliver ""home truths"" to a government that France and other Western donors have said must reform the country's politics and the economy.
One man told Macron: ""We hope this aid will go to the Lebanese people not the corrupt leaders.""
Before the Beirut port blast, whose explosive force was registered hundreds of miles (kilometres) away, Lebanon was grappling with an imploding economy - its banks in crisis, currency in freefall and mountain of debts climbing.
""Mr President, you're on General Gouraud Street, he freed us from the Ottomans. Free us from the current authorities,"" said one person among the crowd who gathered around him, appealing for help from Lebanon's former colonial power.
Some of the crowd, who were filmed by a pool report in a predominantly Christian district of the capital, shouted: ""Mr Macron, free us from Hezbollah,"" referring to the Iran-backed Shi'ite Muslim group, a powerful player in a nation where political loyalties often run along sectarian lines.

After visiting a pharmacy damaged by the explosion, Macron told the crowd: ""I understand your anger. I am not here to write a blank cheque ... to the regime.""

1263,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>","In big shift, Pope names six women to Vatican financial oversight body","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has appointed six women, including the former treasurer for Britain's Prince Charles, to the council that oversees Vatican finances, naming them in one fell swoop to some of the most senior roles.
The appointments to one of the Holy See's most important offices marked the latest attempt by the pope to keep promises to improve gender balance made years ago but which women's groups have said were too slow in being realised.
Francis has already appointed women as deputy foreign minister, director of the Vatican Museums, and deputy head of the Vatican Press Office, as well as four women as councillors to the Synod of Bishops, which prepares major meetings.
Still, Thursday's new appointments marked the largest number of women named at one time to Vatican posts.
The previously all-male Council for the Economy consists of 15 posts. One cardinal is the coordinator and the 14 other posts are divided evenly among members of the clergy and lay people.
The seven-member lay portion now consists of six women and one man. Of the six women, two each are from Britain, Spain and Germany. The sole male lay member is Italian.
One of the Britons, Leslie Jane Ferrar, was treasurer to Prince Charles from 2015 to 2017 and now holds a number of non-executive and trustee roles, the Vatican said. 
The other, Ruth May Kelly, served as secretary of state for education and for transport, and as minister for women and equality, in Britain's former Labour government from 2004-2008.
The other four women have backgrounds in business, banking and academia.
Francis established the Council for the Economy, which oversees budgets and sets policy, in 2014 as an international body to oversee often-troubled Vatican finances.
The new council is starting its work as the coronavirus pandemic has hit the Vatican's finances hard, forcing it to dip into reserve funds and implement some of the toughest cost control measures ever in the tiny city state.

GUATEMALA CITY/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hundreds of migrant children rapidly expelled from the United States under a coronavirus immigration policy are returning to shelters in Guatemala where virus testing and bed capacity are regularly stretched to their limits.
Shelter operators, government officials in the Central American nation and international organizations said they are seeing rising numbers of children being sent back to Guatemala alone, with some unable to return to their homes because of domestic abuse or gang violence. 
""Child protection services, which were already overstretched and under-resourced have now been further compromised by COVID-19,"" said United Nations children's agency UNICEF spokesman Christopher Tidey. ""So it is a challenge to provide vulnerable children with the support and protection they need.""
U.S. President Donald Trump on March 21 toughened his hardline stance on immigration by implementing a new policy his administration said was aimed at stemming the spread of the novel coronavirus. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now quickly turns back most people trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally or claim asylum.
The new rules scrapped a long-standing practice of allowing children to apply for U.S. asylum and other protections from trafficking and abuse. Now, most children are quickly put on planes back to their home countries or turned back to Mexico. Some children travel to the United States without their parents while others come with family but cross separately.
CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Guatemala can house 115 unaccompanied children from the United States and Mexico in shelters, said Anaeli Torres, the country's secretary for social welfare. Approximately 50 children per week are arriving from the United States, and while the shelter population fluctuates, it has neared capacity at times.
At one government-run shelter visited by Reuters in Guatemala City, the children stay in individual rooms, with some recreational time in the garden. Most children are eventually reunited with family members. But not all. 
Leonel Dubon, director of another, privately run shelter in Guatemala City, said his shelter is filled to capacity, including 40 returned children who cannot go home because of credible threats to their safety. The organization will try to eventually safely reunify them with their families or else place them with other families. 
Government officials and advocates said deported children can face discrimination in their home communities due to fears they may have become infected with the coronavirus while in the United States. 
In May, health officials inspecting a shelter for unaccompanied children deported from Mexico were shocked to find administrative staff caring for 36 boys and girls, said Torres. Nine childcare staff of the government-run shelter, in the western city of Quetzaltenango, had walked out after some of the children tested positive for coronavirus. 
More than half of the children were evacuated to a shelter in Guatemala City, while government workers were brought in to care for the others still under quarantine. 
DELAYED TESTING
Only around 10 percent of kids sent from the United States arrive with certifications of coronavirus testing, said Torres. The Guatemalan government tests arriving children and keeps them in a 10-day quarantine while awaiting their results.
Between April and June, U.S. officials arrested more than 3,300 unaccompanied children on the southwest border, but CBP has declined to say how many have been expelled under the new process or give a breakdown of arrests by nationality for that time period.
Only about 160 minors were transferred to U.S. custody in the same period, according to U.S. government figures, leading immigrant advocates to believe that the vast majority of unaccompanied minors have been subject to expulsions.

Between April and July of this year Guatemala received 379 unaccompanied minors deported from the United States, 176 in July alone, which was more than double from a month earlier and higher than the same period last year, according to Guatemalan government figures.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brussels will require people to wear masks in public spaces and in private spaces accessible to the public if the uptick in coronavirus cases continues, the regional government said on Thursday.
The order will kick in when the daily average of cases per 100,000 inhabitants reaches 50 over seven days, Rudi Vervoort, the minister-president of the Brussels region, said. The daily average in the region was 38.4 last week.
Belgium imposed sharp curbs on social contacts on July 27 after coronavirus infections surged in recent weeks.
The British government said on Thursday it would impose a quarantine on arrivals from Belgium, following Estonia, Ireland, Latvia and Norway. 
Germany and the Netherlands have also advised their citizens against travelling to the province of Antwerp in the north of Belgium, where the first curfew since World War II was imposed on July 29 to slow rapidly increasing infections.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has designated all of Belgium as a code orange for the new coronavirus, meaning the number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants is 20 or above for two weeks.

Belgium, where the European Union and NATO have their headquarters, imposed a lockdown on March 18 due to COVID-19, which has claimed 9,859 lives in the country, one of the world’s highest fatality figures per capita.

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Joshua Wong and other Hong Kong activists charged over banned June 4 vigil,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Two dozen people in Hong Kong, including pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong, have been charged with participating in an illegal assembly at a vigil on June 4 commemorating the crackdown on protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen square in 1989.
It was the first time the vigil had been banned in semiautonomous Hong Kong, with police citing coronavirus restrictions on group gatherings in refusing permission for it to take place. Still, tens of thousands lit candles across the city in what was largely a peaceful event, bar a brief skirmish with riot police in one neighbourhood.
The anniversary struck an especially sensitive nerve in the former British colony this year, falling just as China prepared to introduce national security legislation later that month in response to last year's often violent pro-democracy demonstrations.
Pro-democracy activists see the new legislation as the latest attempt by Beijing to encroach on Hong Kong's freedoms.
Police said in a statement on Thursday that 24 people, including 19 men and 5 women, aged 23-69, had been charged with holding and knowingly taking part in an unauthorised assembly. Such a charge existed before the new security law came into force on June 30.
Wong, and at least six other activists said on their Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) pages that they were among those charged.
""Clearly, the regime plans to stage another crackdown on the city's activists by all means,"" Wong said.
Wong made a court appearance on Wednesday on similar charges related to a protest last year. The verdict is expected later this year.
The new security law, which punishes anything China sees as subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, has drawn strong criticism from Western countries for putting Hong Kong on a more authoritarian path.
Its supporters say it will bring stability after a year of unrest.
June 4 commemorations are banned in mainland China, but Hong Kong, which was promised certain freedoms when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, such as that of expression and assembly, traditionally held the largest vigils globally every year.

China has never provided a full account of the 1989 violence. The death toll given by officials days later was about 300, most of them soldiers, but rights groups and witnesses say thousands of people may have perished.

The ministry said in an update for June - which has now been removed - that Chinese forces had breached the border in the Kugrang Nala and Gogra areas and the north shore of Pangong Tso lake in the northern Indian territory of Ladakh on May 17-18.
New Delhi says a ""violent face-off"" that followed the intrusion killed 20 of its soldiers in the western Himalayas.
It was the worst outbreak of violence between the giant Asian neighbours in decades. China accuses the Indian side of crossing the de facto border and provoking its soldiers.
""While engagement and dialogue at military and diplomatic level is continuing to arrive at mutually acceptable consensus, the present standoff is likely to be prolonged,"" the Indian defence ministry said in the now-removed statement, which was posted to Twitter by Reuters partner ANI https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1291225755762831361/photo/2 and others on Thursday.
A ministry spokesman did not respond to a call and a text message asking for comment on the document.
Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said the government was not being candid about the situation on the border, especially after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement in June that ""nobody has intruded into our border, neither is anybody there now, nor have our posts been captured"".

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam is close to completing the conversion of a sports stadium into a 1,000-bed field hospital in its new coronavirus epicentre Danang, the health ministry said on Thursday, as it battles an outbreak that has spread to at least 11 locations.
Aggressive contact-tracing, targeted testing and strict quarantining had helped Vietnam halt an earlier contagion, but it is now racing to control infections in the central city and beyond after a new outbreak ended a run of more than three months without domestic transmission.
Danang's Tien Son Sports Palace will from Saturday be used to treat an overflow of infected patients should the city's hospitals become overwhelmed, said the company behind the project, Sun Group.
Danang has reported more than 200 cases since the virus reappeared there on July 25. Authorities have said the situation was ""under control"" and the outbreak would likely peak in the next 10 days.
If infection numbers stabilise, the facility would be used to isolate people who were in direct contact with a positive case, as part of Vietnam's centralised quarantine programme, Sun Group said. 
The health ministry reported 34 new COVID-19 infections on Thursday, taking Vietnam's total cases to 747, with 10 deaths. 
Most recent cases have links to three hospitals in Danang, a coastal city that was until recently inundated with domestic tourists capitalising on holiday promotions and easing restrictions.
The health ministry has sent a task force of medical experts and more than 1,000 health workers to Danang, while Cuba has also dispatched a medical team to Vietnam to assist.
In the capital Hanoi, 72,000 people who recently returned from Danang would be re-tested, the city's governing body said on Thursday, this time using a swab-based test, known for its higher rate of accuracy than the blood sample-based rapid test kits, which Vietnam has used for mass screening.

Vietnam's Prime Minister has said early August was the ""decisive"" time to contain the outbreak.

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China on Thursday threatened to take countermeasures over a trip to Taiwan by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, as the Chinese-claimed island geared up for its highest-level U.S. official visit in four decades.
The visit, which begins on Sunday, adds to tensions between Beijing and Washington over everything from trade and human rights to the novel coronavirus pandemic. China calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its bilateral ties with the United States.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing in Beijing that any attempt to deny or challenge the ""one China"" principle, which states that Taiwan is part of China, would end in failure.
""China will take strong countermeasures in response to the U.S. behaviour,"" Wang said, referring to Azar's visit.
While he gave no details, China last month said it would impose sanctions on  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) for involvement in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
Taiwan has batted away China's criticism, saying Beijing has no right to comment. 
Washington broke off official ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing. The Trump administration has made strengthening its support for the democratic island a priority, and boosted arms sales.
Azar, who is scheduled to meet President Tsai Ing-wen, is coming to strengthen economic and public health cooperation with Taiwan, and support Taiwan's international role in fighting the pandemic.
Taiwan is locked out of most global agencies, such as the World Health Organization, due to the objections of China, which views the island as a Chinese province that is not entitled to any of the rights that statehood confers.
Taiwan Centres for Disease Control Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang said Azar and members of the U.S. delegation would be tested for coronavirus before leaving for Taiwan, and again upon entry at the airport. 
Only if they are negative will they be allowed in.
""They must wear masks at all times,"" Chuang said. 
""There are rules on where they can go,"" he added, saying that Taiwan's often-crowded night markets would not be on the list for private visits.
The members of the U.S. delegation will also have to maintain social distancing when meeting government officials, Chuang said, adding they would use dedicated elevators ""to avoid any risks"".
Taiwan has won praise for its steps to control the coronavirus, including strict border quarantine controls and the widespread wearing of masks, which have won broad public support.
It has reported 477 cases of the coronavirus and seven deaths. Most cases have been imported, and only a small number of people remain in hospital or isolation.

The United States has had more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country, and the wearing of masks has become a heated political issue, with some people objecting to what they see as an infringement of personal freedom.

Hundreds of protesters had gathered outside the national electoral commission's headquarters to demand that Gbagbo, his ally Charles Ble Goude and former prime minister Guillaume Soro be included in the rolls, a Reuters witness said. 
The electoral commission said the three were not included because of criminal convictions and that it will consider appeals against their exclusion. But their supporters say President Alassane Ouattara's government is trying to silence political opponents before the election. 
The Oct. 31 election is widely seen as the biggest test of Ivory Coast's stability since Gbagbo refused to accept defeat to Ouattara in the 2010 election, sparking a brief civil war that killed 3,000 people. 
Tensions have risen in recent weeks since Ouattara's choice to succeed him, Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, died unexpectedly. The ruling party then asked Ouattara to run for a third term - a move his opponents say would violate the constitution. [nL5N2F089Z]
Ouattara has not yet said whether he will run. He is scheduled to address the nation on Thursday evening. 
Following the civil war, Gbagbo was sent to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to face charges of crimes against humanity. He was acquitted last year but has not yet received a passport to return home from Europe. 
An Ivorian court convicted him in 2018 of having stolen money from the central bank during the civil war and sentenced him to 20 years in prison.

Philippine Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra on Thursday said his office was trying to secure a certificate for the death of ""Christopher Reinhard Bauer"", which he said had been recorded in a civil registry in the capital Manila last month.
""Bauer is part of an ongoing NBI/AMLC investigation, and these agencies have an interest to know if he is still alive,"" Guevarra told Reuters, referring to the National Bureau of Investigation and the Anti-Money Laundering Council.
""We can't confirm until we see the death certificate.""
The Southeast Asian country became connected to the accounting saga at Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY) when the German firm initially claimed that a missing $2.1 billion had been kept in two Philippine banks, which the banks said was not true.
The central bank has said no money from Wirecard entered the Philippine financial system.
Wirecard admitted that $2.1 billion of its cash probably did not exist. Auditor EY had said there were clear indications of an elaborate fraud involving multiple parties around the world. 
The Philippines was also linked to Wirecard through its former chief operating officer Jan Marsalek, who was recorded as entering the country on June 23 then leaving for China a day later, around the time that news of the scandal broke. 
Guevarra last month said those travel records had been falsified.
He confirmed on Thursday that Bauer was among the initial list of people and entities of interest in the Philippine investigation. 

They included three local firms - Centurion Online Payment International, PayEasy Solutions and ConePay International. Those companies have not responded to Reuters requests for comment.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's king has approved veteran banking executive Predee Daochai as new finance minister, the official Royal Gazette said, handing him the task of navigating Southeast Asia's worst performing economy through the coronavirus pandemic. 
Predee, 61, former co-president of Kasikornbank and chairman of the Thai Bankers' Association, had been widely tipped to replace Uttama Savanayana who resigned last month along with other ministers in a major economic team shake-up.
Predee had worked for Kasikornbank for 38 years and graduated with law degrees from Thammasat University and a master's degree in law from the University of Illinois.
The departure of Uttama and Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, who headed the economic team, comes at a critical time for the economy which the central bank predicts will shrink by a record 8.1% this year and adds to uncertainty over policymaking as Thailand struggles with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Analysts want to see policy continuity and new measures to boost the economy in the short and long term, including the development of the Eastern Economic Corridor(EEC), an ambitious connectivity and development project launched by the then military government to boost Thailand's industrial east. 
""The market does not look at who but what policy will be announced,"" said Naris Sathapholdeja, head of TMB Analytics.
""What the new finance minister needs to do is to retain jobs and support smaller businesses,"" he added.
Tim Leelahaphan, economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank, said ""We are paying special attention on who will serve as head of the economic team"" as measures such as the EEC and the progress of various other mega projects were started under Somkid and it remains to be seen whether the projects would be continued.
Thailand has also appointed a new central bank governor, Sethaput Suthiwart-Narueput, an economic advisor to the prime minister, who will take over from Veerathai Santiprabhob for a five-year term in October.

Lebanese authorities have blamed a huge stockpile of the highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at Beirut's port for Tuesday's explosion, which killed at least 145 people and injured more than 5,000. 
It is estimated about 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were involved in the explosion.
By comparison, Australia's Orica stores between 6,000 to 12,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate (AN), on average, at its Kooragang Island plant in the port of Newcastle, the company said in a statement. 
The stockpile has led resident groups to campaign for the plant to be relocated, according to several local media reports.
""It's a totally inappropriate place to have such a dangerous material produced and stored, and it's something we've been complaining about for many, many years,"" chemical engineer and community campaigner Keith Craig told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).
He is one of 300 residents in the Stockton Community Action Group campaigning for the Orica plant to be relocated, or its stockpiles to be significantly reduced, the ABC reported.
In a statement, Orica said it followed all international standards and local regulations to ensure safety at every stage of the manufacturing supply chain. 
""AN storage areas are fire resistant and built exclusively from non-flammable materials,"" Orica said.
""...we take a rigorous, best-practice approach towards safety in the production, storage and transport of all our products."" 
""You have to be extremely negligent with AN for it to explode,"" it said. It said video footage of the Beirut explosion suggested fireworks had been stored close by. Some reports say a welder started a fire.
""This cannot be compared to the responsible and heavily regulated production, storage and transport of AN by Orica and others in Australia,"" Orica said.

There was no immediate comment on the incident in Houthi media. 
The drone had been launched from Hodeidah governorate on Yemen's Red Sea coast, the coalition said. It did not say where the drone was intercepted. 
Cross-border attacks by Houthi forces have escalated since late May when a truce prompted by the coronavirus pandemic expired. In late June, missiles reached the Saudi capital Riyadh. The coalition has retaliated with air strikes.
Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported a coalition air strike on Thursday morning on the Saada area which borders Saudi Arabia. 
The conflict has killed more than 100,000 people since the Saudi-led alliance intervened in Yemen in March 2015 shortly after the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government from power in the capital Sanaa.
The conflict is largely seen regionally as a proxy war between Saudi and Iran. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.
The United Nations Yemen envoy has been holding virtual talks between the warring parties to try to agree a permanent ceasefire and confidence-building steps to restart peace negotiations last held in December 2018.

LA TOUR-DE-PEILZ, Switzerland (Reuters) - For Frenchwoman Annick Weber, the Swiss shores of Lake Geneva were just the place for a getaway during the coronavirus pandemic.
Eager for a holiday with husband Christophe, she thought the French Riviera was too distant, too crowded, and too complicated.
""So we chose Switzerland because it is not too far, it's beautiful and it is calm. We hope to not have too many people and more space to visit, go for walks, enjoy ourselves and get some rest during our holidays,"" she said.
But as much as Switzerland seeks to parlay its squeaky-clean image to promote tourism, a sharp divide is emerging as people flock to mountains and lakes while avoiding city centres, where hotels are suffering.
Overnight stays at Swiss hotels plunged a record 47.5% in the first half of 2020, with foreign demand down by three-fifths.
In June stays fell 62%, even after the government relaxed restrictions and opened borders to members of the Schengen passport-free zone.
""The impact is absolutely catastrophic,"" said Thierry Lavalley, president of the Geneva Hotel Association.
He said Geneva's hotel business was in ""intensive care"", with around 40 hotels shut.
Four out of five overnight hotel stays in Geneva are by people travelling from abroad. That has all dried up.
Summer travellers from Asia, the Middle East and North America are absent, Lavalley said. People from these regions face 10-day Swiss quarantines.
""We don't make it easy for them. They are not allowed to enter Switzerland freely and this is extremely difficult to find flights that come in Geneva to bring those travellers. So this is really an apocalyptic situation, nothing is done to help.""
He estimated Geneva hotels' revenue could drop 75-80% versus 2019. The canton's hotels and restaurants employ 15,000, of whom 12,000 are in state-supported part-time working schemes.
For Marie Forestier, director of the Bon Rivage hotel in La Tour-de-Peilz that reopened in May, business has picked up since mid-July thanks to last-minute customers. 

""There is a lot of work, but the team is united, and this is really great. But we still think of this very uncertain future.""

Beavers, semi-aquatic vegetarian mammals, were hunted to extinction in Britain more than four centuries ago because people wanted their meat, fur and castoreum, a secretion that was used in medicine and perfumes.
But in 2013 a family of beavers was found to be living on the River Otter in Devon, a rural county in southwest England. It is not clear where the beavers came from and at first they were threatened with eviction.
Instead, they were allowed to stay for five years under a trial spearheaded by the Devon Wildlife Trust charity which studied their behaviour and impact on the environment.
The beavers thrived, successfully breeding and dispersing throughout the river's catchment area. They have built 28 dams and are now estimated to consist of 15 family groups.
The five-year trial found that other creatures such as fish, insects, birds and water voles had benefitted from the presence of the beavers, who enhance wetland habitats. Their dams had also reduced the risk of flooding to some human homes.
As a result, the government announced on Thursday the beavers would be allowed to stay permanently, expanding their range naturally - the first legally sanctioned reintroduction to England of an extinct native mammal.
""This is the most groundbreaking government decision for England's wildlife for a generation,"" said Peter Burgess, Director of Conservation at Devon Wildlife Trust.
""Beavers are nature's engineers and have the unrivalled ability to breathe new life into our rivers and wetlands.""
The beavers had caused some localised problems for a small number of landowners but these had been successfully managed, the trust said. The government said it would launch a consultation on a national approach to managing beavers.
The River Otter, like many of Devon's rivers, is also home to otters.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Behind Monageng Legae's funeral parlour in the South African township of Soweto sits a refrigerated shipping container made to store chilled goods. Now it stores bodies.
Funeral businesses like Legae's Sopema Funerals have taken such measures to cope with the influx of bodies into their morgues as South Africa's coronavirus cases rise above half a million, with deaths at around 9,000.
Surrounded by coffins in his showroom and wearing a protective mask and visor, Legae told Reuters that he handled 85 funerals in June and 75 in July, compared with 30 a month this time last year.
The cost of the container, along with outlays on a temporary outdoor waiting area, more staff and an additional night shift, has helped wipe out additional revenues.
Legae said the government should do more for under-pressure funeral parlours. ""People forget that this industry is actually playing a pivotal role.""
Funeral directors say that beyond the spike in deaths from COVID-19 - the disease associated with the coronavirus - they have to cope with coffin shortages and delays in the issuance of death certificates.
Data showed in July that South Africa had 59% more deaths than would normally be expected between early May and mid-July, suggesting more people were dying of COVID-19 than official figures show.
Amid the scramble, funeral parlours aren't always able to balance strict regulations with the expected sensitivity: there have been reports in local media of the wrong bodies being interred.
Stephen Fonseca, regional forensics adviser for Africa at the International Committee of the Red Cross, said South Africa's experience should serve as a warning for other nations as the continent's cases near 1 million.
""Once a country is facing a COVID-19 surge, it is too late to plan for how to manage mass casualties in a way that is both safe for the body handlers and dignified for the families of the deceased,"" he said.
Even Avbob, the country's biggest funeral provider by market share that was established during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, has had to make changes to cope with COVID-19.
It has buried some 25% of the country's coronavirus dead and saw a 60% rise in burials in July, Pieter van der Westhuizen, its general manager funeral service, said, adding Avbob has set up 13 mortuaries in shipping containers and is building 4 more.

""If we didn't ... we might have ran into trouble,"" he said.

YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar court on Thursday sentenced a Canadian preacher who said Christians were immune to the novel coronavirus to jail with hard labour for three months for holding church services in defiance of a ban on gatherings during the outbreak.
David Lah, a Canadian of Burmese origin, and another man, Myanmar national Wai Tun, were detained under a disaster management law over services they held in the city of Yangon in April.
A ban on public gatherings in the commercial capital took effect in mid-March.
Judge Moe Swe told reporters both men had been convicted of breaking administrative rules.
The lawyer for both men, Aung Kyi Win, confirmed that both of them had been jailed for three months. He did not elaborate.
In a sermon posted online in late March, Lah had told followers: “If you hear the sermon of God, the virus will never come to you. I declare it with the soul of Jesus Christ.”
About 20 people who took part in Lah's gatherings in April, including Lah himself, later tested positive for the coronavirus, an official said at the time.
This led to a cluster of 67 cases, according to Thar Tun Kyaw, a spokesman for the health ministry. The cluster was one of the largest in Myanmar, which has only reported 357 cases and six deaths related to the virus.
Religious gatherings across the world have at times been triggers for the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 18 million people globally and killed nearly 700,000.

Myanmar is predominantly Buddhist though it has small Christian communities.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German authorities did not follow correct procedures when they extradited a German man from Italy for a rape charge whom investigators also suspect of murdering British toddler Madeleine McCann, an adviser to Europe's top court said on Thursday.
Christian B, who lived in the Algarve region of Portugal when 3-year-old Madeleine vanished from her bedroom in 2007, had challenged the validity of the European arrest warrant issued by Germany because it cited a drugs conviction but not the 2005 rape charge.
The 43-year-old German was extradited to Germany from Italy under the warrant in 2018 and subsequently convicted and sentenced for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in December 2019. 
A German court subsequently sought guidance from the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
German authorities were required to get the consent of the Italian authorities for the rape charge so that the former could carry out their proceedings lawfully, CJEU Advocate General Michal Bobek said in a non-binding opinion.
The Court, which will rule in the coming months, follows such non-binding recommendations in four out of five cases.
Christian B is currently serving a sentence for drug dealing in the prison in Kiel in the north of Germany but could be freed any day now as he has already served two-thirds of his sentence.
Under German law, police have not released the suspect's surname and media in Germany are not permitted to report it, although it has appeared in some British outlets.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Olympic rings monument installed in Tokyo Bay for the 2020 Summer Games was temporarily removed for maintenance on Thursday and will return in December when Japan heads into the final stretch of preparations for the rescheduled event.
The Olympics were pushed back by a year in March due to the novel coronavirus outbreak. Thursday would have been Day 14 of the Games.
The monument, which was installed seven months ago and stands 15.3m tall and 32.6m wide, will be cleaned and undergo a safety inspection before being re-installed.
""Since it will be not on display for four months, it is kind of sad,"" Atsushi Yanashimizu, Planning Director at Tokyo Metropolitan Government, told Reuters on Thursday.
""But I consider in a positive way that we will make sure it will be clean and securely maintained when it comes back in four months.”
When the rings are re-installed in December organisers will hope to have a better idea as to whether the Games can go ahead in Tokyo next year amid continuing concerns about COVID-19.
Organisers have said successfully hosting the Games can be a positive symbol for the world as it deals with the pandemic.
""By delivering the Games successfully in Tokyo we strongly hope that we can create a legacy that is in the history of mankind,"" Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto told Reuters in an interview last month.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - India's federal government named a former telecoms minister on Thursday to lead the restive region of Kashmir, where it hopes to accelerate economic development and end years of strife.
Manoj Sinha, a leader in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party, will replace career bureaucrat G.C. Murmu as lieutenant governor of Jammu and Kashmir, a government statement said.
The appointment came a day after authorities ensured that the first anniversary of the revocation of Kashmir's constitutional autonomy passed off without any street protests amid heavy deployment of police and restrictions on public movement.
Last August, Modi's government removed special privileges accorded to Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, took away its statehood and split it into two federally-administered territories by carving out Buddhist-dominated Ladakh.
The move angered Kashmiris as well as Pakistan. India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.
On Thursday, anti-India militants shot dead a village council head from Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party in Kashmir's Kulgam district, police said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Two rescue workers were killed and five were missing in South Korea on Thursday after their boats overturned in floodwaters, Yonhap news agency reported, as heavy rain across the Korean peninsula threatened to bring new floods and landslides.
Parts of South Korea have seen 44 consecutive days of rain, the longest monsoon since 2013.
Three rescue boats were trying to free a police boat stuck in wire by a dam near the city of Chuncheon, to the northeast of Seoul, when they overturned and were swept over the dam, Yonhap reported.
One body was found near the dam, with another recovered about 20 km (12 miles) downstream.
Elsewhere, at least 16 people have been killed and 11 were missing, with more than 1,600 people displaced over recent days.
In Seoul, the Han River swelled over its banks in some areas after authorities were forced to open floodgates on upstream dams. Some highways by the river had to be closed, Yonhap reported.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun visited some of the hardest-hit areas and urged the government to consider designating several provinces special disaster zones.
A decision on that could come by Friday, Yonhap reported, with the designation enabling more government aid.
Emergency workers implemented measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in gyms and community centres being used as shelters.
Heavy rain has also fallen in North Korea and state media published pictures of flooded streets but did not give any detail of damage or casualties.
The government in North Korea had issued a flooding alert for areas near some its biggest rivers and lakes, the Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported.

Close to 70% of eligible Sri Lankans voted in Wednesday's election to the 225-member parliament, shrugging off fears of coronavirus.
Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya said counting had started at 9 a.m. local time (0330 GMT) and the first results were expected late afternoon with the final tally coming in around midnight.
Rajapaksa is hoping to install his older brother who is also a former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, as prime minister. The brothers are best known for crushing Tamil Tiger rebels fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils during the elder Rajapaksa's presidency in 2009.
President Rajapaksa said he was pleased by the voting on Wednesday. ""As the first South Asian country to hold general elections amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, it reflects the confidence that the people have in our efforts to control this pandemic,” he said.""

One group has openly criticised the monarchy, in a rare show of defiance. 
Here are the major events that have led up to these protests: 
May 22, 2014 - Military stages a coup, ousting an elected government for the second time in a decade, citing the need to restore order in the face of street demonstrations against a populist government linked to telecoms tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra, who himself was ousted in a coup in 2006.
Oct. 13, 2016 - Constitutional monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej dies after a 70-year reign. His son becomes King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
April 6, 2017 - A military-backed constitution is ratified after being approved in a referendum, with changes requested by King Vajiralongkorn that increased his powers, paving the way for an election.
Feb. 7, 2019 - The king rebukes his sister, Princess Ubolratana, over a Thaksin-linked party's nomination of her as its candidate for prime minister. The party is later dissolved by a court before the election. 
March 24, 2019 – General elections held amid complaints of cheating and vote-buying. Former army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the 2014 coup and was then prime minister of a military government, heads a pro-army party that wins the most votes.
Nov. 20, 2019 - Court disqualifies rising opposition figure Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, leader of the Future Forward Party, from parliament prompting thousands to rally in Bangkok.
Jan. 12, 2020 - More than 12,000 people join an anti-government ""Run Against Dictatorship"" in the biggest show of dissent since the 2014 coup. A rival group holds a run in support of Prayuth. 
Feb. 21 - Future Forward Party is banned for illegally taking a loan from its billionaire leader, Thanathorn, prompting small student protests on university campuses.
March 22 - Given restrictions to stop the novel coronavirus, student protests peter out but online criticism of government continues, with some also directing criticism at the king. The hashtag ""#whydoweneedaking?"" is posted more than 1 million times.
June 8 - Small protests held to call for an investigation into the disappearance of an exiled government critic in Cambodia.
June 15 - Prayuth warns political activists not to criticise the monarchy. 
June 24 - Protesters gather to mark the anniversary of the end of absolute monarchy in 1932.
July 18 - About 2,500 protesters gather at Democracy Monument, one of the largest demonstrations since the coup, calling for the dissolution of parliament and new elections.

Aug. 4 - Speakers call for the monarchy's power to be curbed at a rally attended by hundreds in Bangkok.

Japan's Obon festival, a time when spirits of the dead are believed to return from heaven for several days, usually marks an exodus from the capital as people head home to visit graves and spend time with family.
However, this year's celebration comes as COVID-19 cases hit record levels around the country, prompting governors of several prefectures to declare states of emergency.
The central government took the same step in April but has so far been reluctant to reimpose that broad measure because of the potential economic impact. 
""We are not currently in a situation where we need a new state of emergency,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at a news conference on Thursday.
Japan has reported an average of around 1,300 new COVID-19 cases each day over the past week, taking total cases to around 43,500. It has recorded just over 1,000 deaths.
Koike is due to hold an emergency news conference later on Thursday, where she will ask Tokyo residents to limit travel outside the metropolis as much as possible, Fuji News Network said. 
The country's top doctors' association on Wednesday warned against domestic travel and said local areas should decide their own restrictions. Okinawa prefecture in the south and Aichi in central Japan have both imposed a state of emergency. 
Official messages on travel remain mixed, with the central government ignoring calls to halt a national tourism campaign launched last month while urging people to do all they can to prevent further spread of the virus.
""With the Obon holidays approaching, people should avoid crowded situations, talking loudly, and gathering in large groups to eat meals,"" Abe said.
Obon is centred around Aug. 13-16 but many people take more time off. 
Aichi governor Hideaki Omura, who instituted a state of emergency in his prefecture from Thursday through Aug. 24, took a slightly more cautious stance.
""We'd like people to discuss with their families and, if possible, avoid inter-prefectural home visits this time around,"" he said.
There were some early signs that people were taking heed. The bookings website for tickets on Shinkansen bullet trains from Tokyo to other parts of the country, which normally sell out within minutes of going on sale, showed notable vacancies for the holiday period.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - When Hong Kong's largely peaceful pro-democracy protests turned violent last summer, it drove a wedge through every section of society, dividing friends, families and also worshippers at its more than 1,500 churches.
The majority of people in Hong Kong follow some form of Buddhist, Taoist or other traditional Chinese religion, but the former British colony has about 900,000 practicing Christians, about 12% of the population according to government figures, split almost evenly between Roman Catholic and Protestant faiths. There is no consensus among them about the protests or China's tightening grip on the city.
Canaan Wong, Blesson Chan and Kristy Chan, all in their mid-20s, are part of a group of about 40 people who in late June quit their positions as mentors and teachers at the evangelical Tung Fook Church, because they said they felt pressure from senior church leaders to keep quiet about political matters. 
They said several pastors were told by church leaders to remove their names from public statements opposing a bill last year that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, the issue which sparked the protests. The bill was eventually withdrawn. The three said they did not know which church leaders, or how many, were telling pastors to remove their names. 
""It sends chills down our spine with such self-censoring,"" said Wong. ""This shows that in this church, politics clearly overrides religion and truth."" 
The group wants the church to speak up on political issues, such as the new national security law enacted by China on June 30, which makes anything that Beijing regards as subversion or promoting independence punishable by life in prison.
""We are not asking for a yellow church,"" said Blesson Chan, using the local shorthand for pro-democracy. ""We just feel that church is a part of the society and should not be hiding up in an ivory tower."" 
The group is set to have talks with leaders of the church, which is located next to the headquarters of China's new national security agency in Hong Kong, about how to resolve their issues. A representative for Tung Fook church said it wanted to “enhance communication and eliminate misunderstanding” with the group.
If the church does not take a stand, the three said they feared it will end up resembling the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, a Protestant organization in mainland China that is closely controlled by the state and whose leaders staunchly support the Chinese Communist Party. 
The National Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches in China declined to comment.
Although China is an officially atheist state, it does allow certain state-supervised religious organizations, such as the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, to operate. However, Beijing has closed down many so-called underground or house churches outside the state-controlled system and has imprisoned worshippers on the grounds that they are more loyal to their religion than to the Chinese state. 
Chinese authorities did not respond to a request for comment. 
'TEAM JESUS' 
On the other side of the divide is a 49-year-old police officer, who said he left the Christian and Missionary Alliance Tak Tsuen Church after 14 years last June, when he was abused by fellow worshippers who told him the police deserved to be attacked by protesters. 
""As Christians, seeing the police bleed and wounded, how can you think it's good and we deserve it?"" said Sing, who asked to be identified by only one name. The church did not reply to a request for comment. 
Shortly after, the policeman joined Trinity Theology Baptist Church, set up by former police officer Ricky Wong, 54, as a refuge for police who felt unwelcome elsewhere.
""I want to minimize my brothers' and sisters' hatred towards the yellow camp,"" Wong told Reuters, referring to the general opposition among police officers to Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. 
""When (Jesus) saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd,"" said Wong, quoting a passage from the Bible. ""These people are also lambs."" 
Wong said the 120 or so members of his church, which include many members of the uniformed services plus some doctors and teachers, pray at secret locations for fear of being targeted by pro-democracy activists.
Despite his concern about the yellow camp, Wong said he did not identify as blue, or pro-Beijing. Instead, he described his congregation as ""Team Jesus.""
ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD
When China took back control of Hong Kong in 1997, it adopted the principle of ""one country, two systems"" and agreed to uphold the territory’s Basic Law, its de facto constitution, which includes the freedom of speech and religion. 
That principle is now seen to be under threat after China imposed the new national security law, which supporters say will bring stability to the financial hub, but critics say will crush all forms of freedom. 
Hong Kong’s government did not reply to a request for comment. It has said previously the new security law preserves “the basic rights and freedom lawfully enjoyed by law-abiding citizens.” The law makes no mention of religious groups. 
Nevertheless, church leaders are treading cautiously. 
A day before the law was imposed, Lo Hing-choi, president of the Baptist Convention of Hong Kong, the umbrella group for the city’s 164 Baptist congregations, posted a message critical of the law on the convention's website, but took it down a day later. 
""We expect the government to enact just laws to make society harmonious and stable,"" said Lo in the withdrawn post, arguing that the new security law could not achieve long-term stability and that only a truly democratic system would lead to prosperity.  
Lo, 68, told Reuters he was unnerved by an anonymous caller who accused him of encouraging violence.
Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper controlled by the Chinese state, singled out Lo for what it called ""hijacking the churches."" The newspaper did not reply to a request for comment. 

""In churches now, different people, different political stances are constantly fighting,"" said Wong. ""Right now, I don't think the rift in our society can be mended.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A violent Mexican cartel that stole vast amounts of fuel from state energy company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) could operate for years because top government officials at the time looked the other way, a senior official from the current administration said.
Authorities over the weekend captured gang leader Jose Antonio Yepez on his home turf in the central state of Guanajuato, the biggest arrest of an organized crime boss since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador came to power in December 2018. 
Known as 'El Marro' (The Mallet), Yepez and his Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel for years operated with what was essentially ""a license"" from the last government, said Santiago Nieto, head of the finance ministry's financial intelligence unit (UIF).
""The attitude was one of omission,"" Nieto told Reuters in an interview. He did not provide evidence for his assertions.
But he said federal and local officials failed to tackle fuel theft under the administration of former President Enrique Pena Nieto, who ran Mexico from 2012 to 2018.
In particular, Eduardo Leon Trauwitz, who was in charge of security at Pemex [PEMX.UL], fell short, Nieto said. Trauwitz's responsibilities included monitoring the firm's vast infrastructure, comprising refineries and tens of thousands of kilometers of pipelines. 
The task of policing theft was left to the oil workers' union, which did not do its job, Nieto said.
""(Trauwitz) let the union operate the control systems, and in reality what happened is that when the system reported a fuel theft, no immediate action was taken,"" he said.
A lawyer for Trauwitz, who was once head of security for Pena Nieto before he became president, said he was not immediately able to contact his client. Trauwitz's current whereabouts are unknown.
A representative for the union did not respond to a request for comment and a representative for the Pena Nieto government could not immediately be reached for comment.
Lopez Obrador said last year Trauwitz was under investigation for possible wrongdoing linked to fuel theft.
Last year, the UIF froze several of Trauwitz's bank accounts but a federal judge later overturned that decision, Mexican media reported.
Fuel theft in Mexico cost Pemex an estimated $3 billion in losses in 2018 alone, the government said.
Lopez Obrador, who has blamed former corrupt officials for oil theft and other problems at the company, moved swiftly to curb illegal fuel tapping when he took office.
The battle to control the illicit fuel trade has sparked violent clashes between the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel and Jalisco New Generation Cartel from neighboring Jalisco state.

MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stopped to take a photo with a singer known for his celebratory ""narcocorridos"" during the president's visit to Sinaloa on Wednesday.
Alfredo Rios, better known as ""El Komander,"" is famous on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border for popular ballads that recount Mexico's brutal drug wars, often seen as glorifying violence and members of the cartels. 
Rios lives in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, a stronghold of the Sinaloa Cartel, and has composed songs about the group and its former leader, notorious drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
Lopez Obrador's photo with the singer and his family comes after the president faced criticism for shaking hands with Guzman's mother during a previous visit to Sinaloa.

His government also suffered politically after ordering the release of Ovidio Guzman, one of El Chapo's sons, after his brief detention during a military operation that led to heavily armed cartel gunmen effectively taking control of Culiacan for hours.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors charged Guatemalan former Economy Minister Asisclo Valladares on Wednesday with helping launder nearly $10 million in cash from drug traffickers and a corrupt politician.
Valladares, a prominent official in the administration of former President Jimmy Morales that ended in January, used the proceeds of the laundering scheme to bribe politicians in Guatemala, U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan for the Southern District of Florida, in Miami, said in a statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Valladares' lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
Valladares' father, who is Guatemala's ambassador to the United Kingdom, said they both had full confidence in the U.S. legal system and that his son would appear in court when required.
The charges against Valladares are partly based on the testimony of cooperating witnesses, including convicted drug traffickers and a bank employee. 
""I see this as an act of revenge by drug traffickers,"" the ambassador said, adding that he had combated traffickers when he worked as a prosecutor in the 1990s and that he believed they were targeting his son to hurt him.
Valladares, the former minister, has so far evaded a warrant issued in Guatemala for his arrest, despite an Interpol Red Notice for his capture.
Both of the Valladares were prominent opponents to the U.N.-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, (CICIG) which uncovered corruption in the highest reaches of Guatemalan society. 
CICIG was driven from the country last year after an intense lobbying campaign by the government and allies. Valladares was named in two CICIG investigations. 
The U.S. case against him details alleged cash deliveries that arrived in sports bags, or, during the festive season, hidden in boxes of liquor. The cash was passed on to lawmakers in Guatemala, the case alleges.
Initially, the origin of the money was another politician, but when his illicit funds ran out, Valladares turned to drug money to keep up the bribe payments to lawmakers, the case alleges.

The city government in the U.S. capital passed the legislation last month as demonstrations sparked by the death of George Floyd, a man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, led many cities to rethink approaches to policing.
The legislation included measures such as barring choke holds and placing limits on the police department's use of non-lethal force and acquisition of military weaponry, but fell short of activists' demands to cut funding to the police department. 
In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the union said it was unconstitutional for it to be the only labor union in the federal district stripped of the right to negotiate with management regarding discipline of their members.
""While the Union remains in agreement with many of the provisions in the law, there are recently enacted sections that are catastrophic to our employee rights and protections under the law,"" the union said in a statement.
The union said reduced employee protections under the law would make it more difficult to recruit qualified candidates and had already led to police officers planning early retirements or quitting in order to work in other jurisdictions.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is pushing ahead with its bid to extend an international arms embargo on Iran by way of a second draft U.N. Security Council resolution, despite what some diplomats say is a lack of enthusiasm for such a move among its 15 members.
The U.S.-drafted resolution needs at least nine votes in favor to force Russia and China to use their vetoes, which Moscow and Beijing have signaled they will do. Some diplomats question whether Washington can even secure those nine, however.
""We have tabled a resolution that we think accomplishes what we think needs to be accomplished,"" U.S. Iran envoy Brian Hook told the Aspen Security Forum, held virtually, on Wednesday.
""The easy way is to do a rollover of the arms embargo. It's not difficult, there's all the reasons in the world to do it. But we will do this one way or another.""
The arms embargo on Iran is currently set to end on Oct. 18 under Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which Washington quit in 2018.
The second draft circulated by Washington is virtually unchanged from the first text shared with the council in June. 
If the United States is unsuccessful in extending the embargo, it has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran under a process agreed in the 2015 deal.
Such a move would kill the deal, touted as a way to suspend Tehran's suspected drive to develop nuclear weapons. Washington argues it can trigger the sanctions because a Security Council resolution still names it as a participant.
Iran has breached parts of the nuclear deal in response to the U.S. withdrawal and Washington's reimposition of sanctions.
""For as long as Iran is allowed to enrich, we're going to be having this discussion - how close is Iran to a nuclear breakout? ... We need to restore the U.N. Security Council standard of no enrichment,"" Hook said. 
Iran denies it is seeking to build a nuclear bomb.
Diplomats say Washington would face a tough, messy battle if it tries to trigger a return to sanctions.
The United States would have to submit a complaint to the council, which would then have to vote within 30 days on a resolution to continue Iran's sanctions relief. If such a resolution is not put forward by the deadline, sanctions would be reimposed - what is known as a snapback.

Some diplomats have suggested the United States will submit its complaint by the end of August to ensure the 30 days ends in September, before Russia takes the monthly rotating council presidency in October.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Radiant in a long white gown and veil, 29-year-old Lebanese bride Israa Seblani stands smiling and posing for her wedding video. The scene is shattered by a deafening roar, and a powerful shockwave nearly blows her off her feet.
The dramatic footage captured the moment when a massive explosion rocked the Lebanese capital on Tuesday, killing 135 people and injuring more than 5,000.
Seblani, a doctor working in the United States, helped to check on the injured nearby, before fleeing central Beirut's Saifi square to safety.
A day later, she and her husband Ahmad Subeih, 34, a businessman in Beirut, were struggling to process what happened.
""I have been preparing for my big day for two weeks and I was so happy like all other girls, 'I am getting married'. My parents are going to be happy seeing me in a white dress, I will be looking like a princess,"" she told Reuters.
""What happened during the explosion here - there is no word to explain ... I was shocked, I was wondering what happened, am I going to die? How am I going to die?""
Behind her, piles of smashed glass from the blown-out windows of the hotel where she was due to stay littered the ground, along with crushed remnants of flower arrangements that had adorned banquet tables.
Seblani arrived in Beirut three weeks earlier to prepare for her wedding.
Subeih recalled the aftermath of the blast, which officials have blamed on a huge stockpile of highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at the port.
""We started to walk around and it was extremely sad, it was not describable the devastation and the sound of the explosion,"" he said. ""We are still in shock ... I have never heard anything similar to the sound of this explosion.""
""I feel so sad about what happened to other people, about what happened to Lebanon,"" added Seblani. ""When I woke up and saw the damage that happened to Beirut, the one thing I said was thank God we are still alive.""
After the blast, she and her husband tried to compose themselves and carry on with their celebrations.
""My husband told me to continue, we can't stop. I was like okay, why not, we continue. I was not living the moment actually, I was like walking, my face was smiling, my lips were smiling, that's it, not more. Then we went to have a dinner.""
Subeih recalls entering the damaged hotel on Wednesday to retrieve belongings and passports.
""The scene in the room was unbelievable,"" he said. 
He is waiting for a visa to the United States so he can join his wife there. Seblani loves Lebanon, but feels that after Tuesday's blast, living there is not an option.
She is still trying to find joy in a wedding she took so long to prepare.
""There is a lot of damage, many people were killed and wounded. But also if I want to look at us, myself, my husband, the photographer - how we escaped unharmed, I thank God for protecting us. 

""This alone makes me feel optimistic and to keep the joy of the occasion that I came here to celebrate.""

Eduardo Ochoa, a 29-year-old freelance journalist and teacher in the city of Uruapan, was shot in the jaw, chest and hand when he left his home to buy food on Tuesday, prosecutors said.
The Michoacan attorney general's office said it was unclear how many people took part in the attack or what motivated it.
Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of suffering reprisals, a friend of the dead journalist told Reuters that Ochoa, who covered security matters, had received death threats from local criminals and wanted to quit the profession.
The killing of Ochoa follows the slaying on Sunday morning of journalist Pablo Morrugares along with a bodyguard in the southwestern city of Iguala in Guerrero state.
Two days later, unidentified gunmen shot up the offices of local newspaper Diario de Iguala, state prosecutors said.
Long convulsed by drug gangs, Michoacan and Guerrero are among the most lawless and violent states in Mexico.
According to a tally kept by Reporters Without Borders, a nonprofit group dedicated to protecting freedom of information, three journalists had been killed in Mexico this year before the deaths of Morrugares and Ochoa.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Walid Assi was cooking at a Beirut pizza joint on Tuesday night when a huge blast wave pushed him down. The ground beneath him shook. He saw a flash of white. The roof caved in.
""We can't believe we got out of this alive,"" the chef told Reuters in a central district of the Lebanese capital. ""People were bleeding, lying on the ground, running around in the streets...It was like a nightmare.""
Staff stood aghast near the restaurant the morning after a massive warehouse explosion a few kilometers (miles) away at Beirut port, which investigators blamed on negligence. Once the shock subsided, Assi said, the next feeling was anger. 
""Why should innocent people have to suffer like this because of worthless rulers? Is this how cheap our lives are to them?""
Beirut's residents woke up on Wednesday to a capital in desolation. Rescuers dug through the rubble for survivors in a city that was already buckling under the weight of a financial meltdown and a coronavirus outbreak.
The explosion killed at least 135 people, injured 5,000 and pushed up to 250,000 out of their homes after the shockwaves ripped out doors and shattered windows miles inland. 
The death toll is expected to rise. Officials blamed the blast on a huge stockpile of highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at the port.
For many Lebanese, it was the latest blow they blamed on a clutch of sectarian political elites that have ruled for decades. 
The government has vowed to hold those responsible for the explosion to account. 
But for workers and residents sweeping up debris in the popular nightlife neighbourhood of Gemmayze, clouds of dust swirling around them, it sounded just like the empty promises they were tired of. 
Thousands of Lebanese have protested since October against state waste and corruption that pushed the country into financial ruin. The local currency has since crashed, sending prices soaring and leaving many poor. 
IT'S AS IF RULERS 'WANT US TO DIE'
""What more can happen to us other than death? It's as if they want us to die,"" Rony Abu Saad said outside the blown-out storefront of his sandwich shop. One of his employees had died under the wreckage inside.
""This country now looks like its rulers, the garbage and rubble in the streets, it looks like them,"" he said. ""If any of them has a speck of consciousness left, they would leave.""
Around him, shards of glass and twisted metal littered the pub street. The roof of a large petrol station had crashed atop its pumps. A loft building lost all its balconies. 
In one alleyway, collapsed billboards and tree branches smashed a row of cars. In another, a man paced back and forth on the sidewalk muttering ""this is war.""
Abu Saad, whose furniture in his house near the sandwich shop was torn to pieces, hadn't slept all night. ""We're all still in shock, none of us can understand the scale of the destruction,"" he said. 
The wreckage shocked many even in a city that has weathered crisis after crisis, including a 1975-1990 civil war, a 2006 war with Israel and a series of assassination bombings. 
""The worst part is this government and all those before it did nothing. Nobody cares. Did they know this warehouse was there, and they kept it there near our houses?"" said Habib Medawar, 65, landlord of a building where two people had died.
He sat outside in a yellow plastic chair, staring out towards the sea. ""I don't want to do anything, I can't even bring myself to go inside.""
Nearby, Pierre Mrad, the medical director of a hospital in Gemmayze that was knocked out of service, held back tears. The blast had wounded staff and killed one of the nurses. 
""We evacuated all the patients. The hospital will have to be rebuilt. There's nothing left, nothing to be done right now,"" he said. ""We have to start all over. What more can I say?""

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - At least 30 people were injured in a grenade attack on a rally in Karachi on Wednesday, as Pakistan marked the first anniversary of India's revocation of Kashmir's semi-autonomy.
The wounded were rushed to different hospitals, where one was in a critical condition, an official from the provincial health department said.
“A grenade was lobbed in the rally, causing several casualties,” Karachi police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon told Reuters.
The attack was claimed by Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army, a separatist outfit that has become active in the past months.
In June, four people were killed including two soldiers in three consecutive explosions claimed by the SRA.
The group wants Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, to break from the Pakistani federation. It has also announced its alliance with the Balochistan Liberation Army, a militant group fighting for greater autonomy for the Balochistan region in southwestern Pakistan.
The attack took place as similar rallies were held across the country. The Karachi rally, organised by Jamaat-e-Islami, a religious right party, was called off after the attack. 
Last August, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government stripped Jammu and Kashmir - India's only Muslim-majority state - of its special rights and split it into two federally administered territories.
The government said the change was necessary to develop the revolt-torn region and integrate it with the rest of India, but it infuriated many Kashmiris as well as neighbouring Pakistan.
Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, which have gone to war twice over it, and both rule parts of it.

Indian authorities deployed troops and curbed public movement on Wednesday to stop potential protests in Kashmir.

Israel has been in a technical state of war with Lebanon for generations, and it deems the country's armed Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah, backed by Iran, the biggest threat across its northern border. Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war in 2006 and have traded fire again in recent weeks. 
But, arguing that ""humanity comes before any conflict"", Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai ordered City Hall on Rabin Square, named for the late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, to be illuminated with the Lebanese flag on Wednesday evening. 
""Our hearts are with the Lebanese people following this terrible tragedy,"" Huldai wrote on Twitter. 
At nightfall, windows on the 13-storey building's facade were filled with light in the design of Lebanon's flag: two horizontal red stripes enveloping a wider band of white, with a large green cedar tree - Lebanon's national symbol - at the centre. 
The decision drew criticism from some Israelis, including cabinet minister Rafael Peretz, who on Twitter likened it to ""raising (an) enemy state's flag in the heart of Tel Aviv"". 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had offered aid to Lebanon after the massive warehouse explosion in the port district of the capital Beirut on Tuesday that killed at least 135 people and injured over 5,000.
Lebanon has not responded to the overture, according to an Israeli defence official, who suggested that Israel with U.N. support could ""set up and operate field hospitals on our side of the border and admit casualties from Lebanon"". 
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared Wednesday a day of mourning and ordered Palestinian flags in the territory lowered to half mast in solidarity with Lebanon.

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuadorean women are using code words to seek help in situations of domestic violence as the country's quarantine is creating conditions for increased abuse of women and has also forced the closure of many organizations that provide support.
Some women send specific emojis in cell phone text messages or approach neighbors to ask for salt as a way of alerting that they face danger from abusive partners with whom they are now locked inside.
When women call a hotline run by an office of the province of Pichincha and ask that ""a red basket"" be delivered to their address, social workers send out alerts about domestic violence in that home.
""We receive a call from someone saying, 'I want a red basket,' and we immediately ... contact ECU 911 (Ecuador's emergency service), police and state prosecutors,"" said Pamela Quishpe, the coordinator of the project, adding that the system has helped save the lives of several women.
The phrase originally referred to a basket of food that state authorities began delivering during the pandemic.
The government does not have statistics on the increase in domestic abuse because of the difficulties of measuring it, said Ecuador's Human Rights secretary, Cecilia Chacon. 
Calls for help by women suffering domestic abuse have fallen by 30% since the quarantine began in March, she said, adding that this is believed to be the result of women not feeling comfortable making such calls with abusive partners nearby.
But she added that anecdotal evidence indicates that the rise in unemployment has boosted financial pressures on men and increased the likelihood that they will drink alcohol, both of which tend to drive abuse.
In Ecuador, 65 out of 100 women have suffered some type of violence throughout their lives and one in four have been psychologically abused in the last 12 months, according to research published in November by the National Institute of Statistics and Census.
In the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) province of Sucumbios, women send a specific emoji to the local chapter of Care International to alert of domestic abuse. The emoji is frequently changed for security reasons.
Reporting domestic abuse is more difficult in rural areas because few people have cellular phones and women must travel long distances to reach state aid agencies.
In the rural province of Cotopaxi, Dioselinda Iza of the Organization of Indigenous and Peasant Women Planting Hope says women ask their neighbors for salt to warn of domestic abuse.
""Asking the neighbor for salt was the key to saying that something bad is happening with her husband,"" said Iza.

The strategy has helped 1,500 women members of the organization avoid physical violence during quarantine, Iza said.

Such costs include health expenses or the extension of holidays in case of a compulsory quarantine while on the islands.
The move will take effect this week and is the first of its kind in Spain as the tourism-dependent nation seeks to reassure visitors after Britain dealt a blow to the sector by imposing a compulsory quarantine for anyone coming from Spain. 
The travel policy will be managed by French insurer AXA and will include health-related repatriations, the Canary Islands regional government said in a statement. It will last for one year and will exclude health conditions that were known of before the traveller concerned came to the islands. 
""It will help the economic recovery of the archipelago,"" Yaiza Castilla, the regional official in charge of tourism, said in a video published on Twitter. 
In a relief for the Canary Islands, Swiss health authorities on Wednesday excluded the archipelago, as well as the Balearic Islands, from its decision to add Spain to its list of countries from which arriving passengers must enter a 10-day quarantine.
Spain reported 1,772 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, marking the biggest daily jump since a national lockdown was lifted in June following a sharp drop in contagion rates.

The United Nations-backed court located outside The Hague, Netherlands, was due to give a verdict in the trial of four men who are accused in the deaths of Hariri and 21 others this Friday.
The verdict has been delayed ""out of respect for the countless victims of the devastating explosion that shook Beirut on 4 August, and the three-days of public mourning in Lebanon,"" the court's registry said in a statement.
Before the explosion that rocked Beirut on Tuesday, the country had been bracing for the verdict in the case of the men charged with planning and arranging the bombing 15 years ago.

(Reuters) - Former Vice President Joe Biden will not travel to Wisconsin to accept the Democratic U.S. presidential nomination during the party's national convention this month because of coronavirus concerns, party officials said on Wednesday.
The decision to pull Biden and other speakers from Milwaukee, where Democrats had once planned to hold a multiday nominating convention in person, ensures the event from Aug. 17-20 will be almost entirely virtual. Biden will accept the nomination and deliver a national address from his home state of Delaware, the Democratic Party said.
Separately, Republican President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would ""probably"" deliver his nomination acceptance speech later this month from the White House.
The last-minute changes are the latest reminder of how the pandemic has wreaked havoc on traditional campaigning ahead of the country's Nov. 3 elections. The presidential conventions are typically made-for-television affairs featuring often-raucous speeches in front of thousands of the party faithful.
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) said the decision was made to protect Milwaukee residents as well as the vast number of people needed to stage a national convention.
The event will feature two hours of prime-time programming each night with feeds from around the country, the DNC said.
""From the very beginning of this pandemic, we put the health and safety of the American people first,"" DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement.
The Republican convention was initially set for Charlotte, North Carolina, before Trump moved part of the festivities to Jacksonville, Florida, after North Carolina's governor warned he might not permit a huge crowd.
But a surge of coronavirus cases in Florida prompted Trump to cancel those plans. Only one night of the convention, a ""nomination night,"" will take place in Charlotte, Trump said in an interview on Fox News on Wednesday.

Trump said the bulk of the convention would be virtual and include live speeches from different locations, including his address on Aug. 27.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The City of Amsterdam on Wednesday began ordering use of face masks in crowded areas such as its ""Red Light"" prostitution district, in a drive against the coronavirus that stands in contrast with national policy.
Last week the national Dutch government decided not to advise the public to wear masks, saying their effectiveness against the disease has not been proven and they may weaken adherence to social distancing rules.
The World Health Organization has recommended using masks in areas where it is impossible to maintain social distancing since June.
Amsterdam mayor Femke Halsema ordered the measure, in agreement with health authorities, as part of an experiment to see whether they may be effective after all, as some scientific studies have found, her spokesman said.
""We do think it can have an immediate effect,"" Sebastiaan Meijer said. ""We want people to wear masks and be aware of the pandemic, so we do think it's going to help stop the virus from spreading.""
City workers on Wednesday handed out leaflets to tourists and residents, most of whom do not currently wear masks, explaining the new rules. Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of 95 euros ($112).
Like other European countries, the Netherlands is facing a spike in coronavirus cases after it eased lockdown measures on July 1. On Tuesday, health authorities reported new cases had doubled in the past week to 2,588, with clusters among young adults and in major cities.
In the past week Amsterdam has ordered the closure of several bars and one strip club where clusters were detected among staff and recent customers.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - A Georgia prosecutor asked a Fulton County Superior Court judge to revoke the bond for the former Atlanta policeman charged with murder in the shooting of Rayshard Brooks, saying in court papers that he violated its terms by taking an out-of-state vacation.
Brooks was fatally shot in the parking lot of a south Atlanta Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) restaurant. A video of the incident touched off days of protests including the burning of the restaurant. 
District Attorney Paul Howard asked the court late on Tuesday to send former officer Garrett Rolfe, 27, back to jail for violating the terms of his bond, which include a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and an order that he stay within the court's jurisdiction, court papers say.
Rolfe, who was out of jail on $500,000 bond, went to Daytona Beach, Florida, court papers say, citing data from an ankle-monitoring device.
The papers, filed to Fulton Superior Court Judge Jane Barwick, also say the state received notice from Rolfe's attorney on Monday that he had traveled to Florida for vacation.

One leading federation of laboratories said an abrupt July 25 decree to make testing free-of-charge and without prescription piled pressure on at a time many staff go on holiday. Political opponents lampooned a policy in disarray.
""Testing anyone achieves nothing. You have to be targeted,"" epidemiologist Didier Pittet, who heads a government-appointed task force monitoring the handling of COVID-19, told Europe 1 radio.
France, like many of its European neighbours, is witnessing a mushrooming of new coronavirus clusters. 
The number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care rose for the second straight day on Tuesday, reversing a 16-week downward trend. The disease has killed more than 30,000 people in France.
France is now testing some 576,000 people per week, an Health Ministry spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday, compared with 200,000 when President Emmanuel Macron began easing one of Europe's strictest lockdowns.
The strategy is working, health minister Olivier Veran said over the weekend. ""The virus is no longer tracking us, we are tracking it,"" he told Le Parisien.
The ministry's spokesman acknowledged ""localized problems"" but was adamant that France had chosen the right strategy.
But Lionel Barrand, who heads the Syndicat National des Jeunes Biologistes federation, said the open testing strategy amounted to hunting for a needle in a haystack and put laboratories under strain.
""The government threw sand in our wheels. It sent a lot of people to labs without prior warning,"" Barrand told Reuters.
Frustrated by the reluctance of some laboratories to invest in the manpower and operational changes needed to conduct testing, the government had considered requisitioning some of them, one government official said.

Thousands of Bulgarians have been demonstrating since early July, setting up tent camps and blocking intersections in the capital Sofia, accusing three-time premier Borissov of weakening state institutions for the benefit of powerful tycoons.
Borissov, 61, who has dominated Bulgarian politics for the past decade, did not disclose any details, but said he wanted to avoid the collapse of the government and dissolution of parliament at the time when the economy is being battered by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
He did not address the protesters' allegations, but stressed that his government had worked hard to reduce smuggling, hitting the interests of many local oligarchs.
""I am ready to leave at any time. I do not want any tension because of me,"" he told a group of GERB activists at a party assembly. ""I will hold talks with my coalition partners and offer options including one where I would leave and the government continues.""

The protests have eroded support for GERB to 14.5% from 21.7% in December according to an opinion poll.
A government reshuffle last month aimed at quashing public anger failed to placate protesters, and critics say Borissov's resignation might not be enough to calm public anger over endemic corruption.
On Wednesday, dozens of protesters gathered in front of a tech park where GERB was meeting, chanting ""Borissov is a disgrace - resignation and jail"". 

Over a decade after joining the European Union, Bulgaria remains its poorest member state. It also ranks as the bloc's most corrupt country according to Transparency International and is yet to jail a senior official on graft charges.

Reuters could not immediately verify the videos, which were obtained by Seoul-based Daily NK, which monitors North Korea, and the Associated Press. Other South Korean media also cited unnamed sources who reported the fire and explosions.
Citing an unnamed source inside North Korea, Daily NK reported on Wednesday that as many as 15 people had died in the explosion and resulting fire at a house in Hyesan, Yanggang Province.
The Associated Press quoted a travel agent in the Chinese border town of Changbai who said he observed the explosion and filmed a video of it, but did not know the cause.
The videos show a fire glowing over tree tops, punctuated by multiple explosions that send columns of flame into the sky.

LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (Reuters) - Northern Ireland peacemaker John Hume was remembered for his unshakeable commitment to non-violence at a small funeral on Wednesday where the pope, former U.S. President Bill Clinton and fellow Nobel Laureate, the Dalai Lama, sent messages of support.
Hume, the Roman Catholic architect of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement that ended 30 years of sectarian violence, was credited with dragging a British region convulsed by bloodshed to the negotiating table. He died on Monday aged 83.
Respecting COVID-19 restrictions, fewer than 100 mourners in masks, including Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin and the Catholic and Protestant leaders of Northern Ireland were dotted around the large St Eugene's Cathedral in Hume's native Derry. 
In messages read out by Bishop Donal McKeown, Pope Francis praised Hume's untiring efforts to promote peace, the Dalai Lama his deep conviction to the power of dialogue. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, shared their sadness at the loss of their friend.
""With his enduring sense of honour, he kept marching on against all odds towards a brighter future for all the children. He was Ireland's Martin Luther King,"" read the message from Clinton, whose hands-on role was central to bringing an end to the conflict that killed some 3,600 people.
Conscious of the pandemic, his family asked people to stay home and light a candle for peace at their door on Tuesday night.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a message that he lit a candle at the door of No. 10 Downing Street to remember ""a giant of a politician"".
One of Hume's sons, Aidan, was unable to attend due to the restrictions and watched online from his home in Massachusetts in a service that was broadcast and streamed live on both sides of the Irish border.
""If Dad were here today, witnessing the current tensions in the world, he wouldn't waste the opportunity to say a few words,"" Hume's son, John Hume Junior, told the mourners. 

""He'd talk about our common humanity, the need to respect diversity and difference, to protect and deepen democracy and to place non-violence at the absolute centre.""

PARIS (Reuters) - France on Wednesday stepped up financial support for wine growers faced with a deep drop in demand after lockdowns closed restaurants and bars and U.S. tariffs curbed exports.
""The state will increase to 250 million euros its support plan to wine growing and we will request this aid to be distributed as quickly as possible because cash needs are pressing,"" French Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Wednesday.
Castex made the announcement during a visit to the Menetou-Salon and Sancerre vineyards in the Loire region.
""The international situation, the health crisis, a drop in exports: our wine sector faces major difficulties. State support must continue and intensify,"" Castex said on Twitter earlier.
France has already provided some support, but the wine industry has called for more action.
In May, France cleared a 140 million euro ($165.87 million)crisis mechanism to distil surplus wine into industrial alcohol to be used to produce hand sanitisers.
Then in June, the government unveiled an additional 30 million euros of support for the wine industry, including 15 million for the launch of a private storage scheme for two million hectolitres of surplus wine, an alternative to distilling.
In addition to the impact of COVID-19, France's wine industry has suffered from U.S tariffs on imports imposed as part of the trade dispute between the European Union and the United States over aircraft subsidies.
In April, the European Commission decided to support crisis management measures in wine and other agriculture sectors affected by the coronavirus crisis.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's Azores Islands, some 1,400 km from the Portuguese coast, breached the national constitution by forcing air passengers to the popular tourist destination to quarantine for 14 days, the country's Constitutional Court has ruled. 
The court said authorities on the islands had treated people as if they were serving a short prison sentence by confining them in hotels, regardless of whether they had symptoms.
""The competence to legislate on rights, freedom and guarantees lies with the parliament, or the (national) government - and only with those two sovereign bodies,"" the court ruled. 
The regional government of the Azores had decided in March that all arriving air passengers had to stay in confinement for two weeks in a hotel. 
Authorities initially paid for the hotel but those arriving from May 8 onwards were told they had to pay for their own stay. 
The Constitutional Court's July 30 ruling, made public on Wednesday, came after a man launched a legal appeal over having to quarantine for two weeks in a hotel in Sao Miguel, the Azores' biggest island. 
A lower court decided the man, who had a family home in Sao Miguel, had been deprived of his freedom and ordered authorities to release him immediately. Court documents state the man's meals were sent to his room three times a day, he was not able to see his family or friends, and had to clean his room himself. 
After the lower court's ruling, prosecutors asked the Constitutional Court for clarification of the legal framework. 
Since the lower court's ruling in mid-May, those travelling to the Azores must now either take a COVID-19 test before their trip or on arrival if they wish to be admitted. 

Vasco Cordeiro, president of Azores' regional government, told reporters authorities had complied with both court decisions, but it had become apparent that the legal framework was not sufficient for dealing with the completely unexpected situation of the pandemic.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party is considering whether to pull Turkey out of an international accord designed to protect women, party officials said, alarming campaigners who see the pact as key to combating rising domestic violence.
The officials said the AKP is set to decide by next week whether to withdraw from the deal, just weeks after the vicious murder of a woman by an ex-boyfriend reignited a row over how to curb violence against women.
Despite signing the Council of Europe accord in 2011, pledging to prevent, prosecute and eliminate domestic violence and promote equality, Turkey saw 474 femicides last year, double the number seen in 2011, according to a group which monitors murders of women.
Many conservatives in Turkey say the pact, ironically forged in Istanbul, encourages violence by undermining family structures. Their opponents argue that the deal, and legislation approved in its wake, need to be implemented more stringently.
The row reaches not just within Erdogan's AKP but even his own family, with two of his children involved in groups on either side of the debate about the Istanbul Convention.
The AKP will decide in the next week whether to initiate legal steps to pull out of the accord, a senior party official told Reuters.
""There is a small majority (in the party) who argue it is right to withdraw,"" said the official, who argued however that abandoning the agreement when violence against women was on the rise would send the wrong signals.
Another AKP official argued on the contrary that the way to reduce the violence was to withdraw, adding that a decision would be reached next week.
The argument crystallised last month around the brutal killing of Pinar Gultekin, 27, a student in the south-western province of Mugla, who was strangled, burned and dumped in a barrel - the latest in a growing number of women killed by men in Turkey. 
An ex-boyfriend has been charged with murder and jailed pending trial, having confessed to the killing, according to media reports.
Opponents of the accord say it is part of the problem because it undermines traditional values which protect society.
""It is our religion which determines our fundamental values, our view of the family,"" said the Turkish Youth Foundation, whose advisory board includes the president's son Bilal Erdogan. It called for Turkey to withdraw from the accord.
The Women and Democracy Association (KADEM), of which Erdogan's daughter Sumeyye is deputy chairwoman, rejects that argument. ""We can no longer talk about 'family'...in a relationship where one side is oppressed and subject to violence,"" KADEM said.
""BREAKING WITH CIVILISED WORLD""
Many conservatives are also hostile to the principle of gender equality in the Istanbul Convention and see it as promoting homosexuality, given its principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.
Critics of the bid to withdraw from the pact say it would put Turkey further out of step with the values of the European Union, which it has sought to join for decades.
""This would really break Turkey away from the civilised world and the consequences may be very severe,"" Gamze Tascier, a lawmaker from the main opposition Republican People's Party, told Reuters.
Turkey would not be the first country to move towards ditching the accord. Poland's highest court is to scrutinize the pact after a cabinet member said Warsaw should quit the treaty which the nationalist government considers too liberal. [nL5N2F1534]
Turkish women's groups were set to protest on Wednesday to demand better implementation of the accord, taking to the streets after an online campaign in the wake of Gultekin's killing where they shared black-and-white selfies on Instagram.
Turkey does not keep official statistics on femicide. World Health Organization data has shown 38% of women in Turkey are subject to violence from a partner in their lifetime, compared to about 25% in Europe.
The government has taken measures such as tagging individuals known to resort to violence and creating a smartphone app for women to alert police, which has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times.

The annual rite, gathering top state and military officials and war veterans, was again staged in the southern hill town of Knin, the former bastion of rebel Serbs who opposed Zagreb's 1991 secession from Serbian-dominated federal Yugoslavia.
The Belgrade-backed nationalist Serbs seized a third of Croatian territory, declared a Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) and expelled the local Croat population.
After years of sporadic clashes and bouts of Serb shelling that at one point struck the capital Zagreb, a revamped Croatian army wrested back almost all of the breakaway RSK in a four-day August 1995 operation code-named Storm.
Boris Milosevic, one of four deputy premiers in the Croatian government and a top figure in the minority Serbs' SDSS party, on Wednesday became the first representative of his community to join the anniversary ceremony in 25 years.
""Going to Knin is not easy for me because of my personal tragedy and because of all the Serbs that lost someone in Operation Storm. But after 25 years, it is necessary to stop the hatred,"" he said before his arrival in Knin.
In the aftermath of the 1995 offensive, armed Croats plundered and torched scores of abandoned Serb properties and killed a number of elderly Serb civilians who remained in their homes - one of whom was Milosevic's grandmother.
Croatia, now a member of the European Union and NATO, later forged full diplomatic relations with Serbia though tensions endure amid disputes over borders and the fate of missing people from the war. 
Belgrade, which did not support Milosevic's presence in Knin, regards Operation Storm as an act of ethnic cleansing as some 200,000 ethnic Serbs fled to Bosnia and Serbia from the advance of Croatian forces.

""We also regret the victims of the war crimes committed by the Croats, which unfortunately did happen, as the legitimate right of self-defence is no justification for war crimes,"" Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic told the ceremony.

Badalamenti, 60, who had been a fugitive in Brazil since 2017, is wanted on charges of drug trafficking and bank fraud allegedly committed while living there under an alias, a statement said.
He was arrested at his mother's home in the coastal city of Castellammare del Golfo and taken to a prison in Palermo to await extradition procedures.
His father, Gaetano Badalamenti, was the boss of the mafia ""commission"" in the 1970s and infamous in organised crime history for ordering the murder of anti-mafia radio journalist Peppino Impastato in 1978 in the Sicilian city of Cinisi.
The elder Badalamenti took his family to Brazil in the 1980s to avoid the bloody mafia wars launched by the Corleone clan led by Toto Riina to assume total control of organised crime.
Gaetano Badalamenti was convicted of heroin trafficking in the United States in 1987 in the so-called ""Pizza Connection"" case and died in a Massachusetts prison in 2004 at the age of 80.

The programme, which during its original 1984-1996 run lampooned then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher as a tyrannical boss who ate raw steak and called her ministers ""the vegetables"", has been resurrected for a new series starting this year.
Pictures from the new incarnation showed an overweight rubber-faced Johnson flapping a badly-knotted neck tie beneath a messy shock of blond hair. 
His chief aide Cummings, in contrast, has his hands pressed together in contemplation under his chin, paired with steep arching eyebrows and an enlarged cranium.
The portrayal reflects what some see as the relationship between the two men at the top of government. 
Cummings, architect of the 2016 Brexit campaign, is regarded by critics as the most powerful unelected man in government with an outsized influence over his boss. 
Johnson cultivates an eccentric, comedic, yet intellectual persona that often divides opinion but helped win the trust of British voters in a landslide election victory last year. 
The new series will air on BritBox, a streaming service created by the BBC and  ITV  (LON:ITV) broadcasters
At its peak, Spitting Image drew audiences of 15 million viewers - roughly a quarter of the population - who tuned in to see its no-holds-barred caricatures of politicians, celebrities and even the royal family acting outrageously on screen.
Queen Elizabeth was mocked up as a middle-aged housewife and her son Prince Charles as a hapless victim of his growing ears.
The new series promises a more global lineup and has already unveiled mock-ups of Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The bloom is back at Lee's Flower and Card Shop in Washington's historic U Street neighborhood, with an added touch: Blue, green, yellow and white origami cranes spelling out the words ""Black Lives Matter"" on the storefront window.
The signs reflect a slow return to normalcy as life and business adapt to the coronavirus pandemic and racial justice movement that both erupted in the first half of 2020.
The business, run by sisters Stacie Lee Banks and Kristie Lee, stayed open during the months of mandated shutdown in Washington, doing deliveries as its doors stayed shut.
Clients have been welcomed back into the store since June 22, although a table bars anyone from stepping in more than 10 feet. For wedding and funeral consultations customers may go further inside, but only after checking their temperatures.
""I think that we could have reopened more than we did, but we're still being cautious about our space and not letting people in, because our employees are concerned,"" Banks said.
When D.C. businesses reopened, the city government gave small businesses a supply of masks and hand sanitizer upon request. The shop, one of several U.S. small businesses that Reuters is following through the crisis, also bought face shields for employees and a thermometer. 
The sisters had to modify staff schedules, with people working the same number of hours over fewer days.
The third generation owners of the family business also alternate their days in the shop to care for their mother, who was diagnosed with dementia this summer. 
Staying open during the pandemic means rolling with unexpected punches, like when an employee attended a gathering where someone later tested positive for the coronavirus. The employee needed to quarantine, forcing the shop to juggle shifts.
""We're a small staff, but we're mighty, and so when one person is gone, we have to try to figure out how to replace them,"" Banks said.
BUSINESS BEGINS TO BLOOM
Business has rebounded from a slump in the early days of the pandemic lockdown. Between June 1 and July 28, sales jumped 71% from a year earlier.
Being a Black-owned business may be a factor, Banks said. The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May sparked national protests over racial injustice and a ""buy Black"" movement that she said has led customers to her shop.
Many people are sending flowers to their loved ones instead of visiting them. And orders have risen for funerals and a pandemic trend, micro-weddings.
""Where we ordinarily would have 20 deliveries a day, we're having 40 and 50 deliveries a day,"" Banks said. Three more people have been hired, bringing her staff total to 12.
Banks served on Washington's reopening advisory committee, and is happy with how the district had reopened.
""I really think they did a good job by not reopening too soon, because look at all the places that are having to close back down, like California, Texas,"" Banks said.
As the White House and Congress debate the next coronavirus relief bill, Banks said she would like more business funding and clarity on Paycheck Protection Program loans. 
The shop received a $75,000 loan under the program, allowing it to rehire furloughed staff.

""They say it's forgivable, but they haven't come out with any clear-cut rules on how to make it forgivable,"" Banks said. ""I am on pins and needles.""

HANOI (Reuters) - A new coronavirus outbreak in Vietnam spread to two more provinces on Wednesday, the country's health minister said, as the COVID-19 task force declared the contagion ""under control"" in the central city where the outbreak began. 
Aggressive contact-tracing, targeted testing and strict quarantining had helped Vietnam contain earlier outbreaks, but it is now battling infections in at least 10 cities and provinces, after going more than three months without domestic transmission.
The health ministry confirmed two new cases on Wednesday, bringing Vietnam's total infections to 672, with 8 deaths. 
The new outbreak was first reported on July 25 in the tourist resort city of Danang and has spread to major urban centres like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, which have since closed entertainment venues, restricted gatherings and tested tens of thousands of people. 
Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long told state media on Wednesday the outbreak had expanded to the provinces of Bac Giang near Hanoi and Lang Son, bordering China, both linked to the Danang infections.
State media and government officials have made strong statements against illegal immigration since the new outbreak, but no official links have been made.
The outbreak in Danang, currently under lockdown alongside Quang Nam province, was ""under control"", the government's COVID-19 steering committee said late Tuesday.
The source of the Danang outbreak remains unclear. 
All but six of its cases have been traced to three of the city's hospitals, the committee said, and the six had not infected anyone else.
""The second wave of the pandemic may be happening elsewhere in the world, but we are determined to not let that happen in Vietnam,"" committee head Vu Duc Dam said in the statement, which predicted more cases and deaths ahead. 

""We do not intend to repeat the story of a widespread, national lockdown either. If everything is done well, we are confident we can fight the disease"".

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 06:41AM ET</span>",Special Report: COVID opens new doors for China's gene giant,"By Kirsty Needham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - As countries scramble to test for the novel coronavirus, a Chinese company has become a go-to name around the world.
BGI Group, described in one 2015 study as ""Goliath"" in the fast-growing field of genomics research, is using an opening created by the pandemic to expand its footprint globally. In the past six months, it says it has sold 35 million rapid COVID-19 testing kits to 180 countries and built 58 labs in 18 countries. Some of the equipment has been donated by BGI's philanthropic arm, promoted by China's embassies in an extension of China's virus diplomacy. 
But as well as test kits, the company is distributing gene-sequencing technology that U.S. security officials say could threaten national security. This is a sensitive area globally. Sequencers are used to analyse genetic material, and can unlock powerful personal information. 
In science journals and online, BGI is calling on international health researchers to send in virus data generated on its equipment, as well as patient samples that have tested positive for COVID-19, to be shared publicly via China's government-funded National GeneBank.
As BGI's foothold in the gene-sequencing industry grows, a senior U.S. administration official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, so does the risk China could harvest genetic information from populations around the world.
Underpinning BGI's global expansion are the Shenzhen-based company's links to the Chinese government, which include its role as operator of China's national genetic database and its research in government-affiliated key laboratories. BGI, which says in stock market filings it aims to help the ruling Communist Party achieve its goal to ""seize the commanding heights of international biotechnology competition,"" is coming under increasing scrutiny in an escalating Cold War between Washington and Beijing, Reuters found. 
Reuters found no evidence that BGI is violating patient privacy protections where these apply. Responding to questions from the news agency, BGI said it is not owned by the Chinese government. 
""Under the current political climate, the fear raised about the use of BGI's technology is unfounded and misleading,"" BGI said in a statement to Reuters. ""BGI's mission is, and has always been, using genomics to benefit people's health and wellbeing."" 
China's foreign ministry said in a statement the country has been open, transparent and responsible in ""sharing information and experience with the international community, providing supplies to relevant countries"" including COVID-19 test kits and protective equipment, and helping countries improve epidemic control.
The extent of BGI's endeavours to dominate an industry with geostrategic value, as well as of its efforts to gather genetic data from around the world, was pieced together by Reuters from public documents and dozens of interviews with scientists, researchers and health officials. 
Some U.S. officials warn of a dual risk to national security from BGI: Sensitive genetic information about U.S. citizens may fall into foreign hands, and American companies stand to lose their innovative edge in the field of genomics to Chinese firms.
Earlier this year, the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) published practical tips for health services to avoid ""potential threats posed by foreign powers"" in connection with COVID-19 tests. Other officials draw parallels between BGI and Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese telecommunications titan whose 5G technology the United States says could be used to capture personal data that Beijing could exploit. Huawei has said it would refuse to cooperate with spying. 
Sharing data is essential for medical research. But in the case of genetic data, officials and scientists say the risks are that it could be weaponized.
Individuals can be identified by a portion of their DNA, and some researchers have found genetic links with behaviours such as depressive disorder. A hostile actor could use such data to target individuals for surveillance, extortion or manipulation, according to a comprehensive report prepared for the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence by science and medical experts in January, which added that such associations are not yet well understood. 
Knowledge of the genetic makeup of national decision-makers or the military, and their propensity to act in certain ways, could be used by adversarial intelligence agencies as a mechanism of influence, said the report, ""Safeguarding the Bioeconomy,"" from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. Genetic data could reveal a U.S. vulnerability to specific diseases, it added. 
As companies race to develop and patent biological drugs for the global market, the ethnic diversity of the U.S. population makes U.S. genomic data more valuable than data from countries with homogeneous populations, the report said. That's because the more varied the data, the bigger the advantage in identifying genetic disease. The report raised the possibility BGI could amass DNA sequence information from U.S. genetic samples that would give it an ""asymmetrical"" advantage over U.S. firms.
Genetic information, including family medical history, ""is of enormous value and can be exploited by foreign regimes for a range of security and economic purposes,"" Bill Evanina, director of the NCSC, told Reuters in response to questions about Chinese genomic companies. 
BGI and Huawei have said they work together. In a video that is no longer available on Huawei's site, a BGI executive said it processes ""staggering volumes of data"" from its gene sequencers, stored on Huawei's high-powered systems. In response to questions from Reuters about whether this information could be shared with China's government, Huawei said only users of its technology can define who to share data with. ""Huawei's Cloud technology and cloud computing services are secure and compliant with international security standards,"" it said, adding it complies with all laws. 
BGI said it does not have access to patient data from its diagnostic tests. 
The company said it is conducting scientific research on the genomes, or genetic blueprints, of the virus and patients with COVID-19. But it said this research is separate from the tests it provides to other nations to diagnose COVID-19. 
Asked about China's genomics ambitions, a U.S. State Department spokesman said: ""We believe countries need to be able to trust that vendors will not threaten national security, privacy or intellectual property. Trust cannot exist where a company is subject to an authoritarian government, like the People's Republic of China, that lacks prohibitions on the misuse of data."" 
FROM ""WHO1"" TO FIRE EYE
BGI was involved in China's response to the coronavirus from the start. Its scientists were among teams that sequenced the virus genome and shared that information in January. 
On Dec. 26, BGI collected and tested a throat swab from a 44-year-old man who was a patient in the military hospital in Wuhan, according to a record of the sequence that was shared with other researchers on a global database. The World Health Organisation (WHO) learned of cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause in Wuhan on Dec. 31; the blueprint of the patient's virus was named WHO1. 
The week after that first test, BGI took swabs from another three patients at the hospital who had been to the local seafood market, according to a paper published by Chinese scientists in The Lancet on Jan. 29. BGI sequenced these samples. 
By month's end, the company had designed an automated laboratory for the Wuhan government to massively increase testing. BGI called the design ""Fire Eye,"" after the ability of China's fabled Monkey King to see disguised threats.
The labs were replicated in China, and the Mammoth Foundation – a charity established a few months earlier by BGI – started donating tests and laboratories worldwide. By mid-year, BGI's COVID-19 lab equipment was installed in at least 10 countries thanks to donations by the charity, company statements and local news reports show. 
China's government helped coordinate some of BGI's deals. The Solomon Islands said it had received a $300,000 cheque from the Chinese embassy, which advised the island nation to buy tests and lab equipment from BGI. China's foreign ministry said China has done its best to ensure safety and reliability of medical supplies. 
Besides donations, BGI has reported lab deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars. As technicians in white protective suits build Fire Eye labs in countries from Australia to Saudi Arabia, BGI Genomics, a listed subsidiary of the group, said last month demand would help boost profits by 700% for the first half of the year to more than $218 million.
POWERFUL INFORMATION
There are two main aspects to BGI's COVID-19 programme.
First, diagnostic test kits, which come with high-speed processing robots to handle large volumes, work by detecting the genetic material of the virus in a patient's sample to tell if a person has been infected. BGI says these tests do not give access to patient data. 
The second part, which the company offers as an add-on in its marketing materials, is gene-sequencing equipment. 
In the pandemic, researchers around the globe are using sequencers to track mutations in the virus, see which mutation is spreading, and choose strains or samples to work with for vaccine development. 
Underpinning demand for DNA sequencers is also their role driving a lucrative medical field known as precision or personal medicine. 
Rather than seek one-drug-suits-all treatments, precision medicine focuses on how different people's genes interact with their environment to help predict their risk of disease, or their response to medications. 
In July, BGI Genomics, BGI's listed subsidiary on the Shenzhen stock exchange filed for a $293 million capital hike, telling investors in the filing their support would help it collect as much patient data as possible, ""on the human body, genome, people's living habits and environment, so we can understand more, and diagnose in a more precise way."" 
The company also says it plans to promote the Fire Eye labs it rolls out for COVID-19 for precision medicine after the pandemic.
FROM CUSTOMER TO RIVAL
BGI was set up by four scientists in 1999 as a non-profit research body called the Beijing Genomics Institute, to enable China to join a global project to map the human genome. Since 2016, its headquarters have housed and operated the government-funded China National GeneBank, a biorepository of 20 million plant, animal and human genetic samples.
In 2010, BGI received a $1.5 billion loan from the state-run China Development Bank, some of which it used to buy 128 sequencing machines from an American firm, San Diego-based Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN).
Two years after that, Beijing said in a State Council plan for the bio-industry that it wanted China to develop gene sequencing technology. In 2013, BGI succeeded in buying Illumina's largest competitor, California-based Complete Genomics, for $118 million. That is now the U.S. research arm of the Chinese group. BGI Group launched its own sequencing equipment in 2015; the group floated BGI Genomics in 2017.
This year, BGI Genomics told investors that it had cost $95 million to sequence a whole human genome in 2001. By 2014, Illumina had announced it reduced the cost to below $1,000. Now BGI could do it for $600.
In May, MGI Tech, the BGI subsidiary that makes DNA sequencers, raised $1 billion in venture capital.
But after BGI indicated it would launch its sequencers in the United States, it ran into a challenge - an accusation of intellectual property violations from Illumina. In June, a U.S. court issued a preliminary injunction banning the sale, distribution or promotion of BGI's materials and equipment, pending a trial to decide if the technology was copied from Illumina. 
Seeking the injunction, Illumina's lawyers told the court: ""BGI plans extreme price cutting and ambitious sales directly against Illumina.""
BGI declined to comment on the case. In court papers, BGI denied infringing Illumina's patents and asked that parts of the injunction be put on hold while it appealed the ruling. Illumina told Reuters COVID-19 will boost sequencer demand. 
""MORE VALUABLE THAN GOLD""
With a price tag of between $20,000 for a portable model and $1 million for a powerful machine, gene sequencers are an important part of a country's pandemic armoury. 
Even before the new coronavirus, in October 2019, Ethiopia's government said it would establish a genomics lab with equipment donated by BGI. Months later, Illumina donated sequencers to 10 African nations to help monitor the virus, the U.S. company said. 
At least five countries worldwide have received BGI's sequencers with the Fire Eye labs, according to statements the countries or BGI have released. In many cases BGI does not own or operate the Fire Eye laboratories, but simply provides the equipment, the company told Reuters. 
For BGI, sequencers offer more than money. It has said they will also help it study the virus in large populations. 
One recipient of BGI sequencing equipment is Serbia, the Balkan country where Beijing has invested heavily as part of its One Belt, One Road initiative to open trade links for Chinese companies. Two labs have opened there. Both were donated by Chinese companies, Beijing and Belgrade said. 
After the first lab opened, coordinator Jelena Begovic told Reuters in May that DNA sequencers help researchers by linking genetic information on the virus with genetic information on the patient. In future, she said, the labs would underpin cooperation with BGI.
""Information is nowadays sometimes more valuable than gold,"" she said. ""In that sense, this is also a source of information for them regarding this region."" 
Prime Minister Ana Brnabic told an opening ceremony that after the pandemic, ""We will have the most modern lab, which will enable us to start talking with BGI on how to build the most advanced institute for precision medicine and genetics in this region.""
Sweden, too, has received sequencing equipment from BGI. The Karolinska Institute, a medical university in Stockholm, hopes to use it to identify a human genotype that is more susceptible to the disease, microbiology professor Lars Engstrand said in a presentation on BGI's website. 
Asked by Reuters about the risk Swedish genomic data may be collected by the Chinese government, Engstrand said this was ""a very relevant question"" and the institute's IT security department had scrutinised its collaboration with BGI.
""There will be no sequence information sent to any other servers or computers outside our institute,"" said Engstrand, who heads the institute's Center for Translational Microbiome Research, in an email. ""No cloud solution will be used for these sensitive data."" 
He was unsure if the institute would go ahead with sequencing human genomes, he added.
""CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT""
Researchers globally are sharing virus data, but BGI has also set up its own sharing platform, the ""Global Initiative on Open-source Genomics"" for the new coronavirus. 
On a website together with the China National GeneBank, giogs.genomics.cn, it invites international scientists to send in virus information including patient age, gender and location, collected in accordance with local regulations. 
""You will be asked to share virus genome data to the public via (the National GeneBank) in the first instance,"" the site says.
In exchange, the site offers sequencing services and ""considerable support"" for the cost of kits and reagents.
BGI told Reuters it had received no patient samples under this new programme - samples have been sequenced in local facilities.
It said its goal is to ""develop more high-quality genome data of (the) virus with BGI's sequencing solution."" It said it wants to facilitate the rapid and open sharing of genome data to support research on the virus.
Besides the National GeneBank, BGI's headquarters also house at least four government-designated ""Key Laboratories"" for genomic research, which are also government-funded. BGI said this funding is used for research, not operations.
One of the labs supported a study by a dozen BGI researchers who sequenced the genomes of more than 300 COVID-19 patients in a Shenzhen hospital, according to a paper they shared on MedRvix, a website for pre-published scientific papers. 
""We and the others are continuing to recruit patients and data in China and around the world to understand the host genetic background underlying the varying clinical outcome of the patients,"" the researchers wrote. 
As rapid COVID-19 tests are adopted globally, the researchers added, it will be important to study patients who don't show symptoms. The study's lead author didn't respond to questions from Reuters. 
SECURITY APPARATUS
BGI's pandemic push comes as tensions between China and the United States are mounting, including over China's genetic programme. 
Two BGI subsidiaries were blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department last month for China's alleged human rights violations. Washington alleged BGI is involved in conducting genetic analysis of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang in western China, where U.N. experts and activists say Muslims were held in detention centres. 
BGI said in a statement it ""does not condone and would never be involved in any human-rights abuses."" Chinese officials say the camps are educational and vocational institutions and deny they violate the human rights of the detainees. 
China's security apparatus is a BGI customer. Another BGI subsidiary, Forensic Genomics International, says on its website it works with China's Public Security Bureau. It had multiple contracts with the police to collect male DNA samples, as well as samples from some newborn babies, a survey this year by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found. 

BGI said the forensics subsidiary complied with scientific ethics and the law. The foreign ministry declined to comment.

Average time that children have spent on schoolwork has fallen to 3.6 hours a day since then, from 7.4 hours normally, according to the Ifo institute survey of 1,099 parents conducted in June and published on Wednesday.
With schools due to start reopening again fully in the coming weeks, the survey found 64% of parents believed their children had learnt a lot less during the pandemic. 
Meanwhile, time they spend watching television, playing computer games or using phones has risen to 5.2 hours a day from four. 
Girls have used consoles and phones an hour less a day than boys, but spent half an hour more on their studies, 20 minutes more on reading and creative pastimes and 15 minutes more on social media.
Parents doubled the time they spent helping their children with schoolwork to one hour a day, the survey found, with many having more arguments than before.
""The results show how important it is that we return to normal school lessons while respecting protective measures,"" said Ludger Woessmann, head of the Ifo centre for the economics of education.
Children will have to wear masks at least some of the time and adhere to social distancing.

Germany has had relatively few COVID-19 deaths, thanks in part to widespread testing and a well-equipped healthcare system. But daily cases have ticked up in recent weeks, with health experts citing laxer adherence to hygiene and distancing rules.

Meghan, wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, is suing Associated Newspapers over articles in its Mail on Sunday paper that included parts of a handwritten letter she had sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.
As part of its defence, the paper argues that it had published the letter in response to an article in the U.S. magazine People which was based on anonymous interviews with five of Meghan's friends. 

Judge Mark Warby ruled at London's High Court that their names could not be published as part of the her lawsuit in which she says the Mail invaded her privacy and breached her copyright. The anonymity issue is a preliminary matter with the full trial not expected until next year.

Mostafa Salehi, one of several men sentenced to death for their roles in anti-government protests in recent months, was convicted of shooting Sajjad Shah-Sanai, a member of the Revolutionary Guards. 
His execution was carried out as a retribution sentence demanded by the victim's parents, ISNA said. 
The unrest of late 2017 and early 2018 began as demonstrations against economic hardship that spread across the country, triggering violence that killed 21 people and led to thousands of arrests, according to officials.
The economy is again in freefall, crippled by U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic, and activists say the death sentences against Salehi and others are aimed at intimidating future protesters. Iran's clerical rulers have denied this.
""The silence of the international community about the execution of Salehi can be considered a green light for more executions,"" said Mahmoud Amiri-Moghaddam, director of the Oslo-based Iran Human Rights group, in a statement.
In July, the judiciary suspended the executions of three other men linked to anti-government protests last November, after the hashtag “Don't execute” was tweeted millions of times in Iran's Farsi language by Iranians inside and outside the country. 
Salehi was executed in Isfahan ""at the request of (Shah-Sanai's) parents,"" ISNA said, quoting a statement from the province's justice department.
Under Iran’s Sharia, or Islamic, law, the family of a victim of murder and some other crimes can demand the death of the guilty party, or commute the sentence in return for financial compensation.
Iranian officials have accused arch-foe the United States and government opponents living in exile of fomenting unrest.
In June, Iran's judiciary said it had sentenced to death Ruhollah Zam for allegedly fuelling the late 2017 riots on social media.
Zam, a Paris-based journalist-turned-activist, was detained in 2019 after apparently being lured to Iraq, according to the Revolutionary Guards.

MINSK (Reuters) - Under President Alexander Lukashenko, the average monthly wage in Belarus has risen in dollar terms to $500 from $50 in 1999. For voters, there's just one problem: it hit $500 in 2010, and has been stuck there ever since.
As Lukashenko, a 65-year-old former collective farm manager with a fondness for a Soviet-style command economy, seeks re-election on Sunday after 26 years in power, his economic record is being found wanting by some voters. 
""My daughter tells me all the time: I love my country, I want to live in my country,"" said Dmitry, a 53-year-old Minsk resident protesting against Lukashenko last week. 
""But with what is happening here, there are no prospects for young people. No future,"" he said, saying his daughter lived in the Czech Republic and had no plans to return. 
He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals in a country where little dissent is allowed.
Once cast by Washington as ""Europe's last dictator"", Lukashenko controls the levers of power in the strategically important country between East and West through which Russia sends its oil. He is expected to be re-elected. 
But he faces protests by opposition supporters rallying around his main opponent, a former English teacher whose husband was jailed and cannot run himself.
Lukashenko is also facing criticism over his human rights record and dismissal of COVID-19 as ""a psychosis"". 
His once popular promise of ""$500 for everyone"" was a reflection of rising prosperity in the 2000s, but has become the butt of internet memes. 
""People are really sick of it, people want change, people want some kind of development,"" said Vadim Iossub, a senior analyst at financial company Alpari Eurasia. 
Fraying ties between Belarus and Russia have prompted Moscow to scale back subsidised energy supplies that previously propped up Lukashenko's rule, creating a $700-million budget hole as the coronavirus pandemic tipped the economy into recession.
Hundreds of thousands of Belarusians have moved abroad in recent years. Lukashenko said on Tuesday the population had fallen by 8%.
UNWRITTEN AGREEMENT
Around 70% of the economy and two-thirds of the workforce have remained in state hands in the former Soviet republic. 
While the government has cut red tape for private entrepreneurs, whom Lukashenko once derided as ""leeches"", the economy is dominated by public companies receiving government loans and subsidies.
The model has been underpinned by cheap Russian gas and crude oil, processed in Belarusian refineries and exported.
Addressing the nation on Tuesday, Lukashenko promised to double wages within five years and resisted calls for rapid change, casting Belarus as an island of stability at a time of global turmoil.
Lukashenko said he expected the economy to grow by 3-4% in coming years. He said his statist model should deliver that if production and exports are ramped up and Belarus starts to manufacture $4 billion of goods it currently imports annually. 
""For the entire term of my presidency, I have not found an answer to the question: why are state-owned enterprises such an eyesore to everyone?"" he said.
Belarus grew by an average of less than 1% annually between 2010-2020. In 2012, the purchasing power of Belarusian wages was 73 percent of that in neighbouring Poland. By 2020, it had dropped to 60 percent, according to official data.
Valery Tsepkalo, an election opponent who fled abroad fearing arrest, told Reuters Lukashenko had broken an ""unwritten agreement"" with voters to deliver prosperity in exchange for political obedience.

""He deprived Belarus people of political freedoms and he also deprives Belarus people of economic growth. This is one of the reasons society started to protest,"" he said.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>","Uganda's tough approach curbs COVID, even as Africa nears 1 million cases","By Elias Biryabarema
KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's crumbling public hospitals, doctors' strikes and corruption scandals make its success in the fight against the new coronavirus all the more unlikely.
But the nation of 42 million people has recorded just over 1,200 cases and five deaths since March, a strikingly low total for such a large country.
As the number of cases in Africa approaches one million, Uganda's experience shows what can be accomplished when a government with a firm grip on power acts quickly and enforces a strict lockdown. But its success came at a cost, critics say.
Jobs were lost, and economic growth is set to plunge to as low as 0.4% in 2020, from 5.6% last year, according to the World Bank.
Some pregnant women died in labour, unable to reach hospitals because of travel restrictions. Security forces - criticised by rights groups for abuses - beat and arrested some rule-breakers. 
Opposition leaders accuse the government of using the pandemic as an excuse to restrict political gatherings and arrest opponents, charges the government denies.
""A jobless person is better than a dead person,"" state minister for health Robinah Nabbanja told Reuters. ""The lockdown was completely justified.""
LOCKDOWN
Uganda's approach contrasts with that of many other African countries, which did not impose such strict measures and began easing them long before infections peaked to protect their fragile economies and mostly poor populations.
Some now face rapidly accelerating outbreaks that could overwhelm their public health systems, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.
Uganda's stringent measures bought the government time to prepare its health system and learn lessons about the disease, said Tim Bromfield, regional director for East and Southern Africa at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a U.K.-based think-tank. 
""All governments are balancing lives versus livelihoods.""
Uganda closed schools and banned large gatherings three days before confirming its first case on March 21. By the end of March, most businesses were shut, vehicle movement was banned, and an overnight curfew was in force. Masks became mandatory in public in May.
The East African nation's response was shaped by battling deadly infectious diseases like Ebola and Marburg virus, public health experts said.
The country was already on alert because of an Ebola outbreak in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo when COVID-19 hit, said Alex Ario, director of the government-affiliated National Institute of Public Health. 
Teams were in place to educate the public and trace those infected. Passengers were already being screened at airports. Isolation wards were ready to receive patients, and anyone infected was hospitalized.
""Uganda knew where to conduct their surveillance,"" said John Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. ""The lesson from them is you should know your pandemic.""
Uganda - like China - could enforce aggressive containment measures with little domestic opposition.
In March, local media carried images of a paramilitary force beating fruit vendors and pedestrians for breaking work and travel restrictions. Military spokeswoman Brigadier Flavia Byekwaso said they were ""overzealous in enforcing the measures.""
Bruce Kirenga, who heads the Makerere University Lung Institute, said strong public health measures likely reduced the amount of virus in circulation.
He noted that around 95% of Uganda's cases are asymptomatic or very mild. Some scientists suggest that patients exposed to a higher number of pathogens develop more severe cases.
HUNGER BITES
Neighbouring Rwanda, which also took an aggressive approach, has recorded five deaths in a country of 12 million. Other countries with low fatalities include the small island nation of Seychelles, which quickly closed its borders and had no deaths, and Botswana, which has fewer than 2.5 million people and two deaths.
South Africa imposed one of the world's strictest lockdowns when it had just 400 cases. But the measures battered its struggling economy, and the government began easing some of them within weeks, under pressure from business leaders, trade unions and opposition parties.
It now faces a runaway epidemic that accounts for roughly half the continent's 975,000 cases and 21,000 deaths. 
Public health experts believe the number of infections and deaths in Africa is higher than official figures suggest, noting low levels of testing in most nations. But with a few exceptions, countries have not reported hospitals being overwhelmed.
Uganda's figures are considered more reliable than most: it has carried out more than 250,000 tests and works closely with international institutions, said Dr Peter Waiswa, a public health expert at Makerere University College of Health Sciences.
Uganda is now easing its lockdown, but people like Wilson Munyakayanza want it lifted. The father-of-three has not worked since losing his job as a bar manager in March. 

""I go hungry sometimes and eat only once in a day,"" he said. ""Coronavirus hasn't killed us but the hell of going hungry is not that far from death.""

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Australian politician's staffer investigated for advancing China's interests,"By Kirsty Needham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian federal police raided the home and office of a man employed by an Australian politician as part of a foreign interference investigation into whether he was working to advance ""Chinese state interests"", according to court documents.
The disclosure is made in documents lodged on Monday in Australia's High Court by the employee, John Zhang, who is seeking to quash the search warrants used by police and the return of seized computer evidence.
Zhang, who could not be reached for comment, has not been charged with any offence. His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
The case is the first test of the foreign interference law which was introduced in 2018, spurred in part by a classified Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) report on Chinese activity.
The legislation sparked anger from Beijing which consistently denies it meddles in the political affairs of other countries.
Federal police searched and seized material from Zhang's Sydney home, business premises, and the parliamentary office of his employer, New South Wales (NSW) state Labor politician Shaoquett Moselmane on June 26.
Moselmane, who has been suspended from the NSW Labor party following the raids, has previously said he had not done anything wrong and was not a suspect.
The court documents said Zhang was an Australian citizen who migrated from China in 1989 and had been employed part-time by Moselmane since 2018.
According to details of the search warrants described in the court documents, Zhang was under investigation for allegedly concealing from Moselmane that he was acting on behalf of, or in collaboration with, the ""Chinese State and party apparatus including the Ministry of State Security and the United Front Work Department"".
The documents said it was alleged Zhang was suspected of acting on behalf of the ""Chinese state and Party apparatus"" in a private social media chat group with Moselmane, to advance the policy goals of the Chinese government.
He is alleged to have encouraged Moselmane to advocate for ""Chinese state interests"", they said.
This conduct is alleged to be unlawful because it was covert and sought to influence an Australian political process, the documents said.
Zhang's lawyers argue in the High Court application that the foreign interference law breaches Australia's constitution because it restricts freedom of political communication and attempts to influence political decisions.
Offences under the foreign interference law can attract jail terms of up to 15 years.
An Australian Federal Police spokesman wouldn't comment further on the case, saying ""it is an ongoing investigation"".

""I'm not on holiday and I'm not abandoning Spain. This is just a parenthesis,"" he said in a message to friends, according to the newspaper.
Dogged by allegations of corruption, Juan Carlos decided to leave Spain to prevent his personal affairs from overshadowing his son King Felipe's reign, the royal palace said on Monday, stunning Spaniards.
But, with no official confirmation of the 82-year-old's whereabouts, speculation remains rife. El Pais, also reporting that the former king told friends his departure would be temporary, added: ""Others, in the government, think it won't be that easy.""
Juan Carlos came to the throne in 1975 after the death of General Francisco Franco and was widely respected for his role in helping guide Spain from dictatorship to democracy, but recent scandals have tarnished his image.
News of the former monarch's exit is continuing to make huge waves at home.
An online petition to change the name of Madrid's King Juan Carlos university had racked up more than 39,000 signatures on Wednesday morning. 
""Corruption cases surrounding the Royal Family keep appearing, torpedoing the image of a monarchy that had been presented to us as 'wholesome' and 'humble'"" the petition read. 
Citing anonymous sources, El Pais and El Confidencial say Juan Carlos, who his keeping his title of King Emeritus, is in Portugal, where he spent part of his youth. 
La Vanguardia and ABC newspapers report he travelled by car to Portugal before flying to the Dominican Republic where he is staying as the guest of a wealthy family. 
But Dominican authorities told Reuters the king's last stay in the country was between Feb. 28 and March 2 and they had no information about a possible arrival.
A Royal Palace spokesman and a lawyer for Juan Carlos both said they had nothing to say. They have made no public comment beyond Monday's announcement of the king's departure.
In recent months, Swiss and Spanish prosecutors began investigating allegations of bribes relating to a high-speed rail contract. 

While Juan Carlos is not formally under investigation several details of the probes were leaked to the press, piling on the pressure for the king to take action to protect the monarchy. Through his lawyer Juan Carlos has repeatedly declined to comment on the case.

1340,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 03:31AM ET</span>",EU effort to stem African migration leaves some ex-smugglers empty handed,"By Edward McAllister
AGADEZ, Niger (Reuters) - Andre Chani said he once earned thousands of dollars a month driving Europe-bound migrants from Niger's desert trading hub of Agadez to Libya. 
But in 2016, he said, police in Niger impounded his two white pick-up trucks as part of an effort to stem the flow of Africans onto European shores. So Chani, 44, applied for 2.5 million CFA francs ($4,511) in aid from a European Union (EU)-funded program to start trucking agricultural produce to neighbouring Algeria.
He never heard back, he said, so briefly turned to drug smuggling to support his family. Now he scrapes by growing onions, he said.
Chani is one of many would-be entrepreneurs in this ancient city, long a launch point for northbound travelers, to seek support from the vast EU fund, established in 2015 to address the root causes of illegal migration to Europe. A spike in migration from sub-Saharan Africa in the last decade has proved deadly to thousands and created a refugee crisis in countries like Italy and Spain.
Yet the EU money has been slow to arrive: Only half the 4.7 billion euros ($5.5 billion) from the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) approved over the last five years has been distributed, according to statistics on the fund’s website.
""It is frustrating that the help is so late,"" Mohamed Agali, head of migration at the Regional Council of Agadez, the local governing body, told Reuters, referring to the money Chani sought. ""The EU wants to stop migration, but to do that you need to help the people recover. Without that, they will have to try something else.""
An EU official familiar with the program said the rollout in Agadez was “in line with the timings for EU processes.” The official, who declined to be named, citing EU protocol, also said it took Agadez authorities longer than expected to draw up a list of potential beneficiaries, evaluate their proposals and purchase goods. The authorities did not respond to requests for comment.
Under EU rules, local officials buy merchandise and equipment for EUTF beneficiaries. They are not allowed to receive cash. The Agadez business proposals were submitted for approval to a committee including local authorities, aid groups and ex-traffickers - not EU representatives.
Some phases of the EUTF program were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, the official said. But that did not affect Chani and many other Agape residents who applied long before the outbreak.
MIGRATION CRISIS
Thousands of migrants have perished since 2010 on the journey northward, often during crossings of the desert in open-back pick-up trucks or the Mediterranean Sea in overloaded, rickety boats. In 2016, about 300,000 migrants passed through Niger to Libya. That dropped to around 50,000 in 2019, due largely to Niger’s EU-backed clamp-down.
The Agadez program was set up the following year to jump-start small businesses for former smugglers. It was one of more than 200 such projects launched in 26 African countries, and one of 12 in Niger. All told, EUTF projects have created over 66,000 jobs in Africa, the fund’s website says.
Since its genesis, EU data show, about 42% of the more than 2,300 business plans submitted in Agadez have been approved for funding. Of those applicants with approved business plans, the data show, less than half have received the assistance.
Twenty people from Agadez who identified themselves as former smugglers told Reuters they had submitted applications in 2017 - sometimes more than one. They said they either received no assistance or not enough to replace lost livelihoods. Some also said the application process was infuriatingly complex and time-consuming.
Reuters was unable to independently confirm most individual stories, because the applicants did not keep copies of their business proposals and correspondence, and the EU would not address questions about individual cases.
However, the EU official said it was “unrealistic” to match the kind of compensation ex-smugglers used to earn trafficking migrants. “Let us not forget that 10 million Nigeriens live on less than two euros a day,” the official said.
Among the 20 people Reuters interviewed, four said they received aid. However, they said they were given cash, not goods, by local suppliers - which is against EU rules - and that the funds were less than the value of the goods they were promised.
Agadez leaders told Reuters that the growing ranks of unemployed in the city could make residents susceptible to recruitment by groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State. Although the region has remained largely free of Islamist violence, attacks elsewhere in Niger surged in 2019, mainly along the western border with Mali and Burkina Faso.
Critics of the EU program, including philanthropies, human rights groups and migration experts, say the European fund was hastily put together, with slow and opaque decision-making and poor oversight.
""Again and again with these EU migration-related projects, the top line is about stopping migration to Europe, and they become blind to the problems along the way,"" said Raphael Shilhav, EU migration policy advisor at anti-poverty charity Oxfam International.
POORER THAN BEFORE
Without a way to support his wife and two children, Chani said he agreed to transport a truckload of drugs from Agadez to the town of Ingal, 150 kilometers (93 miles) to the west.
He said he did not know what drugs he was carrying and quit when he didn't get paid for his first run.
Another former trafficker, Moussa Ditresta, said he became a motorcycle taxi driver with help from the European program but made too little to provide for his seven children. So he returned to smuggling migrants.
""I need to feed my children,"" he said, as he waited to transport migrants arriving by bus from Ghana and Burkina Faso to a smuggler’s compound.
Until 2016, Ahmed Mohammed ran one such compound in Agadez, a job he said allowed him to pay his wife's family a belated bride price: a suitcase filled with cash, clothes and gold.
Mohammed said he submitted three business proposals in 2017, two of which were rejected as too costly. On his third try, he said, he was offered rice and cooking oil worth 1.5 million CFA francs ($2,706) to sell. But he said the rice - provided through a local charity - was of poor quality, and he could not have sold it at market rate.
To settle the dispute, Mohammed said, the supplier gave him cash instead of the goods – 30% less than the value of the materials he was promised. He accepted the payment anyway, he said.
The supplier, Mahaman Garba, denied that he had paid Mohammed in cash. But he said other suppliers frequently do so, and shortchange them on the amounts.
The EU said in an email that an audit of the project carried out by Agadez authorities had ""not provided any assertions of the sort presented"" by Reuters regarding cash payments. An evaluation of the EUTF by the EU Court of Auditors also found no irregularities, it said.
Mohammed said his money was gone within six weeks. He now sells used mobile phones on the streets of Agadez.
""We are angry because we have become poorer than before,"" Mohammed said. “It’s very dangerous to have a lot of unemployed men in a city like this.”

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 03:06AM ET</span>","Toll expected to rise in blast that shook Beirut, killing 100, injuring thousands","By Samia Nakhoul and Ellen Francis
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese rescue workers dug through rubble looking for survivors of a powerful warehouse explosion that shook the capital Beirut, killing 100 people and injuring nearly 4,000 in a toll that officials expected to rise.
Tuesday's blast at port warehouses storing highly explosive material was the most powerful in years in Beirut, already reeling from an economic crisis and a surge in coronavirus infections.
President Michel Aoun said that 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years at the port without safety measures, and he said that was ""unacceptable"".
He called for an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday. 
Officials did not say what caused the blaze that set off the blast. A security source and media said it was started by welding work being carried out on a hole in the warehouse. 
""It's like a war zone. I'm speechless,"" Beirut's mayor, Jamal Itani, told Reuters while inspecting damage on Wednesday that he estimated would cost billions of dollars.
""This is a catastrophe for Beirut and Lebanon.""
The head of Lebanon's Red Cross, George Kettani, said at least 100 people had been killed. 
""We are still sweeping the area. There could still be victims. I hope not,"" he said.
Kettani earlier told broadcaster LBCI that the Red Cross was coordinating with the health ministry to set up morgues because hospitals were overwhelmed.
Hours after the blast, which went off shortly after 6 p.m. (1500 GMT), a fire blazed in the port district, casting an orange glow across the night sky as helicopters hovered and ambulance sirens sounded across the capital.
The blast was heard throughout Cyprus, which is about 100 miles (160 km) away.
It revived memories of a 1975-90 civil war and its aftermath, when Lebanese endured heavy shelling, car bombings and Israeli air raids. Some residents thought an earthquake had struck. 
Dazed, weeping and injured people walked through streets searching for relatives. 
""The blast blew me metres away. I was in a daze and was all covered in blood. It brought back the vision of another explosion I witnessed against the U.S. embassy in 1983,"" said Huda Baroudi, a Beirut designer.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab promised there would be accountability for the blast at the ""dangerous warehouse"", adding ""those responsible will pay the price"".
The U.S. embassy in Beirut warned residents about reports of toxic gases released by the blast, urging people to stay indoors and wear masks.
MANY MISSING
""There are many people missing. People are asking the emergency department about their loved ones and it is difficult to search at night because there is no electricity,"" Health Minister Hamad Hasan told Reuters late on Tuesday. 
Footage of the explosion posted on social media showed a column of smoke rising from the port, followed by an enormous blast, sending a white cloud and a fireball into the sky. Those filming the incident from high buildings 2 km (one mile) from the port were thrown backwards by the shock.
Bleeding people were seen running and shouting for help in clouds of smoke and dust in streets littered with damaged buildings, flying debris, and wrecked cars and furniture.
The explosion came three days before a U.N.-backed court is due to deliver a verdict in the trial of four suspects from the Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah over a 2005 bombing that killed former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and 21 others.
Hariri was killed by a huge truck bomb on the same waterfront, about 2 km (about one mile) from the port. 
Officials in Israel, which has fought several wars with Lebanon, said it had nothing to do with the blast and said their country was ready to give humanitarian and medical assistance. 
Shi'ite Iran, the main backer of Hezbollah, also offered support, as did Tehran's regional rival Saudi Arabia, a leading Sunni power. Cyprus said it was ready to offer medical aid.

At a White House briefing, U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that the blast was a possible attack, but two U.S. officials said initial information contradicted Trump's view.

Hundreds of thousands of people posted pictures of emptied shelves on Twitter, accompanied by handwritten ""Out of Stock"" notices, as they canvassed suggestions on how to acquire the coveted antiseptic. 
""Anyone else having trouble buying gargling medicine? I'm coming to four misses now,"" wrote one user, @shotaro_1117, who posted images of four cleaned-out shelves. 
On Tuesday, Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said a study showed a smaller viral load in the saliva of 41 patients with mild symptoms after regular gargling with a medicine infused with povidone-iodine solution than in those who had not.
""Perhaps we can even overcome the coronavirus with gargling medicine,"" he told a mid-afternoon news conference, speaking of the study on those convalescing in regional hotels which was released by an Osaka hospital. 
As the Japanese official spoke, shares of Meiji Holdings Co (T:2269), which sells a popular medicine previously marketed as Isojin, skyrocketed, gaining as much as 7.7% by late on Tuesday.
The shares were down 4% on Wednesday, but more than 1.2 million tweets had employed the hashtag #Isojin by afternoon.
As governments worldwide have struggled to rein in the virus, which has killed nearly 700,000 people and infected more than 18 million, some in authority have seized on any treatment seeming to offer a glimmer of hope.
For example, U.S. President Donald Trump has persistently promoted the unproven drug hydroxychloroquine as successful in treating the virus, and in April, he asked publicly if injecting disinfectant might help.
Japan's top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said he was aware of the Osaka governor's comments, including the fact that researchers would try to determine if the ingredient could keep disease symptoms from worsening.
""The government will closely watch developments of the research,"" Suga told a news conference. 
Some experts were sceptical, however.
""I think these kinds of claims might even lead to a high number of false negatives for PCR tests,"" pharmacist and medical writer Shuichi Aoshima wrote on Twitter, adding that tests after use of the germicide would register lower levels of the virus.

""It's the same as dripping povidone-iodine onto a virus sample.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A migrant in Singapore who self-harmed and was pictured bloodied in a stairwell has heightened concerns over the mental health of thousands of low-paid workers confined to dormitories in the city-state due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In April, Singapore sealed off sprawling housing blocks where its vast population of mainly South Asian labourers live in crowded bunk rooms, in an effort to ring-fence a surge in virus cases among the workers.
Four months on, some dormitories remain under quarantine, and even migrants who have been declared virus-free have had their movements restricted and face uncertainty over the jobs on which their families back home depend.
Rights groups say this has taken a heavy mental toll on workers, pointing to recent reports that migrants have been detained under the mental health act after videos showed them perched precariously on rooftops and high window ledges.
""We've heard of the extreme distress due to the inability to provide for families, inability to service debts to money lenders and banks and inability to fund medical care for children and elderly parents,"" said Deborah Fordyce, president of migrant rights group, Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2).
""Many of the workers now say that the mental anguish is a more serious problem than the virus.""
Singapore has recorded over 53,000 COVID-19 cases, mainly from dormitories in which around 300,000 workers from Bangladesh, India and China are housed. Only 27 people have died from the disease in the city-state.
Authorities have said they expect to lift quarantines on all dormitories this month, with the exception of some blocks serving as quarantine zones, and that 89% of workers have either recovered or are virus-free.
But reports and images published in local media on Wednesday of a man in blood-stained clothing at the foot of some stairs have fuelled concerns about the mental toll of the lockdowns.
Singapore's Ministry of Manpower - which has overseen the quarantines - said it was aware of the incident in which a worker had ""harmed himself"", adding that he was now in a ""safe and stable condition"". Police said the 36-year-old man was detained under the mental health act.
Checks had found there was no indication the man was in distress prior to the incident or was owed any salary, the ministry said in a statement, urging workers not to ""act rashly"" and reach out to non-governmental organisations for help. 

The ministry did not immediately have further comment, but referred to previous remarks saying it was working with NGOs to address mental health needs of migrants by providing services including counselling.

AYODHYA, India (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will unveil a plaque on Wednesday to kick off the construction of a Hindu temple in the northern city of Ayodhya on a spot where a mosque was demolished nearly three decades ago to spark deadly riots nationwide.
The event fulfils a long-standing promise by Modi and his Hindu nationalist party and marks the first anniversary of another commitment delivered by his government, the end of special privileges for India's only Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir.
It follows a Supreme Court verdict late last year that handed the site to India's Hindu majority in exchange for a plot given to the Muslim community for a mosque, ending years of litigation.
Although two prominent Muslims who experienced the riots said in a gesture of reconciliation that they would attend the ceremony, an influential Muslim non-government body said the Babri Mosque ""was, and will always be,"" one.
""Usurpation of the land by an unjust, oppressive, shameful and majority-appeasing judgment can't change its status,"" the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board said on Twitter. ""No need to be heartbroken. Situations don't last forever.""
Many Hindus believe the god-king Ram was born on the exact spot where the mosque was built in the 16th century by Muslim Mughal rulers. In 1992, it was demolished by a Hindu mob, triggering riots that killed about 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.
Yellow flowers decorated the freshly washed area around a temple on the banks of the Sarayu River where Modi will offer prayers before heading to the construction site at noon on his first such visit since becoming prime minister in 2014.
Numerous security officials guarded Ayodhya, crowded by thousands of people, few wearing masks against the coronavirus, although social distancing measures to limit its spread will allow only about 200 to gather at the main event site. 
The chant of prayers resounded through the city, located about 687 km (427 miles) southeast of the capital New Delhi, as devotees and monks thronged its numerous ancient temples in celebration.

Event organisers gathered soil from more than 2,000 holy spots and water from over 100 rivers for use in prayers at the start of the building work, while a Ram devotee from southern Tamil Nadu state has donated two bricks of precious metal.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar will visit Taiwan in coming days, his office said on Tuesday, making the highest-level visit by a U.S. official in four decades - a move likely to anger China, which claims the island as its own.
Azar's visit will probably worsen already poor Beijing-Washington relations, inflamed over trade, the pandemic and human rights, even as Taiwan has welcomed the show of support in the face of unrelenting Chinese pressure.
During his visit, Azar will meet with President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said, which may infuriate China further.
""Taiwan has been a model of transparency and cooperation in global health during the COVID-19 pandemic and long before it,"" Azar said in a statement. ""I look forward to conveying President Trump's support for Taiwan's global health leadership and underscoring our shared belief that free and democratic societies are the best model for protecting and promoting health.""
His department, describing the trip as ""historic"", said Azar would be accompanied by Mitchell Wolfe, chief medical officer of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other members of the administration.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said the visit showed the firm U.S. support for Taiwan and the closeness of their relationship.
Taiwan has been especially grateful for U.S. support for its requests to get meaningful access to the World Health Organization during the pandemic. 
Taiwan is not a member because of Chinese objections; Beijing considers the island merely one of China's provinces. Taiwan has denounced Chinese efforts to block its access, though Beijing says the island has been given the help it needs.
The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, having ditched Taipei in favour of Beijing in 1979, but is its main arms supplier and strongest backer on the international stage.
Gina McCarthy, then-head of the Environmental Protection Agency, was the last U.S. Cabinet-level official to visit the island, in 2014. Her position is technically lower-ranking than Azar's.
Taiwan has won praise for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, having kept its case numbers low due to effective and early prevention steps. 
The United States has more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country.
In April, Azar held a teleconference with Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung, whom he will also meet on his trip.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new law in March requiring increased support for Taiwan's international role. China threatened unspecified retaliation in response.

(Reuters) - U.S. astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, home two days from a landmark mission as NASA's first crew to fly a privately built vehicle into orbit, recounted on Tuesday the loud, jarring ride they experienced through Earth's atmosphere before a safe landing at sea.
Their splash-down on Sunday in the Gulf of Mexico off Florida - a mode of return for human spaceflight last used by NASA 45 years ago - capped the first launch of astronauts from U.S. soil in nine years.
At a news conference from NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, their first extensive public remarks since coming home, Behnken, 50, and Hurley, 53, described the tense final moments of their 64-day journey.
The duo endured tremendous, jolting forces as the SpaceX-built Crew Dragon, an acorn-shaped vehicle that had carried them to the International Space Station, fired rocket thrusters to slow its descent for re-entry, then pierced the outer atmosphere.
""It came alive,"" Behnken told reporters of the nearly 12-minute thruster burn. ""It doesn't sound like a machine, it sounds like an animal coming through the atmosphere."" 
As the capsule streaked deeper through the sky, atmospheric friction scorched the protective heat shield of the plunging Crew Dragon to 3,500 Fahrenheit (1,927 Celsius), slowing its rate of descent to 350 mph (563 kph).
At that point, the first of two sets of parachutes were deployed, abruptly breaking the capsule's speed further - an interval that felt ""very much like getting hit in the back of the chair with a baseball bat,"" Behnken recalled.
""It was a pretty significant jolt,"" he said.
The second set of chutes gradually slowed the capsule to a gentle 15-mph rate of descent for a splash-down that ended what Hurley called a ""flawless"" mission. 
Minutes later, recovery teams dispatched by SpaceX, the California-based rocket company founded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, hoisted the capsule onto a boat. Behnken and Hurley where then flown by helicopter to shore to catch a private flight to Houston.
The two were launched to the International Space Station from Florida on May 31, embarking on a two-month journey to prove the Crew Dragon capsule safe for transporting humans to and from space. 
While bobbing in the water just after splash-down awaiting recovery teams, Hurley said they completed one final test objective for the mission: ""making prank satellite phone calls to whoever we can get a hold of."" 

""There was a real reason for it,"" Hurley said, in all seriousness, explaining that they needed to prove they could contact mission control using a sat-phone in case the crew landed from space in an unexpected part of the ocean.

""No longer content with their maximum pressure ploys to coerce China into accepting an unfair trade deal, these neo-crusaders are seeking to provoke an all-out confrontation whereby they can finally hold 'communist China' by the throat,"" the editorial in the official English-language China Daily said.
The commentary follows China's vow on Tuesday to retaliate if the United States persisted with ""hostile action"" against Chinese journalists, who may be forced to leave in coming days if their U.S. visas are not extended.
The editor of the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper, said on Tuesday that retaliation could include targeting U.S. journalists based in Hong Kong.
The China Daily editorial took aim at what it said was a ""certain political faction"" that had ""hijacked the executive functions of government"" to promote elite interests.
""Lost in the fog of flawed recollections of the country's past glory and guided by the decomposing guidebook of Reaganite strategy this cabal of wackadoodles has forsaken the most basic sense of propriety in interactions between countries and breached the bottom lines of international relations,"" the editorial in the official English-language China Daily said, referring to U.S. officials.
Relations between Beijing and Washington have deteriorated sharply in recent months, prompting several tit-for-tat actions involving journalists.
The United States in March slashed the number of Chinesenationals allowed to work at the U.S. offices of major Chinesestate-owned media to 100 from 160.
China expelled U.S. journalists working for three U.S.newspapers this year and has threatened to match any moreU.S. actions against Chinese journalists.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Isaias killed at least four people on Tuesday as it made its way up the U.S. Atlantic Coast, including two deaths at a North Carolina trailer park that was struck by a tornado spun off by hurricane-force winds.
The storm knocked out power to more than 2.8 million homes and businesses from New York to North Carolina, according to electric companies.
Isaias, which was briefly a Category 1 hurricane when it made landfall in North Carolina late on Monday, reduced the mobile home park in the north of the state to rubble hours later, leaving two people dead.
""It doesn't look real. It looks like something on TV. There's nothing there,"" Bertie County Sheriff John Holley told local reporters. ""Vehicles are turned over. Vehicles are piled on top of each other. It's just very sad.""
A mother and her two children who were missing for hours after the storm ripped through the area were found safe later on Tuesday.
In Mechanicsville, North Carolina, a large tree fell on a car, killing the driver, the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said. The sheriff's department did not immediately identify the motorist.
North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Twitter that as of 2:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday more than 172,000 homes remained without power, even as Isaias moved northward and skies cleared.
Cooper said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump, who had pledged aid. 
A man in the New York City borough of Queens became the fourth fatality when a tree crushed a car he was inside, local authorities said.
Social media images showed tornadoes in Cape May, Marmora and Long Beach Island along New Jersey's southern shore, and tornado damage in Dover (NYSE:DOV), Delaware.
In Bear, Delaware, Tammy Trelford Campos said she was terrified to hear a tornado destroy her backyard.
""The damage is crazy. No power, almost all my trees are split or uprooted, water is coming in all windows,"" she said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
New York City, much of New Jersey, all of Massachusetts and other parts of New England went under a tornado watch. New York state officials temporarily shut down coronavirus testing centers as a precaution.
As of 2 p.m. ET on Tuesday the storm was about 20 miles (35 kilometers) west of Albany, New York, with maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour (100 km per hour), according to the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center. 

""The center of Isaias will continue to move farther inland over eastern New York and Vermont this afternoon and evening, and over southern Canada tonight,"" the NHC said.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 09:35PM ET</span>",India's police shamed by rare murder probe into custodial deaths,"By Sudarshan Varadhan and Abhirup Roy
CHENNAI (Reuters) - It took a while for Indians to learn how a father and son died in hospital with blood pouring from their rectum, days after police in small southern town locked them up for violating a nationwide coronavirus lockdown.
Fanned by media reports, outrage spread throughout India over what happened between June 19 and June 23 in Sathankulam, a town on the sub-continent's southern tip, 2,785 km (1,730 miles) from the capital New Delhi.
A month earlier, many Indians noted how commonplace police brutality was in their own country when they saw the furious global reaction to images of George Floyd, a Black American man, dying as a Milwaukee policeman knelt on his neck. 
Yet, despite nearly 800 custodial deaths in India in the latest eight years covered by official data, no police officers were convicted in any of the cases.
Charges have yet to be laid in Sathankulam, and it is uncertain whether investigations into the deaths of J Jayaraj, 59, and his son, 31-year-old Bennicks Immanuel will lead to prosecutions, but five officers have been named as murder suspects.
Jayaraj, the owner of a mobile phone shop, was detained on June 19 after exchanging words with officers who accused him of breaking lockdown rules.
That night, accompanied by friends, including two lawyers, Immanuel went to the police station looking for his father.
When he remonstrated with officers over why his father had been beaten, he was locked up too, his friends told Reuters.
Both men, allegedly, were brutally beaten while in custody, taken to hospital, and then transferred to jail. 
""When they sat on a chair in the hospital and in a car when they were taken to the magistrate, they left blood trails. That's how much they were bleeding,” said S. Rajaram, one of lawyers. Other witnesses asked for their names to be withheld, fearing police retribution.
Immanuel, described as fit and healthy by his family, died on June 22. His father died on June 23. They were buried together a day later.
Jayaraj's eldest daughter recounted what male relatives and friends had told her and photographs had shown.
""You should see the bedsheet they were sitting on while being transported to the jail. It was full of blood. And this was hours after they were brought to a hospital,"" J Persis, the daughter, told Reuters.
The case prompted popular news channels Times Now and Republic TV to run prime time debates on police conduct, and there were biting commentaries in op-ed pages of national dailies.
""Coming so soon after the George Floyd incident in the U.S., the Sathankulam episode should shock our conscience,"" R.K. Raghavan, a former Central Bureau of Investigation director, wrote in The Hindu newspaper.
As the media storm gathered, a court in Madurai, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, ordered the case to be made a murder probe.
As each state has its own police force under India's federal system, the CBI, an agency equivalent to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, was tasked with investigating. 
On July 1, the first policeman was detained. By July 9, cases had been filed against the five police suspected of murder, and five suspected of abetting them. 
Reuters was unable to establish whether any of them had appointed lawyers. 
Tamil Nadu's police chief did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The office of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edapadi Palaniswami did not respond either, though he has previously said action would be taken ""as per the law.""
INACTION 
India is a country of 1.3 billion people with massive social problems, but it is also a democracy, with strong laws, a vibrant media and active public interest litigation lawyers. So, when abuses happen someone usually speaks up, even if culprits often avoid jail.
Yet out of the 783 custodial deaths between 2010 and 2018, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) records shows charges were only filed in over a sixth of the cases.
And there were no convictions.
Graphic: How people died in police custody https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CRIME/nmovaldqjpa/chart.png
According to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), the NCRB data understates the scale of the problem. It put the annual average for custodial deaths at 143, some 46% higher than the NCRB average of 98. 
Caste and religious frictions sometimes play a part in custodial deaths in India, while some are suspected extra-judicial killings of criminals who ""were trying to escape"".
But a common denominator for many cases, legal experts say, can be boiled down to the brutish behaviour of officers who know their colleagues will keep their mouths shut.
Yet, the NCRB data shows that nearly 16% of custodial deaths in the five years through 2018 were explicitly classified as being due to ""physical assault"" by police. 
""There are very few witnesses in custodial deaths because mostly the witnesses are people who are on duty, who don't support the investigation,"" said Ravi Kant, president of the National Network of Lawyers for Rights and Justice and a senior advocate at India's Supreme Court.
Neither the home or justice ministries responded to requests for comment on the dearth of convictions.
India's law commission - an executive body responsible for legal reform - had twice recommended - once in 1985 and again in 1994 - that if there was evidence that a person was injured in custody, courts could assume the injuries were caused by police. 
More than 25 years later, however, the recommendations have yet to be adopted.
A report released in 2016 by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), a rights body for people born into the lowest rung of India's caste hierarchy, highlighted cases of men in custody being tortured by having heavy stones tied to their genitals, and women having chilli powder and petrol poured on their genitalia.
The report was submitted to India's president, but two of the authors said no action has been taken yet. The President's office did not respond to requests seeking comment.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A powerful blast in port warehouses near central Beirut storing highly explosive material killed 78 people, injured nearly 4,000 and sent seismic shockwaves that shattered windows, smashed masonry and shook the ground across the Lebanese capital.
Officials said they expected the death toll to rise further after Tuesday's blast as emergency workers dug through rubble to rescue people and remove the dead. It was the most powerful explosion in years in Beirut, which is already reeling from an economic crisis and a surge in coronavirus infections.
President Michel Aoun said that 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years at the port without safety measures, and said it was ""unacceptable"".
He called for an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday and said a two-week state of emergency should be declared. 
""What we are witnessing is a huge catastrophe,"" the head of Lebanon's Red Cross George Kettani told broadcaster Mayadeen. ""There are victims and casualties everywhere.""
Hours after the blast, which struck shortly after 6 p.m. (1500 GMT), a fire still blazed in the port district, casting an orange glow across the night sky as helicopters hovered and ambulance sirens sounded across the capital.
A security source said victims were taken for treatment outside the city because Beirut hospitals were overwhelmed with wounded. Ambulances from the north and south of the country and the Bekaa valley to the east were called in to help.
The huge blast revived memories of the 1975-90 civil war and its aftermath, when Lebanese endured heavy shelling, car bombings and Israeli air raids. Some residents thought an earthquake had struck. Dazed, weeping and injured people walked through streets searching for relatives. 
Others sought their missing loved ones in the overflowing hospitals. One medic said 200 to 300 people had been admitted to a single emergency department. ""I've never seen this. It was horrible,"" the medic, who gave her name as Rouba, told Reuters. 
“The blast blew me off metres away. I was in a daze and was all covered in blood. It brought back the vision of another explosion I witnessed against the U.S. embassy in 1983,"" said Huda Baroudi, a Beirut designer.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab told the nation there would be accountability for the deadly blast at the ""dangerous warehouse"", adding ""those responsible will pay the price.""
The U.S. embassy in Beirut warned residents in the city about reports of toxic gases released by the blast, urging people to stay indoors and wear masks if available.

SMOKE AND FIREBALL
Footage of the explosion shared by residents on social media showed a column of smoke rising from the port, followed by an enormous blast, sending up a white cloud and a fireball into the sky. Those filming the incident from high buildings 2 km (one mile) from the port were thrown backwards by the shock.
Bleeding people were seen running and shouting for help in clouds of smoke and dust. Streets looked as if they had been hit by an earthquake, with damaged buildings, flying debris, and wrecked cars and furniture.
Officials did not say what caused the blaze that set off the blast. A security source and local media said it was started by welding work being carried out on a hole in the warehouse. 
The government said it was still struggling to establish the magnitude of the disaster. ""There are many people missing. People are asking the emergency department about their loved ones and it is difficult to search at night because there is no electricity,"" Health Minister Hamad Hasan told Reuters. 
Hasan said 78 people were killed and nearly 4,000 injured. 
Lebanese broadcaster al-Jadeed read out appeals for information about the missing into the early hours of the morning. Some people posted photos of missing relatives on social media.
The prime minister called for a day of mourning on Wednesday.
TANGLED WRECKAGE
The explosion occurred three days before a U.N.-backed court is due to deliver a verdict in the trial of four suspects from the Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah over a 2005 bombing which killed former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and 21 others.
Hariri was killed by a huge truck bomb on the same waterfront, about 2 km (about one mile) from the port. 
Israeli officials said Israel, which has fought several wars with Lebanon, had nothing to do with Tuesday's blast and said their country was ready to give humanitarian and medical assistance. Shi'ite Iran, the main backer of Hezbollah, also offered support, as did Tehran's regional rival Saudi Arabia, a leading Sunni power.
Qatar and Iraq said they were sending makeshift hospitals to assist the high numbers of casualties.
The United States, Britain, France and Germany expressed shock and sympathy and said they were read to help.
U.S. President Donald Trump indicated at a White House briefing that the explosion was a possible attack. Asked later to elaborate, Trump said that he had met with some U.S. generals who felt it was not ""some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event.""[L1N2F62KI]
Two U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said initial information contradicted Trump's view, however. 
The blast threatens a new humanitarian crisis in a nation that hosts hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and which is already grappling with economic meltdown under one of the world's biggest debt burdens.
Images showed port buildings reduced to tangled masonry, devastating the main entry point to a country that relies on food imports to feed its population of more than 6 million.

Residents said glass was broken in neighbourhoods on Beirut's Mediterranean coast and inland suburbs several km (miles) away. In Cyprus, a Mediterranean island 110 miles (180 km) across the sea from Beirut, residents heard the blast. One resident in Nicosia said his house and window shutters shook.

""Today, the Indo-Pacific is the epicentre of strategic competition,"" Morrison told the Aspen Security Forum, which brings government and military leaders together with experts.
""Tensions over territorial claims are growing.""
The annual conference is being hosted using virtual digital platforms this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Australia last month said it would boost defence spending by 40% over the next 10 years, buying long-range military equipment that will be focused on the Indo-Pacific region, where both Beijing and Canberra are competing for influence.
Diplomatic tension between China and Australia has worsened recently over issues including an Australian call for an international inquiry into the origin of the coronavirus, and debate about China's new national security law in Hong Kong.
Last week, the United States and Australia held high-level talks on China and agreed on the need to uphold a rules-based global order, but Australia stressed its relationship with China was important and it had no intention of hurting it.
Morrison said on Wednesday China's rise as a major economic partner has been good for the global economy, Indo-Pacific region and Australia, ""but with economic rise comes responsibility"".
The prime minister said China and the United States together have a ""special responsibility"" to respect international law and should resolve their disputes peacefully.

""It means a commitment to rules-based economic interaction. Neither coercion nor abdication from international systems is the way forward,"" Morrison said.

Mask-wearing visitors will be allowed to tour exhibits on two of the museum's floors, strolling through 250 years of European Renaissance art, a dazzling Islamic Middle East gallery, and five centuries of fashion from around the world.
Tickets are free but visitors will be allowed in on a booking-only basis after months of coronavirus-enforced closure, marking another step in Britain's tentative economic and cultural reopening. 
""We want people to enjoy themselves again after all these months of looking at screens - to go and see an artefact for yourself, to stand in front of an object, that's what's so important,"" said museum director Tristram Hunt.
""The V&A has been closed for 138 days, the longest period of closure in its history.""
The 160-year-old museum, named after Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert, has been modified to meet the demands of social distancing regulations designed to prevent the spread of a COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 46,000 people in Britain alone.
Hand sanitiser dispensers have been dotted around the sprawling, mosaic-floored building. The gift shop and cafe have been equipped with protective screens. 
Further sections of the V&A's seven miles of galleries will reopen in phases later in the month.
""What we've all discovered is that it's relatively easy to close, but it's a lot more difficult to reopen,"" Hunt said.

""We've got the pubs open, we've got the football playing, that's great. But museums, galleries, schools, places where people can nurture their souls is really important.""

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordanian security forces on Tuesday used tear gas to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators it blamed for disrupting public services during a protest demanding the release of leaders of the opposition-run teachers union, state media said. 
A government source said seven security forces were injured in the protest in the southern city of Karak, with violence breaking out for the first time in an escalating crisis between the authorities and the union that has become a leading source of dissent.
The government on July 25 closed the offices of the 100,000 strong union and suspended its activity for two years, in one of the largest crackdowns on a major dissident group in recent years.
U.S. based Human Rights Watch last week criticised the crackdown that has included arrests of dozens and urged the authorities to end intimidation tactics that bar people from exercising their right to freedom of association.
""Shuttering one of the Jordan's few independent labor unions following a protracted dispute with the government and on dubious legal grounds raises serious concerns about the government's respect for the rule of law,"" said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch
The union went on strike last year, shutting down schools across Jordan for a month in one of the longest and most disruptive public sector strikes in the country's history. 
In recent weeks its leadership has accused the government of failing to honour a deal signed last October that ended the strike.
Prosecutors charged its jailed leaders with incitement and financial and administrative wrongdoing which the union says are baseless.
The cities of Irbid, Karak, Jerash and Tafila have seen scattered night protests in the past few days with hundreds of opposition activists taking to the streets, calling for the government's resignation, an end to corruption and the release of jailed unionists.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduras announced Tuesday it will reopen its airports to domestic and international flights in mid-August, after a nearly five-month closure due to the pandemic.
The reopening of the airport terminals is part of the government's efforts to reactivate the economy, which is expected to contract between 7% and 8%, according to the Central Bank of Honduras.
""Under strict biosecurity measures, domestic flights will resume on Aug. 10 and international flights will resume on Aug. 17,"" said Maria Antonia Rivera, minister of economic development, in a virtual presentation.
The novel coronavirus has infected 43,794 people in Honduras and killed 1,384 more.
The reopening plan involves 263 municipalities and between 20% and 60% of the labor force, depending on the local impact of coronavirus. Thirty-five municipalities that are considered hardest hit by the pandemic are excluded, and in these areas, residents are only permitted to leave the house to visit banks, pharmacies and supermarkets.
Despite the reactivation of some sectors, the country still has an overnight curfew, and the government has not moved to reactivate public transportation, bars, restaurants, movie theaters, sports events, and schools and universities.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankans go to polls on Wednesday to elect a new parliament in an election that the party of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is widely expected to win.
The election has twice been postponed this year because of the coronavirus, but government and election officials said the country was in a better position now after a series of lockdowns.
The election is important for Rajapaksa who is seeking a two-thirds majority for his party so that he can make constitutional changes and expand the executive powers of the presidency.
""I need the power to implement my economic programme which you voted for,” Rajapaksa, who won the presidency in November, told supporters last week. 
He hopes to install his brother and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa as premier, tightening the hold of the family over the island nation of 21 million people. 
Polling will take place under strict safety guidelines. Voters have to maintain a one-metre distance between themselves, wear masks and sanitise their hands every time they touch anything.
Masks have to be removed only when the identity of the voter is being verified. Officials are also encouraging voters to bring their own pens. 
“There will be no chance for you to get infected by the coronavirus at the polling stations,” election commission chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said. 
Sri Lanka has reported 2,828 cases of the coronavirus and 11 deaths as of Tuesday, which is small compared to other South Asian countries. 
The opposition, led by Sajith Premadasa, strongly opposes giving the presidency more power, warning it will make Sri Lanka an autocracy.
Votes are to be counted on Thursday when results should be known.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Beijing does not want tensions with Washington to escalate further following tit-for-tat consulate closures over the past weeks, the Chinese ambassador to the United States said on Tuesday.
The world's top two economies should work to cooperate instead of confronting each other, Ambassador Cui Tiankai said, striking a relatively conciliatory tone at the virtual Aspen Security forum. 
""I don't think a new Cold War would serve anybody's interest,"" said Cui, seen as a moderate voice among Beijing's top diplomatic brass. ""Why should we allow history to repeat ... when we are faced with so many new challenges?"" he said, while rejecting U.S. allegations of Chinese spying in the Houston consulate shut down by Washington last month.
U.S.-China ties have quickly deteriorated this year over a range of issues including Beijing's handling of the coronavirus; telecoms-equipment maker Huawei; China's territorial claims in the South China Sea; and the clampdown on Hong Kong.
Cui pushed back on Washington's allegations that Beijing was employing intimidation tactics across the South China Sea and said intensifying U.S. military activities in the region were raising the risk of a potential confrontation.
Asked about TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-video app that President Donald Trump threatened to ban as of Sept. 15 barring a sale to another company outside of China, Cui said there was no evidence that the company was sharing information with the Chinese government.
Cui's comments came a little more than a week after a July 23 policy speech in California by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who described getting Beijing to change its ways as ""the mission of our time.""

Despite the tensions, Cui said Washington and Beijing were moving along on the Phase One trade deal. ""The two economic teams have been in contact with each other at various levels..and we are making progress,"" he said.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - With a heavy deployment of troops and barricades of barbed wire, India put Kashmir under the strictest lockdown in several months on Wednesday, the first anniversary of the Himalayan region's loss of autonomy.
Streets in the Kashmir's main city of Srinagar were deserted, with armed paramilitary and police manning roadblocks to enforce a lockdown that was initially imposed on Tuesday to prevent any violent protests.
Top police officer Vijay Kumar said security agencies had received intelligence reports of a suicide attack or attempts to target politicians, and that restrictions would be further tightened on Wednesday.
""We are monitoring the situation,"" he told Reuters.
Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, was stripped of its special rights last August and divided into two federally-administered territories in an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to draw the restive region closer to the rest of the country.
The move was accompanied by a communication blackout, widespread movement restrictions and mass detentions, including those of elected leaders. Most of these measures have been eased, although internet speeds are still restricted and most families remain indoors because of coronavirus-related lockdowns.
But Modi's promise to rapidly develop the region is yet to pick up pace, partly hamstrung by the coronavirus outbreak. There is strong local resentment, particularly in the Kashmir valley where an armed insurgency has raged on since the 1990s.
""Forget about development and creating new employment opportunities, thousands of daily-wagers, casual labourers, scheme workers and others have been denied wages for months,"" former leftist lawmaker Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami said.
The August decision was also condemned by India's arch rival Pakistan which has called for protests in solidarity with the Kashmiri people.
Both countries claim the region in full but rule in parts, and have gone to war twice over the territory.
Sajjad Ahmad, 37, said he tried to visit his critically-ill father in a Srinagar hospital on Tuesday but was not allowed by police and paramilitary troops.

Ahmad said these were the strictest restrictions he had seen since August last year. ""There are barricades everywhere,"" he said.

On Saturday, the 16-year-old Saeed was released from custody. On Monday, wearing a baseball cap and plaid shirt, he was received by Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who said those who had beaten up Saeed had been suspended from duty and referred to trial after an investigation.
Back in May, Saeed was selling water bottles and taking part in an anti-government protest on Baghdad's Tahrir Square when a bottle fell to the ground. As he bent down to pick it up, interior ministry forces detained him, accusing him of wanting to throw stones at them, he told Reuters from his home.
Saeed said that security forces beat him up while he was briefly held, tore up his clothes and cut his hair.
He later returned to Tahrir Square but got arrested again when he got into a fight with another man who had accused him of stealing a bicycle.
He said he was then held in a Baghdad police station for about 10 weeks and not allowed to contact his family.
When videos showing Hamid being roughed up by riot police began circulating on social media a few days ago, his relatives believed the abuse happened only recently and soon found out he was in police custody.
After receiving the freed youth in his office, Kadhimi issued a statement saying those who ""exploit their position in the security forces to assault (people) will only face punishment and legal prosecution"".
On Tuesday, Kadhimi sacked a senior security forces officer, a spokesman for the prime minister told a press conference.
Kadhimi's new government has pledged to investigate the deaths and incarceration of hundreds of protesters in unrest that unseated the previous government last year.

Last week, three policemen were suspended for using their personal hunting rifles against a protest, resulting in the deaths of two demonstrators. [nL5N2F188Y]

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is being built about 15 km (9 miles) from the Ethiopian border with Sudan on the Blue Nile, has become a major sticking point between the three countries. Egypt fears the $4 billion project could lead to water shortages upstream, while Sudan is concerned about the dam's safety.
The Blue Nile is a tributary of the Nile river, from which Egypt’s 100 million people get 90% of their fresh water.
Cairo said Addis presented a proposal on Tuesday that excluded ""operating guidelines"" as well as ""a legal mechanism to settle disputes.""
Sudan's irrigation ministry said the latest Ethiopian position presented in talks on Tuesday raised new fears over the track the negotiations had been on.
""[We] stress the seriousness of the risks that the dam represents for Sudan and its people, including environmental and social risks, and for the safety of millions of residents along the banks of the Blue Nile... which reinforces the need to reach a comprehensive agreement covering both filling and operation,"" the Sudanese irrigation ministry said.
Ethiopia's Irrigation Minister Seleshi Bekele had expressed optimism over the talks and tweeted earlier on Tuesday saying: ""Ethiopia would like to sign the first filling agreement at the soonest and also continue negotiation to finalize a comprehensive agreement in subsequent periods.""
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had said earlier in July that his country had already achieved its first-year target for filling the reservoir, thanks to a heavy rainy season.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday condemned all foreign military involvement in Libya, including the use of mercenaries and private military contractors, and said Libyans themselves must rebuild a unified country.
U.S. President Donald Trump had spoken with several world leaders about Libya in past weeks, and it was clear there was ""no winning side,"" U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien said in a statement on Tuesday. He did not name the leaders.
He said efforts by foreign powers to exploit the conflict posed a grave danger to regional stability and global commerce.
He urged all parties to enable Libya's National Oil Corp to resume its work, with full transparency, and to implement a demilitarized solution for Sirte and al-Jufra, respect the UN arms embargo, and finalize a ceasefire under UN-led talks.
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Since 2014, it has been split, with an internationally recognized government controlling the capital, Tripoli, and the northwest, while military leader Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi rules the east.
Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that there are ""unprecedented levels"" of foreign interference and mercenaries in the oil-producing country.
O'Brien, who returned to the White House on Tuesday after recovering from a mild case of COVID-19, said the United States was deeply troubled by the escalating conflict, and intervention by foreign powers undermined the collective security interests of the United States and its allies.
""Escalation will only deepen and prolong the conflict,"" O'Brien said. ""It is clear there is no 'winning' side. Libyans can win only if they come together to reclaim their sovereignty and rebuild a unified country.""

He said Washington was committed to playing an ""active, but neutral"" role in helping find a solution that supported Libyan sovereignty and protected the shared interests of the United States, and its allies.

Tundu Lissu, who clinched the nomination for the leading opposition Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (CHADEMA) party, is a fierce critic of President John Magufuli. 
Lissu survived the attempt on his life in 2017 and left to seek medical treatment abroad, returning from exile last week. His attackers have never been found. Magufuli condemned the attack.
Lissu’s endorsement by all delegates present after prevailing over two other contenders within his own party on Monday made him the main opposition candidate.
“Due to this landslide victory, I would like to officially announce that ...Lissu is the presidential candidate...,” party chairman Freeman Mbowe said.
Another opposition candidate will be Bernard Membe, a former foreign minister, who was expelled from the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi party in February. Membe hopes to be nominated by the Alliance for Transparency and Change party. 
A third opposition contender, Ibrahim Lipumba of the Civic United Front, is running for the fifth time after his party nominated him last month.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for Oct. 28. 
Magufuli's party has ruled Tanzania since independence in 1961. He swept to power in 2015 promising to end corruption and expand infrastructure. But his tough governing style has cemented his nickname - the Bulldozer - originally bestowed on him during his time as public works minister. 
Magufuli has claimed credit for strong economic growth though the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have given lower estimates of the government's performance.
Opposition politicians and rights groups have accused his administration of suppressing political rivals and muzzling the media, accusations the government denies.

The capture on Sunday of alleged drug trafficker and fuel thief Jose Antonio Yepez, alias ""El Marro,"" or ""The Mallet,"" has removed one of the two bosses battling for control of Guanajuato state, an industrial powerhouse clouded by bloody gang wars. 
Mexican Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval on Tuesday said authorities were keeping an eye on four possible addresses when they got word that Yepez arrived at one of the homes in Guanajuato.
""Considering the information that 'El Marro' didn't sleep two nights in the same place, also the presence of [a black truck and food delivery] to that address that confirmed the tip we had,"" leading authorities to obtain search warrants, Sandoval said.
A top target for the government, Yepez, boss of the Guanajuato-based Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel has been engaged in a struggle for supremacy in the state with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), one of Mexico's most powerful and violent gangs.
To capture Yepez, the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, sent in two fully-manned Cougar helicopters, unmanned drones and hundreds of soldiers. 
Another 1,000 state security forces were deployed to ""maintain the safety of citizens in those municipalities,"" Sandoval said at Lopez Obrador's daily press conference.
Authorities arrested six men and three women in the raids, including Yepez, and seized high and low caliber weapons, a grenade launcher, around $6,600 in cash and rescued a 52-year-old kidnapped woman.
Lopez Obrador likely wanted to avoid the embarrassment his administration faced last October in western Sinaloa state after the brief arrest and then release of one of the sons of notorious drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman as cartel gunmen overwhelmed security forces.

Uribe, a mentor of President Ivan Duque who now serves as a senator, has repeatedly declared his innocence and questioned the court's independence.
The court has not yet released its ruling and it was unclear whether Uribe, a divisive political figure, would be held under house arrest or possibly behind bars.
""The privation of my liberty causes me profound sadness for my wife, for my family, and for Colombians who still believe that I have done something good for the country,"" Uribe wrote on Twitter. 
The Supreme Court ruling would mark the first ever in Colombia ordering the detention of a former president.
Duque has repeatedly backed Uribe and said he should be allowed to defend himself while free.
The case stems from a long-running feud between the right-wing Uribe and leftist Senator Ivan Cepeda.
In 2012, Uribe accused Cepeda of orchestrating a plot to tie him to right-wing paramilitary groups.
But in 2018 the court said Cepeda had collected information from former fighters as part of his work and had not paid or pressured former paramilitaries. 
Instead it was Uribe who was at fault, the court said, adding that his allies had undertaken new witness tampering efforts even after its original ruling.
Uribe and lawmaker Alvaro Hernan Prada (OTC:PRDSY) face prison terms of up to 12 years. That would put Uribe in the ranks of other former Latin American presidents, including Brazil's Lula da Silva and Peru's Alberto Fujimori, who have served time in confinement.

Uribe is best known for mounting an aggressive offensive against Marxist guerrillas during his 2002 to 2010 tenure. He and his family have long been accused of paramilitary links. His brother Santiago is currently facing a murder charge.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will maintain support for opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president and expects dozens of other countries to continue recognizing him following Dec. 6 legislative elections that opposition parties plan to boycott, a U.S. envoy said on Tuesday.
Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special representative on Venezuela, made the commitment to Guaido two days after 27 opposition parties announced they would not participate in the elections, saying they would be rigged by President Nicolas Maduro’s ruling socialist party.
The ballot still could pave the way toward a loss of opposition control of Venezuela’s National Assembly, which could complicate Guaido's standing based on his position as the speaker of the congress. 
Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Abrams insisted the United States “will not recognize this fraudulent election” and said it was in discussions with the roughly 60 countries that have backed Guaido and they would stick with him.
They withdrew recognition for Maduro after his 2018 re-election, which they regarded as a sham. But Maduro has remained in power, backed by the OPEC nation's military as well as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran.
U.S. officials say privately that Maduro's continued rule despite U.S. sanctions has been a source of frustration for President Donald Trump.
In an interview with Axios in June, Trump played down his decision in January 2019 to recognize Guaido.
Trump's aides, however, see his tough approach on Venezuela as appealing to the large Cuban American community in Florida, a key swing state as he seeks re-election in November.
Abrams said U.S. deportations of Venezuelans have halted but court decisions have led to ""some reluctance"" to grant ""temporary protected status."" Some lawmakers have called for giving them asylum.
U.S. sanctions in recent months have targeted fuel shipments from Iran, another heavily U.S.-sanctioned foe, to gasoline-starved Venezuela.
Abrams reiterated the administration's assessment that Venezuela was paying Iran from its gold reserves.
Asked about Turkey's role in Venezuela's sanctions evasion, Abrams said it was not as extensive as Russia and Cuba but a ""lot of gold"" was passing through Turkey. ""We keep going after companies as we find them,"" he added.

Abrams made clear the United States was still focused on Maduro's removal in a political settlement. Responding to a lawmaker's question, he said there was, for instance, no interest in a U.S. blockade of Venezuela, which he said would be ""an act of war.""

(Reuters) - The soaring number of COVID-19 cases in the United States has far outstripped many local health departments’ ability to trace the contacts of those infected, a step critical in containing the virus’ spread.
With the pandemic claiming about a thousand American lives a day, many city and county departments say they lack the money and staff to expeditiously identify people who have been exposed, according to a Reuters survey of 121 local agencies, as well as interviews with dozens of state and local officials, epidemiologists and tracers.
The United States badly lags other wealthy countries in contact tracing, including South Korea and Germany, which ramped up their programs months ago. Contributing to the faltering U.S. response is the government’s failure to provide accurate and timely diagnostic testing, something other countries were able to roll out much faster and more broadly.
On Alabama’s hard-hit Gulf Coast, health department staffers are stretched so thin they are directing individuals who test positive to notify any contacts themselves, said Rendi Murphree, director of Mobile County’s Bureau of Disease Surveillance and Environmental Services.
“Everything is overwhelmed,” she said.
Adding to the challenge has been a sharp politicization of the COVID-19 response, with many Americans, from President Donald Trump on down, often portraying mask-wearing and other measures as an infringement of personal liberty.
The United States has by far the world’s largest COVID-19 caseload, with over 4.6 million confirmed infections and more than 155,000 deaths. Yet public health measures during the pandemic have been largely decentralized, coming down to patchwork efforts by state, and especially local, governments. Federal funding has proved unreliable, caught up in fierce debate over the crisis.
Now, as part of log-jammed negotiations over new relief legislation, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are arguing over funding proposals for testing and tracing that are tens of billions of dollars apart. As of June, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Robert Redfield said the country had 27,000 contact tracers – about a quarter of what has been recommended.
Although some local health departments told Reuters their efforts have proved successful – and many said they were worthwhile – several researchers described U.S. contact tracing overall as too little, too late. 
“You don’t clean up an oil spill with paper towels,” said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard public health school.
On this point, the Trump administration does not disagree. Admiral Brett Giroir, Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told Reuters that given the spread of the disease, mask wearing and other prevention measures are more effective.
""It is really impossible to contact trace,"" Giroir said, until the numbers come down.
The agencies responding to the Reuters survey serve at least 27 million residents in large cities such as Minneapolis, Boston, and Cleveland, as well as smaller communities including Allentown, Pennsylvania, and Dare County, North Carolina. Collectively, as of last week, they accounted for at least 230,000 COVID-19 cases and 7,300 deaths. The responses cover the week ending June 22. Reuters followed up in late July with several departments, such as Las Vegas and Kansas City, Kansas, where officials said circumstances had not improved.
Among the findings:
• The 40 local health departments with the highest caseloads have fallen far short in their efforts to reach patients who tested positive. Only about half the departments with more than 1,000 cases had reached close to all infected people at the time of the survey. The CDC recommends that newly positive cases be interviewed within 24 hours.
“It’s just impossible with the kind of numbers that we are seeing,” said Devin Raman, a senior disease investigator at the Southern Nevada Health District, including Las Vegas.
• Nearly half of the local departments said they lacked sufficient staff and funds. In Missouri, many said they hadn’t received any additional money for contact tracing. “Some of them are literally running out of money right now,” Diane Weber, executive director of the Missouri Association of Local Public Health Agencies, said in July.
• Local health officials in six states complained that efforts to create statewide contact tracing systems have been hampered by issues including technical problems and poor coordination. In some cases, this has led to tension and a costly duplication of efforts, with state and local tracers calling the same people.
“We’re not going to drop the ball on tracing in our county and leave it to the state. If we did that, we’d probably all be dead,” said Joni Wise, administrator of the Vigo County Health Department in Indiana.
A spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Health acknowledged that people are more likely to answer a local call from a municipal health department than an “833” number from the state’s centralized call center.
• More than three dozen public health departments said they were hindered by some residents’ failure to answer their phones or to provide accurate information when they did. Several departments said people they called had objected to contact tracing as an infringement on their privacy rights.
“We get a variety of responses from yelling and hanging up, to those telling us that they have already contacted all of their friends and will not give us those names,” said Kenosha County health director Jen Freiheit in Wisconsin.
'A LAME EXCUSE'
From the early days of the pandemic, public health experts emphasized the importance of contact tracing, a decades-old strategy aimed at interrupting infectious disease transmission. It involves interviewing infected people, identifying people whom they may have exposed to infection and trying to keep those individuals from passing the virus to someone else.
“If any country is saying contact tracing is difficult, it is a lame excuse,” World Health Organization Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in June. He pointed to the WHO’s success in halting an Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo by tracing 25,000 contacts a day in a remote area, where some 20 armed groups were fighting. [nL8N2E65A8]
Under the best of circumstances, contact tracing is not a panacea. It is only one of many public health tools commonly deployed against infectious disease. The approach is particularly challenging during a fast-moving epidemic in which people may be infectious but don’t fall sick right away. In addition, a culture of individualism and legal protections inhibit U.S. authorities from forcing people to stay inside and divulge their social relationships.
Still, some other democracies have devised a more coordinated testing and tracing strategy than the United States.
In Germany, a country with about 400 public health offices, contact tracing early on was part of a collaborative effort. Workers from other municipal government offices lent a hand. The national Robert Koch Institute said it deployed hundreds more “containment scouts” – mostly medical students – to help. Daily confirmed cases in Germany now number in the hundreds. Deaths per day are down to the single digits, from a peak of over 300 on April 16.
In the United States, daily case counts that had been falling since mid-April began climbing again in July, reaching a peak of 77,299 July 16.
The federal government has largely taken a hands-off approach to contact tracing, as well as other public health measures during the pandemic. Though the CDC has issued guidance for contact tracing, it is not deeply involved. And though Congress authorized billions of dollars in aid that could pay for tracing, the money is not required to be used that way.
Trump and many of his fellow Republicans in Congress have often downplayed the threat posed by COVID-19. In July, the White House tried to block new funding for testing and contact tracing – something the White House later disavowed amid opposition even from Trump's own party. Since then, Senate Republican leaders have proposed a relief bill that would dedicate $16 billion for the effort, while a bill passed by the Democrat-dominated House would provide $75 billion for testing, tracing and hospital support. Negotiations are at a crawl.
A senior CDC official told Reuters in a statement that the agency has provided more than $12 billion across the country to address the COVID 19 crisis, including a recent grant of $10.25 billion for testing and other activities such as contact tracing. In addition, the official said, the CDC has provided staff and extensive technical support to states.
“Contact tracing is most effective when local communities embrace it and drive it,” said the official, who declined to be named. “The Administration has empowered states with funding to lead these efforts.""
REALITY SINKS IN
A few days before Las Vegas casinos reopened in June, state health officials in Nevada predicted a wave of coronavirus cases.
The state should have as many as 700 people working on contact tracing to meet the surge, the officials wrote in a May 29 COVID-19 “plan of operations,” which Reuters obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request. Referring to the roughly 100 tracing staffers then aboard, the plan said staffing “falls short of what is needed to effectively manage the need.”
It took two months to staff up. As of July’s end, Nevada had 744 staffers statewide, a Nevada Health and Human Services department spokeswoman said.
Still, Las Vegas and surrounding areas have struggled. The Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) saw about 1,000 new cases a day by mid-July, up ten-fold from the first week of June (although new cases have dropped precipitously in recent days).
A SNHD official told legislators last week that the district had less than half the tracing staff needed to serve Clark County, home to Las Vegas.
Raman, the senior investigator in the southern district, estimated in mid-July that her department was able to interview between 25% and 40% of people who recently tested positive.
“Right now, unfortunately, we are just trying to keep our heads above water.,"" she told Reuters.
It was a similar story in other hotspots. Health officials for Harris County, Texas, who serve the Houston suburbs, have reported about 550 cases a day since July 1, up from about 200 a day during the first half of June.
Harris County reported reaching about 60% of the newly positive people to interview about contacts. In general, epidemiologists told Reuters, the goal should be at least 75%.
Martha Marquez, a county spokesperson, described the 60% figure as “good” but said the county was “looking into how to grow our success rate.”
Other departments struggle to keep potentially infectious people in quarantine. Ideally, a tracer notifies contacts, refers them for testing and advises them to stay home and away from others. Then someone in the department follows up to see if they need anything to stay indoors – house-cleaning supplies or food, for instance. It’s no guarantee they won’t go out, but tracers say it can make a difference.
In Alabama's Mobile County, with case counts exploding to more than 1,000 cases a week by mid-July, follow-up was next to impossible. “It is not going well,” said Murphree, the disease surveillance director. 
For months, the health department in Mobile relied only on existing health staff for contact tracing – as well as a few volunteers. It took until mid-July for the department to hire two people dedicated to that work, positions that the federal government has promised to fund, Murphree said. 
The county has not yet received the money, she said.
This lack of resources is being felt across the country. 
Despite pleas for assistance, local health departments in Missouri have received little to no COVID-19 funding from the state. Meanwhile, the state recently announced a $15 million package to help support tourism, using funding from the federal CARES Act – a $2.2 trillion COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March.
""Tourism is a major employer and a major boon to the economy of Missouri,” said Scott Clardy, assistant director of the Columbia/Boone County Department of Public Health and Human Services. “That being said, here we are not being able to investigate cases, but we're giving $15 million to the tourism industry to bring in more people.""
Clardy said, however, that he was expecting almost $1.8 million in CARES Act funding for contact tracing and testing to become available as early as this week.
Contact tracing efforts are strained not just by the sharp rise in cases but by the long delays in getting COVID-19 test results back.
David Holcombe, the director of the Louisiana Department of Health for the central portion of that state, said that, as of mid-July, the turnaround was as long as 14 days.
The lag time makes “contact tracing virtually useless,” he said. That’s because by the time positive results come back, the infected person has potentially had many more contacts, who have potentially infected others themselves.
KEEPING UP
Not all contact-tracing efforts are in disarray.
In San Francisco, cases are rising but not spiking to the level seen in other places in the country. So far, contact tracers say they have been able to keep up – largely through the efforts of redirected city workers.
Before the pandemic, program manager Jana De Brauwere could be found at San Francisco’s main public library, using one of the four languages she speaks to help patrons without computers apply for jobs and other services online.
Since April, dozens of librarians, attorneys and other San Francisco city workers have been redeployed to trace COVID-19 contacts – though at some cost to the city’s other public services.
After about 20 hours of training, De Brauwere started calling people exposed to the disease, arranging for supplies to help them quarantine, and referring them for testing. Soon she was promoted to team leader.
A typical shift now starts at 7 am, when De Brauwere parcels out roughly 100 contacts for her eight-tracer team to interview that day. De Brauwere has given up all her library work. “This is the priority,” she said.
The city’s contact tracing program, which is getting help from nonprofit organizations, reported reaching over 80% of people with positive tests through the third week of July, an exceptionally high rate. Similarly, health officials in Vigo County, Indiana, report being able to interview nearly all positive cases. Wise, the county health administrator, said local contact tracers have been more successful at reaching people than those at the state level.
The state’s tracers often are contractors who don’t understand the area, she said. That unfamiliarity can alienate residents and make them less likely to share critical health information, she said. 
'A THREAT TO OUR PRIVACY'
Even with sufficient money and staff, health departments often have trouble convincing people to pick up the phone and cooperatively answer questions.
Playing into that problem are political divisions throughout the country over how seriously to take the pandemic and what responsibilities the government should or should not impose on the public.
In Texas, a Republican state representative in June called for ending the contact tracing program as “a threat to our privacy and individual liberties.” The Republican-controlled Kansas legislature in June passed a COVID-19 bill with bipartisan support ensuring that no civil or criminal penalties would apply to anyone who refuses to provide information to a tracer. Such penalties, to the limited extent they are allowed under public health laws, are rarely enforced.
People may be reluctant to engage with tracers for a variety of other reasons, including embarrassment for exposing themselves to infection or fear they’ll lose their job.
Sometimes, contact tracers are hindered by misunderstandings.
In early June, in Berrien County, Michigan, contact tracer Karen Kortebein received a call from a public health nurse in a neighboring county. An employee of a long-term care facility there – a resident of Kortebein’s county – had contracted the virus. Kortebein knew the woman. She'd been speaking with her since her husband tested positive in May.
Kortebein had asked the woman then if she was working outside her home. The woman said no. But in reality she had been working – possibly while infectious – with a particularly vulnerable population until her husband became ill, something contact tracers needed to know as soon as possible.
It turned out the woman, whose first language is not English, had misunderstood the question. Also, she was confused about the risk she posed because she’d had conflicting test results and had yet to develop symptoms.
For Kortebein, it was a lesson in how easily wires can get crossed.

“I was kind of blown away,” she said.

Alex Saab, who has been working on behalf of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, was arrested in June when a plane he was traveling on landed in the West African island nation. Maduro's government said Saab was traveling as a state ""agent"" on business to obtain humanitarian supplies to help combat the coronavirus pandemic.
The United States last year charged Saab in connection with a bribery scheme to take advantage of Venezuela's state-controlled exchange rate. It also sanctioned him for allegedly orchestrating a corruption network that allowed him and Maduro to profit from a state-run food subsidy program.
Saab's defense team, led by former Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, said in a statement that it would appeal the decision against ""Special Envoy Saab"" before Cape Verde's Supreme Court. 
If that appeal were to fail, Saab's lawyers said they would then make a request to the Constitutional Court. His lawyers called the U.S. charges ""politically motivated.""
The U.S. Department of Justice said in June that Saab, who also has a Venezuelan passport, was arrested pursuant to an Interpol red notice issued with respect to his indictment.

The German foreign ministry said it was dropping warnings against travel to Antalya, Izmir, Aydin and Mugla provinces, where the coronavirus's prevalence stood at only five new infections per 100,000 inhabitants over the course of a week.
Turkey would also require of all travellers leaving for Germany that they show a negative coronavirus test result less than 48 hours old before leaving, the ministry's Tuesday statement added.
Some 3 million of Germany's 80 million inhabitants have a Turkish ethnic background, while Turkey's sea coasts have historically been among the most popular tourist destination for Germans of all ethnicities.

A court spokeswoman said a hearing would take place on Sept. 3, shifted from a planned verdict on Wednesday, to give more time to review the rulings.
The murders of Jan Kuciak and his fiancee, Martina Kusnirova, sparked mass protests and forced then prime minister Robert Fico to step down amid public anger over perceived graft in public life.
Fico's Smer party lost a general election to anti-corruption politician Igor Matovic's party in February, ending the leftist group's nearly decade-and-a-half rule in the central European country.
Anger over the killings and demands to end corruption have remained a strong theme in civic life since mass protests two years ago that were sparked by the killings at Kuciak's home in February 2018. 
Prosecutors say Slovak entrepreneur Marian Kocner, the subject of Kuciak's reporting on corruption involving politically connected businesspeople, had contracted the reporter's killing. 
He and two co-defendants, who deny wrongdoing, face 25 years in prison if found guilty.
Two others have already been sentenced after admitting guilt. A former soldier received 23 years in prison in April for shooting and killing Kuciak and his fiancee while a fifth suspect admitted to arranging Kuciak's murder and was jailed for 15 years in December.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru´s Congress on Tuesday rejected a vote of confidence for President Martín Vizcarra´s cabinet chief, forcing yet another reshuffle of his top advisors in the middle of an economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Cabinet chief and Prime Minister Pedro Cateriano lost a confidence vote 54-37 after a marathon parliamentary session that began on Monday morning.
The upheaval throws the government's plan to kickstart the Andean nation's ailing economy into disarray. The 19 cabinet ministers must now present their resignation to Vizcarra, who has no political party or representation in Congress. A new cabinet must be appointed within 48 hours. 
Vizcarra had already been forced to replace more than half of his cabinet in mid-July as his popularity plunged due to the harsh economic impact of the pandemic and a lengthy lockdown.
The ousted Cateriano, an experienced independent politician, had presented an ambitious economic recovery plan in Congress the day before.
Peru, the world's second biggest copper producer, has been battered by the COVID-19 outbreak. It has the third most cases in Latin American, behind only Mexico and Brazil. The economy has crashed as mining output sank.
""This is the answer to arrogance, to the lack of proposals. People are dying in the country,"" said José Luna, leader of the Union for Peru party, following the vote.

HARARE (Reuters) - A prize-winning Zimbabwean novelist and filmmaker arrested at recent protests accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government on Tuesday of holding its people in a repressive ""chokehold"" as they endured an economic emergency. 
Tsitsi Dangarembga, whose latest book ""This Mournable Body"" has been nominated for a Booker Prize, was bundled into a police truck while holding placards on Friday and charged with breaking the COVID-19 lockdown to hold an illegal gathering. 
Bailed pending trial after a night in jail, the 61-year-old said she could not keep quiet while neglect and mismanagement left Zimbabweans unable to afford a decent meal and healthcare. 
""These are things that are outside the reach of most Zimbabweans. It's like the people of Zimbabwe are in a chokehold,"" she told Reuters from her home in Harare's affluent Borrowdale suburb. 
""It's a matter of survival really.""
Security forces deployed on Friday to block planned opposition protests over corruption and economic hardships. Foes say Mnangagwa is behaving like his autocratic predecessor Robert Mugabe and exploiting the coronavirus crisis as cover. 
'WHO IS PAYING YOU?'
Popular anger is high over inflation above 700%, hospital strikes, and shortages of medicines and foreign currency.
Mnangagwa blames the opposition, Western sanctions, droughts and the pandemic. ""Dark forces both inside and outside have tampered with our growth and prosperity,"" he said in a speech on Tuesday.
Dangarembga said she had been lucky after rights groups said some activists rounded up over Friday's unrest were abducted and tortured. The government denies that. 
""When we got into the (police) truck one of the first thing that happened is I was asked 'who is paying you?' I was very outraged by that question,"" she recalled.
""What was going through my mind was:'what do we do now? The main thing is not to escalate the situation, we have not done anything wrong so we shouldn't be frightened'.""
Dangarembga noted that a new hashtag #ZimbabweansLivesMatter was helping focus global attention. 
""Trying to change Zimbabwe for the better is going to be a long engagement and we have to strategise,"" she said.
Dangarembga's first novel ""Nervous Conditions"" was part of Zimbabwe's school curriculum and won the African section of the Commonwealth Writers Prize in 1989. 
She also wrote ""Neria"", Zimbabwe's most successful film.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has unexpectedly released a Jehovah's Witness on probation after a court overturned his 6-1/2 year jail sentence for extremism on appeal, a decision hailed by his lawyer on Tuesday as a ""miracle"".
The religious group said it welcomed Monday's decision to free Gennady Shpakovskiy, 61, less than two months after he was sentenced in the northwestern city of Pskov, but said it did not mean Russia was showing greater leniency to its adherents. 
Shpakovskiy's sentence on June 9 was the harshest handed to a Jehovah's Witness in Russia since a 2017 Supreme Court decision branded the Christian denomination an extremist group.
Jehovah's Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia, where the dominant Orthodox Church is championed by President Vladimir Putin. Orthodox scholars have cast them as a dangerous foreign sect that erodes state institutions and traditional values, allegations they reject. 
Shpakovskiy, a Russian, denied charges of organising and financing extremist activities. The Pskov regional court upheld his conviction but overturned the sentence after his appeal.
""I thought everything would remain in force, but a pleasant miracle has happened, something unexpected both for me and the defendant,"" said his lawyer, Arly Chimirov. 
Jarrod Lopes, a U.S.-based spokesman for the religious group, said Shpakovskiy remained stigmatised as a convicted extremist and urged Russia to stop criminalising what he said was the peaceful Christian worship of Jehovah's Witnesses. 
Describing it as ""just one ruling,"" he said: ""We do not yet see it as having national significance. We will see if subsequent cases reveal a pattern of hope."" 
Putin said in 2018 he did not understand why authorities were pursuing the group, but the Kremlin has said since that the group remains illegal under current legislation.

MINSK (Reuters) - Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko accused Moscow on Tuesday of lying in a row about the arrest of a group of Russian security contractors in Minsk, and said unnamed forces were plotting a revolution that would fail.
In a fiery address to the nation as early voting began in an election in which he is seeking to extend his 26-year rule, Lukashenko said he would protect Belarus from opponents he portrayed as wreckers controlled by ""puppet masters"" abroad. 
He faces his toughest challenge for years in Sunday's election because of public anger over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy and human rights in the strategically important east European country of 9.5 million.
Before the election there have been mass protests, some of Lukashenko's opponents have been arrested on what they call trumped-up charges and Minsk has said it suspects the security contractors arrested this month were preparing ""terrorist acts"".
Russia has said the detained men were transiting Belarus to a third country, but Lukashenko said those assertions were ""all lies"".
""These people have given testimony and said they were sent specially to Belarus. Their order was to wait (for further instructions),"" he said.
Lukashenko said Belarus had information about a second group of fighters deployed in the south of the country. He cited no evidence but said they would be hunted down. 
Addressing Russia, he said: ""Stop lying. You have already disgraced yourselves."" 
There was no immediate reaction from Moscow, which has in the past dismissed Lukashenko's criticisms as emotional and has demanded the security contractors' release.
Russia, whose oil exports run through Belarus to the West and has long regarded the country as a buffer zone against NATO, is watching the outcome of events in the country closely, as is the West which has tried to lure Minsk from Moscow's orbit. 
""COLOUR REVOLUTIONS""
Belarus said earlier on Tuesday it would conduct military training for reservists near the border with Russia from Aug. 11. Moscow said on Monday more than 3,000 men and 800 vehicles would take part in war games in regions that neighbour Belarus. 
Lukashenko, who is seeking his sixth term, cast himself as a guarantor of stability and said Belarus was threatened by opponents beholden to foreign forces seeking more of the ""colour revolutions"" that toppled leaders in other ex-Soviet republics.
""They decided to try these colour revolutions on us, using new information technology,"" he said. 
He said the economic fallout from COVID-19 had shown the need for a strong state, and warned: ""Don't believe those who promise wonders – miracles don't happen."" 
He said he would double salaries in the next five years and protect pensions, and rejected opponents' calls to revert to a constitution setting a two-term limit on the presidency. 

His main election opponent is Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, a former teacher whose husband was arrested and prevented from taking part. Western observers do not judge elections in Belarus to be free and fair.

Warsaw deems the Istanbul Convention too liberal and the new row over it could worsen friction between the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) and European Union institutions alarmed at a perceived erosion of democratic standards and rights in Poland.
The PiS has targeted the convention since its presidential candidate narrowly won re-election in July after a campaign that inveighed against LGBT rights. PiS officials have signalled they want to start procedures to leave the pact as part of efforts to cement a socially conservative agenda for years to come.
""It's a document that can in a few years be used to push for a change in law on abortion, for example. It's a convention that makes a number of extreme leftist assumptions,"" Sebastian Kaleta, a deputy justice minister, told Reuters this week. 
He said the convention could also be used to increase migrant flows. ""These men who a few years ago crossed the sea to European countries would say at the first control (point) that they feel they are women or genderless...and will ask for asylum as the convention allows (for this),"" Kaleta said.
Poland has been among the most vocal critics of the EU's migrant relocation programmes and has some of Europe's most restrictive rules surrounding abortion. 
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki last week said Poland's potential departure from the convention would be assessed by its constitutional court. 
Since the election, the European Commission has threatened to cut off funding to Polish regions declaring themselves free of what they call LGBT ""ideology"", hoping to deter what it sees as Poland's backsliding on women's and LGBT rights. 
Kaleta said such moves would violate EU treaties and called for a shake-up in the Commission.

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>","Reuters Graphic: In a flash, a changed world - Remembering Hiroshima","(Reuters) - The atomic bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945 killed tens of thousands and flattened the Japanese city in an instant.
""Little Boy,"" as it was known, was the endpoint of years of research, wrangling a physics theory into a mechanism that would release the energy that binds together atoms. 
The concept was simple: driving together enough uranium or plutonium at high enough speeds would create a ""critical mass"" so quickly that it would start an uncontrolled, nearly instantaneous chain reaction of neutrons knocking apart atomic nuclei.
(Click https://graphics.reuters.com/WW2-ANNIVERSARY/HIROSHIMA/rlgpdnqljpo/index.html to see an interactive graphic about developing atomic weapons.)
Each atom's lost mass is converted to energy at a staggering exchange rate. Only 1.09kg of the 64kg of uranium in Little Boy became energy, but it was the equivalent of detonating 15,000 tons (13.6 million kg) of TNT, according to Los Alamos National Laboratory (NYSE:LH) calculations.
About one square mile of Hiroshima was flattened, crushed by the hammer blow of Little Boy detonating about 580 metres (1,900 ft) overhead. Nearly everyone in that area died instantly. Farther away, the bomb's heat ignited buildings and people, and deadly radiation bloomed.
Since World War Two, no country has attacked another with a nuclear weapon. But at least eight have developed them. More than 2,000 nuclear weapons have been detonated in experiments since 1945.
Thousands of nuclear weapons now sit in arsenals around the world, ready to deploy by aircraft or missile. The Arms Control Association estimates that there are nearly 14,000 such weapons, although of these only a third or so could be immediately used in a war.
Even so, 75 years have passed without a nuclear attack.
""I am hopeful that we can stretch the streak for decades more - but the real question is whether nuclear deterrence will work forever,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.

Lewis, who played an instrumental role in passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, was buried last week after an emotional service in Atlanta attended by three of the nation's four living past presidents. 
Asked about the legacy of Lewis and how history would remember him, Trump told Axios: ""I really don't know ... I don't know John Lewis. He chose not to come to my inauguration ... I never met John Lewis, actually, I don’t believe."" 
Lewis did not attend Trump's January 2017 presidential inauguration after questioning the legitimacy of the 2016 presidential election amid Russian meddling, sparking a verbal clash with the then-president elect. [https://reut.rs/3fzONRL]
The interview aired Monday night but was taped July 28 as Lewis was honored in Washington and laid in state in the U.S. Capitol. Trump did not to attend, although Vice President Mike Pence, who had served in the House of Representatives with Lewis, did. 
Former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton attended a memorial service in Atlanta while 95-year-old former President Jimmy Carter sent a letter.
Obama also eulogized Lewis in a fiery speech that sought to press the nation further on voting protections ahead of November's election, which Trump has sought to undermine by casting doubt with unsubstantiated claims on mail-in ballots and suggesting a possible delay.
Lewis was instrumental in the push for Black Americans' voting rights and led a famous march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, where he was nearly beaten to death.
An effort is now under way to rename the bridge, a National Historic Landmark, in honor of the lawmaker, who died last month at age 80. Trump told Axios he would not object.

The latest tally of 680 new infections and six deaths comes as Poland considers introducing stricter restrictions, including mandatory testing for travellers returning to Poland and quarantine for those coming from certain countries.
More than 220 cases were reported in Silesia, where a rapid spread of infections led to a temporary reduction of coal output and work in 12 mines in June. The situation then stabilised, but has now deteriorated again.
Last week new cases were detected in three mines, including Chwalowice, which was among those where work was cut back to a minimum in June. The state assets ministry said all 2,700 miners in Chwalowice would be tested on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Sanitary services said last week the resurgence of COVID-19 among miners was a result of easing restrictions and of the working conditions in the mines, where it is difficult to enforce social distancing.
Currently 1,043 coal miners are infected, mostly from Poland's biggest coal producer PGG, data cited by state-run news agency PAP showed on Tuesday. 
The pandemic has added to numerous problems faced by the coal industry. The government, PGG representatives and trade unions have agreed to work out a restructuring plan by the end of September.
Poland now has a total of 48,149 recorded coronavirus cases and 1,738 deaths. 
Sittings of the upper and lower houses of parliament have been pushed back, with the lower house meeting moving from Aug. 7 to Aug. 14, after one senator tested positive on Saturday.

Heavy rain, which has also battered China, Thailand, Myanmar and India in recent days, inundated farmland and flooded parts of major highways and bridges in the capital, Seoul.
The victims included three New Zealanders from the same family, who were found dead on Monday after a landslide hit vacation cottages in Gapyeong country, northeast of Seoul.
They were a woman believed to be 65, her 36-year-old daughter and her three-year-old grandson, a Gapyeong police official said.
The New Zealand foreign ministry said it was aware of the deaths and was providing consular assistance. It did not elaborate.
President Moon Jae-in expressed concern for the impact of 42 days of rain, which weather officials said was the longest such stretch since 2013, on public sector emergency workers already battling the coronavirus pandemic.
He urged ""all-out efforts to prevent further loss of life"", such as action to avert landslides and evacuate people, even in cases of little apparent danger.
Most of the flooded roads and bridges along the Han River in Seoul that had backed up traffic and damaged infrastructure were back in operation on Tuesday, the Yonhap news agency said.
In neighbouring North Korea, state media warned of possible flooding.
""All the sectors of the national economy... are taking steps to prevent damage from the downpour,"" state news agency KCNA said, saying that some areas were predicted to receive as much as half a metre (20 inches) of rain. 
Citing unidentified South Korean government officials, Yonhap said North Korea opened the floodgates of a border dam on Monday without advance notice to its neighbour.

The July 3 programme, entitled ""Locked up in Malaysia's lockdown"", prompted a backlash in the Southeast Asia nation, with authorities branding the report inaccurate, misleading and unfair.
Rights groups have accused the government of suppressing media freedom after Al Jazeera journalists were called in for questioning by the police and an investigation was opened into alleged sedition, defamation and violation of a communications law. 
Malaysian police seized two computers from the Al Jazeera office during Tuesday's raid, the Qatar-based broadcaster said in a statement. 
""Conducting a raid on our office and seizing computers is a troubling escalation in the authorities' crackdown on media freedom and shows the lengths they are prepared to take to try to intimidate journalists,"" Al Jazeera said.
Al Jazeera said it stood by its report and called on authorities to drop the criminal investigation. 
Malaysian police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Malaysia arrested hundreds of undocumented foreigners, including children and Rohingya refugees, after the country imposed a lockdown to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.
Human rights activists have condemned the arrests as inhumane. Malaysian officials have said they were necessary to prevent the spread of the virus.
Activists have voiced concern that the five-month-old administration of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin is stifling dissent amid a series of clampdowns, an accusation it has denied.
Last month, authorities arrested a Bangladeshi man who criticised the government's treatment of migrant workers in the Al Jazeera programme.

With a tradition of using the leaf to relieve pain and fatigue, Thailand became the first Southeast Asian nation to legalise marijuana in 2017 for medical use and research, but only the government was allowed to grow plants. 
Deputy government spokeswoman Traisuree Taisaranakul told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the proposed amendments would also allow patients, businesses and medical professionals to produce, export, import and sell the leaf.
""The law will promote the pharmaceutical industry and increase competitiveness, which will be important for Thailand in becoming a leader in medical cannabis,"" Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul also told reporters.
Thailand has dropped cannabis extracts from its narcotics list and opened medical marijuana clinics.
Cannabis still remains a category five drug under Thai law, however, and illegal possession is punishable by up to 15 years in prison and fines of up to 1.5 million baht ($48,000).
The amendments are to be sent for legal review before going to the Thai parliament. 
While countries from Colombia to Canada have legalized marijuana for medical or even recreational use, the drug remains illegal and taboo across much of Southeast Asia, which has some of the world’s harshest punishments for drug law violations.

Marijuana traffickers can be subject to the death penalty in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief who staged a coup six years ago and has led military-backed governments ever since, also promised that parliament would consider protesters' demands to amend the constitution.
""I beg people not to create chaos at this time. We are solving these problems together,"" Prayuth told reporters after a cabinet meeting.
He said he was ""worried"" about the young protesters who have been gathering in small groups in different parts of the country calling for the dissolution of parliament and new elections.
Prayuth said a committee has been formed in parliament to discuss possible changes to a 2017 constitution drafted under military auspices and a mechanism to gauge the views of young people would be set up this month.
Opposition activists say that under the constitution, Prayuth was virtually assured of staying on a prime minister after a disputed 2019 general election by the creation of a junta-appointed Senate.
""I support changes that are needed and I am not in conflict,"" he said.
He did not say what changes would be considered in parliament, where his ruling coalition holds a comfortable majority after a main opposition party was dissolved in February.
A court ban of the opposition Future Forward Party sparked campus demonstrations and student protesters took to the streets last month with some 2,500 rallying at Bangkok's Democracy Monument. Since then, protests have spread.
Prayuth has previously warned protesters not to insult the monarchy, which is illegal in Thailand, though he said King Maha Vajiralongkorn had asked that people no longer be prosecuted under that law.
On Monday night, student protesters issued a statement calling for changes in laws ""that expand the power of the monarch and that could impinge on democracy where the king is the head of state”.
Officials at the Royal Palace on Tuesday said they had no comment when asked about the protest demands.
The constitution says the king is to be ""revered"" and insulting the monarchy is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison under ""lese majeste"" laws.
After the king took the throne in 2016, the palace required revisions to the new constitution that gave him greater emergency powers. He has since taken personal control over some army units and palace assets worth tens of billions of dollars. 
Asked about the protesters openly discussing the king, Prayuth said it was a matter of law enforcement.
""I won’t stop it from happening. This issue is for authorities to follow the law,"" he said.

""Protests are a right under the law, but they have to respect the law and rules. I am not threatening, but I am worried.""

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 06:22AM ET</span>",Crisis-weary Lebanon braces for Hariri tribunal verdict,"By Tom Perry
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Fifteen years after a truck bomb killed Lebanon's former Sunni leader Rafik al-Hariri in Beirut, triggering regional upheaval, a U.N.-backed court trying four suspects from Shi'ite Hezbollah delivers a verdict on Friday that could shake the country again.
The defendants, members of the powerful Iran-backed group, have been tried in absentia on charges of planning and arranging the 2005 bombing which killed the former prime minister who spearheaded Lebanon's reconstruction after its long civil war.
Hariri's assassination prompted mass protests in Beirut and a wave of international pressure which forced Syria to end its 29-year military presence in Lebanon after the U.N. investigator linked it with the bombing.
The assassination also inflamed political and sectarian tensions inside Lebanon and across the Middle East, particularly when investigators started probing potential Hezbollah links to the death of a politician who was backed by the West as well as Sunni Gulf Arab states opposed to Tehran. 
Hezbollah, which is both a political party in Lebanon's government and a heavily armed guerrilla group, denies any role in Hariri's killing and dismisses the Netherlands-based tribunal as politicised. 
Few expect the defendants to be handed over if convicted, but any guilty verdicts could pose a problem to the government and deepen rifts unresolved since the 1975-1990 civil war. The country is already reeling from the worst economic crisis in decades and a deepening COVID-19 outbreak.
Hezbollah has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United States, Canada, Germany, Britain, Argentina and Honduras as well as the Sunni Muslim Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which includes Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Kuwait. The EU classifies Hezbollah’s military wing as a terrorist group, but not its political wing.
Hariri's supporters, including his son Saad who subsequently also served as prime minister, say they are not seeking revenge or confrontation, but that the court verdict must be respected. 
""We... look forward to August 7 being a day of truth and justice for Lebanon and a day of punishment for the criminals,"" Saad Hariri said last week.
""AVOIDING STRIFE""
Hariri stepped down as prime minister in October after failing to address demands of protesters demonstrating against years of corruption by a ruling elite which has driven Lebanon to its current financial crisis.
His successor Hassan Diab, backed by Hezbollah and its allies, says the country must avoid further turmoil over the tribunal verdicts. ""Confronting strife is a priority,"" Diab tweeted last week.
In the Feb. 14, 2005 bombing, a truck laden with 3,000 kg of high-grade explosives blew up as Rafik Hariri's motorcade passed Beirut's waterfront Saint Georges hotel, killing him and 21 other people and leaving a huge crater in the road.
Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hassan Habib Merhi, Assad Hassan Sabra and Hussein Hassan Oneissi are charged with conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack. Ayyash is charged with committing a terrorist act, homicide and attempted homicide.
Prosecutors said data culled from telephone networks showed that the defendants called each other from dozens of mobile phones to monitor Hariri in the months before the attack and to coordinate their movements on the day itself.
The men have not been seen in public for years.
Hezbollah has often questioned the tribunal's integrity and neutrality, saying its work had been tainted by false witnesses and reliance on telephone records that Israeli spies arrested in Lebanon could have manipulated.
""It is Hezbollah's right to have doubts about the court, which transformed into political score-settling far from the truth,"" said Salem Zahran, an analyst with links to Hezbollah leaders. Any verdict ""has no value"" to the group, he said.
Nabil Boumonsef, deputy editor-in-chief of Lebanon's An-Nahar newspaper, said neither Saad Hariri nor Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah wanted to escalate tensions.
But he expected Hariri to call for the defendants to be handed over if found guilty - which would leave Hezbollah on the defensive politically despite its military strength. If the group refused to surrender them it could put the government which it helped put together in difficulty.
As it tries to tackle the deep economic crisis, a guilty verdict could also jeopardise Lebanon's efforts, which have been supported by France, to win international aid.
""France... will have to take a position on Hezbollah after the verdict comes out on Aug. 7,"" Boumonsef said.
France hosted a donor meeting in Paris in 2018 when Beirut won more than $11 billion in pledges for infrastructure investment. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told Lebanese leaders in Beirut last month that Paris was ready to mobilise international support if Lebanon moved ahead with reform.

Australian and U.S. aircraft located the men on tiny Pikelot island, about 200 km (124 miles) west of where they had set off in a seven-metre (23-ft) skiff before veering off course and running out of fuel.
""I am proud of the response and professionalism of all on board as we fulfil our obligation to contribute to the safety of life at sea wherever we are,"" the Australian Navy's Capt. Terry Morrison said in a defence department statement.
Morrison commands the HMAS Canberra, which sent a helicopter to the rescue after officials in the U.S. territory of Guam raised the alarm, following the men's failure to complete a 42-km (26-mile) trip between Pacific atolls.
The helicopter landed on the island on Sunday to check the men's condition and gave them food and water after its crew spotted their appeal for help, close to their makeshift shelter.
A Micronesian patrol vessel is headed to the island to pick up the men, the statement added.
Pikelot is a low coral islet, with forest and scrub, that is home to a seabird rookery and turtle nesting site.

A pact reached by U.S. and Taliban negotiators in Doha in February had agreed that 5,000 Taliban prisoners should be released from Afghan jails as a precondition to the militant movement holding talks with the government.
President Ashraf Ghani's government has released all but 400, saying their crimes were too grave.
On Sunday, it declared a loya jirga, a traditional consultative gathering of elders, community leaders and politicians was needed to debate what to do with the remaining prisoners. And on Tuesday, the government fixed the date.
""These 400 are those who have been convicted in killings from two to 40 people, drug trafficking, those sentenced to death and involved in major crimes, including kidnapping,"" Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the president, said.
He said a loya jirga, regarded in the constitutional as the highest expression of the Afghan people, was required as the president was not empowered to release prisoners convicted of such crimes.
Held under a giant tent, the loya jirga is a centuries-old institution used to build consensus among competing tribes, factions and ethnic groups and to discuss matters of national importance, traditionally convened under extraordinary circumstances.
On Sunday, as the government and Taliban were observing the last day of three-day ceasefire for Muslim Eid holidays, Islamic State militants launched a brazen attack at a prison in eastern Nangarhar province and freed hundreds of inmates.
The violence comes at a sensitive time for Afghanistan as the U.S. attempts to usher a peace deal between Afghan government and the Taliban to end 19-year-old war. 
Since the U.S.-Taliban agreement in Febuary, 3,560 Afghan security forces personnel have been killed in attacks by militants, thousands more have been wounded, Ghani said last week.
In the same week, U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a report that more than 1,280 Afghan civilians had been killed in the first six months of the year, mainly as a result of fighting between Afghan government forces and Taliban insurgents.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece has seen fewer migrants and refugees arriving from Turkey, numbering in the hundreds in the last four months, mainly due to increased border checks and partly due to the coronavirus pandemic, a government minister said on Tuesday.
But Turkey is ""a difficult and unpredictable neighbour that controls a pool of four million migrants and refugees"", Alternate Migration Minister George Koumoutsakos told Reuters.
""No one can rule out that it will attempt to use (them) at another instance.""
Koumoutsakos was speaking before visiting migrant camps on the island of Lesbos with the premier of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
In March, tensions between NATO allies Greece and Turkey, which disagree on a range of issues, rose a notch when thousands of refugees hosted by Turkey tried to storm the border into Greece and the European Union. 
""The reduced flow won't allow us to rest. On the contrary, it imposes the (need) for continued vigilance,"" Koumoutsakos said. 
More than a million people fleeing conflict reached Greek shores from Turkey in 2015-16.
From April to July, Greece recorded 850 arrivals, down from 12,363 in the same period last year. Tens of thousands are still trapped in overcrowded migrant camps on its islands. 
Turkey, home to 3.6 million Syrians, the world's largest refugee population, had said it would open the frontier because it was alarmed by the prospect of another wave of refugees fleeing war in northwest Syria.
The conservative Greek government has started transferring thousands of migrants to more secure facilities on the mainland, which activists have compared to prisons.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China vowed on Tuesday to retaliate if the United States persisted with ""hostile action"" against Chinese journalists who may be forced to leave in coming days if their U.S. visas are not extended.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters at a daily briefing that no Chinese journalist in the United States had been granted a visa extension since the United States, on May 11, limited their stay to 90 days, with an option to extend.
""The U.S. has been escalating its actions against Chinese journalists,"" Wang told reporters. ""The U.S. should immediately correct its mistake and stop its actions."" 
""If the U.S. persists, China will take a necessary and legitimate response to safeguard its rights,"" he said. 
Wang did not say how many Chinese journalists were affected or what retaliation China might consider, but the editor of China's Global Times newspaper said earlier U.S. journalists based in Hong Kong would be among those targeted should Chinese journalists be forced to leave the United States.
""Chinese side has prepared for the worst scenario that all Chinese journalists have to leave,"" Hu said on Twitter.
""If that's the case, Chinese side will retaliate, including targeting US journalists based in HK.""
The Global Times is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party. 
The two countries, whose relations have deteriorated sharply recently over various issues including trade and the novel coronavirus, have exchanged several tit-for-tat actions involving journalists in recent months.
The United States in March slashed the number of Chinese nationals allowed to work at the U.S. offices of major Chinese state-owned media to 100 from 160.

China expelled U.S. journalists working for three U.S. newspapers - New York Times, Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post - this year and has threatened to match any more U.S. action against Chinese journalists.

Some suburbs have seen more than 300 mm of rain in the 24 hours to Tuesday morning and more heavy rain is expected over the next two days, said India Meteorological Department (IMD) official K.S. Hosalikar.
The department issued a red alert for the city for the next two days and civic authorities advised people not to venture out unless absolutely necessary.
Trains, already running skeleton services due to the novel coronavirus lockdown, were suspended in several places because of flooding and traffic was disrupted on some of the city's main roads.

There was no impact on operations at Mumbai's airport apart from reduced visibility, a representative said.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - In a gesture of reconciliation, two prominent Muslims who lived through deadly riots following the razing of a mosque in northern India in 1992 plan to attend the foundation-laying ceremony for a Hindu temple on Wednesday on the same site, they said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Hindu nationalist party has been leading the demand for a temple there dedicated to the god-king Ram, is expected to be the chief guest at the event in Ayodhya town.
Construction was made possible by a verdict late last year from the Supreme Court of India awarding the disputed site to the Hindus, and the planned visit by the two well-known Muslims underscored an easing of animosity between followers of the two religious faiths in one of Hindu-majority India's most communally sensitive regions.
""Whatever happened are things of the past,"" said Iqbal Ansari, one of the Muslim litigants. ""I've been invited and I think it's the wish of Lord Ram and I am going to attend it.""
Mohammad Sharif, another Muslim honoured with one of India's highest civilian awards for doing the last rites of unclaimed bodies since the riots, told Reuters he too had got an invitation and was keen to be there.
In 1992, a Hindu mob destroyed the 16th-century Babri Mosque on the site, triggering clashes in which about 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed across the country. Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of Lord Ram, a physical incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu.
The area, situated about 427 miles southeast of New Delhi, was filled with the sounds of vedic hymns ahead of the ground-breaking ceremony.
Barricades have been put up across the town with heavy police presence, as authorities try to limit the number of visitors to maintain social distancing. At least two priests in the area and four policemen have tested positive for COVID-19.

Still, nearly 200 people are likely to be there at the event, including 135 saints and priests from Nepal.

Researchers from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine modelled the impact of reopening schools either on a full- or part-time basis, thus allowing parents to return to work, on the potential spread of the virus.
They concluded a second wave could be prevented if 75% of those with symptoms were found and tested and 68% of their contacts were traced, or if 87% of people with symptoms were found and 40% of their contacts tested.
""However, we also predict that in the absence of sufficiently broad test–trace–isolate coverage, reopening of schools combined with accompanied reopening of society across all scenarios might induce a second COVID-19 wave,"" said the study, published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health.
""Our modelling results suggest that full school reopening in September 2020 without an effective test-trace-isolate strategy would result in R rising above 1 and a resulting second wave of infections that would peak in December 2020 and be 2.0-2·3 times the size of the original COVID-19 wave.""
The lead author of the study, Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, said the test-and-trace system in England was currently reaching only about 50% of contacts of all those testing positive for COVID-19.
Panovska-Griffiths, lecturer in mathematical modelling at University College London, told BBC radio that the worst scenarios could still be avoided.
""Importantly, what we find is that it is possible to avoid a second epidemic wave if enough people with symptomatic infections can be diagnosed. Their contacts can then be traced and effectively isolated,"" she said.
""We are the first study that has quantified this, how much this needs to be for the UK.""
Schools in Britain closed in March during the national lockdown, except for the children of key workers, and reopened for a small number of pupils in June.
However, the government says all pupils will return to school across the United Kingdom by early September with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it is a national priority.
""I think we all accept that test-and-trace is a programme which needs to continue to improve. There is total humility in government about that,"" junior local government minister Simon Clarke told BBC radio.

""We fully accept that we need to keep driving those numbers up,"" he said.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday formally declared her intention to seek a second term in an election in November that is seen as a test of the Southeast Asian nation's tentative democratic reforms.
After decades of military rule, Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for campaigning for democracy, took the reins in 2016 after an electoral landslide, but has been forced to share power with the generals.
Her international reputation slumped over Myanmar's treatment of Rohingya Muslims but she remains popular at home, where her image is undented by accusations of complicity in atrocities against the minority.
On Tuesday, Suu Kyi, 75, waved to a crowd of around 50 supporters on the outskirts of the former capital Yangon to submit an application to run as a candidate.
Some of her supporters wore red-coloured face masks denoting their backing for her National League for Democracy (NLD) party and shouted: ""Mother Suu, be healthy."" 
In 2017, a military-led crackdown in Myanmar resulted in more than 730,000 Rohingya fleeing across the border to Bangladesh, where they took shelter in refugee camps. U.N. investigators concluded that the military campaign had been executed with ""genocidal intent"".
In January, Suu Kyi admitted that war crimes may have been committed against Rohingya, but denied genocide, saying refugees had exaggerated the extent of abuses against them
Mainly-Muslim Gambia had filed a suit in November at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) accusing Myanmar of “ongoing genocide” against the Rohingya. 
Myanmar has filed a report on its adherence to measures to protect Rohingya, but details of the document have not been published.
On the domestic front, Suu Kyi's adminstration has had faltering peace talks with ethnic armed groups in various parts of the country, while a struggling economy faces new pressure from the cororavirus pandemic.

The Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which is dominated by the military and retired civil servants, will be the NLD's main opponent.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Indian soldiers patrolled streets and kept watch from the rooftops in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar on the eve of the first anniversary of the Muslim majority region's loss of autonomy.
Late on Monday, authorities imposed a curfew in Srinagar until Wednesday due to intelligence about potential violent protests, according to a government order.
On Aug. 5, 2019, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government took away Jammu & Kashmir state's special privileges, provoking anger in the region and in neighbouring Pakistan.
It also took away Jammu & Kashmir's status as a state by creating two federally controlled territories, splitting off the thinly populated, Buddhist-dominated region of Ladakh.
Jammu & Kashmir had been the only Muslim-majority state in mainly Hindu India.
India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, and the disputed Himalayan region was again the focus of a flare-up between the two nuclear powers last year.
Police had received information that separatist groups including those supported by Pakistan planned to observe a ""Black Day"" on Wednesday and there was a risk to life and property, the Srinagar's district magistrate said in a public order. 
Modi's government has said the move last August was necessary to spur economic development and to better integrate the region with the rest of country.
But the removal of Kashmir's special status - granted to the state via the Indian Constitution's Article 370 - was accompanied by harsh movement restrictions, mass detentions and a complete communication blackout to forestall protests.
Shabir Ahmad Dar, 40, who works in a juice factory, said he was stopped at one of Srinagar's several checkpoints on Tuesday morning and was told by soldiers to return home.
""Other workers from our locality were also sent back"", he said.
Pakistan has said it will observe the anniversary of Kashmir's loss of autonomy as a ""siege day"" in solidarity with Kashmiris.

New Delhi has along accused Pakistan of backing militant groups operating in Kashmir - a charge that Islamabad denies, saying that it only provides moral and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their struggle for self-determination.

Vorayuth Yoovidhya was accused of crashing his Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) into policeman Wichien Klanprasert and dragging his body for dozens of metres before fleeing the scene. 
He missed eight summonses to appear in court and his case raised angry questions about impunity for the rich. He was eventually charged with reckless driving causing death, with a statue of limitations until 2027, but his whereabouts are not known.
Last month, in a surprise move, police said the charges against him were being dropped. 
But that decision was questioned in parliament and elsewhere and the police, the government and the Attorney General's office all said they would investigate.
A spokesman for the Office of the Attorney-General said new evidence had been found about the speed at which Vorayuth was believed to have been driving when he crashed into the policeman, who was on a motorcycle, on a Bangkok street.
""This case is not over because the law says if there is new evidence, we are able to proceed,"" Prayut Phetkun, the office's deputy spokesman, told reporters.
Previously, the speed of Vorayuth's Ferrari at the time of the accident was allegedly 80 kph (50 mph) but Prayut said, according to an expert opinion not previously included in the police report, the speed was closer to 170 kph (105 mph).
""This is new evidence according to the law."" 
Vorayuth could also face a new charge because blood tests after the accident showed traces of cocaine, but he was not charged at the time due to a possible false positive from the use of other medication, Prayut said. 
Vorayuth, the grandson of the late Chaleo Yoovidhya, creator of the Krating Daeng, or Red Bull, energy drink was 27 at the time of the accident.
Prayut said the Attorney-General's office would recommend that police re-investigate the case due to discrepancy over the vehicle's speed.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 02:41AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.N. staffer who complained of sexual assault appeals dismissal - documents,"By Emma Farge
GENEVA (Reuters) - A policy adviser fired by the U.N. agency fighting AIDS is appealing her dismissal for misconduct, saying she was actually sacked for reporting that she had been sexually assaulted by a senior colleague, her appeal documents show.
Martina Brostrom, from Sweden, was fired for sexual and financial misconduct in December. Her appeal, which she said was sent in April to the Global Board of Appeal of the World Health Organization (WHO), which oversees UNAIDS, has not been made public but Reuters has reviewed it.
""It becomes absurd to the point of being ironic that the one person who filed a sexual assault complaint is the one who is found guilty of sexual misconduct,"" she said in an interview. The WHO declined to comment.
Then UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director Luiz Loures denies her accusation that he groped her in a hotel elevator in Thailand in 2015 and tried to drag her towards his room. Brostrom went public with her complaint in 2018.
Brostrom told Reuters an initial internal U.N. investigation did not substantiate her allegations but that the matter is still being investigated as part of a subsequent, wider case.
According to a UNAIDS letter to Brostrom dated April 27, 2018, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres initiated the second investigation after other sexual harassment allegations were made against Loures, which he also denies.
Guterres spokesman Stephane Dujarric declined to give any details of the investigation, citing confidentiality. Reuters was unable to confirm whether it was still ongoing.
Brostrom's appeal says her dismissal emerged from an investigation based on allegations contained in anonymous emails and initiated by Loures, then the agency's number two.
The transcript of a July 2017 internal U.N. interview seen by Reuters cites him saying: ""I trigger the investigation"".
Asked to comment, Loures said Brostrom was trying to distract attention from her dismissal. ""I was not involved in the decision to dismiss and indeed had left UNAIDS before the independent investigation was started,"" he said.
UNAIDS spokeswoman Sophie Barton-Knott declined to comment on the specifics of the case, citing confidentiality.
""Comprehensive policies are in place and strictly adhered to at UNAIDS to protect whistle-blowers who report suspected wrongdoing from retaliation,"" she said. ""UNAIDS does not engage in or tolerate any form of retaliation.""
REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE
Since the 1990's, the U.N.'s reputation has been damaged by a series of high-profile allegations of sexual misconduct, notably by U.N. peacekeepers. U.N. personnel have immunity, which must be waived before any judicial proceedings.
Guterres has called for ""zero tolerance"" on sexual harassment and sought to bring in greater protection for those who report it since taking office in 2017.
In November 2018, around 10,000 staff and contractors across the U.N. said they had experienced sexual harassment in the past two years. Only 17% of those eligible responded, something Guterres said may indicate an ongoing sense of mistrust.
U.N. data shows 446 formal reports of sexual harassment were made from 2016-8. Forty five led to disciplinary proceedings.
UNAIDS declined to give details of the alleged wrongdoing by Brostrom which led to her dismissal, citing confidentiality.
She says the charge of sexual misconduct refers to a consensual relationship with her now-husband which was disclosed to the agency. She denies the charge of financial misconduct and says it relates to a hotel bill at an official workshop.
Her appeal says she suffered ""severe and irreparable harm"" to her personal and professional life from a ""campaign of retaliation and harassment"" against her. She is seeking two million Swiss francs ($2 million) in damages from the agency.
UNAIDS has a $484 million budget for 2020-2021. Top donors are the United States and Sweden.
In July, U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression David Kaye called for ""real reform"" of U.N. whistleblower protection mechanisms.

Dujarric said Guterres had improved those mechanisms and ""remains committed to ensuring the system protects those who come forward"".

The country is battling a new wave of the deadly virus, with southeastern Victoria state reeling from hundreds of infections, while Indigenous Australians are seen at greater risk as they suffer a higher incidence of other health woes.
""It's up to tourists to stay away if they come from hotspots or are sick,"" Thalia Bohl-Van Den Boogaard, the representative of a group of Indigenous Australians protesting against the visits, told Reuters by telephone.
A few protesters from the indigenous community stood on the main entrance road to the park on Tuesday, down from the previous day's numbers of between 30 and 40 that had turned away tourists before the attraction closed, she said. 
The group was concerned by the arrival in a nearby town of 39 people from the northeastern city of Brisbane, a declared virus hotspot, said Bohl-Van Den Boogaard, the chief executive of the Mutitjulu Community Aboriginal Corporation. 
""People here have been locked in their communities for months and months to contain the spread, and now it's not up to them to do the right thing,"" she added, urging visitors to keep away. 
About 350 tourists have visited the park following July's re-opening of the state's borders since closure in March during the first wave of the pandemic, Bohl-Van Den Boogaard said.
Parks Australia, the state-run manager of heritage estates and nature sites, said it was working as part of a ""collective response"" to minimise the risk of contagion. 
""At the request of the Mutitjulu Community Aboriginal Corporation, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park will be closed,"" a spokesman told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Monday. 
The UNESCO World Heritage-listed 348-m (1,142-ft) monolith, formerly known as Ayers Rock, where climbing was banned last year, is closed to sightseers. 
An agency spokeswoman said the park would stay closed during discussions with the group and Northern Territory officials to ramp up health screening and testing at the local airport and Yulara, the town the Brisbane group visited.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Tuesday that the world faces a ""generational catastrophe"" because of school closures amid the coronavirus pandemic and said that getting students safely back to the classroom must be ""a top priority.""
Guterres said that as of mid-July schools were closed in some 160 countries, affecting more than 1 billion students, while at least 40 million children have missed out on pre-school.
This came on top of more than 250 million children already being out of school before the pandemic and only a quarter of secondary school students in developing countries leaving with basic skills, he said in a video statement.
""Now we face a generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress, and exacerbate entrenched inequalities,"" said Guterres as he launched a U.N. ""Save our Future"" campaign. 
""Once local transmission of COVID-19 is under control, getting students back into schools and learning institutions as safely as possible must be a top priority,"" he said. ""Consultation with parents, carers, teachers and young people is fundamental.""
The U.N. recommendations for getting global education back on track come as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for schools to reopen in the face of opposition from some teachers and parents while COVID-19 is surging in many parts of the country.
The coronavirus, which first appeared in China late last year, has infected 4.6 million people in the United States and killed more than 155,000 Americans since February, according to a Reuters tally. Deaths rose by over 25,000 in July and cases doubled in 19 states during the month.

Globally the coronavirus has infected at least 18.1 million people and there have been more than 689,000 known deaths worldwide, according to the Reuters tally.

At 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6 (2315 GMT, Aug. 5) 1945, U.S. B-29 warplane Enola Gay dropped a bomb nicknamed ""Little Boy"" and obliterated the southwestern city of Hiroshima, killing 140,000 of an estimated population of 350,000, with thousands more dying later of injuries and radiation-related illness.
On Aug. 9, the United States dropped another bomb, dubbed ""Fat Man"", about 420 kilometers (261 miles) to the south over Nagasaki, instantly killing more than 75,000 people beneath a mushroom cloud which grew as high as 9,000 meters (30,000 feet).
Japan surrendered six days later, ending World War Two.
Archive footage shows pre-bomb Hiroshima as a bustling, thriving city of trilby-topped gentlemen boarding trams, ladies dressed in elegant kimonos, and uniformed schoolchildren walking beneath cherry blossoms overhanging shopping streets.
After the blast, rubble and contorted metal stretch almost uninterruptedly to the horizon. Electricity poles and bare trees accompany the dotted handful of windowless buildings which appear to have withstood the impossible.
Japan will commemorate the 75th anniversary of the bombing of the two cities on Aug. 6 and Aug. 9 this year.
In previous years, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the city mayors attended annual memorial services and renewed pledges for a nuclear-free world. Bells tolled and a minute's silence was observed at the exact time the bombs detonated in both cities.

Commemorations this year will be scaled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with fewer seats and video messages from dignitaries.

DANDWAL, India (Reuters) - One overcast morning in a farming village in hilly western India, a group of schoolchildren sat on the mud floor of a wooden shed for their first class in months. 
There was no teacher, just a voice from a loudspeaker. 
The recorded lessons form part of an initiative by an Indian non-profit spread over six villages that aims to reach 1,000 students denied formal classes since the coronavirus pandemic forced schools to close four months ago. 
The children sang rhymes and answered questions, with some of them speaking of the loudspeaker as 'Speaker Brother' or 'Speaker Sister'.
""I love studying with Speaker Brother,"" said Jyoti, a gleeful 11-year-old girl who attended one session. 
Reuters followed the volunteers last week as they carried the loudspeaker through villages in the Indian state of Maharashtra where children awaiting its arrival had gathered at designated, socially-distanced spots. 
""We wondered if children and their parents would accept a loudspeaker as their teacher,"" said Shraddha Shringarpure, head of the Diganta Swaraj Foundation, which has done development work for more than a decade among tribal villages in the region.
But response to the programme, called 'Bolki Shaala' or 'Spoken School' in the state language of Marathi, has been encouraging, Shringarpure added.
It reaches children who are usually the first in their families to go to school, with content covering part of the school curriculum, as well as social skills and English language lessons. 
""These kids have no guidance from their family, they are on their own,"" Shringarpure said.
While many children in cities have been able to attend classes online, those in places like Dandwal, where telecom networks are poor and power supply is often erratic, have gone months without opening schoolbooks. 
Parents like Sangeeta Yele, who hope for better lives for their children, are pushing them to attend the mobile classes.
""As the school is closed, my son used to wander in the forests,"" said Yele.

""'Bolki Shaala' has reached our village and now my son has started studying. I am happy. It gives me happiness that my son can now sing songs and narrate stories.""

1414,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 09:12PM ET</span>",The survivor: last Korean war criminal in Japan wants recognition,"By Ju-min Park
TOKYO (Reuters) - To the casual observer, 95-year-old Lee Hak-rae could be just another elderly person in Japan. Surrounded by pictures of his family and paintings by his great-grandchildren, Lee potters about his cluttered living room on the outskirts of Tokyo.
But Lee is obsessed by brutal events of 75 years ago that have defined his life: his recruitment into the Japanese army from then-occupied Korea in 1942; his role in building the Thai-Burma railway; being designated a World War Two criminal; and how, he says, he was tossed into the dustbin of history by both Japan and South Korea.
Since recovering its sovereignty under the San Francisco Peace Treaty signed in 1951, and reviving military pensions in 1953, Japan has given a pension supplement that can add up to about $41,000 a year to military veterans. 
That includes war criminals and their families, government officials say. Japanese wartime leaders convicted of war crimes by an Allied tribunal are honoured at Tokyo’s Yasukuni shrine.
The treaty also meant Koreans who fought for Japan lost their Japanese nationality, and with it, entitlement to such assistance. More importantly for Lee, the men have never been afforded the attention and a sense of closure given to their Japanese counterparts. 
""Listen to me. Why are they treating us differently?"" says Lee, switching in a barely audible voice between Korean and Japanese. 
""It’s unfair and doesn’t make any sense. How can I accept this unbelievable situation?” Lee said as he clutched dog-eared clippings documenting his years of campaigning for recognition and compensation.
Lee was among 148 Korean war criminals convicted after the war. Now he is the last survivor.
Twenty-three of them were executed and he too was sentenced to death by hanging as Kakurai Hiromura in 1947.
His sentence was commuted on appeal to 20 years. He was released on parole from a Tokyo prison in 1956.
About 240,000 Korean men took part in the war on the Japanese side. 
After the war, while Allied governments rounding up suspected war criminals treated men of Korean ethnicity as Japanese, they were rejected by both Korea and Japan, historians say.
""The Koreans convicted of war crimes had a terrible time after the war because they were regarded as collaborators by other Koreans, but they weren’t recognised by the Japanese government as veterans,"" said Robert Cribb, history professor at Australian National University.
Cribb said it was unfair the Japan gave pensions to their war criminals but not to Koreans who were part of the Japanese army.
THE LIZARD
In 1943, Lee oversaw about 500 Allied prisoners of war (POW) building what later became known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Myanmar. 
About 12,000 POWs died from overwork, beatings and exhaustion during the construction of the 415 km (258 mile) line. The conditions were made famous in the 1957 film ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"".
Trial records reviewed by Reuters show prisoners remembered Lee, known as the Lizard, as one of the most brutal guards on the railway. 
Austen Fyfe, an Australian POW, said Lee was notorious for his brutality and beat him repeatedly, including with a bamboo stick on the back of the head. Other prisoners said Lee would stalk their makeshift hospital and ""beat up the people he thought to be well enough to work"".
Lee told the court he had ""pushed them slightly near the shoulder"" but denied charges of brutality, records show. Lee said Koreans were on the lowest rung of the Japanese military hierarchy and merely took orders.
After his release, Lee started a taxi company with other Korean war criminals. Afraid of being labelled a traitor back home, he felt he could not return, even missing his mother's funeral.
""Except my parents and siblings, no one would welcome me,"" he said.
In 1999, Japan’s Supreme Court rejected compensation claims by Lee and other Korean war criminals. 
In 2006, South Korea recognised them as victims of Japanese imperialism but offered no compensation to those living in Japan. Those in Korea gained the right to subsidised healthcare. 
Lee can now only walk with help but he keeps campaigning, even from his wheelchair. In June, he went to parliament to urge lawmakers to propose a law compensating Korean war criminals and their families.

""I was lucky to live until 95. I don't want to live longer for myself but I can't stop fighting for my dead comrades,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Seventy-five years after Japan's defeat in World War Two, Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine for war dead is a potent symbol of the controversy that persists over the conflict's legacy in East Asia. 
Here are some reasons why the shrine is a flashpoint in Japan's relations with China and the two Koreas.
DYING FOR THE EMPEROR
Established in 1869 in a leafy urban enclave, the shrine is 
s dedicated to 2.5 million Japanese who died in wars beginning in the 19th century and including World War Two.
Funded by the government until 1945, Yasukuni - its name formed by combining the Japanese words for ""peace"" and ""country"" - was central to the state religion of Shintoism that mobilised the wartime population to fight in the name of a divine emperor.
Since 1978, those honoured have also included 14 World War Two leaders convicted as ""Class A"" war criminals by an Allied tribunal in 1948, among them wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo. 
Tojo and the others were secretly elevated to the status of gods at the shrine in a solemn ceremony that year, news of which sparked a domestic firestorm when it became public.
BITTER MEMORIES
Many Japanese pay respects to relatives at Yasukuni and conservatives say leaders should be able to honour those who died in the war.
Chinese and Koreans, however, resent the honours accorded there to the war criminals.
Koreans still chafe over Japanese rule from 1910 to 1945, while China has bitter memories of Japan’s invasion and brutal occupation of parts of the country from 1931 to 1945.
Critics in Japan see Yasukuni as as a symbol of a militarist past and say leaders' visits violate the separation of religion and state mandated by the post-war constituion. 
A museum on the grounds has been criticised as depicting the war as one that Japan fought to liberate Asia from Western imperialism, while ignoring atrocities by its troops.
The names of thousands of men from Taiwan and Korea killed while serving with Imperial forces are also recorded at Yasukuni. Some relatives want their names removed.
EMPERORS SHUN 
Emperor Hirohito, in whose name Japanese soldiers fought the war, visited Yasukuni eight times between the conflict's end and 1975. Historians say he stopped due to displeasure over the enshrined convicted wartime leaders.
His son, Akihito, who became emperor in 1989 and abdicated last year, never visited, nor has current Emperor Naruhito. The royals have attended a separate, secular ceremony.
PRIME MINISTERS' CONTROVERSY
Many Japanese premiers visited Yasukuni after the war, but refrained from saying it was in an official capacity, until Aug. 15 1985, when Yasuhiro Nakasone made an official visit.
The move, on the 40th anniversary of the war's end, drew harsh criticism from China. Nakasone did not go again.
Junichiro Koizumi made annual pilgrimages while premier from 2001 to 2006, contributing to a deep chill in ties with China.
Abe, whose agenda includes reviving pride in Japan's past, visited in December 2013, saying he went to pray for the souls of the war dead and ""renew the pledge that Japan must never wage a war again"".
The pilgrimage sparked outrage in Beijing and Seoul and an expression of ""disappointment"" from the United States. Abe has not gone since, but has sent ritual offerings instead.
ANOTHER WAY?
One proposal is to expand the nearby Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery, dedicated to unidentified war dead, into an alternative memorial site. A 2002 panel called for a state-run, secular facility for war dead. Neither idea gained traction.

Others have suggested dropping the Class-A war criminals from the list of those honoured, but shrine officials say that is impossible.

1416,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 09:05PM ET</span>",Capture of kingpin offers hope to battered Mexican state,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The arrest of one of Mexico's most notorious crime lords has offered a glimmer of hope to businesses in a central state whose emergence as an industrial powerhouse has been clouded by the bloody gang wars he waged there.
The capture on Sunday of alleged drug trafficker and fuel thief Jose Antonio Yepez, alias ""El Marro,"" has removed one of the two bosses battling for control of Guanajuato, a state once dominated by mining and agriculture but now bristling with carmaking operations.
Turf wars between Yepez, leader of the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel, and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel of Nemesio Oseguera have sown chaos in Guanajuato, which could benefit from a new North American trade deal launched in July.
Authorities say Yepez, 40, masterminded the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars of fuel in a state crisscrossed with pipelines and home to one of Mexico's six oil refineries.
""We all hope these kinds of crimes start to decrease, the perception of lawlessness diminishes, and that the business climate picks up,"" Jose Arturo Sanchez, head of the CCE business lobby in Leon, Guanajuato's biggest city, said after the arrest.
Guanajuato boasts plants of carmakers such as Toyota, General Motors (NYSE:GM), Honda and Mazda, but its automotive prowess has been increasingly overshadowed by gangland slayings since the government cracked down on El Marro's fuel theft ring in late 2018.
As illicit fuel sources dried up, his gang began to extort firms to secure extra revenues, a local businessman said. What had once been ""sporadic"" extortion became ""a rule"", he added, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.
Yepez's detention offered a ""glimmer of hope"" that companies could start planning with greater certainty again, he said.
Guanajuato's descent into bloodshed has been precipitous.
In 2011, the peak year of gang violence under then-President Felipe Calderon, Guanajuato accounted for 2.7% of the national murder tally. In 2020, with murders on track to break records for the third year running, the figure is over 13%.
Guillermo Romero, a former state economy minister, said Yepez's capture should lift investor confidence, and welcomed what he saw as improved cooperation between the opposition-run state government and federal authorities.
Now authorities needed to ensure they did not allow jostling to succeed Yepez to unleash more mayhem, he added.

""There can be no let up,"" he said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea is pressing on with its nuclear weapons program and several countries believe it has ""probably developed miniaturized nuclear devices to fit into the warheads of its ballistic missiles,"" according to a confidential U.N. report.
The report by an independent panel of experts monitoring U.N. sanctions said the countries, which it did not identify, believed North Korea's past six nuclear tests had likely helped it develop miniaturized nuclear devices. Pyongyang has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017.
The interim report, seen by Reuters, was submitted to the 15-member U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee on Monday.
""The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is continuing its nuclear program, including the production of highly enriched uranium and construction of an experimental light water reactor. A Member State assessed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is continuing production of nuclear weapons,"" the report said. 
North Korea is formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said last week there would be no more war as the country's nuclear weapons guarantee its safety and future despite unabated outside pressure and military threats.
The U.N. report said one country, which it did not identify, assessed that North Korea ""may seek to further develop miniaturisation in order to allow incorporation of technological improvements such as penetration aid packages or, potentially, to develop multiple warhead systems.""
'LUCRATIVE' CYBERATTACKS
North Korea has been subjected to U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. While the Security Council has steadily strengthened sanctions in a bid to cut off funding for those programs.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since 2018, but failed to make progress on U.S. calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and North Korea's demands for an end to sanctions. 
In May 2018 North Korea followed through on a pledge to blow up tunnels at its main nuclear test site, Punggye-ri, which Pyongyang said was proof of its commitment to end nuclear testing. But they did not allow experts to witness the dismantlement of the site.
The U.N. report said that as only tunnel entrances were known to have been destroyed and there is no indication of a comprehensive demolition, one country had assessed that North Korea could rebuild and reinstall within three months the infrastructure needed to support a nuclear test.
The U.N. experts said North Korea is violating sanctions, including ""through illicit maritime exports of coal, though it suspended these temporarily between late January and early March 2020"" due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Last year the U.N. experts said North Korea has generated an estimated $2 billion using widespread and sophisticated cyberattacks to steal from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges.

""The Panel continues to assess that virtual asset service providers and virtual assets will continue to remain lucrative targets for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to generate revenue, as well as mining cryptocurrencies,"" the latest report said.

Defaming the monarchy is punishable by up to 15 years in prison under Thailand's 'lese majeste' laws. Police did not stop the six speakers, but said that any suspected offences would be investigated.
Many of the 200 protesters were dressed like the fictional wizard Harry Potter and other characters in what they said was a reference to vanquishing injustices under the military-backed government.
Lawyer Anon Nampa, 34, accused the palace of taking on increasing powers that undermined democracy and of inaction in the face of attacks on opponents of the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader.
After the king took the throne in 2016, the palace required revisions to a new constitution that gave him greater emergency powers. He has since taken personal control over some army units and palace assets worth tens of billions of dollars.
Meanwhile, some Thai activists complain of harassment by authorities, saying that at least nine opposition figures living abroad have disappeared. Two were later found dead. Reuters has not independently confirmed what happened to these opposition figures.
""Talking about this is not an act to topple the monarchy, but to allow the monarchy to exist in Thai society in the right way and legitimately under a democratic and a constitutional monarchy,"" Anon told the group of around 200 at Bangkok's Democracy Monument.
Two student groups then read out demands that started with: ""Cancelling and reforming the laws that expand the power of the monarch and that could impinge on democracy where the king is the head of state.""
The Royal Palace did not answer phone calls on Monday seeking comment on the criticism.
Deputy government spokeswoman Ratchada Thanadirek said it was up to police whether to act against the protesters
""The government wants the young protesters to observe the laws so that they can continue to exercise their rights to make their demands and the country can stay peaceful,"" she said.
The students from Mahanakorn and Kaset universities also called on the authorities to listen to the protesters and to reform the 'lese majeste' laws that ban criticism of the monarchy.
Student protests to demand the resignation of Prayuth's government and a new constitution now happen almost daily. While some placards have made veiled criticism of the monarchy, this is the first time it has been open. 
Police officer Surapong Thammapitak said: ""We cannot yet determine what offences have been committed ... Any offences under any laws will be processed for the investigators.""
Prayuth said in a speech in June that there have been no prosecutions under the 'lese majeste' laws recently, at the king's request, but warned against criticising the monarchy.
Criticism was exceedingly rare under the king's father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whose 70 year reign ended with his death in 2016.

""Such open criticism of Thailand’s monarch by non-elites at a public place within Thailand — with the police simply standing by — is the first of its kind in Thai history,"" said Paul Chambers, who teaches international affairs at Thailand's Naresuan University.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held a video meeting on Monday with the Taliban's chief negotiator, Mullah Baradar Akhund, to discuss the state of the Afghanistan peace process, an insurgent spokesman said.
The discussions included the issue of Taliban prisoners whose release by the Afghan government the insurgents are demanding, Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban spokesman in Doha said on Twitter.
The Taliban want the prisoners freed before they join talks with government officials and other Afghans on a political settlement to decades of war, 
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""Both sides talked about the inception of intra-Afghan negotiations"" and they ""emphasized that the release of the remaining prisoners are essential for commencement of intra-Afghan negotiations,"" Shaheen wrote.
The meeting between Pompeo and Baradar, the Taliban's Doha-based deputy leader, came as Afghan security forces ended a siege of a major prison in eastern Afghanistan by Islamic State militants in which hundreds of prisoners escaped.
It was not immediately known if the escapees included any of the prisoners whose release the Taliban is demanding.
The release of the Taliban prisoners has become a major hurdle to the convening of intra-Afghan peace talks, which were to have started by March 10.
A Feb. 29 U.S.-Taliban agreement for a U.S. troop withdrawal called for Kabul to free up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners in return for the release by the insurgents of up to 1,000 government detainees.
The Taliban has released around 1,000 detainees. The Afghan government, under U.S. pressure, has freed around 4,600 Taliban prisoners named on a list compiled by the insurgents.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, however, is resisting freeing the remaining 400 named on the list, contending they were involved in serious crimes, including a massive 2017 bombing against the German embassy and other bloody attacks.
Instead, Ghani is expected to release 500 prisoners who are not on the list, and has called a traditional assembly of tribal elders from across the country - known as a loya jirga - to consult on whether to free those remaining on the list.

The assembly is expected to be held later this month.

The Syrian army and allied forces also clashed with rebel fighters while trying to advance on a frontline town near the strategic Jabal al-Akrad mountain range, said Jaish al-Nasr and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
An opposition tracking centre that monitors military aircraft movements said the airstrikes by Russian warplanes had stopped by the early afternoon.
There was no mention of the operation on Russian or Syrian news agencies.
Moscow has long backed Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in his nine-year-old war against rebels. Russia has an air base in Latakia. 
The Syrian army has launched several campaigns to try to seize the Kubayna mountain in Jabal al-Akrad. The eviction of rebels from commanding positions in the mountains would bring the army closer to securing parts of Idlib, in the northwest, and a main highway connecting the cities of Latakia and Aleppo.
The northwest is home to a mix of Islamist militant and opposition groups, many of which fled other parts of Syria as Assad, with Russian backing, seized back territory from them in the civil war that erupted after a crackdown on protests in 2011.
The area is also populated by hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons who rely heavily on humanitarian assistance.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon named the president's diplomatic adviser as new foreign minister on Monday after Nassif Hitti quit the post, blaming a lack of political will to enact reforms to halt a financial meltdown which he warned could turn Lebanon into a failed state.
Foreign donors have made clear there will be no aid until Beirut makes changes to tackle state waste and corruption, which are behind the crisis that is the biggest threat to Lebanon's stability since a 1975-1990 civil war. 
""Will this cry of deep frustration move Lebanon to finally work on reforms, on measures taking care of the Lebanese, sinking every day deeper into poverty and desperation?"" tweeted United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jan Kubis. 
In his resignation statement, Hitti cited ""the absence of an effective will to achieve structural, comprehensive reform"". 
President Michel Aoun and Prime Minister Hassan Diab appointed Charbel Wehbe, Aoun's diplomatic adviser since 2017 and a career diplomat, as foreign minister. 
Wehbe, 67, is a former secretary general of the ministry. He is seen as close to Aoun and his influential son-in-law Gebran Bassil, a former foreign minister who heads the largest Christian political bloc in the sectarian power-sharing system.
Wehbe later told local broadcaster OTV that the government should work ""step by step"" to help the country overcome what he described as difficulties. 
""Lebanon must always strive and knock on the door of all friendly and brotherly states,"" he said.
""MULTIPLE BOSSES""
Hitti, a former ambassador to the Arab League, was appointed in January when Diab's cabinet took office with the support of the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and its allies. 
""I took part in this government to work for one boss called Lebanon, then I found in my country multiple bosses and contradictory interests,"" Hitti said. ""If they do not come together in the interest of rescuing the Lebanese people, God forbid, the ship will sink with everyone on it.""
Hitti had differences with Diab and was frustrated at being sidelined, sources close to the ministry said. Diab last month appeared to criticise France's foreign minister for tying aid to reforms and an International Monetary Fund (IMF) deal. 

Talks with the IMF, which the heavily indebted state entered in May after a sovereign default, are stalled due to a row over the scale of vast financial losses between the government, banks and lawmakers from the main parties.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",Former king Juan Carlos to leave Spain amid corruption allegations,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's former king Juan Carlos has told his son, King Felipe, that he is leaving the country, the Royal House said on Monday, in a dramatic move designed to protect the monarchy after corruption allegations against him surfaced.
In June, the Spanish Supreme Court opened an investigation into Juan Carlos' involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia, after Switzerland's La Tribune de Geneve newspaper reported he had received $100 million from the late Saudi King.
Through his lawyer, Javier Sanchez-Junco, Juan Carlos, who is 82, has declined to comment on the allegations.
On Monday, Sanchez-Junco said in a brief statement that despite his decision to leave, the former king would ""remain at the disposal of the prosecutors' office"".
El Mundo newspaper reported that Juan Carlos had already left Spain. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.
The palace statement quoted Juan Carlos' letter to the king as saying that he wanted to enable Felipe to rule untroubled ""amid the public repercussions that certain past events in my private life are generating.
""Guided by my desire to do what is best to serve the Spanish people, its institutions and you as king, I am informing you of my ... decision to leave Spain at this time.""
King Felipe thanked Juan Carlos for his decision, underlining ""the historic importance that his father's reign represents"" for democracy in Spain.
He also reaffirmed ""the principles and values on which it (democracy) is based according to our Constitution and legal framework"".
The allegations against the former king have eroded people's confidence in the monarchy.
Pablo Echenique, a senior official in the far-left Podemos, which is a member of the ruling coalition, said the party would continue to seek a full investigation into Juan Carlos' ""murky businesses"", and questioned whether he should be allowed to leave.
Jordi Sanchez, one of several separatist Catalan leaders jailed for their role in the region's failed independence bid in 2017, said he remained incarcerated on the grounds that he was a flight risk. He called on the High Court to withhold the former king's passport.
""Where is justice in Spain?,"" he tweeted.
Spanish monarchs have immunity during their reign but Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014, potentially leaving himself vulnerable to prosecution.
King Felipe put an end to his father's palace allowance and renounced his own inheritance in March, following allegations of secret offshore accounts.
Juan Carlos came to the throne in 1975 after the death of General Francisco Franco and was widely respected for his role in helping guide Spain from dictatorship to democracy.

But his popularity sank in later years due to a series of scandals, prompting him to step down.

JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Afghan security forces on Monday killed at least 10 Islamic State fighters who had taken control of a prison in the eastern city of Jalalabad, ending a siege in which hundreds of prisoners escaped. 
At least 29 people were killed in the militants' assault on the prison on Sunday evening and subsequent clashes with security forces, a spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province said before the final shootout.
""The attack is now over,"" Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the provincial council, told Reuters after security forces clashed night and day with militants who had taken over the prison watchtowers.
The violence comes at a sensitive time for Afghanistan as the United States attempts to usher peace talks between the Afghan government and the insurgent Taliban, who say they oppose Islamic State and have fought against them. 
More than 300 prisoners were still at large, Attaullah Khugyani, spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province, said, said. Of the 1,793 prisoners, more than 1,025 had tried to escape and been recaptured and 430 had remained inside.
""The rest are missing,"" he said.
A defence ministry statement said all 10 attackers had been killed by Afghan security forces, though a provincial council member and a witness inside the prison told Reuters the number was likely around 30.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, which came a day after the Afghan intelligence agency said special forces had killed a senior Islamic State commander near Jalalabad, the provincial capital. 
After detonating a car bomb at the entrance on Sunday evening, Islamic State gunmen overran the prison where many Islamic State militants captured during a campaign in the past month were being held, along with Taliban fighters and common criminals.
Mohammad Idres, one of the prisoners trapped inside and contacted by cellphone, said on Monday afternoon when the siege was under way he could see could around four bodies on the ground outside. 
""We are very hungry, it's very hot and we don't have water,"" he told Reuters.
""Sometimes it is quiet and then firing starts,"" he said. ""The security forces cannot seem to advance because the attackers hold strategic points, including the watchtowers.""
Officials said Afghan Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen Yasin Zia arrived on Monday to oversee the operation, involving special forces.
Khugyani said civilians, prisoners and members of the security forces were among the 29 dead and more than 50 wounded before the final assault.
As the siege dragged through the day, the normally bustling city was placed under a curfew.
""Jalalabad is completely empty,"" Qaderi said.
Some 130 km (80 miles) east of Kabul, Jalalabad lies on the highway leading to the Khyber Pass and the Pakistani city of Peshawar. 
Security forces also clashed with Islamic State fighters on Monday in another part of Nangarhar, according to Ghalib Mujahid, the governor of Behsud district, though he said he did not yet have any information on casualties. 
The United States is drawing down troops after almost 19 years of war but security has remained volatile as the Taliban continue attacks on Afghan forces and other targets.
A U.N. report last month estimated there were around 2,200 Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan, and that while the group has lost territory and its leadership has been depleted, it remains capable of carrying out high-profile attacks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and Iran will have a brief window between their upcoming presidential elections in which to ease dangerous tensions, according to a new report from a Washington think tank that proposes pathways for resuming talks on Iran’s nuclear program and regional security.
The bipartisan Center for a New American Security report, co-authored by an informal adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, proposes a phased approach to easing tensions that could be adopted by Republican President Donald Trump in a second term or Biden, if he wins the Nov. 3 election. 
Tensions spiked after Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal negotiated by world powers during the Obama administration, when Biden was vice president. A resumption of U.S. sanctions has battered Iran’s economy and pushed Tehran to breach restraints designed to block nuclear weapons development. 
The U.S. presidential election opens a window for easing the crisis before Iran holds a vote sometime next year expected to result in a hard-liner succeeding President Hassan Rouhani, under whom the nuclear deal was reached, according to the report seen by Reuters and to be released on Tuesday.
“You are looking at a situation where you might lose ... the opportunity for U.S.-Iranian engagement, and it could be years away after that,” said report co-author Ilan Goldenberg, who served at the State Department and Pentagon during the Obama administration. “The risk of conflict actually exists.”
The historic enemies came close to war after the United States killed a top Iranian general in early 2020 and Iran retaliated with a missile attack on U.S. troops in Iraq. 
The prospects for new talks appear bleak. The Trump administration is threatening to trigger a reimposition of international sanctions on Tehran ended by the nuclear deal unless the U.N. Security Council extends an arms embargo on Iran slated to lapse in October.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last week ruled out any negotiations on Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
In a phased de-escalation proposed by the report, the next U.S. president would offer to re-enter the nuclear deal – an idea Biden has embraced if Iran returned to compliance - or the sides adopt other measures that halt or roll back Tehran’s breaches.
They also would commit to a regional “calm for calm” and Washington would grant Tehran limited sanctions relief, the report says.
That relief would involve “modest, unilateral confidence-building measures"" including ending Trump’s ban on travel from Iran and steps to ensure U.S. sanctions do not impede Tehran’s ability to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The next U.S. administration would devise a long-term Iran strategy. It would consult Congress, European and Middle East allies, China and Russia before convening separate international talks with Iran on regional stability and the nuclear issue, including extending the time-bound restraints on Iran’s program.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican, responding to a German newspaper report that former Pope Benedict XVI was seriously ill, said on Monday his condition was ""not particularly worrying"" and that he was overcoming a painful but not grave ailment.
The clarification came hours after Benedict's biographer, Peter Seewald, sparked alarm by telling the Passauer Neue Presse that he had found the 93-year-old ex-pope exceptionally frail when he visited him on Saturday.
Seewald said Benedict, who has been in shaky health for some time, was now suffering from shingles, a viral infection that causes painful rashes and is common among older people.
""The health conditions of the Pope Emeritus are not particularly worrying, apart from being those of an old man of 93 who is overcoming the most acute phase of a painful but not grave illness,"" the statement said.
Seewald said Benedict's voice was barely audible - echoing something other visitors have said for months - and that the former pope told him he might pick up writing again if he regains his strength.
In June, Benedict, who lives in a former convent in the Vatican gardens, left Italy for the first time since his resignation in 2013 for an emotional farewell visit to his older brother Georg in their native Bavaria.
Georg Ratzinger died on July 1 aged 96. The two brothers were ordained priests on the same day in 1951.
Benedict, who was elected in 2005 to succeed the widely popular Pope John Paul II after a reign of nearly 27 years, shocked the world and even his closest aides on Feb. 11, 2013, when he announced in Latin he was stepping down.
He told a gathering of cardinals that he was too old and frail to lead an institution with more than 1.3 billion members.
At the time of Benedict's resignation the Vatican was mired in a raft of financial woes, sexual abuse scandals and infighting among bureaucrats that led to leaks of important documents.
Benedict said his resignation was for exclusively health reasons.

Hardline conservatives in the Church who have been alarmed by Pope Francis' progressive moves have looked to Benedict as their standard bearer. This forced the former pope on several occasions to remind them that there is only one pope - Francis.

A new poll by Alpha Research on Monday showed GERB's public support at 14.5%, down from 21.7% in December, while nearly 46% of Bulgarians said they were undecided or would not vote, up from 27.3% seven months earlier.
Thousands of Bulgarians have been rallying since early July, demanding the resignation of three-time premier Borissov over his failure to combat endemic graft.
He has refused to step down until regular elections next March, saying the European Union's poorest country cannot afford political ""chaos"" ahead of a looming coronavirus economic crisis.
Despite the protests, GERB has held to its fragile top position among political groupings in Bulgaria, followed by opposition Socialists, who also had their support plunge to 10.4% from 18.2% last December, the poll showed. 
About 60% of the Bulgarians say they support the anti-graft protests but remain divided on whether the government should resign. Some 40% say they want snap polls, while about 37% think Borissov's government should carry out its full four-year term.
""People support the protests but are not sure what should come next. For the time being, there is no dominant political faction around which a clear majority can be consolidated,"" Alpha Research analyst Boriana Dimitrova said. 
Over a decade after joining the EU, Bulgaria ranks as its most corrupt member, according to Transparency International. It has yet to jail a senior government official for graft.
The recently registered populist and anti-elite party of Slavi Trifonov, a talk show host and singer, has seen its support rise to 10.2%, making it the third most popular political faction.

Liberal right-wing and vocal anti-graft party Democratic Bulgaria, has also gained popularity and seen its support climb to 6.2%, the poll showed.

The North Side is a largely affluent, white area, while the South Side is traditionally African-American, and has suffered with poverty and gun violence.
""It just naturally evolved into me one day asking one resident if they wanted to meet their 'map twin' resident,"" Johnson said. ""And they said, 'yes.' And I was like, oh my gosh, what am I going to have them talk about?""
Johnson asked ""awkward but necessary"" questions such as how much they paid for their house. On the project website, videos of these interviews join photos of their homes side by side to highlight the effect of decades of segregation and disparities in city resources - and how things can change.
It opened the eyes of Jonathan Silverstein and his wife Paula Hermann, who enjoy many shops, restaurants and food markets in Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Park on the North Side.
""I guess it is really striking, you know, how lucky we are, and we certainly don't think of ourselves as living in a rich neighborhood but compared to some we are very privileged,"" he said.
Their South Side 'map twin' Maurice Perkins in Englewood needs to travel far just to find a grocery store.
""They couldn't even imagine being in a community, or a community not having the things that, it's, I guess, basic necessities,"" said the local community leader and rapper.
The meeting with his 'map twins' was encouraging, he said. ""There was, like, a genuine connection, right? It was, like, nothing forced or fake.""
Inspired by the recent U.S. racial justice protests, Johnson plans to expand Folded Map into other neighborhoods, and add resources on her website for people to help desegregate their own cities.
""I'd like to think maybe it's the start of a movement,"" Silverstein said of the project. ""I'd love to see more and more people in the city start to build these relationships.""

BELFAST (Reuters) - John Hume, the Roman Catholic architect of Northern Ireland's 1998 Good Friday peace agreement who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending 30 years of sectarian violence, died on Monday at the age of 83.
World leaders and former leaders praised him as a ""political titan"", visionary and hero for the Irish people.
A veteran civil rights campaigner credited with kick-starting peace negotiations in a British region convulsed by bloodshed in the early 1990s, Hume shared the Peace Prize with Northern Ireland's then-first minister, David Trimble of the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party.
He died in a care home in his native Londonderry in the early hours of Monday, his family said in a statement. 
""John Hume was a political titan; a visionary who refused to believe the future had to be the same as the past. His contribution to peace in Northern Ireland was epic,"" former British prime minister Tony Blair, in office at the time of the Good Friday accord, said in a statement.
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who described Hume as a friend, praised him for ""marching on against all odds towards a brighter future for all the children of Northern Ireland.""
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called Hume a ""political giant"" and Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said he was a ""great hero"" for the Irish people. 
Hume in 1968 joined a movement to protect the civil rights of the province's pro-Irish Catholic minority, fighting against discrimination by the pro-British Protestant majority in everything from housing to education. 
As leader of the moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), Hume was an important advocate of non-violence as fighting erupted between Irish nationalists who wanted a united Ireland and pro-British forces, including the British Army, who wanted to maintain the region's British status. 
By 1998, over 3,600 had been killed. 
""Right from the outset of the Troubles, John was urging people to stick to their objective peacefully and was constantly critical of those who did not realise the importance of peace,"" Trimble told BBC Radio Ulster on Monday. 
In a pivotal breakthrough, Hume in 1993 took part in pioneering talks with Gerry Adams, who was at the time the leader of the Sinn Fein party that was then the political wing of the guerrilla Irish Republican Army (IRA). 
The talks helped pave the way for a joint initiative by the British and Irish governments in 1993 that spawned a peace process and an IRA truce in 1994 - and ultimately paved the way for the watershed Good Friday accord four years later.
""When others were stuck in the ritual politics of condemnation John Hume had the courage to take real risks for peace,"" Adams said in a statement.

The survey, carried out on July 13-23 and whose results were shared exclusively with Reuters by market research firm YouGov, showed two-thirds of Germans who normally travel abroad would cancel a holiday if they needed a test upon arrival.
Germany this week imposed mandatory coronavirus testing for travellers from 130 countries.
In France, which implemented testing upon arrival last Saturday for travellers from 12 countries, half of those who normally holiday abroad said they would cancel rather than take a test. The same proportion would call off a holiday if they had to wear a mask outdoors.
In other countries surveyed - Denmark, Sweden, Germany, and Britain - over two thirds would not tolerate mask-wearing outdoors.
Mask-wearing in public spaces was made mandatory in most places across Europe's tourism hotspot Spain over the course of July. The Portuguese island of Madeira implemented the policy over the weekend.
Even needing a mask indoors would put off two-thirds of Danes and Swedes, the survey showed, compared to just over 40% of British travellers and half from Germany. Sweden has no rules on mask use.
Needing to quarantine upon return was even more unpopular, with over 80% of Danes, Swedes and Germans saying the trip would be off if they had to stay at home for two weeks afterwards.

Among Britons, who now face two weeks of quarantine if they travel to a number of countries including Spain and Portugal, 70% would cancel their trip, while 65% of French respondents said they would do the same.

Belarusian authorities have said they suspect the men entered their country to plot ""acts of terrorism"" and destabilise it before an Aug. 9 presidential election.
Russian officials have dismissed the accusation and described the men as employees of a private security firm. The Russian state says it does not use mercenaries.
The standoff could further strain relations between Minsk and its traditional ally Russia, which soured after the neighbours failed to agree on an oil supply contract for this year.
""Their final destination was one of the states in the Latin American region,"" the diplomat, Kirill Pletnyev, was quoted as saying on Monday by the Russian RIA news agency.
Belarus granted Pletnyev consular access to the detained men, RIA added. His quotes did not name the Latin American country or give any more details on the identity of the men.
Russia has close relations with a number of Latin American countries including Venezuela, and sent dozens of military personnel to Caracas last year, describing them as military specialists.
On Friday, Alexander Agafonov, the head of the Belarusian investigative group that is handling the case, said the arrested men - some of whom were wearing army fatigues - had given ""contradictory accounts"" about their plans.
He was quoted as saying that 11 of the arrested men had told authorities they planned to fly on to Venezuela, 15 to Turkey, two to Cuba and one to Syria. Another said he did not know his destination, while three refused to make a statement.

Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, who has said he wants a full explanation from Russia, faces his biggest electoral test in years on Aug. 9 as public anger swells over his handling of COVID-19, the economy and human rights.

The forecast path showed the storm would continue churning up the coast and possibly soaking major cities such as Washington, Philadelphia and New York on Tuesday before moving into New England. 
""Isaias is forecast to regain hurricane strength before it reaches the coast of northeastern South Carolina or southern North Carolina tonight. Slow weakening is forecast after Isaias makes landfall in the Carolinas and moves across the U.S. mid-Atlantic region tonight and Tuesday,"" the hurricane center said in an advisory.
The storm's center was about 100 miles (155 km) east-southeast of Jacksonville, Florida, at 8 a.m. Eastern time (1200 GMT) with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (100 kph), moving north at 13 mph (20 kph), the hurricane center said.
The storm mostly spared the Florida coast on Sunday but still provoked hurricane and storm surge warnings on Monday for much of the South Carolina and North Carolina coastline.
Tropical storm warnings were issued further north including parts of Chesapeake Bay and the Tidal Potomac River not far from Washington, D.C.
Long Island and the Long Island Sound near New York City also had tropical storm warnings.
Isaias did not affect the return home on Sunday of two NASA astronauts, who rode to the International Space Station aboard SpaceX's new Crew Dragon.
They splashed down in the capsule in the Gulf of Mexico after a two-month voyage that was NASA's first crewed mission from home soil in nine years. 

Isaias caused at least two deaths in the Dominican Republic and knocked out power for thousands of homes and businesses in Puerto Rico, according to media reports.

Some 106 American soldiers will join three separate exercises from Aug. 18 to 30 in three provinces and would be subjected to the same requirements as anyone entering the country, said the head of the Thai Army's anti-COVID-19 Unit, Nattapon Srisawat.
Thailand has been over two months without a local transmission and has kept infections to just over 3,300.
It has closed borders and airspace to tourists to keep the virus out and allows entry only to Thai repatriates or foreigners with special permission. All must undergo quarantine. 
A popular Thai Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page attracted 25,000 likes when it questioned the necessity of holding joint exercises between the two historic allies amid a global health crisis.
""Is it really necessary to take in foreign soldiers now? If it does not impact the relationship just postpone it,"" it said.
""Even citizens who need to travel have delayed their plans, why can't the military training be postponed?""
More than 70 American soldiers arrived from the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam on Monday and would be staying in alternative state quarantine, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the country's coronavirus task force, referring to the mandatory quarantine that foreigners must undergo at their own expense.
More troops were due to arrive on Tuesday from Japan.
Asked about the criticism of the drills, Nattapon said that participants will have undergone two tests and would not be exposed to the public during the exercises.
""These soldiers will not be able leave the barracks,"" he added.
The exercises come as Thailand's military suspended sending forces abroad after nine Thai personnel tested positive for the coronavirus upon return from training in Hawaii.

The U.S. embassy in Bangkok did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is willing to compromise to help break a deadlock in Brexit talks by softening its demand that Britain heed EU rules on state aid in the future, diplomatic sources told Reuters. 
They said Brussels could go for a compromise entailing a dispute-settling mechanism on any state aid granted by the UK to its companies in the future, rather than obliging London to follow the bloc's own rules from the outset. 
Provisions to ensure fair competition pose the biggest stumbling block in the troubled talks aimed at sealing a new trade accord from 2021 following Britain's exit from the EU in January after 46 years of membership.
The 27 EU countries have long demanded so-called ""level playing field"" guarantees from Britain if it wants to continue selling goods freely in the bloc's lucrative single market of 450 million people - after Britain's standstill transition period following Brexit expires at the end of this year. 
Without an agreement, trade and financial ties between the world's fifth largest economy and its biggest trading bloc would collapse overnight, likely spreading havoc among markets, businesses and people.
But Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government refuses to be bound by EU state aid rules, environmental standards or labour laws, saying the essence of Brexit was to let Britain decide alone on its own regulations. 
Both sides still say they hope to avoid the most economically damaging ""no-deal"" rupture.
DISPUTE-SETTLING MECHANISM
""The room for compromise lies in something that will let the UK decide on its own since 'regaining sovereignty' is such a big Brexit thing,"" said a EU diplomat close to the Brexit talks. 
""We would reserve the right to decide on any consequences vis-à-vis access to the single market for UK companies as a result.""
Another diplomatic source said such a dispute resolution mechanism could be a way to overcome the impasse.
A third diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the EU was ready to ease its earlier demands that Britain agree to a ""dynamic alignment"" of its competition rules in the future with the bloc's own.
The person said, however, Britain would still need to agree with the EU on a broad outline of company subsidies policy - rather than specific laws or cases - to allow the bloc to go for such a fix. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has repeatedly urged London to make its future plans on that known to the bloc. 

""There must be a solid framework with independent oversight. If they agree to settle on broad rules for granting state aid and to have this independent institution, then we have a deal,"" said the diplomat.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore researchers have developed ""electronic skin"" capable of recreating a sense of touch, an innovation they hope will allow people with prosthetic limbs to detect objects, as well as feel texture, or even temperature and pain. 
The device, dubbed ACES, or Asynchronous Coded Electronic Skin, is made up of 100 small sensors and is about 1 sq cm (0.16 square inch) in size. 
The researchers at the National University of Singapore say it can process information faster than the human nervous system, is able to recognise 20 to 30 different textures and can read Braille letters with more than 90% accuracy. 
""So humans need to slide to feel texture, but in this case the skin, with just a single touch, is able to detect textures of different roughness,"" said research team leader Benjamin Tee, adding that AI algorithms let the device learn quickly. 
A demonstration showed the device could detect that a squishy stress ball was soft, and determine that a solid plastic ball was hard. 
""When you lose your sense of touch, you essentially become numb... and prosthetic users face that problem,"" said Tee.
""So by recreating an artificial version of the skin, for their prosthetic devices, they can hold a hand and feel the warmth and feel that it is soft, how hard are they holding the hand,"" said Tee. 
Tee said the concept was inspired by a scene from the ""Star Wars"" movie trilogy in which the character Luke Skywalker loses his right hand and it is replaced by a robotic one, seemingly able to experience touch sensations again. 
The technology is still in the experimental stage, but there had been ""tremendous interest"", especially from the medical community, Tee added.

Similar patents developed by his team include a transparent skin that can repair itself when torn and a light-emitting material for wearable electronic devices, Tee said.

The organ - the biggest musical instrument in France - was not burned by the flames that destroyed the cathedral's roof and spire on April 15, 2019. But it was covered in soot and damaged by humidity.
""It is an absolute miracle that it has survived. An organ like this is enormous and looks indestructible, but it is actually very fragile,"" Olivier Latry, one of Notre-Dame's official organ players, told Europe 1 radio. 
Workers will dismantle its five keyboards, pedalboard and the 109 stop knobs that control airflow to its 8,000 pipes, some as high as 10 metres. 
The organ which sits under the Gothic cathedral's huge rose window, was completed in 1867, shortly after the spire, which crashed through the roof during the fire.

The purchase of the FK-3 missile defence system was included in state-run arms company Jugoimport SDPR's annual report, submitted to the state Business Registers Agency last week and seen by Reuters.
Jugoimport SDPR said it made 163 import deals with 31 countries for $620.3 million in 2019. The weapons purchases included armed drones from China and Europe's first known purchase of the FK-3. 
""The biggest part of imports is related to the modernisation of MIG-29 planes, the procurement of drone systems, ... (and) air-defence system FK-3,"" it said. 
Beijing sees Serbia as part of its One Belt, One Road initiative, which is aimed at opening new foreign trade links for Chinese companies. 
In 2018, the Jugoimport SDPR made 162 import deals with 32 countries, worth $482.7 million, including purchases of Russian-made helicopter gunships and transport helicopters. 
China has invested billions of euros in the Balkan country, mainly in soft loans, infrastructure and energy projects. 
In late June, Serbia's air force received six CH-92A combat drones armed with laser-guided missiles, the first such deployment of Chinese unmanned aerial vehicles in Europe.
Serbia, which hopes to join the European Union, declared military neutrality in 2006 and joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program, though it does not seek full membership in the Western defence alliance. 
Serbia's military is loosely based on former Soviet technology and in recent years Belgrade has procured MiG-29 fighter jets and missiles, helicopters, tanks and armoured personnel carriers from Russia.

It is a craft that has been practised at Guerande, in the French region of Brittany, for hundreds of years and has made the salt that comes from here into a delicacy that commands high prices around the world.
The low-lying marshes have been criss-crossed with a grid of earth mounds that creates a network of rectangular lagoons. Sea water from the Atlantic is flushed into the lagoons through ditches, then allowed to evaporate. 
When the salt in the water reaches the right concentration, it forms into snowflake-like crystals which the workers rake out of the water into small white heaps and load into wheelbarrows. They then move onto the next lagoon and repeat the process.
Durot, who has been doing the job for 23 years, said the high temperatures this month meant more work, as the evaporating water yields more salt.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Scores of activist groups in Cambodia urged the government on Monday to release and drop charges against a prominent union leader, who was arrested last week and accused of falsely claiming that land had been ceded to neighbouring Vietnam. 
Rong Chhun, a border activist and top trade union leader, was arrested on Friday and charged with incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest, which could see him jailed for two years if convicted.
Cambodia has for centuries fretted about territorial encroachments by Vietnam to the east and Thailand to the west. The issue is highly emotive and many Cambodians are suspicious and resentful of both neighbours.
The government's border affair committee said Rong Chhun had made a false July 20 statement that Cambodian farmers had lost land to Vietnam in a recent border post demarcation, and that Vietnamese authorities had evicted Cambodian villagers.
Rong Chhun denied making the remarks or stirring up trouble, according to his lawyer. It was his third arrest, the first time in 2005 over a border issue and again in 2014 after a protest.
""After more than a decade of harassment by authorities, this latest arrest of a respected union leader is a direct threat to every Cambodian who exercises their constitutional right to freely express their beliefs without having to fear a midnight visit by police and years lost in prison,"" said a statement by 141 civil society groups.
A protest also took place on Monday over his arrest, which comes amid a broad crackdown in Cambodia on the opposition, civil society and the media that began in the run-up to a 2018 election.
Var Kimhong, border committee chairman, said Rong Chhun was ""distorting the truth"", while government spokesman Phay Siphan said Cambodia and Vietnam were making good progress with joint border demarcation.
""The arrest of Rong Chhun is good news that Cambodia will achieve a peaceful and prosperous borderline,"" Phay Siphan said.

Vietnam, widely praised for its mitigation efforts since the coronavirus appeared in late January, is battling several new clusters of infection linked to Danang after going more than three months without detecting any domestic transmission.
""We have to deploy full force to curb all known epicentres, especially those in Danang,"" the official broadcaster Vietnam Television (VTV) quoted Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc telling government officials.
""Early August will be the decisive time within which to stop the virus from spreading on a large scale.""

Authorities on Monday reported one new case linked to the central city of Danang, a tourism hot spot where Vietnam's first domestically transmitted case in 100 days was detected on July 24.
The source of the new outbreak is unclear but it has spread to at least 10 places, including the capital, Hanoi, and the business hub of Ho Chi Minh City, infecting 174 people and killing six.
Four cases were found at factories in different industrial parks in Danang, which collectively employ 77,000 people, the Lao Dong newspaper said.
The government said on Saturday it planned to test Danang's entire population of 1.1 million people, part of ""unprecedented measures"" to fight the outbreak. The city imposed a lockdown last week, banning movement in and out of the city and closing entertainment venues.
Buon Ma Thuot, a city in Vietnam's coffee-growing Central Highlands region, was placed under lockdown on Monday, state media reported.
Twenty-three percent of the latest infections are asymptomatic, the government said in a statement, meaning people infected with the virus do not show symptoms of the COVID-19 sickness it causes.
Phuc said the new outbreak could have a more ""critical impact"" than previous waves of infection.
Authorities said on Sunday the strain of virus detected in Danang was a more contagious one, and that each infected person could infect 5 to 6 people, compared with 1.8-2.2 for infections earlier in the year.

Vietnam has carried out 52,000 tests for the coronavirus in the past seven days, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. Health ministry data does not include rapid tests used for mass screening.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Terumi Tanaka was 13 when a U.S. warplane dropped a plutonium bomb on the southern Japanese city of Nagasaki, on Aug. 9, 1945.
Sitting at home with a book that morning, Tanaka knew instantly when his surroundings turned a blinding bright white that the massive boom was not one of the air raids he had gotten accustomed to in the waning days of World War Two.
""I felt this was something terrible, so I ran downstairs and ducked, covered my ears and closed my eyes,"" Tanaka, now 88, told Reuters. ""And at that moment, I lost consciousness.""
Just 3.2 km (2 miles) from the epicentre, Tanaka was miraculously unharmed, as were his mother and two sisters. Tanaka's father had died of illness previously.
Tanaka's grandfather, aunt and uncle weren't as lucky.
Three days after the 10,000-pound (4,536kg) bomb, nicknamed ""Fat Man"", exploded over the city, Tanaka ventured towards the epicentre to check on his relatives.
It was only then that the scale of the calamity sank in.
Buildings in the city had been reduced to charred piles of rubble and twisted metal, a vast expanse of land was wiped out, and corpses and burn victims with flesh peeling off their bones littered the ground. His grandfather was one of them: Tanaka dabbed a wet handkerchief to his mouth, which appeared to silently cry out for water. That was their last encounter.
Three days after the hydrogen bomb attack in Hiroshima, the Nagasaki blast killed about 27,000 instantly and more than 70,000 by the end of the year. Japan surrendered six days later.
For nearly 50 years, Tanaka has been speaking out for nuclear disarmament hoping that his experiences as a witness to one of the only two nuclear bombs ever to be used in conflict would serve to end their potential use.
In this 75th year since the war ended, the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted some key events, such as a New York exhibition that Tanaka helped to organise.
Instead, Tanaka, who served as head of the ""Hidankyo"" victims' group for more than 20 years, has turned online to spread his message, with the unexpected benefit of reaching a broader audience.
But he worries that time is running out.
""After all the atomic bomb survivors are gone, I'm worried whether people will be able to really understand what we have experienced,"" he said.

From August 11, the devices will be given to incoming travellers, including citizens and residents, from a select group of countries who will be allowed to isolate at home rather than at a state-appointed facility.
Similar measures using electronic wristbands to track peoples' movements during quarantine have been used in Hong Kong and South Korea.
Travellers to Singapore are required to activate the device, which use GPS and Bluetooth signals, upon reaching their home and will receive notifications on the device which they must acknowledge.
Any attempt to leave home or tamper with the device will trigger an alert to the authorities. 
Hong Kong in March introduced a scheme for incoming travellers to use a slim electronic wristband, similar to a tag worn by hospital patients, to enforce quarantines for arriving passengers. South Korea has also used such wristbands connected to smartphone apps for those who violate quarantine.
Singapore, which has not given details on what the device will look like, said in a statement that it will not store any personal data and does not have any voice or video recording function. 
Those aged 12 and below will not have to wear the devices.
The city-state, which is also planning to give all residents a wearable virus-tracing dongle, has tough punishments for breach of its quarantine and social distancing rules.
Under the Infectious Diseases Act, punishments can be fines of up to S$10,000 ($7,272) or imprisonment of up to six months, or both. It has also revoked the work passes of foreigners who flouted the rules.

Singapore has reported 52,825 coronavirus infections, mostly due to mass outbreaks in cramped migrant workers dormitories, but imported cases have been creeping up in recent days.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa hopes to tighten his hold on the nation's fractious politics in an election on Wednesday that could elevate his brother and allow the two to change the constitution if they prevail.
Rajapaksa, who claims credit for controlling the spread of the new coronavirus in the island nation, hopes to install his elder brother and former president - current caretaker Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - in the post formally with an outright election victory.
Voters in the tiny Indian Ocean nation of 21 million people will wear masks, carry their own pens to mark ballot papers and maintain physical distancing for the parliamentary polling that has twice been postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Votes will be counted on Thursday. 
Sri Lanka has reported 2,816 infections of the new coronavirus and 11 COVID-19 deaths as of Sunday. The totals are lower than in neighbouring south Asian countries, held in check by a strict lockdown since March.
""We will make it safe for you to vote,"" said chief election commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya, urging people to vote without fear.
The Rajapaksa brothers, who built their political careers as Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists, are best known for crushing Tamil separatists fighting for a separate homeland for their ethnic minority. The 26-year civil war ended under the elder Rajapaksa's presidency.
Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who won the presidency in November, is not up for re-election in the parliamentary polls.
Given the support the brothers enjoy among the Sinhalese majority, Mahinda is favoured to become prime minister over Sajith Premadasa, analysts say. Sri Lanka does not have a tradition of conducting political opinion polls. 
The opposition candidate is the son of Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was assassinated while president by a Tamil suicide bomber in 1993.
The Rajapaksas want to return to the presidency powers that were diluted by previous governments as part of reforms to prevent abuses of power. 
""The majority community in Sri Lanka have (shown) that they have already decided they want the Rajapaksas back by voting Gotabaya Rajapaksa into the presidency,"" said Jayadeva Uyangoda, an independent political commentator. The question, he said, is whether they will get a big majority to make sweeping changes.
The reforms created independent bodies, including judicial, human rights and police commissions to exercise powers that had been concentrated in the president.
President Rajapaksa says he cannot implement his agenda of economic growth because of the curbs on his power.
“It is impossible to make any meaningful changes and implement the agenda that I presented to the people,"" he said last week.
Restoring those powers would require amending the constitution, which in turn requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - The scars of last summer remain in Soura, an enclave that became a symbol of Kashmir's resistance to India's central government a year ago on Wednesday.
Coils of concertina wire, remnants of makeshift road blocks, lie close to the broken tar of roads dug up to keep the security forces of Prime Minister Narendra Modi out of this area of 15,000 people in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar.
A year after stripping Kashmir of its autonomy, Modi's government has prevented widespread protests and violence, with a heavy hand on people who for weeks had barricaded themselves in and staged protests, hurling stones at federal troops armed with pellet guns and tear gas.
Security forces eventually broke through.
But local politicians warn that anger is rife with young men still picking up arms - and stones.
This Himalayan region has been at the heart of tensions between Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan for decades, the cause of two of the three wars between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Both countries claim the region in full, but each rules only in part.
On Aug. 5, 2019, Modi split the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two federally controlled territories and took away its special privileges, saying this was necessary to better integrate the region with the rest of India. 
New Delhi flooded troops into the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley, where insurgents have fought since the 1990s. India detained thousands, imposed harsh movement restrictions and forced a communications blackout.
Many of those measures have since been eased, but the internet remains throttled and a subsequent COVID-19 lockdown - India has the world's third-highest coronavirus infections and rising fast - has forced millions of Kashmiris to stay in their homes for 12 months.
""The government said that they did it for the good of Jammu and Kashmir. What good things have happened since then? They have destroyed our economy,"" said Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami, a former lawmaker. ""Where is the development?""
Modi's government says it has undertaken reforms but that the pandemic, hitting Kashmir hard like the rest of India, got in the way. 
Reforms include legal changes to help non-Kashmiris who can now apply for government jobs and secure seats in colleges for their children, 10,000 new government jobs, extending federal schemes to the territory and bolstering the village-level administrative system. 
""We have to try and win public sentiment,"" a government official told Reuters, adding there is a push to improve roads, water and electrification. 
Jammu and Kashmir police chief Vijay Kumar said security forces had kept up the pressure on the insurgency, killing 138 militants in the year to July, slightly more than the 129 killed in the same period last year.
Still, officials express concern that there is little sign of a let-up in disaffected youth joining the armed revolt.
This year around 60 new recruits have joined the militant groups through July, compared with 80 for the same period last year, according to a government estimate.
""The challenge would be how do we tamp down the recruitment,"" the government official said.
SYMBOL OF RESISTANCE
Two of Fatima Wani's three sons have found little work as labourers in the past 12 months, making it difficult to make ends meet.
But the 62-year-old housewife's worry is with her eldest son, picked up for allegedly taking part in a protest and booked under the Public Safety Act, which allows for detention for up to two years without charge.
About 150 people arrested last year are still detained, two-thirds of them charged under the law, according to government data.
Wani said her family had to sell a cow to pay for their travel to the northern town of Agra to meet her son in prison.
""He is innocent,"" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks. ""I want justice."" 
Police chief Kumar said arrests had been made of stone-throwers and associates of militants trying to stir up violence in the streets, some of whom had been booked under the security act.
In Soura, the indignation remains. A young man, who gave his name as Sahil and claimed he had been detained three times by police for clashing with troops, said he wasn't going to back down. 

    ""We are being suppressed, and I will fight against that suppression in whatever way I can,"" he said. ""I will continue stone pelting.""

Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam on Friday postponed the election for the Legislative Council, or Legco, citing public health dangers in the Chinese-ruled city, but said there were political considerations.
The poll would have been the former British colony's first official vote since Beijing imposed a sweeping security law to tackle what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with punishment of up to life in prison.
Electoral rules in Hong Kong only allow votes to be postponed for 14 days, but colonial-era laws give the government broad powers in case of threats to public safety.
In a statement on Sunday, the Hong Kong Bar Association said the electoral law was more recent and more specific when it comes to public health hazards at election time and ""generally"" should take precedence over older legislation.
Invoking emergency legislation to delay the scheduled vote ""may turn out to be unlawful,"" it said.
The delay came after 12 pro-democracy candidates were disqualified from running for perceived subversive intentions and opposition to the security law, prompting questions among many about whether the pandemic was the real reason for the delay.
The pro-democracy opposition was hoping to win a historic majority in the legislature after an overwhelming win in lower level district council polls last year.
Lam said the local government was seeking help from the Chinese parliament's top decision making body to resolve the legislative vacuum created by the expiring mandate of the Legco.
The Hong Kong government ""is effectively inviting"" Beijing ""to override the relevant provisions"" of its mini-constitution and local laws ""to circumvent possible legal challenges,"" the Bar Association said.
""This is contrary to the principles of legality and legal certainty and degrades the rule of law in Hong Kong.""
Washington has also condemned the postponement, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying it was likely that ""Hong Kong will never again be able to vote – for anything or anyone.""
President Donald Trump on Thursday raised the possibility of delaying the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, but the Constitution bestows that power on Congress, not the president.

1462,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 10:13PM ET</span>",NASA astronauts cap historic ‘odyssey’ aboard SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule,"By Joey Roulette
(Reuters) - U.S. astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, who flew to the International Space Station in SpaceX's new Crew Dragon, splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday after a two-month voyage that was NASA's first crewed mission from home soil in nine years. 
Behnken and Hurley, tallying 64 days in space, undocked from the station on Saturday and returned home to land their capsule in calm waters off Florida's Pensacola coast on schedule at 2:48 p.m. ET following a 21-hour overnight journey aboard Crew Dragon ""Endeavor.""
""This has been quite an odyssey,"" Hurley told senior NASA and SpaceX officials at a homecoming ceremony at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. ""To be where we are now, the first crewed flight of Dragon, is just unbelievable.""
The successful splash-down, the first of its kind by NASA in 45 years, was a final test of whether SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk's spacecraft can transport astronauts to and from orbit — a feat no private company has accomplished before.
""This day heralds a new age of space exploration,"" Musk said. ""I'm not very religious, but I prayed for this one.""
NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said the successful mission marked ""a new era of human spaceflight where NASA is no longer the purchaser, owner and operator of all the hardware"" but one of many future customers of space travel.
""Today we really made history,"" Bridenstine told an earlier press conference.
Despite Coast Guard restrictions and safety risks, spectators in private boats surrounded the splash-down site dozens of miles from shore as SpaceX and NASA recovery teams used a crane to hoist the spacecraft out of the water and onto a boat.
The crew's retrieval from Crew Dragon was delayed slightly as the teams worked to flush its fuel tanks after sensing traces of nitrogen tetroxide fumes outside the capsule, a toxic gas from one the spacecraft's flammable fuels. 
Hurley, giving a thumbs up as he was wheeled out of the spacecraft on a stretcher, a normal procedure as astronauts adjust to Earth's gravity, said, ""I'm just proud to be a small part of this whole effort to get a company and people to and from the space station."" 
""Thanks for doing the most difficult parts and the most important parts of human spaceflight - getting us into orbit and bringing us home,"" Behnken told SpaceX mission control in Hawthorne, California, as the hatch door was opened. 
For the return sequence, on-board thrusters and two sets of parachutes worked autonomously to slow the acorn-shaped capsule, bringing Behnken and Hurley's speed of 17,500 miles per hour in orbit down to 350 mph upon atmospheric re-entry, and eventually 15 mph at splash-down. 
The pair were to undergo medical checks onshore in Pensacola ahead of a flight to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.
FLAG CAPTURED 
NASA officials have said Crew Dragon, a pod with seven astronaut seats, was in a ""very healthy"" condition while docked at the space station, where astronauts conducted tests and monitored how the spacecraft performs in space. 
Behnken and Hurley undocked from the orbital station late on Saturday to begin their trip home, waking at 7:40 a.m. Sunday to a recorded wakeup call from their sons.
""Good morning Dragon Endeavor,"" Hurley’s son said in a recorded message sent to the capsule. ""I'm happy you went into space but I’m even happier that you’re coming back home.""
NASA, aiming to galvanize a commercial space marketplace, awarded nearly $8 billion to SpaceX and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co collectively in 2014 to develop dueling space capsules, experimenting with a contract model that allows the space agency to buy astronaut seats from the two companies. 
Billionaire entrepreneur Musk's SpaceX became the first private company to send humans to orbit with the launch of Behnken and Hurley. 
""Congratulations SpaceX & NASA on completing first crewed Dragon flight!!,"" Musk wrote on Twitter after the splash-down, adding a U.S. flag emoji followed by ""returned"" — referring to a rivalry with  Boeing Co  over which company's astronaut crew would be the first to retrieve an American flag left on the space station in 2011, when the last crewed mission launched from U.S. soil. 
Behnken and Hurley brought the flag back to Earth, stowed as cargo in Crew Dragon. 
The landmark mission, which took off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on May 31, marked the first time the U.S. space agency launched humans from American soil since its shuttle program retired in 2011. Since then, the United States has relied on Russia's space program to launch its astronauts to the space station. 

""It was a great relief when I saw Bob and Doug come out of the capsule, smiling, thumbs up, looking very cheerful,"" SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told reporters. ""That was the good moment.""

By 8 p.m. ET (0000 GMT), Isaias was about 55 miles (90 km) east-southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, heading north-northwestward with top sustained winds of 70 miles per hour (110 km per hour), the National Hurricane Center said.
After passing the Florida coast overnight, the storm is expected to keep offshore while grazing Georgia and southern South Carolina before heading inland over eastern South Carolina or southern North Carolina on Monday night. 
""A turn toward the north and north-northeast along with an increase in forward speed is anticipated on Monday and Tuesday,"" said the NHC, which issued a hurricane watch for parts of South and North Carolina.
Storm surges, when a storm pushes tidal levels above normal, of up to 4 feet (1.22 m), and flooding also threatened some of the areas in Isaias' path, forecasters said. 
Isaias, which was downgraded from a hurricane on Saturday, is expected to move upward along the East Coast and reach Washington, Philadelphia and New York City on Tuesday before moving into New England.
The Palm Beach area, where President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort is located, emerged largely unscathed from the storm after it brushed off the coast, with authorities reporting no widespread damage and no flooding.
""We still are experiencing some winds,"" Lisa DeLaRionda, a spokeswoman for Palm Beach County, said on Sunday. ""However, based on the latest forecast, those winds should be dying down early afternoon.""
Although it appeared that Isaias' impact on Florida would not be severe, the storm provided local emergency management with a ""real-world scenario"" of what extreme weather preparation and response could look like in the midst of a public health emergency as the states battles the coronavirus pandemic, DeLaRionda said. 
As the storm slowly moved north along the coast, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said earlier on Sunday that Isaias had turned more inland, increasing the threat of heavy rain, flash flooding and tornadoes in the eastern part of the state. 
""Right now, we expect the heaviest rain along the I-95 corridor with as much as seven inches in some places,"" Cooper told a news conference. 
Isaias did not affect the return home on Sunday of two NASA astronauts, who rode to the International Space Station aboard SpaceX's new Crew Dragon.
They splashed down in the capsule in the Gulf of Mexico after a two-month voyage that was NASA's first crewed mission from home soil in nine years. 

Isaias caused at least two deaths in the Dominican Republic and knocked out power for thousands of homes and businesses in Puerto Rico, according to media reports.

Japan invaded and occupied parts of Asia before and during the war in the name of its emperor, Hirohito, and aligned itself with Germany and Italy in 1940 to become one of the so-called Axis powers.
Here are some key events of World War Two in the Pacific:
Dec. 7, 1941: Japanese forces attack Pearl Harbor with torpedo planes, bombers and fighter planes, pounding the U.S. fleet moored there in the hope of destroying U.S. military power in the Pacific. Around 2,300 Americans die and 1,200 are injured, 21 vessels sunk or damaged and hundreds of aircraft destroyed.
The United States declares war the following day and three days later, Germany declares war on the United States.
Shortly before the Pearl Harbor attack, Japanese troops land on the east coast of west Malaya, and capture large swathes of territory in their push southward to Singapore. 
Jan. 15, 1942: Five weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbour, a Japanese land column, moving from Thailand, strikes across the frontier into present-day southern Myanmar. British forces fight back but Japan's superior jungle tactics see Myanmar fall at the end of May.
Feb. 15, 1942: Lieutenant General Arthur Percival, commander of the British Commonwealth forces, surrenders to Japanese Lieutenant-General Tomoyuki Yamashita in Singapore after a swift, humiliating battle. Singapore is then occupied by the Japanese until 1945.
April 1942: U.S. and Filipino prisoners of war are forced to march about 100km (62 miles) under brutal conditions after the three-month Battle of Bataan in the Philippines. Many died from physical abuse, dysentery and other diseases. 
Death marches also occurred in Sandakan on Borneo island. Both were later judged as war crimes.
Aug. 1942: In the Pacific, Japanese and U.S. troops fight from island to island. Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands in the Pacific Ocean, was the scene of six months of fighting. Along with the Battle of Midway, this was one of the first major offensives and decisive victories for the Allies in the Pacific. 
Oct. 1944: On the verge of losing the Philippines to U.S. forces, Japan conducts its first kamikaze attack off the island of Leyte, deliberately crashing planes into Allied targets. Roughly 4,000 kamikaze pilots died and 34 U.S. ships were sunk as a result of the attacks in the last few months of the war.
Feb. 1945: More than 30,000 U.S. Marines battle 21,000 Japanese on the island of Iwo Jima, the first native Japanese soil to be invaded during the Allied advance. Nearly all the Japanese defenders died in the 36-day battle, along with nearly 7,000 U.S. Marines.
Aug. 6, 1945: The U.S. B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay carrying 12 crew members drops an atomic bomb nicknamed ""Little Boy"" on Hiroshima in Japan's main island of Honshu.
The death toll from the blast was estimated at about 140,000 people by the end of the year, out of a total of 350,000 who lived there at the time. Three days later, the United States drops an atomic bomb nicknamed ""Fat Man"" on Nagasaki.
Aug. 15, 1945: Emperor Hirohito announces Japan's decision to surrender in his first speech broadcast by radio, bringing World War Two to an end. 

Sept. 2, 1945: A Japanese delegation headed by Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu board the battleship USS Missouri to sign the surrender document, along with U.S. General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Allied Commander.

Ali, a former housing minister and member of the opposition People's Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, was expected to be sworn in on Sunday afternoon. Preliminary recount data released in June showed he had won the initial poll, and Washington last month called on current President David Granger to resign.
The final result comes months after a consortium led by  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) began producing oil off Guyana's coast, turning the impoverished country of fewer than 800,000 people into the world's newest crude hot spot and promising to boost growth in the agriculture- and mining-dependent economy. 
Ali's party has criticized the contract Granger's government signed with Exxon - which includes a 2% royalty and a 50% profit share after cost recovery - as too generous, but he has stopped short of pledging to renegotiate the terms of the deal.
Exxon and Granger's allies both say the terms are comparable to other frontier oil producers, and were necessary to attract investment to the unproven location. 

Granger declared victory days after the March vote and said he planned to serve another five years, but the opposition said results from the largest voting district had been inflated to put Granger ahead of Ali and the country's top court found the district had not counted vote in accordance with electoral laws.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican security forces on Sunday captured Jose Antonio Yepez, a notorious drug gang leader and fuel thief blamed for fanning a sharp surge in violence that has severely tested the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Known as ""El Marro"" (The Mallet), Yepez was arrested in the early hours of Sunday by soldiers and state officials during a raid on a house in Guanajuato, a central state that has become the main flashpoint of record gang violence, authorities said.
""This a tremendously successful blow for the government,"" said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).
Boss of the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel, a Guanajuato-based outfit, Yepez has been engaged in a bloody struggle for supremacy in the state with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), one of Mexico's most powerful and violent gangs.
Yepez, 40, is the highest profile narco arrested so far under Lopez Obrador, who pledged to bring down record levels of violence plaguing Mexico when he took office in December 2018.
Instead, homicides have further increased, and last October the Lopez Obrador administration suffered serious embarrassment when it botched the detention of Ovidio Guzman, a son of incarcerated kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
Guanajuato's government said security forces captured Yepez and five other suspected gang members in a village called Franco Tavera in the Santa Cruz de Juventino Rosas municipality, a few miles north of where the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel was born.
During the swoop on two buildings, soldiers freed a local businesswoman who had been kidnapped and seized a cache of weapons including a grenade launcher, the Defense Ministry said. 
Three people were found in the second property, including a sixth suspected gangster.
News network Milenio broadcast a video of the night-time arrest of Yepez, who was wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt, jeans and sneakers. Flanked by several soldiers, Yepez gave his full name and age before also identifying himself as ""Marro.""
Security forces have been gradually closing in on Yepez but he had managed to evade capture thanks to a tight network of informers who allowed him to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, according to analysts and media reports.
LUCRATIVE TRADE
A thorn in the government's side for several years, El Marro has appeared in expletive-laden videos threatening his enemies, and in June a clip of an emotional Yepez lamenting the arrest of his mother and sister was widely broadcast.
The women, who are suspected of helping to run the gang, were released when judges picked apart the case against them.
Notorious for fuel theft in a state that is crisscrossed by pipelines and home to a major oil refinery, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel has become increasingly engulfed in a brutal turf war with the CJNG, based in the neighboring state of Jalisco.
Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of fuel were being stolen every year before Lopez Obrador cracked down a few weeks after taking office.
Abetted by the complicity of corrupt employees within state-run oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the lucrative activity gave the Santa Rosa de Lima outfit outsize financial heft, said security analyst Benitez.
""It's even more money than cocaine,"" he said.
Lopez Obrador blamed corruption at Pemex for fuel theft and the new management he appointed has vowed to root it out.
Yepez's interrogation could yield rich information on corruption inside Pemex, Benitez said.
His detention also suggested that U.S. and Mexican security services had intensified cooperation to curtail local trafficking in the potent opiate fentanyl, a business of which Yepez was trying to secure a bigger share, he added.
U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Christopher Landau hailed news of the arrest in Guanajuato in a post on Twitter.
A carmaking hub, Guanajuato was once one of the safest regions of Mexico. But recent violence there has turned that on its head, and pushed national homicide tallies to record levels.
Once the government dismantles the Santa Rosa de Lima gang, Benitez said, it can turn up the pressure on the CJNG, which in late June was blamed for a brazen assassination attempt on Mexico City police chief Omar Garcia Harfuch.
El Marro's adversary, CJNG boss Nemesio ""El Mencho"" Oseguera, is arguably the most wanted crime boss in Mexico.
""Now 'El Mencho' is next up,"" Benitez said.
Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said Yepez would be taken to the Altiplano maximum security prison where ""El Chapo"" Guzman was housed before he escaped through a tunnel in 2015.
Guzman was recaptured in 2016, extradited a year later and convicted of drug trafficking by a U.S. court in 2019.

The move was widely expected after a series of recent interventions by President Nicolas Maduro's government in the National Electoral Council (CNE) and opposition political parties. The parties boycotted Maduro's 2018 re-election on similar grounds, and now label him a usurper. 
But it nonetheless paves the way toward a loss of opposition control of the National Assembly, which could complicate the standing of Juan Guaido, recognized by dozens of countries as Venezuela's rightful president due to his position as the congress's speaker. 
""Venezuela, a nation undergoing a humanitarian crisis that is also subjected to a criminal, oppressive dictatorship, deserves free, democratic and transparent elections,"" the 27 parties wrote in a statement published on the National Assembly's website. 
The parties included Guaido's Popular Will party, as well as the Justice First, Democratic Action, and A New Era parties, which are collectively known as the ""G4"" and make up the bulk of opposition representation in the legislature. 
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Maduro calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a violent coup, and has argued the opposition boycotts elections it knows it would lose. 
The parties' decision to boycott comes after the Maduro-friendly supreme court named directors of the CNE, which oversees elections, a function the constitution assigns to the National Assembly.
The court also appointed politicians widely seen as shadow allies of the ruling socialist party to leadership posts at the G4 opposition parties. 
Some opposition politicians have floated the idea of extending the current congress's term past its scheduled January 2021 expiry.

A ministry statement, published on state media, did not name the firm involved in the deal with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance that seized swathes of north and east Syria from Islamic State with U.S. help. 
There was no immediate response from SDF officials to a Reuters' request for comment. There was no immediate comment from U.S. officials on Sunday. 
A U.S. senator and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had referred to an oilfields deal between the SDF and a U.S. firm during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Thursday. 
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) said during the committee hearing that SDF General Commander Mazloum Abdi informed him that a deal had been signed with an American company to ""modernize the oil fields in northeastern Syria"", and asked Pompeo whether the administration was supportive of it.
""We are,"" Pompeo responded during the hearing streamed live by PBS. ""The deal took a little longer ... than we had hoped, and now we’re in implementation."" 
Damascus ""condemns in the strongest terms the agreement signed between al-Qasd militia (SDF) and an American oil company to steal Syria's oil under the sponsorship and support of the American administration"", the Syrian statement said. ""This agreement is null and void and has no legal basis.""
Syria produced around 380,000 barrels of oil per day before civil war erupted following a crackdown on protests in 2011, with Iran and Russia backing President Bashar al-Assad's government and the United States supporting the opposition. 
Damascus lost control of most oil producing fields in a stretch east of the Euphrates River in Deir al-Zor. Western sanctions have also hit the energy industry. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has said that despite a military pullback from northeast Syria, a small number of American forces would remain ""where they have oil"". The Pentagon said late last year that oilfield revenues would go to the SDF.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu struck back on Sunday at demonstrations calling for his resignation, accusing protesters of trampling democracy and the Israeli media of encouraging them.
Netanyahu, who was sworn in for a fifth term in May after an election, has often complained of press bias against him, and some of the charges he faces in a corruption trial relate to alleged attempts to seek favourable coverage from media barons in return for state favours.
Thousands of Israelis have been taking to the streets, including outside Netanyahu's Jerusalem home, to protest against alleged corruption and economic hardship stemming from lockdowns during the coronavirus crisis.
Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, has denied wrongdoing in the three graft cases against him. 
Criticising the protests and media at the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said that while demonstrators portray their campaign as an attempt to ""preserve Israeli democracy, I see it as an attempt to trample democracy"".
""These demonstrations are fuelled by a media mobilisation, the likes of which I can't remember,"" he said, accusing the Israeli press of ""North Korean-like"" uniformity in its alleged bias against him.
""They do not report the demonstrations - they participate in them. They add fuel,"" said Netanyahu, who returned as prime minister in 2009 after a first term from 1996-99.
Netanyahu, 70, said no one was trying to restrict the demonstrations, in which many of the protesters are young Israelis. Opinion polls have shown his popularity in decline.
Netanyahu's main coalition partner, Defence Minister Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, defended the demonstrations.
""The right to protest is the lifeblood of democracy,"" Gantz said at the cabinet meeting.

Legislator Tamar Zandberg of the opposition left-wing Meretz party said in a statement that Netanyahu was ""marching in the footsteps of dark regimes"".

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>","Algerian leader secures fugitive officer with Erdogan call, source says","By Lamine Chikhi
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria's president phoned his Turkish counterpart last month to secure the return of a fugitive military official who fled Algeria days after its powerful army chief died in December, a top Algerian security source said. 
Guermit Bounouira was handed over to Algerian security officials in Turkey on Thursday, accused of leaking military secrets, and will face a military judge on Monday in Blida prison southwest of Algiers, the source told Reuters. 
Turkish officials were not immediately available to comment on Sunday, which is not a working day in Turkey. A lawyer for Bounouira was not immediately available for comment.
Turkey's surrender of Bounouira to Algerian authorities underscores the importance Ankara attaches to its relationship with Algeria, a powerful neighbour of Libya where Turkish forces have intervened in the civil war. 
Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune phoned Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan about a week before Islam's Eid al-Adha holiday, which began on Friday, to request he hand Bounouira over, the source said. 
Bounouira, a top aide to the late army chief Ahmed Gaed Salah, is accused of leaking a chart showing movements of army officers including their names and codes, the source said. The chart has circulated on social media, embarrassing the army, although it was unclear who posted it. (correct?) 
Gaed Salah emerged last year as Algeria's most powerful man when weekly mass protests succeeded in unseating the veteran president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and a host of other officials. 
SECRETS
However, Gaed Salah died suddenly of a heart attack on Dec. 23, weeks after a presidential election that he had pushed for, but which the street protest movement opposed as illegitimate. 
Bounouira fled to Turkey in the week after Gaed Salah died and the Algerian security source said he had subsequently leaked military secrets to activists based abroad. 
""Guermit was Gaed Salah's closest man. As such he was aware of military secrets,"" the source said. 
Tebboune, who won the December election, is trying to stamp his own mark on Algeria's government after Bouteflika's two decades in office and appointed a new army chief in January, though the military remains Algeria's most powerful institution. 
The Algerian president has pushed for Libya's neighbours to have a bigger role in finding a solution to the conflict there, and opposes direct foreign involvement. 
Turkey directly intervened there in January in support of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) against eastern-based Libyan forces backed by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. 
For Ankara, any direct Algerian opposition to its role in Libya could complicate a military operation far from its own shores. 

However, despite some disagreements over Libya, Algeria and Turkey have maintained good relations. ""We have worked very well with our counterparts in Turkey,"" the Algerian security source said.

Participants in a separate 5-km (3.11 miles) run were also asked to follow social distancing rules, though this can be challenging when racing.

Jaruchart Mardthong, 40, died in what police said looked like a motorcycle accident on Thursday, amid public suspicion about the exact cause of his death.
Results of an initial autopsy have not yet been released. Local media said his family had planned to cremate the body on Sunday.
He was a key witness in the police investigation into Vorayuth ""Boss"" Yoovidhya, who was accused of killing a police officer in 2012, according to deputy government spokeswoman Traisulee Traisoranakul.
Police said last week that all charges against Vorayuth had been dropped, stirring public anger about the country's entrenched culture of impunity for the rich and well-connected.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha wants to ensure justice and clear public suspicion over the case, Traisulee said in a statement on Sunday.
""The prime minister reiterates that the government will help create justice in the case. Any wrongdoers will be punished. This case will not be unresolved in the public's mind,"" she said.
Police said Jaruchart had died at hospital after crashing with another motorcycle driver, who was also injured but had left hospital.
Prayuth previously said a committee had been formed to look at what led to the case being dropped but it would not interfere in the work of the attorney-general, police and court. The committee has 30 days to complete its task.
Vorayuth had missed eight summonses to appear in court. He was accused of crashing his black Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) into policeman Wichien Klanprasert and dragging his body for dozens of metres before fleeing the scene. He was 27 at the time.
Authorities issued a warrant for his arrest five years after the incident and Vorayuth later left the country. His current whereabouts are unknown.

Police have said the old case against Vorayuth had officially ended and could only be relaunched if relatives of the victim filed the case directly to a court, or if there were new witnesses or evidence.

MIAMI (Reuters) - Isaias weakened slightly to a tropical storm on Saturday after lashing the Bahamas, but forecasters warned it would likely grow into a hurricane again overnight as it approaches coronavirus-stricken eastern Florida. 
Isaias, which was moving northwest off the Bahamas' Andros Island with maximum sustained winds of 70 miles per hour (110 kph) on Saturday evening, was projected to cause dangerous storm surge along Florida's Atlantic coast through Sunday and to move up the U.S. eastern seaboard early this coming week.
""Don't be fooled by the downgrade. We do think it will be upgraded back to a hurricane later on this evening,"" Governor Ron DeSantis told a news conference on Saturday.
Florida's well-honed hurricane responses have been partly upended by its grappling with one of the country's worst outbreaks of the novel coronavirus. The state has recorded more than 480,000 cases of the virus, with tens of thousands recorded in the last week alone, according to a Reuters tally.
The emergency operations center in Miami, usually a beehive of activity ahead of a storm, was mostly empty with plastic dividers set up between work stations and fans with ultraviolet lights hung around the room in the hope of eradicating any floating virus particles. Many emergency officials are instead working remotely.
""It's not a perfect system,"" said Frank Rollason, Miami-Dade's director of emergency management, ""but what we're facing to today with COVID, we're trying to avoid packing all of those people into the emergency operations center.""
Isaias was about 100 miles southeast of Fort Launderdale as of 8 P.M. on Saturday and was forecast to slow from its current 9 miles per hour as it moves northwest from the Bahamas, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm's center was projected to move up the east coast of Florida from Saturday through Sunday night, bringing storm surge as high as 4 feet from Jupiter Inlet to Ponte Vedra Beach.
The storm prompted authorities in parts of Florida to close COVID-19 testing sites and people to stock up on essentials. 
DeSantis declared a state of emergency for a dozen counties on the Atlantic coast, which makes it easier to mobilize resources. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper followed suit.
Scores of hotel rooms along Florida's east coast have been set aside for any people with COVID-19 who are ordered to evacuate their homes where they have been isolating themselves, DeSantis said.
He added that the state's emergency management division was supplying shelters with enough personal protective equipment for 10,000 people to ward off the spread of the virus.
The storm has caused at least two deaths in the Dominican Republic and torn down trees, flooded streets and knocked out power for thousands of homes and businesses in Puerto Rico, according to media reports.
Public beaches, parks, marinas, golf courses and coronavirus testing sites were closed in Miami-Dade County on Friday.

DeSantis said testing sites would remain open on Florida's west coast, and testing at hospitals and community centers may also continue.

(Reuters) - Britain is considering minting a coin to commemorate India's independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, amid growing interest in recognizing the contributions of people from the Black, Asian and other minority ethnic communities.
British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak asked the Royal Mint Advisory Committee (RMAC) in a letter to pursue recognition of individuals from those communities, the UK Treasury said in an emailed statement late on Saturday.
""RMAC is currently considering a coin to commemorate Gandhi"", the Treasury said.
Gandhi, who was born in 1869, advocated for non-violence throughout his life and played a key role in India's struggle for independence. His birthday, Oct. 2, is observed as the International Day of Non-Violence. [nL3N26M2OE]
Often referred to as India's ""father of the nation"", he was assassinated by a Hindu radical on Jan. 30, 1948, just a few months after he led India to freedom from British rule. 
As part of a global reassessment of history, colonialism and racism triggered by the death in May of a Black man, George Floyd, in the United States after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, some British institutions have begun re-examining their past.

Many organizations have taken initiatives to make investments to help the Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities and to support racial diversity. Floyd's death has led to global protests against racism, colonialism and police brutality.
In his letter to the RMAC, Sunak said members of the BAME communities have made a ""profound contribution"" and that the committee should consider recognizing it on the UK's coinage.

(Reuters) - The two NASA astronauts who rode to the International Space Station aboard SpaceX's new Crew Dragon are heading home for a Sunday splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, capping a two-month voyage in space that marked NASA's first crewed mission from home soil in nine years. 
Crew Dragon ""Endeavor"" decoupled from the orbital station at 7:35 p.m. ET carrying U.S. astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley ahead of a Sunday afternoon splashdown off the coast of Pensacola, Florida — the first procedure of its kind in a privately built space capsule. 
""It's been a great two months, and we appreciate all you've done as a crew to help us prove out Dragon on its maiden flight,"" Hurley told the remaining U.S. station crew member Chris Cassidy, as Crew Dragon autonomously eased away from its docking port to begin the 21-hour journey home. 
NASA and SpaceX — monitoring the crew's return from Houston, Texas and SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California — ruled out splashdown options in the Atlantic earlier this week due to Tropical Storm Isaias, a cyclone expected to churn alongside Florida's east coast as a hurricane in the coming days. 
Upon a successful splashdown at 2:48 p.m. ET Sunday, the spacecraft will have completed its final key test to prove it can transport astronauts to and from space — a task SpaceX has accomplished dozens of times with its cargo-only capsule but never before with humans aboard.
""The hardest part was getting us launched, but the most important part is bringing us home,"" Behnken said during a farewell ceremony early on Saturday aboard the space station.
Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX became the first private company to send humans to orbit on May 31 with the launch of Behnken and Hurley, who will have spent more than two months on the space station upon returning.
The mission marked the first time NASA launched humans from U.S. soil since its shuttle program retired in 2011. Since then the United States has relied on Russia's space program to launch its astronauts to the space station. 
NASA officials have said Crew Dragon, an acorn-shaped pod that can seat up to seven astronauts, has been in a ""very healthy"" condition since docking to the space station, where astronauts have been conducting tests and monitoring how the spacecraft performs over time in space.
Behnken and Hurley will have a few hours for sleep during their journey home in the capsule, which will gradually decrease its orbital altitude through a series of automated thruster firings.
""They've got plenty of food and water aboard the spacecraft,"" SpaceX engineer Siva Bharadvaj said during a livestream of the undocking.

NASA, aiming to galvanize a commercial space marketplace, awarded nearly $8 billion to SpaceX and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co collectively in 2014 to develop dueling space capsules, experimenting with a contract model that allows the space agency to buy astronaut seats from the two companies.

An intelligence ministry statement cited by state television did not say how, where or when the detention took place.
""Jamshid Sharmahd, the ringleader of the terrorist Tondar (Thunder) group, who directed armed and terrorist acts in Iran from America, was arrested following a complicated operation, and is now in (our agents') powerful hands,"" it said.
Television showed a video of a man identifying himself as Sharmahd and giving his date of birth. The man was later shown with a blindfold, saying: ""They needed explosives and we provided it.""
Tondar did not confirm the detention. In reaction to what it said were reports of Sharmahd's ""abduction"", the group said on its website it did not confirm ""stories being told by various networks"". 
However it said in an earlier posting on social media that ""Tondar ... will continue to fight even in the absence of a commander"". 
A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said on Saturday that the U.S. government was ""aware of reports related to the detention of Mr. Sharmahd. The Iranian regime has a long history of detaining Iranians and foreign nationals on spurious charges. We urge Iran to be fully transparent and abide by all international legal standards.""
Based in Los Angeles, the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran, or Tondar, says it seeks to restore the Iranian monarchy that was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution. It runs pro-Iranian opposition radio and television stations abroad. 
According to the group's website, Sharmahd is an Iranian-German electronics engineer who was born in 1955 and lived in Germany before moving to Los Angeles in 2003.
No comment was immediately available from the German foreign ministry. 
The Iranian ministry statement said Sharmahd planned and directed an explosion at a religious center in the southern city of Shiraz in 2008 that killed 14 people and wounded 215. 
It said Iranian intelligence had prevented several other plots in more recent years, including one, at an unspecified date, to blow up the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the late founder of the Islamic Republic.
'VIOLENCE-PRONE' GROUP
Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi called Tondar the ""most violence-prone"" royalist opposition group. 
""Despite our complaint to Interpol, Sharmahd would travel everywhere under his own name. This shows how empty anti-terror slogans by Americans and their Europeans allies are,"" he told state TV. 
In 2019, Iran detained Ruhollah Zam, a Paris-based journalist turned activist, after apparently luring him to neighbouring Iraq, according to Iranian media reports at the time. Zam was sentenced to death on security charges in June.
Sharmahd's detention came at a time of particularly tense relations between longtime foes Washington and Tehran.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif urged the West in a Twitter post to ""cease financing and harboring terrorists"" who from ""safe havens in U.S. and Europe ... promote hatred, agitate & organize murder & mayhem, and shamelessly claim responsibility for the murder of innocent Iranian civilians"".
The Iranian foreign ministry earlier said in a statement that Washington should be held accountable for backing ""this terrorist group and other groups and criminals responsible for sabotage, armed and terrorist operations"" from within the United States.
Tondar has claimed responsibility for some attacks, saying on its website it was behind the bombing of a seminary used by Revolutionary Guards in Shiraz in June 2019, and an explosion in a refinery in 2016.
In 2009, Iran executed three men convicted of involvement in the 2008 bombing.

An advisory issued last month by Turkey for the survey overlaps with Egypt's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), constituting ""a violation and an attack on Egypt's sovereign rights"", the Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement.
It did not give details, but said the potential encroachment came under point eight of Turkey's advisory. 
Seismic surveys are part of preparatory work for potential hydrocarbons exploration.
The announcement of the survey escalated tensions between Turkey on one side and Greece and Cyprus on the other, amid conflicting claims to offshore hydrocarbon resources. Turkey has since indicated it could pause exploration operations pending talks.
Egypt is a regional rival of Turkey and has close relations with Greece and Cyprus.

The 45-year-old Lozoya, who was boss of the state-run oil company commonly known as Pemex from 2012 to 2016, was earlier this week barred from leaving Mexico at initial court hearings into his impending trial for alleged bribery and money laundering.
Lozoya, who denies wrongdoing, has been fitted with an electronic bracelet so his whereabouts can be tracked during the trial, which prosecutors have asked for six months to conclude.
Lozoya was admitted to hospital in Mexico City on July 17 after doctors said he had developed anemia and esophagus problems following his extradition from Spain.
Two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Lozoya had been released from hospital overnight. It was not clear where he would be staying meantime, one of them said.

Lozoya's trial could embarrass leaders of the previous administration of former president Enrique Pena Nieto, and prove a vote-winner for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December 2018 vowing to stamp out corruption.

A spokesperson for Facebook said the order was ""extreme"" and threatens ""freedom of expression outside of Brazil's jurisdiction"", but said the company has agreed to the order.
""Given the threat of criminal liability to a local employee, at this point we see no other alternative than complying with the decision by blocking the accounts globally, while we appeal to the Supreme Court,"" the spokesperson said.
Justice Alexandre de Moraes had ruled on Thursday that Facebook and Twitter (N:TWTR) failed to comply with orders to block the accounts because they were only blocked within Brazil, but remained accessible with foreign IP addresses.
On Friday, he ruled that Facebook must pay a 1.92 million reais ($367,710) fine for not complying and face further daily fines of 100,000 reais per day if it does not block the accounts in question globally.
Before the fine was announced, Facebook said on Friday that it would appeal the decision. The world's largest social network said it respects the laws of countries where it operates, but that ""Brazilian law recognizes the limits of its jurisdiction.""
The judge's fine only addressed Facebook's non-compliance. It was not clear whether Twitter would face a similar fine.
The judge originally decided in May to block 16 Twitter accounts and 12 Facebook accounts of Bolsonaro supporters who have been linked to a probe into the spreading of fake news during Brazil's 2018 election.
The accounts were blocked due to allegations that they violated laws on hate speech.

MOSCOW/MINSK (Reuters) - A dispute between Moscow and Minsk over the detention of more than 30 men who Belarus accused of being Russian mercenaries deepened on Saturday, as the two sides contradicted each other about the group's plans.
The arrests this week, shortly before an Aug. 9 presidential election in Belarus, could further strain relations between Minsk and its traditional ally Russia, which soured after the neighbours failed to agree on an oil supply contract for this year.
Russia said on Thursday that the men, who it described as employees of a private security firm, had stayed in Belarus after missing their connecting flight to Istanbul.
President Alexander Lukashenko cast doubt on this version on Saturday.
""There was no Istanbul... It's clear that the group has had another goals. It is the task of the investigation to find out about those goals"", he said, according to state news agency Belta, after hearing reports from the heads of state security and investigation committee.
He said there had been no agreement with Russia for the men to be in the country, while adding that Belarus is open to cooperate with Russia on the issue.
Belarusian authorities said earlier this week that the men were arrested after Minsk received information that more than 200 fighters had entered the country to destablise it.
On Friday, Alexander Agafonov, the head of the Belarusian investigative group that is handling the case, said that the men - some of whom were wearing army fatigues - had no plans to fly further to Istanbul and said they had given ""contradictory accounts"" about the purpose of their stay in Belarus.
He was quoted as saying that 11 of the arrested men had told authorities they planned to fly on to Venezuela, 15 - to Turkey, two - to Cuba and one to Syria. Another said he did not know his destination, while three refused to make a statement.
LINKS TO OPPOSITION
Authorities in Minsk said on Thursday they believe the husband of opposition presidential candidate Svetlana Tikhanouskaya may have ties to the group, launching a criminal case against him on suspicion of inciting riots.
Dmitry Mezentsev, Russia's ambassador to Belarus, rejected any connection between the detained men and domestic affairs in Belarus.

Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, was quoted as saying by RIA news agency on Saturday he hoped the incident would be resolved in the interest of ""brotherly"" relations between the countries.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The number of fires in Brazil's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest jumped 28% in July from a year ago, official data showed on Saturday, as some environmentalists warned a jump this week could signal a repeat of last year's surging destruction of the world's largest rainforest.
Brazil's space research agency Inpe recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, up from 5,318 in July 2019. 
Although that is a three-year high for July, the figure pales in comparison to last year's peak of 30,900 fires in August – a 12-year high for that month.
Still, environmental groups say there are worrying signs of what may come, with the final days of the month showing a sharp spike. More than 1,000 fires were registered on July 30, the highest number for a single day in July since 2005, according to an analysis by advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil.
""It's a terrible sign,"" said Ane Alencar, science director at Brazil's Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). ""We can expect that August will already be a difficult month and September will be worse yet.""
Environmental advocates blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for emboldening illegal loggers, miners and land speculators to destroy the forest with his vision of economic development for the region. Bolsonaro defends his plans to introduce mining and farming in protected reserves as a way to lift the region out of poverty.
This year, the president authorized a military deployment from May to November to combat deforestation and forest fires. He has also banned setting fires in the region for 120 days.
In 2019, Brazil instituted the same temporary policies later in the year, only after fires in the Amazon provoked global outcry in August. 
Scientists say the rainforest is a vital defense against climate warming because it absorbs greenhouse gases.
Non-government organization Amazon Conservation says it has tracked 62 major fires for the year as of July 30. Many of those came after July 15, when the fire ban went into affect, indicating it has not been entirely effective, said Matt Finer, who leads the NGO's fire tracking project.
The overwhelming majority of large fires, where elevated levels of aerosols in the smoke indicate large amounts of burning biomass, happened in recently deforested areas, with none found in virgin forest, Finer said.
Criminals generally extract valuable wood from the jungle before setting fire to the land to increase its value for farming and ranching. Natural fires are very rare in the Amazon.
Deforestation hit an 11-year high in 2019 and has soared a further 25% in the first half of 2020.
Earlier this month, scientists with U.S. space agency NASA said higher surface temperatures in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean in 2020 were drawing moisture away from the southern Amazon.
""As a result, the southern Amazon landscape becomes dry and flammable, making human-set fires used for agriculture and land clearing more prone to growing out of control and spreading,"" NASA said on its website.

Fires are also worsening in the Pantanal, the world's largest wetlands, adjacent to the southern Amazon. In July, the number of blazes there more than tripled to 1,684 compared to the same month a year ago, according to INPE data, the most for that month since records began in 1998.

KHABAROVSK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Thousands of people marched in the Russian far eastern city of Khabarovsk on Saturday for a fourth consecutive weekend in protest at President Vladimir Putin's handling of a local political crisis.
Residents of Khabarovsk, around 3,800 miles (6,110 km) and seven time zones east of Moscow, are unhappy about the July 9 detention of Sergei Furgal, the wider region's popular governor, who was arrested on murder charges he denies.
His detention, which his supporters say was politically motivated, has triggered weeks of street protests, creating a headache for the Kremlin which is trying to tackle a sharp drop in real incomes as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and keep a lid on unrest as the economy stutters.
Sheltering from sporadic rain beneath umbrellas, protesters chanted ""Freedom!""
One banner read ""Russia without Putin"" while protesters chanted ""Putin resign!"" outside a government building. 
City authorities estimated around 3,500 people had taken part in the march. Some local media put the number above 10,000, but said the crowds were smaller than previous weeks. 
The protests have highlighted anger among some in the far east over what they see as policies emanating from detached Moscow-based authorities who have neglected them for years.
""The government doesn't think of us as people, we're scum to them,"" one female pensioner protester told Reuters. 
""We live at the edge of the world. This is the richest country...but we live in poverty and we pensioners have to work.""
Supporters of Furgal, who is a member of the nationalist LDPR party, say he is being punished for defeating a candidate from the ruling pro-Putin United Russia party in 2018. The Kremlin says Furgal has serious charges to answer.

Sustained demonstrations are unusual for Russia's regions, as is a lack of response from the authorities to break them up.

Masondo has been tasked with driving pro-growth economic reforms and is among potential successors to current Finance Minister Tito Mboweni.
A former leader of the Young Communist League, he is seen as more left-wing than Mboweni. Earlier this year he called for the central bank to print money to fund the government response to the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout.
In a letter to Masondo seen by Reuters, the ANC's integrity commission said his actions had brought the party into disrepute and showed poor judgment.
Masondo's written response, also seen by Reuters, insists he had acted on the advice of his lawyer when reporting the former partner to the police for harassing him and his family.
He sent WhatsApp messages to the commission that he said corroborated the harassment claim. He asked the commission for further guidance and said he was aware that ANC leaders were expected to subject themselves to ""organisational processes"".
Neither Masondo, the ANC nor the chairman of the integrity commission responded to requests for comment.
The integrity commission is expected to deliberate further. If it maintains he must resign, Masondo could appeal the decision, or the matter could be referred to the ANC's national executive committee.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's emerging student pro-democracy movement has adopted a Japanese cartoon hamster, Hamtaro, as a creative way to get support from young people around the country.
University and high school students have rallied almost daily in the past two weeks to demand the dissolution of parliament, an end to harassment of government critics, and amendments to the military-written constitution that critics say help maintain the influence of the army over the political system.
This past week, three of the protests were themed around ""Hamtaro,"" where protesters ran around public places in circles, like a hamster wheel, while singing a modified version of the cartoon's jingle, saying the government loves feasting on taxpayer's money and demanding Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha dissolve parliament.
""The Hamtaro cartoon is what on television every morning, so it connects with us easily,"" said Pumiwat Rangkasiwit, 20, a student activist from a group called New Life Network.
Japanese publishing house Shogakukan, which owns the license to Hamtaro, declined to comment on the use of the cartoon in Thai protests when contacted by Reuters.
Student groups have used social media to find new ways for protests, via hashtag #Ideaformob, leaders told Reuters. 
Groups are also planning other themes for protests, including Japanese cartoon character Naruto and Harry Potter.
""Young people grew up with these popular culture characters and they help add new dimensions to our movement, making it relatable and easy to communicate with young people,"" said Jutatip Sirikhan, 21, president of the Student Union of Thailand.
Activist Chutimon Kritsanapanee, 21, from Kasetsart University in Bangkok, said: ""Some people may not be able to relate but the main thing is we want to tell others about the failure of this government through these gimmicks.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - The Thai political street artist who goes by the name ""Headache Stencil"" prefers to keep his true identity anonymous, but he is pretty sure that authorities know where to find him.
Shortly after one of his latest public projections on the June 24, he noticed several men loitering outside his apartment. He says security at the building told him the men had identified themselves as plainclothes police.
""Now when I leave home at night I have to look twice behind my shoulder,” he said at a gallery show of his more permanent art on Friday night.
The display of political art comes amid youth-led political protests by thousands calling for the resignation of Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.
As in all his public appearances, the artist covered his face with a mask, with his public anonymity plus his work's political nature prompting some to call him ""Thailand's Banksy"" after the renowned British graffiti artist.
Asked whether police were monitoring the artist or knew his identity, Krisana Pattanacharoen, a deputy police spokesman, said: ""I don't know him at all"".
Headache Stencil takes his name from the fact that most of his work is sprayed onto walls using stencils and the fact that he aims to cause headaches for Prayuth, who first came to power in a 2014 military coup.
""I started 3 days after the coup,"" he said of his work, adding that he had an office job before that.
Much of his stencilised street art that tends to appear overnight on walls and buildings around Bangkok mocks Prayuth, whom he has portrayed on the face of a Rolex watch in a reference to allegations of government officials' unreported wealth.

(Reuters) - Seven U.S. Marines and a Navy sailor were missing on Friday, a day after their amphibious assault vehicle (AAV) sank off the Southern California coast during a training mission, Marine Corps officials said. 
Seven other Marines were rescued and are alive while one was killed after their vehicle took on water and sank around 5:45 p.m. Pacific time on Thursday (0045 GMT Friday), U.S. military officials said during a news conference. 
""They signaled to the rest of the unit that they were in fact taking on water,"" Lt. Gen. Joseph Osterman said. ""Immediate response was provided by two additional amphibious assault vehicles as well a safety boat."" 
Two of the rescued Marines were in critical condition at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla while the other five are back aboard their assigned ships, Gen. David Berger said. 
A search and rescue mission involving a U.S. Navy destroyer and a Coast Guard cutter continued on Friday afternoon for the missing Marines and sailor. 
The Marines were wearing combat gear along with inflatable vests when the incident occurred, Osterman said. 
""It sank completely,"" he said, adding that it was in several hundred feet of water. At ""26 tons, the assumption is that it went all the way to the bottom."" 
The incident occurred during what the Marine Corps said was a routine training exercise near San Clemente Island. Marines often practice beach assaults there using amphibious troop transport vehicles.
Berger said he suspended all AAV water operations until the cause is determined. He also said AAVs across the fleet will be inspected. 
All the Marines involved were assigned to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which is based at Camp Pendleton, the largest Marine base on the West Coast of the United States, between Orange and San Diego counties.

MIAMI (Reuters) - Florida and North Carolina declared states of emergency on Friday as Hurricane Isaias churned toward the U.S. East Coast, prompting authorities to close COVID-19 testing sites and people to stock up on essentials with heavy rains feared within hours.
The hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds of 75 miles (120 km) per hour, was lashing the Bahamas, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in its latest update at 2:00 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), and progressing toward the northwest.
The NHC said Isaias was ""getting better organized"" and could deliver heavy rains to South and east-Central Florida beginning late Friday before hitting the eastern Carolinas by early next week, potentially causing flooding in low-lying areas.
""While current projections have the eye of Isaias remaining at sea, the situation remains fluid and can change quickly,"" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told a media briefing. ""The state of Florida is fully prepared for this.""
DeSantis signed an executive order establishing a state of emergency for a dozen counties on the Atlantic coast, a move that makes it easier to mobilize resources. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper followed suit, predicting the storm could reach his state's coast as early as Monday.
In contrast, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster told reporters he had no plans to declare a state of emergency, saying he did not think it necessary.
The storm has already caused at least two deaths in the Dominican Republic and torn down trees, flooded streets and knocked out power for thousands of homes and businesses in Puerto Rico, according to local media reports.
Aided by a relatively warm ocean, Isaias will at the very least cause serious water damage along the coast, predicted Brian McNoldy, a senior researcher at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.
""I think the most impactful part will be the storm surge and the coastal flooding from Florida all the way up,"" he said.
Miami-Dade's public beaches, parks, marinas, and golf courses were set to close on Friday as Isaias strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane with a chance of reaching Category 2, defined by wind speeds as high as 110 miles (177 km) per hour.
Miami-Dade and Broward counties also closed drive-through and walk-up testing sites for COVID-19, limiting an important tool for health officials on a day when the state -- at the epicenter of the country's outbreak for weeks -- reported a record increase in COVID-19 deaths for a fourth day in a row.
A total of 6,709 Floridians have died from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, according to a Reuters tally.
At a news conference on Friday Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez urged residents to wear masks, especially those in multigenerational households or homes sheltering additional family members due to the approaching storm.
DeSantis said COVID-19 testing sites would remain open on Florida's west coast and that testing at hospitals and community centers may also continue. The storm's main impact would be to sites set up outside and vulnerable to the wind, he said.
At full capacity, Florida had 162 test sites in all but two of its 67 counties.
In preparation for the hurricane, DeSantis urged residents to secure seven days worth of food, water and medicine and warned they could lose power. And while mass evacuations would not likely be necessary, the shelters were ready, he said. 
Zinnia Santiago, a 50-year-old executive assistant, said she and her family were hunkering down in Coral Springs, one of the towns hit hardest in 2005 by Hurricane Wilma, a category 4 storm which caused $20 billion worth of property damage.
""I have my flashlights, I basically just had water delivered to my home,"" said Santiago, who is immunocompromised and does not feel safe going to stores. ""I kind of feel trapped in here, I'm just going on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) trying to purchase things, but they won't arrive on time.""
The storm will exacerbate the struggles faced by Miami restaurants, many already teetering on the edge of failure when the number of coronavirus cases began spiking last month.
Matt Kuscher, who owns a trio of burger and craft beer restaurants in Miami, said they are offering takeout until evening and then will close until the storm passes. 

""Hopefully we can just make it to the other side, whenever all of this over,"" he said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian Supreme Court judge slapped Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with a 1.92 million reais ($367,710) fine on Friday for not complying with an order to block globally certain accounts controlled by supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro implicated in a fake news inquiry.
Justice Alexandre de Moraes had ruled a day earlier that Facebook and Twitter failed to comply with orders to block the accounts because they were only blocked within Brazil, but remained accessible with foreign IP addresses.
On Friday, he ruled that Facebook must pay the fine for not complying and face further daily fines of 100,000 reais per day if it does not block the accounts in question globally.
Before the fine was announced, Facebook said on Friday that it would appeal the decision. The world's largest social network said it respects the laws of countries where it operates, but that ""Brazilian law recognizes the limits of its jurisdiction.""
The company did not immediately comment after the fine was announced.
The judge's fine only addressed Facebook's non-compliance. It was not clear whether Twitter would face a similar fine.
Twitter said it would also appeal the decision to block the accounts.
The judge originally decided in May to block 16 Twitter accounts and 12 Facebook accounts of Bolsonaro supporters who have been linked to a probe into the spreading of fake news during Brazil's 2018 election. 
The accounts were blocked due to allegations that they violated laws on hate speech.
Last week, Bolsonaro said his government would also launch a legal challenge against blocking the accounts.

William LeCroy, convicted of killing 30-year-old nurse Joann Tiesler in Georgia in 2001, would be executed on Sept. 22, the department said in a statement.
It said Christopher Vialva, found guilty of murdering youth ministers Todd and Stacie Bagley in Texas in 1999, was scheduled to be executed on Sept. 24.
The executions will take place at the U.S. prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, the statement said.
Abraham Bonowitz, director of Death Penalty Action, a death penalty abolition group, accused President Donald Trump's administration of using the executions for political purposes.
""The reason President Trump has scheduled these executions are his ego and his re-election campaign, not to advance justice or help victims,"" Bonowitz said.
The U.S. government carried out its first execution in 17 years on July 14, putting to death convicted murderer Daniel Lee by lethal injection at the federal execution chamber in Terre Haute.
Wesley Purkey was executed on July 16, and Dustin Honken was put to death a day later. Both were convicted of murder.
Two other inmates are scheduled for execution in late August. 
From 2003 to this year, protracted litigation over the drugs historically used in lethal injection executions prevented the government from carrying out the practice, according to Justice Department officials.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - A midair plane collision in Anchorage on Friday killed seven people, including a state lawmaker who was piloting one of the aircraft, Alaska officials said.
There were no survivors of the crash near the airport in Soldotna, a city on the Kenai Peninsula, the Alaska State Troopers said in a written statement. 
State Rep. Gary Knopp, who represented the area, was alone in one of the planes. The other plane was carrying four tourists from South Carolina, a guide from Kansas and a pilot from Soldotna, the troopers said.
All seven victims were pronounced dead at the site except for one person who died while being transported to a hospital, according to the troopers.
Crash debris fell on a highway, which was shut down briefly out of safety concerns.
The Federal Aviation Administration identified one of the planes as a de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.
Knopp, 67, was a Republican and a member of the state House bipartisan majority. Several colleagues expressed condolences.
“I’m devastated and shocked to learn of the crash that claimed Gary Knopp’s life,” House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, an independent, said in a statement. “Gary was a one-of-a-kind leader and a true Alaskan who worked tirelessly for his district in the Legislature. He will be missed by many.”
The other victims were identified as pilot Gregory Bell, 67, guide David Rogers (NYSE:ROG), 40, and the South Carolina visitors: Caleb Hulsey, 26; Heather Hulsey, 25; Mackay Hulsey, 24; and Kirstin Wright, 23.
The last fatal midair collision in Alaska happened in May of 2019 near Ketchikan. Six people were killed when two planes ferrying cruise ship passengers on sightseeing expeditions struck each other. Ten survivors of that collision were rescued from the site.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 07:40PM ET</span>",Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death sentence overturned by appeals court,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday overturned Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death sentence for helping carry out the 2013 attack, which killed three people and wounded more than 260 others.
Tsarnaev and his older brother set off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the world-renowned race, tearing through the packed crowd and causing many people to lose legs.
A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld much of Tsarnaev's conviction but ordered a new trial over what sentence Tsarnaev should receive for the death penalty-eligible crimes he was convicted of.
U.S. Circuit Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson, writing for the court, said the trial judge ""fell short"" in conducting the jury selection process and screening jurors for potential bias following pretrial publicity surrounding the high-profile case.
Thompson said the pervasive news coverage of the bombings and their aftermath featured ""bone-chilling"" photos and videos of Tsarnaev, now 27, and his brother carrying backpacks at the marathon and of those injured and killed near its finish line.
Thompson said the judge deemed jurors eligible who had ""already formed an opinion that Dzhokhar was guilty - and he did so in large part because they answered 'yes' to the question whether they could decide this high-profile case based on the evidence.""
Thompson stressed the ruling's limits. ""Make no mistake: Dzhokhar will spend his remaining days locked up in prison, with the only matter remaining being whether he will die by execution,"" she said.
While all three judges agreed the death sentence should be overturned, U.S. Circuit Judge Juan Torruella said he believed Tsarnaev was also denied the right to a fair trial when the judge declined to let the case be tried outside of Boston.
David Patton, Tsarnaev's lawyer, said prosecutors must now decide ""whether to put the victims and Boston through a second trial, or to allow closure to this terrible tragedy by permitting a sentence of life without the possibility of release.""
U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling's spokeswoman said his office is reviewing the decision. Prosecutors could ask the full appeals court to reconsider the ruling or appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Speaking at an event with law enforcement in Tampa, Florida, President Donald Trump referred to Tsarnaev as an ""animal.""
""They just sent this conviction for the death penalty back to the lower courts so they’ll argue about that for a long time,"" Trump said. ""It's ridiculous.""
HOUSE-TO-HOUSE MANHUNT
Tsarnaev is being held at the United States' ""Supermax"" prison in Florence, Colorado, a site so remote and well secured that it is nicknamed the ""Alcatraz of the Rockies.""
Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan sparked five days of panic in Boston on April 15, 2013, when they detonated two homemade pressure cooker bombs at the marathon's finish line and then went into hiding.
Three nights later, as they attempted to flee the city, they sparked a new round of terror in Boston when they hijacked a car and shot dead Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier. Tsarnaev's brother died later that night after a gunfight with police, which ended when Dzhokhar ran him over with a stolen car.
Police then locked down Boston and most surrounding communities for almost 24 hours, with heavily armed officers conducting house-to-house searches through the suburb of Watertown, where the surviving brother was found hiding in a dry-docked boat in a backyard. 
A jury in 2015 found Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 counts he faced and later determined he deserved execution for a bomb he planted that killed 8-year-old Martin Richard and 23-year-old Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu. Restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, was also killed.
Bill and Denise Richard, whose son Martin was the youngest fatality in the attack, in a statement printed on the front page of the Boston Globe in 2015 had asked the U.S. Department of Justice to drop its pursuit of the death penalty, saying it would only prolong their pain.
On the day of his sentencing, Tsarnaev admitted his crimes.

""I am sorry for the lives I have taken, for the suffering that I have caused you, for the damage I have done, irreparable damage,"" said Tsarnaev. ""In case there is any doubt, I am guilty of this attack, along with my brother.""

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 06:15PM ET</span>",U.S. appeals court delays release of Ghislaine Maxwell deposition,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday temporarily delayed the release of a 2016 deposition about Ghislaine Maxwell's sex life, after she argued it could destroy her ability to get a fair trial against criminal charges she aided the late financier Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of girls.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the order after last-ditch scrambles by Maxwell to keep potentially embarrassing information, which her lawyer said could make it ""difficult if not impossible"" to find an impartial jury, out of the public eye.
Maxwell's appeal will be heard on an expedited basis, with oral argument scheduled for Sept. 22.
Her deposition had been taken in April 2016 for a now-settled civil defamation lawsuit against the British socialite by Virginia Giuffre, who had accused Epstein of having kept her as a ""sex slave"" with Maxwell's assistance.
Dozens of other documents from that case were released late on Thursday, after the presiding judge concluded that the public had a right to see them.
The release of Maxwell's deposition had been scheduled for Monday, pending the outcome of the appeal.
Lawyers for Maxwell and Giuffre did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and eventually abuse three girls from 1994 to 1997, and committing perjury by denying her involvement under oath.
She was arrested on July 2 and has been held in a Brooklyn jail after a judge denied bail, calling her a flight risk. Maxwell's trial is scheduled for next July.
Epstein was found hanged at age 66 last August in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges for abusing women and girls in Manhattan and Florida from 2002 to 2005. He had also pleaded not guilty.
In seeking to keep Maxwell's deposition sealed, her lawyers said in court papers on Thursday she had been promised confidentiality by Giuffre's lawyers and the presiding judge at the time, through an agreed-upon protective order, before answering many personal, sensitive and ""allegedly incriminatory"" questions about her dealings with Epstein.
They said further that Maxwell was blindsided when prosecutors quoted from the deposition in her indictment, and accusing Giuffre of leaking the deposition to the government.
In a court filing on Friday, Giuffre's lawyers called Maxwell's appeal ""frivolous, and a transparent attempt to further delay the release of documents to which the public has a clear and unequivocal right to access.""
The lawyers also called the allegation Giuffre leaked the deposition ""completely and utterly false."" 
Friday's order also covers a second deposition by an unnamed Epstein accuser that Maxwell also wanted kept under seal. Other documents from Giuffre's lawsuit that quote or disclose information from the depositions also remain sealed.
Among the documents released on Thursday were a few emails between Epstein and Maxwell dated January 2015, including one where Epstein told Maxwell that she had done ""nothing wrong.""
Lawyers for Maxwell said on July 10 in a court filing requesting bail in her criminal case that she had not been in contact with Epstein for ""more than a decade.""

Maxwell is now battling prosecutors in her criminal case over the scope of a protective order intended to protect her right to a fair trial while ensuring the privacy of her accusers.

LISBON (Reuters) - Hundreds of anti-racism protesters took over one of Lisbon's main squares on Friday to demand justice for Bruno Cande, a Black actor shot dead in a busy street last weekend. 
Cande, 39 and of Guinean origin, was shot several times by a white man in his eighties at Avenida de Moscavide, around 10 km from Lisbon's city centre, according to police.
A suspect was detained and is awaiting trial. 
Portugal's criminal investigation police agency, the PJ, has not confirmed what motivated the attack. 
Cande's family said in a statement on Saturday the suspect had threatened to kill him three days before the shooting and used racist slurs.
""Why are we here and unable to live in peace? We are working, paying our taxes. Why are they always killing black people?"" 32-year-old protester Sofia Rodrigues asked among the crowd.
During the peaceful demonstration, protesters wearing masks due to the coronavirus outbreak held signs saying ""Justice!"" and ""Racism kills!""
In Guinea-Bissau, lawmakers passed a motion saying the murder was racially motivated and said they would send a delegation to discover what happened to Cande. 
The case has put a spotlight on racism in Portugal, including frictions with police. 
""From authorities to day-to-day life, Portugal remains a racist country,"" said 65-year-old Eduardo Henriques who also at the protest.
Europe's main rights forum, the Council of Europe, said in a 2018 report there were numerous serious accusations of racist violence by Portuguese police. 
Last year, a court found eight officers guilty of kidnapping and beating up six young people from Cova da Moura, a predominantly black neighbourhood in the outskirts of Lisbon. 

There are several poor neighbourhoods around the capital where migrants mostly from Portugal's African ex-colonies live.

Early elections are a key demand of Iraqi anti-government protesters who staged months of mass demonstrations last year and were killed in their hundreds by security forces and gunmen suspected of links to militia groups.
Iraqi's parliament must still ratify the election date.
Kadhimi was selected by parliament in May to head a government that would guide the country towards early elections. His predecessor Adel Abdul Mahdi quit under pressure from protests in December last year.
Activists have also demanded fairer elections and changes to Iraq's voting process and election committee after widespread accusations of fraud in the last nationwide vote in 2018.
The United Nations praised Kadhimi's announcement saying it would promote ""greater stability and democracy"".
Voter turnout in Iraq's last election was 44.5 percent, but especially low in some impoverished southern Shi'ite Muslim areas. Many Iraqis say they have no faith in Iraq's electoral system. 
Demonstrators who took to the street in their hundreds of thousands last year accuse the political elite, especially lawmakers, of squandering Iraq's oil wealth to line their own pockets.

Kadhimi's government faces a health crisis with a rapid spread of the coronavirus, a fiscal crisis because of low oil revenues and exports, challenges from powerful militia groups which oppose him and a rising Islamic State insurgency.

Authorities opened a probe into Ramirez over alleged graft in late 2017 and sought an Interpol red alert for him in early 2018, shortly after he left his later post as Venezuela's United Nations ambassador and began publicly criticizing President Nicolas Maduro's handling of the economy, which remains in freefall.
Ramirez did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has previously denied the corruption allegations, stating that the government was seeking to silence a critical voice.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States intensified its economic pressure on China's Xinjiang province on Friday, imposing sanctions on a powerful Chinese company and two officials for what it said were human rights abuses against Uighurs and other ethnic minorities.
The move, the latest blow to U.S.-China relations, came a week after U.S. President Donald Trump closed the Chinese consulate in Houston, prompting Beijing to shutter the U.S. consulate in Chengdu.
The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement it blacklisted the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, also known as XPCC, along with Sun Jinlong, former party secretary of XPCC, and Peng Jiarui, XPCC's deputy party secretary and commander, over accusations they are connected to serious human rights abuse against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.
""The Chinese Communist Party’s human rights abuses in Xinjiang, China against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities rank as the stain of the century,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
China denies mistreatment of the minority group and says the camps holding many Uighurs provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.
Washington's action freezes any U.S. assets of the company and officials; generally prohibits Americans from dealing with them; and bars Sun Jinlong and Peng Jiarui from traveling to the United States. 
A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the company as a ""a secretive, paramilitary organization that performs a variety of functions under the direct control"" of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
""They are directly involved in the implementation of the CCP’s comprehensive surveillance, detention and indoctrination ... which we all know targets the Uighurs and members of other ethnic minority members in Xinjiang,"" the official said.
The Treasury also issued a license, authorizing certain wind-down and divestment transactions and activities related to blocked XPCC subsidiaries until Sept. 30.
Washington recently imposed sanctions on the autonomous region of Xinjiang’s Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, the highest-ranking Chinese official to be targeted, blacklisting the member of China’s powerful Politburo and current first party secretary of the XPCC, as well as other officials and the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau.
Peter Harrell, a former official and sanctions expert at the Center for a New American Security, said that from an economic perspective, Friday's action was a ""substantial escalation"" of U.S. pressure and sends a warning to companies engaged in activity in China.
""The Trump administration finally took a meaningful sanctions ... action on Xinjiang, as opposed to ones that were primarily symbolic,"" Harrell said.
XPCC is a quasi-military group created in 1954. It was initially made up of demobilized soldiers who spent time in military training while developing farms on the region's arid land.

Civilian members from eastern China later joined the corps, which now numbers 3.11 million people, or more than 12% of the region's population. It is almost entirely made up of Han Chinese in a region that is home to the Muslim Uighur people.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro made a scheduled visit to the south of the country on Friday, after revealing the night before that he is taking antibiotics for a lung infection.
Bolsonaro has previously tested positive three times for the coronavirus, but, according to one source, doctors accompanying him on the trip have not linked the lung infection to COVID-19.
Bolsonaro is one of a handful of world leaders to have tested positive for coronavirus. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was rushed into intensive care in April, and took several weeks to fully recover. 
Having spent most of July self-isolating at his official residence in Brasilia, Bolsonaro said on Saturday that his last coronavirus test was negative.
However, a week back into his normal schedule, the president said in his weekly live broadcast on Thursday that he felt weak and the test results revealed an infection.
""I just had a blood test, you know, I had a little weakness yesterday, they even found a little bit of infection too. I'm on antibiotics now. ... After 20 days indoors, I have other problems. I have mold in my lungs,"" he said.
His wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, tested positive on Thursday, according to a statement from the presidential palace. Science and Technology Minister Marcos Pontes also tested positive for the virus, making him the fifth Cabinet minister diagnosed publicly.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's top immigration enforcement official on Friday announced he will retire from the agency, a staffing shakeup in a key policy area for Trump as he faces re-election in November.
Matthew Albence, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)), said in a statement that his plan to retire had been prolonged by the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic has created challenges for ICE operations both in the field and in immigration detention centers, where nearly 4,000 immigrants have tested positive for the disease. 
The Republican president has made immigration a major theme of his first four-year term in office and a central part of his 2020 campaign against Democratic challenger Joe Biden, but Americans have become increasingly concerned about the virus and the struggling economy in recent months.
Still, Trump has implemented a number of sweeping immigration measures during the pandemic, suspending the entry of certain foreign workers and green card applicants and allowing U.S. authorities to rapidly deport migrants encountered at the country's borders with Mexico and Canada.
ICE tactical police were part of recent deployment of federal officers sent to quell protests outside a courthouse in Portland, Oregon, an effort that drew criticism from Democratic officials in the state. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about who would replace Albence. Derek Benner, executive associate director for ICE's homeland security investigations division, is the next highest ranking official.
Kathy Nuebel Kovarik, a Trump appointee at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the legal immigration system, is expected to move to ICE on Monday. She will take over as the chief of staff, a role that usually involves advising senior leadership.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

LISBON (Reuters) - A crash between a high-speed train and a maintenance machine in central Portugal killed two people and injured at least 37 on Friday, the national relief operations authority CNOS said.
A spokesman for CNOS told Reuters two medical helicopters, as well as more than 160 rescue personnel, including firefighters, were at the scene. 
There were 212 passengers on board the Alfa Pendular train, the country's fastest, the spokesman said, adding that among those injured, 30 had minor injures and seven were seriously hurt. 
The crash happened in the town of Soure, around 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the central city of Coimbra. The town's mayor Mario Nunes said the two dead were working on the rail tracks when the crash took place.
The train driver was among seven people with serious injuries and was rushed to hospital, SIC Television reported. 
A spokeswoman for the District Command of Relief Operations in Coimbra said more emergency services were on their way to the scene, where a field hospital was set up. 
In a note shared on its official website, Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said he ""regrets the serious rail accident"" and sent ""heartfelt condolences"" to the victims' relatives and friends.

Drinkers and diners have to provide a name and a telephone number to allow them to be traced if someone who is found to have the virus was present at the same time.
But the DPA news agency has cited several police stations as saying that they had used that data to find witnesses to help solve crimes.
Germany owes some of the toughest privacy laws in the world to its determination to banish the spectre of the mass surveillance systems once used by the Nazis or the East German secret police, the Stasi.
""I work at a bank,"" Dirk Apel, eating at a restaurant in Bonn, told Reuters TV on Friday. ""Over there, private data is a huge issue. Every little thing like a birthday is watched so that no one else can find it out - the 'need-to-know' basis. And I think this is a abuse of confidence.""
Thomas Lengfelder, managing director of the hotel and catering association DEHOGA, noted that cafe owners were not allowed to ask customers for formal identification, and said reports of data being used elsewhere would not encourage patrons to obey the rules.
""We can't let someone play fast and loose with that data,"" he said. ""Officials should be well aware of what they are allowed to use and what's not allowed.""

After a customer at a restaurant in Berlin tested positive for the virus recently, health officials had difficulty tracing some of the other customers because many had either failed to provide their names and numbers or written fake ones.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has elevated to the House of Lords his younger brother, a cricket hero and some of his allies in the campaign to take Britain out of the European Union.
Under an arcane system whose inner workings are not exposed to public scrutiny, British political leaders are entitled on certain occasions to nominate people to the upper chamber of parliament, where they can sit for life.
Among 36 nominations announced on Friday was Jo Johnson, the prime minister's younger brother, who quit as a junior minister last year because he disagreed with his boss and older sibling's Brexit strategy.
Jo Johnson supported remaining in the European Union in a 2016 referendum, in sharp contrast to Boris Johnson, who led the successful campaign for Britain to quit the bloc.
In another apparent olive branch to heal Brexit divisions within his Conservative Party, the prime minister nominated former finance minister Philip Hammond, a prominent remainer who was long the target of vitriolic attacks by Brexit supporters.
Other political nominations tilted more towards the Brexit camp, with peerages bestowed on former opposition Labour lawmakers Kate Hoey and Gisela Stuart, who as ardent Brexiteers became unlikely allies of Johnson during the referendum.
He also nominated former England cricket captain Ian Botham, who in his heyday in the 1980s was regarded by many fans of the sport as one of its finest all-rounders. Botham was not recognised for his achievements on the field, however, but for his enthusiastic Brexit campaigning.
Among other eye-catching nominations was that of Evgeny Lebedev, the British-Russian owner of the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers. He is the son of Alexander Lebedev, a former KGB agent who became an oligarch.
Evgeny Lebedev, who has spent most of his life in Britain, is frequently seen in high society circles in London, where he is active as a charity campaigner and patron of the arts. He controversially appointed former Conservative finance minister George Osborne, who had no previous experience in journalism, as editor of the Evening Standard in 2017.

The House of Lords has more than 800 members, and despite perennial complaints that the number is far too high and the nominations process opaque and prone to cronyism, prime ministers from all sides have enthusiastically added to its numbers.

Lost fishing nets - known as ""ghost nets"" - wrapped around shipwrecks often turn into death traps for marine life.
The Healthy Seas initiative, which organised the operation, said millions of animals die every year after getting trapped in the nylon gear. 
Last week, Greek and Dutch volunteers dived 52 meters into the waters between the islands of Kefalonia and Zakynthos to remove nets entangled around HMS Perseus, one of the biggest submarines of World War Two and a cultural heritage site.
The cleanup mission focused on the submarine's conning tower and the front outer hull. 
""The underwater cleanups lasted five days targeting also other wrecks in the area, at 50 metres depth, and recovering a total of 500 kilos of lost fishing gear,"" said Healthy Seas.
The nets recovered will be regenerated together with other nylon waste and used for the production of socks, swimwear, and carpets, it added. 
A similar cleanup operation was conducted last year by another organisation. 
HMS Perseus hit a mine in December 1941. Its only survivor, British Navy stoker John Capes, made it to the surface and swam miles in the dark to reach Kefalonia, where he was sheltered and hidden by islanders for more than a year. 

The wreck was located by Greek divers in 1997.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Eusebio Leal, a historian and orator who befriended Fidel Castro and led the reconstruction of the crumbling historic center of Havana, died on Friday morning from a ""painful illness,"" Cuban official media said. He was 77.
Calling himself a ""Fidelist"" rather than a Marxist, Leal was a member of the ruling Cuban Communist Party's elite Central Committee and came to be seen as an elder statesman of Cuba.
Inside Cuba, he earned recognition as an articulate historian, originally a self-taught student who through intellect and hard work passed the university entrance exam without a formal education.
He would go on to earn a doctorate in history and become a member of Cuba's National Assembly.
Outside Cuba, he was best known as leader of the project to rebuild Old Havana, the historic center built by Spanish colonists which had been deteriorating from age, neglect and the damaging effects of seawater on the buildings along Havana's famous boardwalk.
The United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture (UNESCO) named Old Havana a World Heritage site. With financial help from Spain and under the direction of Leal, Cuba rebuilt dozens of colonial-era buildings, contrasting sharply with the many that continued to crumble.
The campaign helped make Old Havana a tourist attraction that was an alternative to the country's popular beach resorts.
Leal was a close friend of Castro as well as his younger brother Raul Castro, who officially took over the leadership of the Cuban Communist Party in 2011, though he shied away from overtly political gestures, concentrating on academia and rebuilding the historic center.
""More than a Marxist, I was a Fidelist,"" Leal told a meeting of artists and writers in April 2014. He added, referring to Fidel Castro, ""His thinking was more inclusive and comprehensive than the dogmatic canons or doctrine."" 
""Fidel was the only one capable of uniting this country after the revolution, in the face of so many discordant ideas,"" he said.
Leal said he built his appreciation for restoring old buildings on his early dedication to the Roman Catholic Church, which fell out of favor in the early days of the communist government but later regained stature with the Castro brothers and other aging revolutionaries. 
""My cultural education was formed through the discipline of the church,"" he said in a 2010 interview with Cuban state television. ""It was difficult to make religion and revolution compatible. People didn't understand, and there were some difficult moments, but for me they were never incompatible.""
Leal also embraced the market-oriented economic reforms implemented under Raul Castro, saying the country must produce economically in order to progress.

""Bread is just as important as thinking. One must have bread in order to think,"" Leal said. ""Think about it. Bread comes before philosophy.""

Belarusian security forces detained more than 30 suspected Russian mercenaries near Minsk on Wednesday after receiving information that more than 200 fighters had entered the country to destabilise it ahead of a presidential election.
State-run Belta news agency said the men worked for Wagner, Russia's best-known private military contractor.

Poland is setting growing store by its bilateral defence relationship with its NATO partner, fearful of an increasingly assertive posture from Russia to the east since Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
On June 12 last year, U.S. President Donald Trump agreed, with Polish President Andrzej Duda beside him at the White House, to send 1,000 more troops to his NATO ally.
But negotiations on the details of where the troops would be stationed and how much Poland would pay dragged on for years.
""We did it. We have finished the negotiations on military cooperation,"" Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said in a statement.
Poland currently hosts a rotating contingent of over 4,000 U.S. troops. A permanent presence, which the statement says will now number at least 5,500 troops, is likely to cost Poland more.
The deal also involves the development of expertise for Polish forces in the areas of reconnaissance and command, with the possibility of more U.S. forces coming to Poland in case of an increased threat, the statement said.
The financial details of the new deal were not revealed in the ministry's statement.
The U.S. military on Wednesday expanded on plans to withdraw about 12,000 troops from Germany and indicated that some of them could be moved to Poland or the Baltic states.
It was unclear from Friday's statement where the additional 1,000 troops would come from, and whether some would be reassigned from Germany. Poland's Defence Ministry was not immediately available to comment and the U.S. embassy declined to do so.

U.S. officials have insisted that the agreement with Poland and the decision to pull some U.S. troops out of Germany are separate matters.

MUMBAI/ISLAMABAD/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has proposed that hundreds of Taliban prisoners be transferred to house arrest in a supervised facility when they are freed from Afghan jails, three senior official sources said, a proposed solution for a deadlock that is holding up peace talks.
The proposal for Taliban fighters accused of conducting some of the bloodiest attacks in Afghanistan to be placed in a location where they would be under both Taliban and Afghan government surveillance was presented this week to the warring Afghan sides by top U.S. diplomats, the sources said.
The diplomats are trying to kickstart peace negotiations in Doha that have been delayed over the prisoner issue. The Afghan government is resisting freeing the final batch out of some 5,000 prisoners whose release was demanded by the insurgent group as a condition to start peace talks. 
U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad pressed Taliban leaders and President Ashraf Ghani to break the deadlock during a visit to Kabul this week. [nL2N2EW09B]
Around 400 prisoners are still in government custody, with Western allies also expressing concerns over releasing around half of those. 
""The Americans and their allies agree that it would be insane to let some of the most dreaded Taliban fighters walk out freely...the Afghan forces arrested them for conducting some of the most heinous crimes against humanity,"" said a senior western diplomat in Kabul.
Khalilzad's office was not immediately available for comment on the proposals. A spokesman for Ghani declined to comment.
The State Department referred Reuters to a statement it released after Khalilzad's visit, which said he had pressed for ""ongoing efforts to resolve the remaining issues ahead of intra-Afghan negotiations"", including the prisoner release, but did not detail any proposals. 
MAJOR ATTACKS
Of the 400 prisoners left, around 200 are accused by the Afghan government of masterminding attacks on embassies, public squares and government offices, killing thousands of civilians in recent years and including a huge 2017 blast targeting the German Embassy in Kabul. 
Two Taliban sources and one former senior Afghan official said senior members of the militant Haqqani Network, which has ties to the Taliban, are also among the group.
On Friday, Ghani ordered the release of 500 Taliban prisoners who are not part of the group's list. 
However the two Taliban and two diplomatic sources said the insurgent group was insistent on its demand for the release of the remaining 400 prisoners on the list. 
""The Taliban are adamant about their release, the only middle path is to get the Afghan government to hand these militants to the Taliban if they agree to put them in house arrest,"" a second diplomat in Kabul said on condition of anonymity. 
RANGE OF PROPOSALS
An Asian diplomat said Khalilzad had presented a range of proposals, including the option of moving them to a jointly guarded facility.
He said other ideas put forward were releasing the prisoners without publicly announcing it, agreeing to release prisoners shortly after negotiations start, or persuading the Taliban to compromise on the most contentious 200 prisoners.
Washington is keen to break the deadlock in order to deliver concrete results ahead of the November U.S. presidential election in which President Donald Trump will want to tout his success in ending the 19-year-long Afghan war.
Washington also wants to adhere to a troop withdrawal deadline reached in February with the Taliban.
""Khalilzad is really feeling the heat now,"" the Asian diplomat said. ""The Americans have become the constant mediators between the two Afghan sides and it's not easy.""
Two senior Taliban members said Khalilzad had promised the group he would resolve the prisoner issue soon, and they expected the final release to take place over the Eid holiday weekend, likely Saturday or Sunday.
Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban's political office, declined to comment on the proposal to hold some Taliban fighters in a jointly guarded facility.

He said the group would shortly complete the release of 1,000 prisoners it is holding and wanted the Afghan government to complete its side of the prisoner exchange.

Around 200 Muslims laid out prayer mats on the pitch usually used for the national sports of Gaelic football and hurling and where in 1920 British troops opened fire on a crowd, killing 14 people during Ireland's War of Independence.
Irish President Michael D. Higgins described it as an important moment in Ireland's narrative. Leaders of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish faiths attended and spoke at the event, which was broadcast live on television for the first time.
With Muslims unable to hold large gatherings in mosques due to Covid-19 social distancing rules, Shaykh Umar al-Qadri, chair of Irish Muslim Peace & Integration Council, approached the management of Croke Park, who he said did not hesitate to offer the venue.
He got the idea after an Ikea store in Germany allowed Muslims to use one of its car parks for Ramadan prayers.
""Today this Eid prayer is sending a very strong message out to the whole world, that Ireland is indeed a country of céad míle fáilte,"" he told the gathering, using the Irish language greeting translated as '100,000 welcomes'.
""No matter how different you are, once you come and you live here and become part of the society, this island of Ireland has this great, unique ability to adopt you.""
A series of sexual abuse scandals shattered the credibility of the Catholic Church which dominated Irish society for decades after its independence from Britain. Ireland has since experienced sweeping social change, including the introduction of abortion and gay marriage in recent years.
The Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, told celebrants that there was something special about recognising publicly the Muslim community's place ""as an integral part of the family of the Irish"" in Croke Park.

The Robert Koch Institute, a German public health agency, put the three Spanish regions on its list of high risk locations, meaning people returning to Germany are required either to quarantine for 14 days or present a negative coronavirus test.
With virus numbers ticking up in Germany, fears have grown that tourists returning from destinations experiencing a surge in new cases could spread infection quickly. Germany reported 870 confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest daily total since mid-May.
From next week, Germany plans to make coronavirus tests mandatory at airports for all returning holidaymakers from high-risk areas in order to slow the spread of infections. 
The travel warning is the latest blow to Spain's economy, which is already in a steep recession and depends on tourism for 12.3% of its economic output. Germans made up around 5% of tourists to Catalonia's main city Barcelona in 2019, according to the city's tourism activity report.
Germany's travel warning follows moves by other European countries to restrict travel from Spain, above all Britain, which accounts for the largest share of foreign visitors. It has introduced a 14-day quarantine on all arrivals from Spain and recommended against all but essential travel to the Spanish mainland. Norway has also imposed a 10-day quarantine.

France has advised against travel to Catalonia.

The ritual, at which pilgrims must hurl pebbles at a giant wall, has in the past been the scene of several deadly crowd accidents. In 2015, hundreds died in a crush at an intersection leading up to the site. 
Clad in white robes denoting a state of purity and face masks, men and women cast their stones, closely monitored by health professionals. The pilgrims stood apart on yellow markers marking a safe social distance.
They will return over the next two days for more stoning before going back to Mecca to pray at the Grand Mosque at the end of haj.
In previous year, some 3 million white-clad pilgrims from across the world flocked to Islam's holiest sites to attend haj.
But with large gatherings impossible given the pandemic, only a few thousand pilgrims - Saudis and foreign residents living in the country- are gathering this year.
Although no official figure has been given, local media report there are around 10,000 pilgrims. The Haj minister in June said pilgrims would number 1,000.
Saudi Arabia stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina and its peaceful organisation of haj, which has been marred in the past by deadly stampedes, fires and riots.
This year it faces the challenge of keeping haj, a once-in-a-lifetime duty for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it and a major source of income for the government, safe from COVID-19.
Late on Thursday, a health ministry spokesman said that there were no Covid-19 infections, nor any other major diseases among pilgrims so far.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A Dutch court cast doubt on the independence of Poland's legal system on Friday in a request for a ruling from the top European Union tribunal over the possible extradition of a suspected Polish drug trafficker.
Polish rule of law has become an increasing matter of dispute within the EU, as critics say the ruling nationalist government has undue influence over judicial appointments. 
The International Chamber of Amsterdam's District Court said it did not believe Polish courts were independent of government and it would not extradite the suspect until the EU Court of Justice told it to.
In April, the EU executive opened a case against Poland's government over muzzling judges. That came after Poland had passed a new law making it possible to punish judges who criticize the system. 
""These developments harm the independence of the Polish judiciary so much that it cannot operate independently of the Polish government and parliament,"" the Dutch court said in a statement.
Warsaw is seeking the extradition of a 32-year-old Polish man arrested in the Netherlands on suspicion of smuggling 200 kg of marijuana and other drugs into Poland. The court did not release his name, following Dutch privacy law.
Poland's government, led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, says that its reforms have been necessary to remove a residue of communist influence from the judicial system and to make courts more efficient and fair.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki argues that the judicial reforms are a national, not EU, matter.

MINSK (Reuters) - Just weeks after emerging from political obscurity to run for president, Svetlana Tikhanouskaya took the stage as darkness fell on Thursday and addressed the biggest opposition rally in Belarus since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Occasionally gazing down at a clipboard as tens of thousands of people chanted her name, she urged the east European country to vote for change when she takes on long-serving President Alexander Lukashenko in the Aug. 9 election.
""I am tired of being afraid. And you - are you tired of being patient? Are you tired of being silent? Are you tired of being afraid?"" she asked.
Tikhanouskaya, 37, announced her candidacy only after her husband, a blogger, was arrested in May and jailed on what she says were trumped-up charges and forced to pull out of the race.
Although Lukashenko is expected to win, she has quickly become the figurehead of a protest movement against Lukashenko, who was once described by Washington as Europe's last dictator.
Western observers do not judge elections in the former Soviet republic as free and fair. But Tikhanouskaya poses the most serious challenge in years to Lukashenko, a 65-year-old former collective farm manager who has allowed little dissent since coming to power in 1994.
Belarus is strategically located between the European Union's eastern edge and Russia, which sends oil to Europe via the country and regards it as a buffer zone against NATO.
Washington is in the process of resetting diplomatic relations with Minsk to offset what it sees as dangerous Russian and Chinese influence.
A Lukashenko win may not quell public anger, political analysts say, and Tikhanouskaya, a former teacher described by an ally as the Belarusian Joan of Arc, is well placed to continue to lead a protest movement that could yield change. 
According to human rights group Spring-96, 63,000 people attended Thursday's rally, making it the largest in the country of 9.5 million since the Soviet collapse in 1991.
""DIRTY GAMES""
Hours before the rally, Tikhanouskaya told Reuters she disliked politics and its ""dirty games"" but felt compelled to stand after her husband's arrest. 
""I entered the election not because I need power or because I am a politician and want to be president. I went to support my husband,"" she said in an interview. ""It was not planned. It was at the call of my heart.""
Tikhanouskaya's first priority is to free all political prisoners, including her husband, and to rerun the election to include all candidates barred from standing.
Her decision to stand was not an easy one. As a crackdown on protests continued, Tikhanouskaya said she received an anonymous threat to have her children taken away.
She thought about quitting, but felt she could not betray the people who had believed in her husband so moved her children to an undisclosed location abroad and carried on. 
""Syarhei is brave, I never considered myself brave,"" she said. 
Authorities on Thursday linked her husband to an alleged plot by suspected Russian mercenaries to destabilise Belarus, an allegation she dismissed.
Lukashenko has compared the opposition to criminals and accused them of trying to whip up violent revolution. 
He has faced criticism over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic -- he recommended drinking vodka to fight COVID-19 -- and grievances over the economy and human rights. 
Despite jibes from him about a woman's fitness to run for office, Tikhanouskaya joined forces with two other women representing other opposition campaigns. 
Political analyst Artem Shreibman questions whether she can keep the momentum going after her likely defeat. 

""But politics in Belarus and Tikhanouskaya herself have recently defied all predictions,"" he said.

The former New Mexico governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations traveled to Caracas and met with socialist President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month as part of a private humanitarian mission on behalf of the families of American prisoners in Venezuela. 
The two prisoners moved to house arrest, Gustavo Cardenas and Jorge Toledo, were among the six arrested in 2017 on charges of embezzlement that the U.S. government and their lawyers say are baseless. Five of the executives of Citgo, the U.S. refining unit of Venezuela's state oil company, have American citizenship.

Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Caracas and Washington cut diplomatic ties last year after the Trump administration tightened sanctions on Venezuela in an attempt to oust Maduro, who it accuses of rigging his 2018 re-election. 
Venezuela's government is also currently holding two former U.S. special forces soldiers, Luke Denman and Airan Berry, who authorities arrested in May for allegedly leading a failed incursion attempt aimed at capturing Maduro.
Richardson has a history of working to get Americans released from captivity by hostile governments. He previously was involved in securing U.S. missionary Joshua Holt's freedom from Venezuelan detention in 2018.

In August last year, the trio were stealing a quad bike when approached by 28-year-old officer Andrew Harper who chased the group's car, getting caught in a tow rope and being dragged for 1.4 miles (2.25 km) down a country lane. His fatally injured body became detached from the vehicle and was left in the road.
Henry Long, 19, the driver, and his passengers Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both 18, were found guilty of manslaughter, but were cleared of murder last year.
At the Old Bailey on Friday, Long was sentenced to 16 years in jail. Cole and Bowers were both sentenced to 13 years in jail.
Earlier this week, Harper's widow wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask for a retrial after her husband’s killers were cleared of murder. A spokesman for the prime minister said he would respond after legal proceedings had been completed.
An initial trial was abandoned after a nationwide lockdown in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. For the retrial, the judge ordered extra security amid fears of potential juror intimidation by supporters of the defendants.
The prosecution argued the defendants were aware the officer was being dragged behind the car. But the teenagers' lawyers claimed the incident could not have been planned.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Friday postponed a Sept. 6 election for the city's legislature for a year because of a spike in novel coronavirus cases, dealing a blow to the pro-democracy opposition hoping to make gains in the vote.
The opposition had aimed to ride a wave of resentment of a new national security law, that Beijing imposed on the city on June 30, to win a majority in the Legislative Council, where half the seats are directly elected with the other half filled mostly by pro-Beijing appointees.
The postponement comes after 12 pro-democracy candidates were disqualified from running in the poll, for reasons including perceived subversive intentions, opposition to the new security law and campaigning to win a legislation-blocking majority.
Lam, who said the election would be held on Sept. 5 next year, told reporters the decision was the most difficult she had made in seven months and it was aimed at safeguarding people's health.
""We have 3 million voters going out in one day across Hong Kong, such flow of people would cause high risk of infection,"" Lam said.
Beijing-backed Lam said she had to invoke an emergency law to make the postponement and no political considerations were involved in the decision. China's parliament would decide how to fill the legislative vacuum caused by it.
The poll would have been the former British colony's first official vote since Beijing imposed the security law to tackle what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with punishment of up to life in prison.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a guarantee of autonomy but critics say the new law undermines the Chinese-ruled city's high degree of autonomy and puts it on a more authoritarian path.
The Chinese and Hong Kong governments say the law will not undermine Hong Kong's freedoms and is necessary to preserve order and prosperity after months of often-violent anti-government protests last year.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wending said earlier that Hong Kong's coronavirus outbreak was a factor in its elections, which were a domestic issue.
'POLITICAL PURGE'
News of the postponement came as the nomination period for candidates seeking to run in the election closed.
Among the 12 opposition candidates disqualified was Joshua Wong, who rose to fame leading protests in Hong Kong as a teenager in 2012 and 2014.
""Barring me from running ... would not stop our cause for democracy,"" said Wong, 23, 
Wong, who China calls a ""black hand"" of foreign forces, said his disqualification was ""invalid and ridiculous"" and the new law a ""legal weapon used against dissidents"".
The government denies political censorship or suppression of the right to run for the legislature.
Authorities also disqualified some members of the Civic Party, a moderate, old-guard opposition group, and others who won an unofficial ""primary"" vote held by the opposition camp this month.
That independently organised vote saw a younger, more defiant generation of democrats taking over the helm of the opposition, but the Civic Party disqualifications signal Beijing is becoming less tolerant of even moderate voices.
Former colonial power Britain said it was clear the candidates had been barred because of their political views. Hong Kong's last British governor, Chris Pattern, called it an ""outrageous political purge"". 
Hong Kong has reported more than 3,000 coronavirus cases since January, far lower than in other major cities around the world.
But for the past 10 days, the number of new infections has been in the triple-digits.
Nevertheless, government critics are likely to question the justification for the postponement.
Rival finance hub Singapore, which has had a larger coronavirus outbreak, held a general election in July.
At least 68 countries and territories have delayed national or regional polls due to coronavirus since February, said the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.

But at least 49 countries and territories have decided to hold national or sensational elections, it said.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the WTO was unlikely to fill a leadership void after Washington's insistence on a U.S. candidate.
The interim chief would normally have been one of the four deputy director-generals who are from China, Germany, Nigeria and the United States. The WTO said on Friday they would instead all stay on in their existing roles.
""The original effort was to try and designate an acting director-general among the four... That was not possible. We were not able to get a consensus on that,"" WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell told a briefing.
""The current director-general Roberto Azevedo said it was disappointing,"" he added.
The role would be largely administrative for a couple of months. However, one potential difficulty concerns the WTO's role in settling disputes. If parties to a case cannot agree on the composition of a three-person adjudicating panel, as is often the case, the director-general can step in to select them.
WTO members also agreed on Friday that they would select the future director-general by cutting the initial field of eight to five, then to two before a final decision is taken.
The WTO's 164 members would be invited to select four preferred candidates in the first round running from Sept 7-16.
A ""troika"" of ambassadors which chairs the WTO's main committees would determine which candidates have wide-ranging support across regions and from least developing to developed countries.

The new leader has to be chosen by November 7.

(Reuters) - There is no ""zero risk"" strategy for countries easing international travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and essential travel for emergencies should remain the priority, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.
In a long-awaited update to its guidance on travel, the United Nations global health agency said cross-border trips for emergencies, humanitarian work, the transfer of essential personnel and repatriation would constitute essential travel.
""There is no 'zero risk' when considering the potential importation or exportation of cases in the context of international travel,"" it said in the updated guidance posted on its website on Thursday.
A surge of new infections in many parts of the world has prompted some countries to reintroduce some travel restrictions, including testing and quarantining incoming passengers. 
The WHO had said in June it would update its travel guidelines before the northern hemisphere summer holidays.
The WHO's guidance can be used by governments and industries to help shape policies, but is not enforceable. 
The updated travel advice is little changed from previous guidance, which also included infection control advice applicable to other settings such as social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands and avoiding touching the face. 
The WHO urged each country to conduct its own risk-benefit analysis before lifting any or all travel restrictions. Authorities should take into account local epidemiology and transmission patterns, it said, as well as national health and social distancing measures already in place. 
Countries that choose to quarantine all travellers on arrival should do so after assessing the risks and consider local circumstances, the WHO said. 
""Countries should continuously plan for and assess their surge capacities for testing, tracking, isolating and managing imported cases and quarantine of contacts,"" it said.

The WHO said this week that international travel bans cannot stay in place indefinitely, and countries will have to do more to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus within their borders.

The Moscow branch of Russia's Investigative Committee, the body that probes serious crimes, said Yulia Galyamina had ""repeatedly violated the established procedure"" for organising and staging protests, rallies and pickets.
It said she would soon be taken in for questioning.
Galyamina was involved in a campaign against what she said were Putin's illegal plans to remain in power. 
The campaign had planned a protest on July 15 in central Moscow against constitutional reforms that gave Putin the option to remain in power for another 16 years. Dozens of protesters were detained at the rally.
A landslide vote this month approved those changes, allowing Putin, who has ruled Russia for more than two decades as president or prime minister, to run for two more presidential terms. 
If found guilty, Galyamina could face a fine or up to five years in jail. 
""It's clear that the case is politically motivated and has been launched with one goal - to pressure me,"" Galyamina wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Members of the campaign released a statement demanding the case against her be dropped immediately.
In Russia, protests of more than one person require the authorities' advance consent. Mass gatherings remain banned in Moscow because of COVID-19 restrictions.

The homes of Galyamina and other opposition activists were searched by law enforcement officials this month ahead of the protest.

TRIPOLI, Lebanon (Reuters) - On the streets of Tripoli, Lebanon's second biggest city and one of its poorest, there are no signs of festivities for Eid al-Adha this year, no decorations or twinkling lights. There's no electricity anyway. 
Only a large billboard welcomes visitors at one of the city's entrances. ""We're broke,"" it says.
The Muslim holiday usually spells large family gatherings replete with mutton cuts, sweets and gifts.
But with Lebanon's economy imploding, leaving many hungry, and fuel shortages causing daily blackouts, there is little to celebrate. Soaring prices mean few can afford Eid traditions.
Many butchers' shops in Tripoli, once buzzing with customers, were closed this week. 
Meat prices are just too high for most people, forcing them to forgo the Eid custom of slaughtering sheep or lambs to share among family and donate to the needy as alms. 
""What Eid? Look around you, does this look like a market at Eid to you? Where are the people?"" said Um Tarek, a mother of five, at the central souk. 
Her husband owns a sweet shop but now barely manages to put food on the table. They will be lucky if they can buy a watermelon for Eid. ""We've only had it once this season,"" she said.
""It used to be that you had to elbow your way in through this market over Eid,"" said Ghazi Arnaout, whose family's shoe shop has been around for six decades. He plans to shut it down after the festival.
Hatem Abulashra, a livestock merchant, had few customers for this year's holiday. The price of a lamb has gone up more than eightfold since last year.
""My farm is full of sheep but there is no one buying. What good is that?"" he said. ""Even my own family is not eating meat.""
For Iman al-Ali, whose blind husband had to sell his vegetable cart, it was already tough to get by before the crisis wiped out the daily manual labour they relied on. 
They had to move with their eight children into the tiny storage room of a building, and nowadays all she can do is hope they don't starve.

""They keep asking me for new clothes,"" she said. ""But we just can't.""

Health experts recommend soap and water for cleaning reusable cloth masks, and 70% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol for proper disinfection.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Worried South Koreans are putting banknotes in their microwaves and washing machines, damaging the bills in their attempts to cleanse them of the coronavirus.
The central bank said on Friday that people had exchanged three times as much burnt money in the past six months as in the same period last year, much of it thought to be from botched efforts to disinfect bills.
A Bank of Korea official told Reuters that the amount of money returned to the bank after being burnt between January and June had risen to 1.32 billion won ($1.1 million) from 480 million ($400,000) in the same period last year.
""There was a considerable amount of bills being burnt in the microwave ovens in the first half of this year,"" the official said, referring to efforts to prevent the coronavirus.
In a statement, the bank said overall a total of 2.69 trillion won worth of damaged notes and coins were destroyed and of that it exchanged 6.5 billion won worth in the first half of 2020.
Besides using microwaves or ovens to heat the bills, some people also put them in their washing machines, the bank said.
In one example given by the bank, a person surnamed Um came in to redeem at least 35.5 million won in notes damaged after he had put them in the washing machine.
Um only recovered 22.9 million won, losing at least 35% of the original money, which he had received as condolence donations for funeral expenses for a family member, the BOK said.
Another case involved a person surnamed Kim, who put 5.2 million won in the microwave to sterilise the money against COVID-19. But the damage was limited so Kim was able to redeem most of the money.
In March, the BOK said it was quarantining bank notes for two weeks to remove any traces of the coronavirus and even burning some as part of efforts to stem the outbreak.

Giving long-range munitions to Japan's Self Defence Forces is a controversial issue for a country that renounced the right to wage war after its defeat in World War Two. The proposal is also likely to anger China and Russia, which could fall within range of any new strike weapons.
""Our country needs to consider ways to strengthen deterrence, including having the capability to halt ballistic missile attacks within the territory of our adversaries,"" the proposal document said.
The proposals, crafted by senior Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers including former defence minister Itsunori Onodera, will be presented to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as early as next week. 
The proposals are ""to stay within the bounds of the constitution and to comply with international law, that has not changed"", Onodera said at a briefing. 
The recommendations will be discussed by Japan's National Security Council, which is expected to finalise new defence policies by the end of September.
Abe has pushed for a more muscular military, arguing Japan needs to respond to a deteriorating security environment in East Asia as North Korea builds missiles and nuclear weapons, China builds a modern, powerful military and Russian forces re-engage in the region.
A strike option is attractive because it is much easier to hit missiles on launch pads than warheads travelling at several times the speed of sound. Finding mobile launchers to hit, however, require close surveillance with satellites that Japan does not currently possess, meaning it would have to rely on help from ally the United States. 
Japan's defence ministry could decide on equipment purchases by the end of the year, government officials told Reuters.
""We will look at the LDP recommendations and consider them thoroughly,"" Minister of Defence Taro Kono said at a regular press briefing.
AEGIS
The ruling party deliberations were prompted by Kono's decision in June to cancel two planned Aegis Ashore sites designed to track and target incoming ballistic missiles from North Korea, citing a risk posed to nearby residents from falling booster rockets and rising costs.
The LDP document included a recommendation that Japan consider how to acquire a defence radar system on a par with  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s Aegis Ashore system that could also track other threats such as drones and cruise missiles.
Among proposals being considered by officials is locating the Aegis Ashore at other ground sites, or putting the new powerful radar on ships. U.S. defence company Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) has been lobbying senior LDP lawmakers with a proposal to choose its SPY-6 radar rather than using Lockheed's system, sources earlier told Reuters..
""The government will make a decision regarding this by the end of September and our thinking will be reflected in that,"" Onodera said. 

North Korea, which has tested missiles over Japanese territory, has held now-stalled talks with the United States aimed at eliminating its nuclear arsenal. It has rejected unilateral disarmament and given no indication that it is willing to go beyond statements of broad support for the concept of universal denuclearisation.

The opposition was hoping to win a historic majority in the Legislative Council, where only half the seats are directly elected and the other half filled mostly by pro-Beijing appointees.
Lam's postponement of the vote comes after 12 pro-democracy candidates were disqualified from running in the poll, for reasons including perceived subversive intentions, opposition to a new security law and campaigning to win a legislation-blocking majority.
Lam, who did not give a new date for the vote except to say it had been postponed for a year, told reporters the decision was the most difficult she had made in seven months.
The decision was aimed at safeguarding people's health, she said.
The poll would have been the former British colony's first official vote since Beijing imposed a new security law in late June, which critics say aims to quash dissent in China's freest city.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a guarantee of autonomy but critics say the new law undermines that promise and puts the territory on a more authoritarian path.
News of the postponement came as the nomination period for candidates seeking to run in the election closed.
Hong Kong has reported more than 3,000 coronavirus cases since January, far lower than in other major cities around the world.
But for the past 10 days running the number of new infections has been in the triple-digits. 
The government has limited gatherings to two people to fight the spread. 
Police have cited such restrictions in rejecting applications for protests in recent months, effectively preventing any major demonstrations.
City authorities have insisted any coronavirus measures are taken for public health reasons and have no political consideration.
Rival finance hub Singapore, which has had a larger coronavirus outbreak, held a general election this month. 
At least 68 countries and territories have delayed national or regional polls due to coronavirus since February, said the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.
While at least 49 countries and territories have decided to hold national or subnational elections, it said.
Supporters of the new security law say it will bring more stability after a year of often-violent anti-government and anti-China unrest and it plugs loopholes in national security left by the city's inability to fulfil a constitutional requirement to pass such laws on its own.

Another constitutional aim is to introduce universal suffrage, the principal demand of last year's protests, but critics say the disqualifications of pro-democracy candidates show Beijing is unwilling to tolerate even some of the moderate, old-guard opposition voices.

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 07:26AM ET</span>",How inequality and poverty undermined South Africa's COVID response,"By Tim Cocks
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - When coronavirus patients started arriving at South Africa's government-run Thelle Mogoerane Hospital, workers scrambled to set up isolation wards to treat them.
They can't keep up. Video filmed inside the hospital and seen by Reuters shows patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, being treated in a general ward, separated from other patients only by curtains.
""There's no space anywhere,"" nurse Rich Sicina said outside the modernist, iron-roofed hospital in a southern Johannesburg township. ""It's a mess.""
Kwara Kekana, spokeswoman for the department of health in Gauteng, the province containing Johannesburg, said that at the beginning of the pandemic, Thelle Mogoerane Hospital had dedicated wards for patients under investigation.
""Once we had a first positive case, a ward was created for confirmed positive cases,"" she said, adding that it strictly followed South Africa's national infection prevention guidelines.
The struggle is what President Cyril Ramaphosa wanted to avoid when he imposed one of the world's toughest lockdowns in late March - when the country had confirmed just 400 cases - to buy health workers time to prepare.
But the measures battered the economy of Africa's most industrialised nation, which was in recession before the pandemic, and Ramaphosa lifted many of them long before infections peaked in order to save livelihoods.
Four months later, South Africa faces a runaway epidemic that has overwhelmed public hospitals in a country where roughly half the population lives below the poverty line, according to the latest government figures from 2015.
With the number of cases approaching 500,000 - more than half of Africa's total and the world's fifth-highest - the country's harsh inequalities appear to have contributed to its undoing, government advisers and independent experts said.
The first cases were wealthy travellers who brought the virus in from Europe, Asia and beyond, they said.
""They could isolate in their mansions,"" said Wolfgang Preiser, a virologist at Stellenbosch University. ""The problem is that these places are maintained by a whole crowd of domestic workers. They were exposed, and they travelled home in (communal) taxis.""
Once the virus reached South Africa's poor, densely populated townships - a legacy of decades of oppressive white minority rule - it spread quickly, said Yunus Moosa, chief infectious disease specialist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and a senior member of the government's COVID-19 advisory panel.
It overwhelmed public hospitals ""already on the brink of collapse"".
Police and soldiers battled to enforce the lockdown in areas where people live in close quarters and depend on daily earnings to eat. Bustling markets in Soweto, Johannesburg's biggest township, were a stark contrast to nearly deserted streets in the city's more affluent suburbs.
Mismanagement and looting of public funds, which have hollowed out public services for years, exacerbated shortages of protective clothing and other supplies at some hospitals, according to both the government and its critics.
Ramaphosa pledged a crackdown, saying on July 23 that authorities were investigating at least 36 corruption allegations in areas including COVID-19 procurement and relief programs.
Other factors were less foreseeable: some epidemiologists think the virus was circulating before it was first detected in the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province in early March, including across the country in the tourist hotspot of Western Cape. 
Global shortages of testing materials undid an ambitious screening policy.
""I understand people might ask if things could have been done better, but honestly, what more could we have done?"" Moosa said. 
""If we had a magic wand we could wave and turn our healthcare system into a world-class one overnight, then we would have done it.""
The World Health Organization says South Africa is a ""wake-up call"" for other African nations, where confirmed infections are lower but climbing.
""South Africa may unfortunately be a precursor, ... a warning for what will happen in the rest of Africa,"" the WHO's top emergencies expert Mike Ryan said.
FROM RICHES TO RAGS
The first cases identified in Johannesburg, the country's biggest city now at the outbreak's epicentre, were concentrated in Sandton, a wealthy northern suburb. 
Provincial officials declined to release case figures for specific suburbs and neighbourhoods that could better explain how the virus spread, but there are clues.
In the greater Soweto area, cases increased 252% this month compared with 200% for the rest of Johannesburg.
Drawing on experience tackling HIV and tuberculosis, the government began screening and testing in communities to catch new infections early.
But the virus spread too swiftly, and there weren't enough personnel or reagents to process so many tests, researchers at two laboratories and Moosa told Reuters. 
Data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases show wait times at public hospitals, the worst hit by shortages, shot up from two days in mid-April to 12 by mid-June, before falling to between four and six days in July.
""That's clearly far, far too long for it to be of any use in terms of preventing spread of infection. Two days is what you need,"" said Richard Lessells, an infectious disease specialist at the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform. 
Officials at the department of health did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment.
Twenty-six years after apartheid ended in 1994, healthcare remains divided between a world class private system for those who can afford it, and an overburdened public one for the mostly Black citizens who cannot. 
Just 17% of South Africans have medical insurance, the latest government figures from 2017 show. But healthcare provider Netcare estimates more than half of the country's 6,000 critical care beds are in private hospitals.
When the first coronavirus cases came to Thelle Mogoerane, on the edge of the mostly black Vosloorus town, southeast of Johannesburg, ""it was pure chaos,"" Sicina said. 
A 30-bed isolation ward was set up in mid-April, but it filled so quickly that 18 critically ill patients were put in a regular casualty ward.
Five more COVID-19 wards have been added since then, but some patients are still spilling over into general wards, Sicina said. Until early May, nurses treated the patients protected only by a surgical mask and apron, he added.
Another nurse corroborated his account; she is not authorized to speak to media and declined to be named.
Kekana said PPE has been available at the hospital since the beginning of the pandemic.
At least eight patients admitted for other complaints caught COVID-19 there, they said, along with 240 staff. Last week, they held a memorial service for two nurses who died.
Kekana said she was not aware of the figure of 240 staff infected, but confirmed a memorial service for one nurse.
The hospital now has the masks, gowns and visors it needs, the nurses said. But shortages persist at other facilities, said Sibongiseni Delihlazo, spokesman for the main nurses' union, the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa. 
A nurse at Bisho Hospital, in the more rural Eastern Cape province, said patients were getting just 30 minutes of oxygen at a time because there weren't enough access points.
Nurses sometimes filled balloons with oxygen for the sickest patients, she said, on condition of anonymity.
The hospital and provincial health department did not respond to requests for comment.
The government has recruited health workers and is building field hospitals with partners to accommodate the overflow. It has also negotiated with private providers to take public patients if needed.
Private hospitals, though under strain, have fared better, said Charl van Loggerenberg, head of emergency medicine at private provider Life Healthcare, by putting in ""big orders for PPE"" and training extra nurses. 

But he added, ""it isn't the world class super centres that are dealing with the public health pandemic. It's the places in the trenches.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss court has convicted a banker for failing to sound the alarm over millions of dollars linked to scandal-tainted Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.
The Federal Criminal Court said on Friday it had found the banker guilty of violating requirements to report suspicious transactions and fined him 50,000 Swiss francs ($55,000) plus court costs.
The ruling may be appealed. 
The former anti-money-laundering executive at private bankCoutts & Co Ltd had denied any wrongdoing. Reuters is not naming him due to Swiss laws on privacy in court proceedings. Swiss markets watchdog FINMA in 2017 ordered Coutts to pay6.5 million Swiss francs for breaching money-laundering regulations in its business linked to 1MDB, but dropped its own proceedings against the executive.
FINMA's investigation found that between 2009 and 2015assets worth $2.4 billion moved through accounts at Coutts,which was founded in the 18th century and is best known asbanker to Britain's Queen Elizabeth. 
The Swiss indictment had detailed warnings from Coutts colleagues about transactions by Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, the Malaysian businessman tied to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fund, which was set up in 2009 by the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.
In Malaysia, Najib was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to 12 years in jail on Tuesday in the first trial over the multi-billion-dollar scandal at 1MDB that stretched to the Gulf states and Hollywood.
Low has denied any wrongdoing, saying in January that he acted only as an intermediary for deals involving 1MDB. 
U.S. justice officials estimate $4.5 billion was siphonedout of Malaysia by high-level fund officials and associatesbetween 2009 and 2014, and laundered through countries includingthe United States, Switzerland, Singapore and Luxembourg.

QUIBERON, France (Reuters) - The Hacienda bar in this French seaside resort was heaving with Saturday night revellers: a crowd of people, beer glasses and smartphones in hand, moving to the sounds of pop and hip-hop music as red and blue strobe lights flashed.
The scenes in the bar in northwest France in mid-July were captured in mobile phone footage. Reuters could not independently verify the video, but health officials said the dancing that evening breached hygiene rules and one person present described it as too full.
One of the people there was a 19-year-old student working a summer job on the bakery counter in a supermarket.
He had a headache and left early. Three days later, on July 21, the student was diagnosed with COVID-19.
Over the following days, dozens of his friends, many of them regulars at the Hacienda, tested positive. Public health officials said that as of Wednesday they had traced 72 positive cases back to the student and his circle of friends.
Public health authorities closed the bar, shut the nearby beach from 9:00 p.m. nightly, set up a campaign of mass testing and appealed to young people to rein in their socialising.
""They want to party,"" said Patrice Faure, the prefect of the region who ordered the Hacienda shut for two months when contact tracers connected the COVID-19 cases to the bar.
The outbreak at the Hacienda is an example a phenomenon that is being repeated across Europe.
After COVID-19 infection rates were driven down by months of strict lockdown, hotspots of infection are starting to emerge.
PARTIES AMID PANDEMIC
Several of the clusters - from Barcelona to northern France and Germany - were in vacation spots favoured by young people letting their hair down for the summer.
Battling a resurgence in new coronavirus cases, Spain's regions have imposed a patchwork of restrictions on nightlife, ranging from socially-distanced dance floors to curfews and attendance limits.
Hard-hit Catalonia, home to the famed nightspots of Barcelona, last week closed nightclubs, told bars in dozens of municipalities to shut at midnight and introduced fines of up to 15,000 euros for youngsters participating in outdoor ""botellon"" parties.
Although the number of outbreaks linked to discos is relatively low, Spanish authorities want to clamp down on parties as the number of cases linked to each outbreak is high.
Health ministry data on Thursday showed 30 active clusters linked to nightlife accounted for 1,100 cases, while family gatherings were responsible for 90 clusters but just 770 infections.
In Germany, cities and police are trying to battle open-air parties in public parks and squares as dancing in night clubs and big public gatherings remain illegal in most places.
The city-state of Hamburg has banned the sale of alcohol in stores and kiosks after 8 p.m. to cut down on dense crowds of revellers in the streets.
In Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, 39 people were arrested after late-night clashes with police earlier this month, and in Berlin police broke up an illegal rave involving around 3,000 people in a public park last weekend.
The phenomenon has given rise to fears of a second wave of the disease sweeping Europe, hurting an already fragile economic recovery.
QUARANTINE
In the week before he took ill, the 19-year-old at the centre of the outbreak in Quiberon had been at the Hacienda every night. Earlier in the week, it was not busy, but by Saturday it was packed.
""There were a few too many people,"" said the student, who asked not to be identified because he feared being stigmatised for his role in the outbreak.
Earlier on Saturday, he had a headache, which he attributed to a migraine. He took some paracetamol, and went to the bar, but said he left before midnight. By Monday, still feeling unwell, he went to his doctor, who referred him to a hospital.
He was tested for COVID, and received a positive result on Tuesday morning. Public health officials quarantined him in an apartment.
The student told Reuters that he had tried to abide by health guidelines by socialising with the same group of people throughout his stay in Quiberon.
Faure, the prefect, said the Hacienda was illegally running a discotheque, banned under COVID restrictions.
Eric Adami, the bar's manager, said he thought he was doing nothing wrong, and that other bars in Quiberon were operating the same way, yet were not punished.
""We got caught,"" he said in a brief telephone interview. ""My morale is at zero.""
YOUTH CULTURE
In France, the daily number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases is running at its highest level since May, though still well short of the peak of the virus.
The biggest rise in new cases is among people in the 15-44 age range. Six weeks ago, 4 people per 100,000 in this category were infected; now it is double that.
The number of people seriously ill or dying continues to fall. Young people are less likely to have serious symptoms. 
Still, young people - if they don't follow social distancing advice - could get infected and contaminate older, more vulnerable relatives, public health officials say.
""One of the challenges we face is convincing younger people of this risk,"" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news briefing in Geneva this week.
""We have said it before and we'll say it again: young people are not invincible. Young people can be infected; young people can die; and young people can transmit the virus to others.""
The man at the centre of the Hacienda cluster was released from quarantine earlier this week. 
On Tuesday evening he was at the caravan where he stays through the summer, dressed in a mask, shorts and a T-shirt. He was gathering belongings before heading to stay with his parents, in a city 150 km away, for a week.
He said he wanted to get away from Quiberon where, he said, he and his friends were being blamed unfairly for the outbreak even though they broke no law.

Recalling the Saturday night when he went to the Hacienda with symptoms of what later turned out to be COVID-19, he said: ""I didn't want to do harm, I just wanted to live a bit.""

Russia a day earlier demanded an explanation over what it called Minsk's wrongful arrest of the group, an incident that risks worsening already strained relations between Belarus and traditional ally Moscow.
Belarus this week detained the group of Russian men near the capital Minsk, saying it had received information that over 200 fighters had entered the country to destabilise it before an Aug. 9 presidential election.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that the men were travelling to another country via Belarus and had nothing to do with Belarusian politics.

""The baseless arrest of Russian citizens, 33 citizens, is not quite in line with our relationship as allies,"" Peskov told reporters on a conference call. ""This is why we hope that our Belarusian allies will clarify this incident in the nearest future and that our citizens will be released.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Documents about dealings between Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein were publicly released on Thursday by a U.S. court, where the British socialite faces criminal charges she aided the late financier's sexual abuse of girls.
Among the materials released were email correspondence between the pair in early 2015, including an email in which Epstein told Maxwell she had ""done nothing wrong.""
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska had ordered the documents' release by Thursday, saying the public's right to see them outweighed Maxwell's interests in keeping them under seal.
However, two depositions remain under seal after Maxwell filed an emergency motion with the federal appeals court in Manhattan earlier on Thursday to keep them from becoming public.
That court has yet to rule, and the depositions will remain sealed until at least Monday.
Lawyers for Maxwell have said that in one of those depositions, filed in April 2016, Maxwell was asked ""intrusive"" questions concerning her sex life, and that its release could make it ""difficult if not impossible"" to get a fair trial.
The second is a deposition by an unnamed Epstein accuser.
Lawyers for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment after the documents were unsealed. 
The cache of documents released on Thursday and the depositions that remain under wraps were part of a now-settled 2015 civil defamation lawsuit against Maxwell by Virginia Giuffre, who said she was underage when Epstein kept her as a ""sex slave"" with Maxwell's assistance. 
A lawyer for Giuffre did not immediately respond to a similar request.
Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and eventually abuse three girls from 1994 to 1997, and committing perjury by denying her involvement under oath.
She was arrested on July 2 at a home in New Hampshire where prosecutors said she had been hiding out.
Maxwell has been held in a Brooklyn jail after a judge denied bail, calling her a flight risk. Her criminal trial is scheduled for next July.
Epstein was found hanged at age 66 last August in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges for abusing women and girls in Manhattan and Florida from 2002 to 2005. He had also pleaded not guilty.
CORRESPONDENCE
Pending appeals by Maxwell, Preska had ordered the release of more than 80 documents in all, including flight logs from Epstein's private jets; and police reports from Palm Beach, Florida, where Epstein had a home.
Among the materials released on Thursday were January 2015 emails between Epstein and Maxwell, who were identified respectively as ""jeffrey E"" and either ""Gmax"" or ""G Maxwell.""
""You have done nothing wrong and i woudl (sic) urge you to start acting like it,"" Epstein wrote on Jan. 25, 2015. ""go outside, head high, not as an esacping (sic) convict. go to parties. deal with it.""
Epstein sent the email a day after Maxwell said she would appreciate it if another woman, identified by a single name only, ""would come out and say she was your g'friend - I think she was from end 99 to 2002.""
Maxwell's lawyers have sought to distance their client from Epstein in their unsuccessful effort to win bail.
In a July 10 bail request, the lawyers said the media had shifted their focus to Maxwell following Epstein's death, ""wrongly trying to substitute her for Epstein-even though she'd had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade,"" had never been charged with a crime or been found liable in civil litigation, and had always denied allegations of misconduct.

Other unsealed materials included emails from Giuffre to the FBI in 2014, including when she expressed interest to the FBI in pursuing a case against Epstein and proving ""how much pedophilia occurred by Jeffrey and the many other monsters he obliged w (sic) underage girls.""

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Friday that its first round of talks with Iran about the downing of a Ukrainian airliner shortly after takeoff in Tehran in January had been constructive, and that it was determined ""to bring Iran to justice"".
All 176 people on board - including 57 Canadians - were killed when Iranian forces struck the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 jet. Iran said they mistook the passenger plane for a missile at a time of high tensions with the United States.
""The talks ended late last night. The talks lasted 11 hours. In general, they were constructive,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a video briefing after meeting with an Iranian delegation.
Kuleba said the sides had agreed the terms of next round of talks and that Kyiv would not allow anyone to drag out the negotiations.
Later on Friday, the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office said the next round was set for October.
""Of course, if the negotiations with Iran are unsuccessful, then we will go to international courts and I have absolutely no doubt that we will bring Iran to justice. But this is plan B,"" Kuleba said.
""And plan A is negotiations with Iran and the solution of all these issues and the payment of compensation. We saw Iran was disposed to a serious and substantive conversation,"" he said.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in February that Ukraine was not satisfied with the size of compensation Iran had offered to families of Ukrainians killed in the incident and Kuleba said on Thursday that Ukraine would make every effort to maximise compensations.

An international team has started examining the black box flight recorders from the plane. A senior Ukrainian diplomat said last week that the transcript from the black box showed there had been illegal interference with the plane.

The seven-day average of new coronavirus infections in France has moved above 1,000 per day for the first time since the first half of May, when France began lifting a nationwide lockdown. Officials hope local measures can prevent a second wave of infections without disruptive nationwide action.
Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Twitter that the decision to impose a mask mandate ""can be taken locally, depending on the situation of the epidemic in each region"".
The government official responsible for Lille announced that wearing face masks would become compulsory from Monday in pedestrian areas and parks in the city, which lies near Belgium.
French health authorities reported 1,377 additional confirmed cases of the new coronavirus on Thursday, bringing the total to 186,573.

The rise in infections in France follows an earlier surge in Spain, adding to concern that Europe could be headed for a second wave.

PALERMO, Italy (Reuters) - At 96, Giuseppe Paterno has faced many tests in life - childhood poverty, war and, more recently, the coronavirus pandemic. Now he has sailed through an exam that makes him Italy's oldest university graduate.
This week, the former railway worker stepped forward to receive his diploma and the traditional laurel wreath awarded to Italian students when they graduate, applauded by his family, teachers and fellow students more than 70 years his junior.
""I am a normal person, like many others,"" he said, when asked what it felt like to be graduating so late. ""In terms of age I have surpassed all the others but I didn't do it for this.""
Already in his 90s when he enrolled for a degree in History and Philosophy at the University of Palermo, Paterno grew up loving books, but he never had the chance to study.
""I said, 'that's it, now or never,' and so in 2017, I decided to enrol,"" he told Reuters in his apartment in the Sicilian city of Palermo, which he rarely leaves nowadays due to his frailty.
""I understood that it was a little late to get a three-year degree but I said to myself 'let's see if I can do it'.""
On Wednesday, he graduated first in his class with top honours, receiving congratulations from the university chancellor Fabrizio Micari.
GREAT DEPRESSION, THEN WAR
Growing up in a poor family in Sicily in the years before the Great Depression, Paterno received only basic schooling as a child. He joined the navy and served during World War Two before going on to work in the railways as he married and brought up two children.
In a society focused on rebuilding after the war, work and family were the priorities, but Paterno wanted to learn and graduated from high school at the age of 31, always harbouring a desire to go further.
""Knowledge is like a suitcase that I carry with me, it is a treasure,"" he said.
As a student, he tapped out his essays on the manual typewriter his mother gave him when he retired from the railways in 1984. He eschewed Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in favour of printed books and was not tempted by the late-night student parties of his 20-year-old classmates, who applauded him warmly at the graduation ceremony.
""You are an example for younger students,"" his Sociology professor, Francesca Rizzuto, told him after he passed his final oral examination in June.
Paterno confessed to a little unease with the video calls that replaced classroom teaching during the coronavirus shutdown, but said he was not put off by the disease itself after the war and everything else he had been through.
""All of that strengthened us, all of my peer group, all of those who are still alive,"" he said. ""It didn't really scare us that much.""
As for what he planned to do next, he said he was not about to stop now he had graduated.

""My project for the future is to devote myself to writing; I want to revisit all the texts I didn't have a chance to explore further. This is my goal.""

The artillery fire came after clashes between Pakistani and Afghan security forces at the closed Chaman-Spin Boldak border crossing, where crowds on both sides were waiting to cross for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha.
""If the Pakistani military continues its rocket attacks on Afghan territory, they will face retaliation by the Afghan army,"" Afghanistan's defence ministry said in a statement. 
Pakistan's foreign office and military did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, but Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told reporters that the matter had been taken up with Afghan authorities and hoped it would be resolved amicably.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are both U.S. allies but their relations have rarely been close.
Afghanistan has for years accused Pakistan of supporting Taliban militants. Pakistan denies doing so and in turn accuses Afghanistan of supporting militants fighting the Pakistani government.
The governor of the southeastern Afghan province of Kandahar, Hayatullah Hayat, said the shells fell in residential areas of Spin Boldak and that women and children were among the 15 dead and 80 wounded.
Hospital officials in Pakistan told Reuters three bodies and 20 people suffering bullet wounds had been brought after the clashes between protesters and security forces.
They exchanged fire when crowds waiting to cross into Afghanistan became unruly and attacked Pakistani installations, a Pakistani official said. 
The crossing, mostly closed to pedestrians during the COVID-19 pandemic, was briefly opened on Wednesday and was to open again Thursday to allow nationals of both countries to cross for Eid, which falls on Friday in Afghanistan and Saturday in Pakistan.
When it did not open, a large crowd gathered to protest, and a quarantine centre and a Pakistani government facility for processing movement at the crossing were burned down, a Pakistani official at the border told Reuters. 
An official of the Chaman administration, Zakaullah Durrani, told Reuters that the situation on the border remained tense.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - For 23 years Hong Kong was an anomaly. 
A free and partially democratic city under Chinese rule, protected by a tradition of firm rule of law from the British colonial era, and a promise from Beijing of freedoms for its 7.5 million people that were unthinkable on the mainland. 
On June 30, however, China imposed a harsh new paradigm on Hong Kong, marking an end to the liberal pledge, say government, political and diplomatic sources.
The national security legislation imposed by Beijing was a response to last year's protracted protests, that were preceded by years of smouldering discontent at what many Hong Kong people saw as China's creeping erosion of the city's freedoms.
The legislation has been enacted ostensibly to tackle terrorism, collusion with foreign powers, secession and subversion. But its 66 articles carry far deeper implications for Hong Kong.
China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said the law would be a ""sharp sword"" hanging over the heads of a ""tiny number of people"" endangering national security.
At the same time, the law would be a ""guardian"" of the rights, freedoms and peaceful lives of the rest of Hong Kong's people, the office under China's State Council said.
The legislation has already had a significant impact on the financial hub as the city government responds to it, at times with China's involvement. 
A Hong Kong government source familiar with Beijing's thinking said the law may have shocked many people but it had spelt out China's limits on what is tolerable and not: a political reality people must accept.
""It's no longer the old era,"" the government source said.
""The bottom line is much worse than we expected and people are shocked. But in terms of China's political bottom line, the situation is clearer now. No one has to guess any more.""
The law has brought a chill and the pulling of pro-democracy books from library shelves, disqualifications of democrats from a city election and the arrests of three teenagers for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts deemed secessionist.
New arms of China's state security apparatus have been set up, including a National Security Office in a leafy neighbourhood on Hong Kong island. 
In a few flare-ups of opposition to the law, protesters have been arrested for once legal banners and for shouting slogans now labelled subversive.
'ONLY THE START'
Foreign governments and rights groups describe the law in bleak terms: an assault on Western-style freedoms and a de facto dismantling of the ""one country, two systems"" formula that has underpinned Hong Kong's role as one of the world's financial centres.
China's Communist Party leaders have a starkly different view at a time of growing tension with the United States, seeing the restoration of order and the snuffing out of foreign meddling in the city as a priority.
The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office called the law a ""milestone"" and a ""turning point"" for Hong Kong to end chaos.
Some Asian and Western diplomats say they have been surprised by the law's reach and the speed at which it is changing Hong Kong.
""At a stroke it has shattered all the assumptions governing Hong Kong's place in the world as essentially a free, open and well-administered city,"" said a Western envoy.
""The overreach has been startling and many of us fear this is only the start.""
Another government source who declined to be identified said more of Beijing's red lines would soon be revealed through its unrelenting ""white-knuckle"" grip on the city.
Chinese authorities are no longer restricted in their reach and can intervene in city affairs when they wish. The law can circumvent all local laws. 
The new National Security Office enjoys investigative and enforcement powers and may make ""proposals on major strategies and important policies for safeguarding national security"".
RISKS
Running parallel with the legislation is a Beijing agenda to instil greater patriotism in Hong Kong and to address longstanding thorns in its side, including the city's free press, rights groups and the opposition, activists say.
For a timeline of the national security law, click 
But there are risks for Beijing.
International pressure has grown, and a few Western countries have offered passports to Hong Kong people, drawing China's ire and raising the risk of a brain-drain.
Some businesses are recalibrating their perceptions of Hong Kong, partly because of client and data confidentiality concerns given new powers under the law of surveillance, the freezing of assets and demands for information.
Hong Kong's financial markets have been largely positive though the U.S. withdrawal of Hong Kong's preferential trading status in response to the law will weigh economically. 
The quelling of open dissent and the scrubbing of social media accounts do not mean convictions have changed, some say.
""If I fall back, if I quit, that means the regime wins,"" said activist Sunny Cheung.

""This is not just something very intangible or ontological ... We should try everything we can to protect the distinctiveness, the identity, the values of Hong Kong.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Young Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong said on Friday his ""invalid and ridiculous"" disqualification as a candidate in elections for the legislature would not stop the fight for democracy in the Chinese-ruled city.
The Hong Kong government on Thursday barred Wong and 11 other pro-democracy activists from the elections due in September, citing reasons including collusion with foreign forces, subversive intentions, opposition to a new security law and campaigning for a legislation-blocking majority.
The disqualifications were the most sweeping move yet on the city's electoral freedoms following Beijing's imposition of a security law last month which many Western nations say erodes citizens rights.
Wong, who China calls a ""black hand"" of foreign forces, said in a statement the security law was an ""legal weapon used against dissidents"".
""Barring me from running ... would not stop our cause for democracy,"" said Wong, 23, who became an international figure leading months-long protests in Hong Kong as a teenager in 2012 and 2014.
Beijing imposed the new law on the global financial hub to give police and new mainland Chinese security agents wide-ranging powers beyond the scrutiny of courts, in some cases, and set its freest city on a more authoritarian path.
Critics say it crushes rights and freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, while supporters say it will restore stability after a year of often-violent anti-establishment protests.
Along with Wong, authorities disqualified some members of the Civic Party, a moderate, old-guard opposition group, and others who won an unofficial ""primary"" vote held by the opposition camp this month.
That independently organised vote saw a younger, more defiant generation of democrats taking over the helm of the opposition, but the Civic Party disqualifications signal Beijing is becoming less tolerant of even moderate voices.
Chances for an historic majority in the Legislative Council, or mini-parliament, for the opposition camp will take a further blow if the government decides to postpone the Sept. 6 vote, as expected, amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The government denied ""political censorship, restriction of freedom of speech or deprivation of the right to stand for elections"" and said there could be more disqualifications.
It said it was merely upholding the Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution, and the candidates' behaviour was inconsistent with it. 

Britain said it was clear the candidates had been barred because of their political views. Hong Kong's last British governor Chris Patten called it an ""outrageous political purge"".

President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is under pressure to revive a stricken economy, has said the protests constitute an ""insurrection"" by the opposition.
In central Harare and nearby Mbare township - a hotbed of past protests - businesses, including banks and supermarkets, were shut as police and soldiers patrolled the streets.
""Workers were told not to come today just in case there was trouble,"" said a security guard, who identified himself as Martin, having a meal of tea and sweet potatoes at a bank. 
Security forces increased check points on roads leading into central Harare.
A journalist in the second biggest city Bulawayo said businesses were also closed with few cars on the road.
Scores were killed during a crackdown on the last major protests in January 2019 and the government shut the internet. 
Zimbabwe's worst economic crisis in more than a decade is marked by inflation running above 700%, acute shortages of foreign currency and public hospitals crippled by strikes and a lack of medicine.
Critics say Mnangagwa is exploiting a COVID-19 lockdown to stifle dissent. Mnangagwa imposed an overnight curfew and restricted free movement last week to curb coronavirus infections.

The president's opponents say he has failed to unite a deeply divided nation after much hope when he took over from Robert Mugabe, who was removed in a coup in 2017. Mnangagwa, like Mugabe before him, says the economic crisis is the result of sabotage by businesses and an opposition funded by the West.

Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, was a favoured destination for Soviet workers' state-funded holidays and now attracts a steady influx of Russian tourists.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - The infamous bus that served as the final campsite for doomed adventurer Christopher McCandless could be preserved as a museum piece under a plan announced on Thursday by Alaska officials.
The University of Alaska Museum in Fairbanks has offered to house the bus, removed by the state last month from its six-decades-long resting site near Denali National Park.
The 1940s-era bus had been an attraction for fans of the 1996 book “Into the Wild” and the 2007 movie of the same name. Over the years, hundreds trekked out to spend time at the abandoned bus, where McCandless spent 114 days before dying of starvation in 1992.
Many of those making pilgrimages to the site put themselves at risk, prompting the state to airlift the bus from the trail made famous by the 24-year-old McCandless.
Two hikers drowned during river crossings. Others have been rescued after becoming injured or stranded. In February, five Italian tourists, one with frostbitten feet, were rescued, and in April a stranded Brazilian tourist was helicoptered out.
The museum’s offer allows the state to memorialize all those who took shelter in the bus while avoiding the “specter of profiteering” from tragedy, Corri Feige, Alaska’s natural resources commissioner, said in a statement.

""I believe that giving Bus 142 a long-term home in Fairbanks at the UA Museum of the North can help preserve and tell the stories of all these people,” Feige said. “It can honor all of the lives and dreams, as well as the deaths and sorrows associated with the bus, and do so with respect and dignity.""

UK tightens lockdown in northern England,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain imposed a tougher lockdown in swathes of northern England after a rise in the rate of novel coronavirus transmission, raising concerns that a second wave of the deadly virus could sow yet more turmoil.
Britain reported its highest number of new COVID-19 infections in more than a month on Thursday, as ministers fretted about a second wave of cases in Europe and warned more quarantine restrictions were possible.
Around 4 million people were ordered not to mix with other households in Greater Manchester, the biggest city in northern England, parts of West Yorkshire and East Lancashire, though they can still go to the pub and to work.
""The problem with this virus is that it thrives on the social contact which makes life worth living,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky. ""I totally understand the human impact of this but unfortunately that is how the virus passes on."" 
""We can see that second wave in Europe,"" Hancock said.
Asked by the BBC if the UK was now entering a second wave, Hancock said: ""It is not yet and we are absolutely determined to take the action that is needed."" 
The measures were introduced hastily at the start of the annual Muslim Eid al-Adha ""feast of sacrifice"". 
People in the areas affected were told not to socialise with other households at home or in gardens, or to meet with other households in pubs, restaurants, cafes, shops, places of worship or leisure venues.
But people are allowed to attend a pub, church or mosque with members of their own household. Those breaking the rules will face a fine of 100 pounds.

Official data showed 846 new positive tests in Britain - the highest number of daily infections since June 28.

Dubbed ""Mr. Democracy"" for ushering freewheeling pluralism and defying China's drive to absorb an island it regards as a wayward province, Lee died late on Thursday aged 97 in Taipei.
Vice President William Lai will lead a committee to organise the funeral and the government has ordered flags to fly at half mast across the island.
A venue will be set up for the public to pay their respects in Taipei, the Presidential Office said. The date of the funeral has not been decided, it said.
""We want to show our respect to former president Lee, who ushered the country's new era of democracy and pluralism,"" Presidential Office spokesman Alex Huang told reporters.
World leaders offered condolences, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe praising Lee for laying Taiwan's foundation for liberty as well as boosting Japan-Taiwan relations.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Lee a crucial player in transforming Taiwan into a ""beacon of democracy"".
""We will honour President Lee's legacy by continuing to strengthen our bond with Taiwan and its vibrant democracy,"" he said in a statement.
Responding to Lee's death, Zhu Fenglian, spokeswoman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, in a statement said Taiwan independence is a ""dead end"" and national unification is ""unstoppable"".
Widely read Chinese state-backed tabloid the Global Times labelled Lee a ""traitor"" for being the ""godfather of Taiwan secessionism"". 
""Lee's death is definitely not sad news to most people in the Chinese mainland,"" the newspaper published in an opinion piece late on Thursday. 
""His image as a national sinner will never be changed in the history of China, and the separatists of the island can never change the historic trend that Taiwan will eventually be reunified with the mainland.""
Lee's greatest act of defiance was becoming Taiwan's first democratically elected president in 1996, achieved with a landslide vote following eight months of intimidating war games by Beijing in waters around the island.

Beijing has not renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control and has stepped up threatening military activity near the island in recent months.

Operation Burnham, carried out by New Zealand troops and allied forces in Afghanistan's Tirgiran Valley on Aug. 21-22, 2010, resulted in civilian casualties, according to the book ""Hit & Run"" by Nicky Hager and Jon Stephenson.
The New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) said for years reports of civilian casualties were baseless but on Friday Defence Force Chief Air Marshal Kevin Short said there had been ""organisational and administrative failings"".
""NZDF acknowledges and regrets these mistakes,"" Short said in a statement.
The investigators said in the report it was likely a girl died as a result of the operation. 
At least seven men were killed, three of whom were identified as insurgents, and there was evidence linking two others to the insurgent group, the report said.
The enquiry was unable to determine whether the two other people killed were insurgents or civilians.
At least six civilians were wounded.
It found that troops operated with proper authorisation, and only one of those killed was shot by a New Zealand soldier. 
""While there was no organised institutional strategy to cover up civilian casualties, between 2010 and 2017 NZDF made a series of incorrect and misleading statements in briefings to ministers and in public statements, to the effect that the allegations of civilian casualties had been investigated and found to be 'baseless' or 'unfounded',"" the report said.
NZDF also failed to adequately remedy its incorrect statements and advice, even after it knew they were wrong, the report said, adding that NZDF personnel edited out of reports from Afghanistan that there may have been civilian casualties.
The report also found that one insurgent was tortured after he was handed over to Afghan custody, but senior leaders in New Zealand were not briefed, nor were any further steps taken.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian Muslims, wearing face masks and getting temperature checks as a precaution against the novel coronavirus, performed morning prayers on Friday to celebrate the festival of Eid al-Adha in mosques with reduced capacity as well as on the streets. 
As the world's biggest Muslim-majority country struggles to contain the spread of the virus, worshippers were advised to maintain social distancing during the prayers.
Indonesia's religious ministry also asked mosques to shorten the gatherings this year, while many mosques cancelled the traditional ceremony when livestock is slaughtered and meat distributed to the community.
Instead the donated sheep, goats and cows will be killed in abattoirs to mark the 'Feast of the Sacrifice', celebrated by Muslims around the world to commemorate Prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Ismail at God's command.
""This year's Eid al-Adha is very different from the previous years because we need to follow health protocols as we perform prayers, like maintaining social distancing,"" said Devita Ilhami, 30, who was at the Sunda Kelapa mosque in Jakarta.
She also noted there were fewer people attending prayers this year and they had to bring their own prayer mats, with markers on the ground to show where they should be laid.
Health experts have been concerned about the risks of the coronavirus being spread during such religious festivals, when Muslims typically gather in mosques and homes, or travel to their home towns.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday urged Muslims in his country celebrating Eid al-Adha to stay away from big gatherings.

An outbreak in the state of Victoria has been partly linked to family gatherings after the holy fasting month of Ramadan.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Police have been ordered onto the streets of an Indian town where Hindu groups will next week begin building a temple on a site contested by Muslims for decades in a dispute that has sparked some of the country's most bloody communal violence.
The Supreme Court of India ruled last year that Hindus, who believe the site in the northern town of Ayodhya is the birthplace of Lord Ram, a physical incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, be allowed to build a temple there.
Hindus say the site was holy for them long before the Muslim Mughals, India's most prominent Islamic rulers, built the Babri Mosque there in 1528. The court said Muslims be given another plot of land for a mosque.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose ruling Bharatiya Janata Party campaigned for more than three decades for the temple, has been invited to lay the temple's foundation stone on Aug. 5, officials said.
""But his visit depends on the pandemic situation and security concerns around it,"" said a senior official in Modi's office in New Delhi, referring to the novel coronavirus.
""Social distancing rules will be followed,"" said the official, who declined to be identified as he is not an authorised spokesman.
In 1992, a Hindu mob destroyed the 16th-century mosque on the site, triggering riots in which about 2,000 people, most of them Muslims, were killed across the country.
Court battles over the ownership of the site followed.
Since the court ruling last year, tension has eased and Muslims, who make up about 12% overwhelmingly Hindu India, have largely accepted the decision.
""We've accepted that Hindu temple will be built and there's no point in creating tension,"" said Shakib Noor, a member of a Muslim religious board in Ayodhya
Nevertheless, authorities in Ayodhya have ordered police to patrol the streets and for barricades to be set up to prevent big crowds gathering next week.
While India has ended its most coronavirus restrictions, it has maintained a ban on religious gatherings.
Donations for the temple have poured in from Hindus in India and abroad. It should be finished by 2022, its supporters say.

""This is a great moment for the entire Hindu community,"" said Sharad Sharma, a senior member of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a hardline Hindu group involved in the temple's construction.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Global social distancing rules targeting coronavirus have pushed influenza infection rates to a record low, early figures show, signalling that the measures are having an unprecedented impact on other communicable diseases. 
In China, where the earliest wide-scale lockdown measures began, new reports of diseases including mumps, measles and some sexually transmitted diseases, have declined significantly, though influenza cases have seen the sharpest drop off. 
Infections reported monthly by the county's health ministry have dropped by over 90% since the beginning of the lockdown, from an average of around 290,000 cases a month to 23,000.
Canada's flu surveillance system also reported ""exceptionally low levels"" of influenza in a recent report, as did other countries that report weekly flu surveillance statistics including the UK and Australia. 
In its most recent weekly report, South Korea's infectious disease portal reported an 83% decrease in cases from the same period a year earlier.
""We've seen the lowest ever rates of other viral infection admissions for this time of year,"" said Ben Marais, an expert in infectious disease at the University of Sydney and clinician at the children's unit at Westmead Hospital. 
""We normally have wards full of children with wheezy chests at this time of year, in winter…but this year the wards are essentially empty,"" he said. 
The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates there are some 3-5 million severe illnesses and up to 500,000 deaths annually linked to seasonal influenza globally.
PASSED US BY
While experts say the drop in influenza infections has reduced the strain on healthcare systems and lowered the number of influenza fatalities, there's also concern that the unprecedented drop in cases could have a negative impact on immunity levels in following seasons. 
""It may be that if we don't have infections this season there will be more vulnerable people next season, that is definitely something that we will have to carefully monitor,"" said Marais. ""This season passed us by, it seems.""
Lower numbers of some infectious diseases could also be linked to reduced reporting rates. 
The WHO said in a recent report that influenza surveillance figures should be ""interpreted with caution,"" due to the limited capacity for reporting in some countries during the pandemic. 
The impact of the lockdown on other diseases with a longer onset period, including HIV and Tuberculosis, may not be clear for years to come. 
In China, new cases of mumps dropped by around 70% and measles by over 90% since the lockdown.
There was an average of around 7,500 gonorrhoea cases reported per month since the lockdown, down from 12,100 a month in 2019. 

Hepatitis, which last year infected some 1.2 million Chinese people according to the reporting system, was down by over 20% in the same period.

The statement did not detail how many individuals the program aims to help, or how many hotel rooms will be made available in Mexico.

Nearly 19,000 formal domestic violence complaints were filed in Mexico in June, up from around 15,000 in April, according to government data, though the complaints are widely believed to undercount the true number of incidents.

Victoria, whose capital Melbourne is under a reimposed six-week lockdown, reported 627 new infections on Friday, down from a record of 723 new infections on Thursday. Eight people died, including two men in their fifties, down from a record of 14 also recorded on Thursday.
The state now accounts for more than half of the country's 198 deaths from the novel coronavirus and about 60% of the nation's 16,900 cases. The majority of Victoria's fresh cases are in Melbourne, Australia's second biggest city.
""It is clear to all of us that these numbers are still far too high,"" Premier Daniel Andrews told a media conference. 
""It may well be the case...that we need to take further steps. The data will tell us, the experts will tell us, what and if any next steps need to be.""
Australian Defence Force and health officials are door-knocking every positive COVID-19 case in the state but have found one in four people not at home. Those people have been referred to police, and may face a A$1,652 ($1,190) fine. 
""If you have got this virus, you've got to stay at home,"" Andrews said. 
Victoria, which is due to come out of lockdown on August 19, is embarking on detailed analysis of transmission trends which will guide any new restrictions. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged the larger spike in cases in Melbourne remained a challenge, although added he was confident a coronavirus flare-up in Sydney, the country's biggest city, was under control.
""The level of community outbreak and community transmission in Victoria is the great challenge down there,"" Morrison said on 2GB radio. ""And there's still a lot of work to do and we're not on top of it yet.""
Morrison said New South Wales had contained the spread of the virus from outbreaks at pubs, restaurants and aged care homes around Sydney thanks mainly to much better contact tracing than in Victoria. New South Wales recorded 21 new cases overnight.
""The key difference is that in New South Wales ... there are no cases that have an unknown source. None,"" he said, noting that Victoria has had around 50 cases a day with no known source.
Morrison urged Muslims who will be celebrating the Eid al-Adha festival starting on Friday to stay away from big gatherings. Some of Victoria's outbreaks since June have been linked to family gatherings after the holy fasting month of Ramadan.

""At times like this, it's even more important that we don't gather in those large groups, that as important as faith is, that we really do think of the health issues here,"" he said.

""The crisis threatens to destroy the livelihoods of Southeast Asia's 218 million informal workers,"" a U.N. policy brief released on Thursday said.
""Without alternative income, formal social protection systems or savings to buffer these shocks, workers and their families will be pushed into poverty, reversing decades of poverty reduction.""
The region-wide economy was expected to contract by 0.4 per cent in 2020, it said, while remittances from Southeast Asians working abroad were likely to fall by 13 per cent or $10 billion.
The paper urged nations to fix ""fiscal termites"": budget-sapping problems like tax evasion, transfer pricing and fossil fuel subsidies so they can deliver large stimulus packages to help vulnerable populations and boost their economies.
Current low oil prices provided an ideal opportunity to reverse fossil fuel subsidies, it added. 
In Indonesia, the region's most populous country, fossil fuel subsidies in 2020 will exceed its entire COVID-19 social assistance and stimulus measures, the U.N. report said.
As well as boosting social welfare payments, Southeast Asian nations should prioritise higher health spending, said Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, head of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.
Six of the 11 countries in the region - including its two biggest nations, Indonesia and the Philippines - received the lowest rating for health spending on the U.N.'s five-tier human development index. Three others were on the second-lowest tier and the remaining two were on the middle tier.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The number of Hong Kong citizens applying to study at Australian universities has hit a three-year-high midway through 2020, according to government data, amid fears a new security law is ushering in a more authoritarian era for China's freest city.
The rise in higher education applications from Hong Kong citizens in the first six months of the year contrasts with otherwise steep falls in the number of overseas students applying to study in Australia during the coronavirus pandemic.
The data released late on Thursday captured Hong Kong citizens' applications in the lead-up to the implementation of new security law late on June 30 which have exacerbated concerns over freedoms in the financial hub.
There was more than a 16% rise in applications from Hong Kong citizens in the first six months of 2020 compared to the corresponding period last year.
Australia is the third most popular destination for overseas students after the United States and United Kingdom, according to the International Education Association of Australia.
Australian universities expect more students from Hong Kong will apply for study visas after the government earlier this month said Hong Kong students, graduates and workers on temporary visas will have the opportunity to stay and work for an extra five years and apply for permanent residency after that time. 
""We have seen a sharp increase in enquiries from Hong Kong nationals in Australia and residents in Hong Kong following the government announcement,"" director at Stirling Henry global migration Simon De Vere told Reuters.
Australia's A$37 billion ($26.54 billion) education sector, the country's second largest services export after tourism, has taken a massive economic hit from the pandemic with universities warning they might lose A$16 billion in revenue by 2023.
Much of that anticipated loss is due to declining enrolments from mainland Chinese students, which has fallen to the lowest levels recorded since 2012-13 in the first half of the year, government data shows.
Australia has also effectively closed its international borders, allowing only a very limited number of inbound passengers each day. Universities are seeking schemes to allow foreign students in via travel bubbles with other countries.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime associate of Jeffrey Epstein, on Thursday urged a U.S. appeals court to block the release of a deposition about her sex life, saying it could destroy her ability to get a fair trial against criminal charges she aided the late financier's sexual abuse of girls.
Maxwell filed an emergency request with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan one day after a federal judge rejected her claim that her need for confidentiality outweighed the public's right to see the April 2016 deposition, which was taken in a civil defamation lawsuit.
""Absent a stay from this court, it will forever let the cat out of the bag,"" Maxwell's lawyers wrote, noting another judge's recent refusal to block publication of former National Security Adviser John Bolton's memoir because copies had already been circulated.
Late Thursday, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska, who oversees the civil case, ordered the separate release of dozens of other documents that the British socialite had wanted sealed, rejecting her lawyers' bid for an emergency phone conference.
The 2016 deposition is scheduled for release on Aug. 3, unless the appeals court orders a delay or further arguments.
Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and eventually abuse three girls from 1994 to 1997, and committing perjury by denying her involvement under oath.
The deposition came from a now-settled lawsuit against Maxwell by Virginia Giuffre, who had accused Epstein of having kept her as a ""sex slave"" with Maxwell's assistance. She wants the disclosure of more information from her case.
Maxwell's lawyers have accused Giuffre of leaking the deposition, and ""in conjunction with the government"" setting a ""perjury trap"" for their client.
They said Maxwell had been promised confidentiality before being forced to answer many ""personal, sensitive, and allegedly incriminatory questions,"" only to be sandbagged when prosecutors quoted from the deposition in her indictment.
The lawyers said this included when Maxwell responded ""I don't know what you're talking about"" when asked if Epstein had a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages.
Maxwell was arrested on July 2 at a New Hampshire home where prosecutors said she was hiding out.
She was denied bail and is being held in a Brooklyn jail after the judge overseeing her criminal case called her a flight risk.
""The government has indicted Ghislaine Maxwell. The media has all but convicted her,"" Maxwell's lawyers said. ""All Ms. Maxwell is asking is that this court have a fair opportunity to review the merits of the district court's decision before the deposition material is unsealed for all time.""

Epstein was found hanged at age 66 last August in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges for abusing women and girls in Manhattan and Florida from 2002 to 2005. He had pleaded not guilty.

Pompeo in a statement called it a ""major expansion"" of the Iran metals-related sanctions administered by the State Department, allowing Washington to blacklist those who knowingly transfer the materials to Iran.
""Iran's nuclear, ballistic missile, and military programs pose a grave threat to international peace and security,"" Pompeo said in the statement. 
Pompeo also said he was firm in his determination that Iran's elite security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), controls Iran's construction sector. 
As a result, sanctions may still be imposed on those who knowingly transfer certain materials, including graphite or raw or semi-finished metals, to or from Iran to be used in connection with the Islamic Republic's construction sector, Pompeo said.
The materials he said he had determined are used in connection with Iran's nuclear, military or ballistic missile programs included aluminum powder with purity above 98%.
Reuters reported in June that Iran Alumina (OTC:AWCMY) Company's aluminum complex near the city of Jajarm is also home to a secret facility, set up by the IRGC, that has produced powder for use in Iran's missile program.
Aluminum powder is a key ingredient in solid-fuel propellants used to launch missiles. 
The United States has previously targeted Iran's metals sector with sanctions in an effort to slash Iranian revenues.

Tensions between Washington and Tehran have spiked since Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and began reimposing sanctions that had been eased under the accord.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States should not stop United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres from naming a new U.N. Libya envoy to replace Ghassan Salame who quit nearly five months ago, Germany's U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen said on Thursday.
Salame, who headed the U.N. political mission and was charged with trying to mediate peace, quit because of stress after his last effort at peacemaking in the war-torn, oil producing country failed. 
The United States now wants to split the role to have one person run the U.N. mission - known as UNSMIL - and another person focus on mediating peace in Libya, diplomats said.
""There have been questions raised by our U.S. partners with regard to the structure of UNSMIL. We believe that, yes, you can discuss that, but ... the U.S. shouldn't stop the Secretary-General nominating a successor to Ghassan Salame,"" Heusgen told reporters. 
The U.N. Security Council traditionally greenlights such appointments by consensus, but some of the 15 members are not in favor of the U.S. proposal to split the role, diplomats said.
Guterres has suggested former Ghana foreign minister and current U.N. envoy to the African Union, Hanna Tetteh, replace Salame and Washington has said it can support her nomination after Guterres appoints a special mediator, diplomats said. 
The United States had proposed former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt to be special envoy, but diplomats said she had withdrawn herself and Washington is now looking for a new candidate.
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Since 2014, it has been split, with an internationally recognized government controlling the capital, Tripoli, and the northwest, while military leader Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi rules the east.

The bill was introduced by the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Chairman Jim Risch and ranking member Bob Menendez, along with Republicans Rob Portman and John Barrasso and Democratic committee members Chris Murphy and Jeanne Shaheen.
The bill also authorizes up to $4 million to train Ukrainian military officers, requires a Department of Defense and State Department report on the requirements of Ukraine's armed forces and a plan to supply security assistance and requires the appointment of a special envoy for Ukraine.
Congressional military aid to Ukraine was at the center of the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry last year into U.S. President Donald Trump.
Trump was charged with obstructing Congress and of withholding aid to the Kiev government as it faced Russian aggression after he pressured Ukraine's president to investigate the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

""This means breaking up the monopoly of companies that had control in Mexico. They sold medications that were expensive, of poor quality and there were often shortages,"" said President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador at a regular news conference.
Lopez Obrador said the distribution agency will make sure residents even in the far-flung corners of Mexico have access to medications and vaccines. The current head of Mexico's civil protection agency, David Leon, will lead the new state-run agency.
Lopez Obrador's government has been criticized for a shortage of medicines following a procurement shake-up, which centralized drug purchases to reduce corruption and overpricing.
The head of pharmaceutical business chamber Canifarma, Rafael Gual, has estimated that the agreement with the U.N. puts 100,000 direct jobs and half a million indirect jobs at risk.
He added that drug prices have already fallen nearly 19% between 2013 and 2019 due to consolidated purchases.

Opposition congresswoman Martha Gonzalez said the measures will not fix the medicine shortage, which she said was the result of ""government inefficiency.""

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 05:05PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Colombia to collect more 2020 tax than previously thought, official says","By Nelson Bocanegra
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's government will collect 7.5 trillion pesos ($2.01 billion) more in taxes this year than previously predicted amid the coronavirus pandemic, due to improved efforts to combat evasion, the head of the tax and customs agency told Reuters on Thursday.
The government reduced its collection target in June to 144.2 trillion pesos, some $38.8 billion, from an original target of 167.5 trillion. But Andres Romero, the head of the DIAN tax and customs agency, told Reuters in an interview collection will likely reach 159.9 trillion pesos.
Should that projection come true, the decline in tax collections will be almost a third smaller than thought.
A months-long nationwide quarantine in Latin America's fourth-largest economy has led the government to take on billions more in debt and predict economic contraction of 5.5% for 2020.
Tax collection fell by 6.4 trillion pesos between April and May, Romero said, but figures looked better in June, when the government collected 1.83 trillion pesos more than expected. 
A similar above-target collection is expected in July, he said.
""There will be seven and a half trillion (pesos) more in collection (in 2020) than what was planned,"" Romero said in a video interview. 
The DIAN recovered 8.7 trillion pesos ($2.34 billion) in anti-tax evasion efforts between January and July, more than half its full-year goal of 16 trillion pesos.
""I think if the Colombian economy reactivates more rapidly ... that people, despite the situation, despite the pandemic, will take self-care measures to restart their economic activities"" Romero said. ""That will without a doubt help collection to improve much more quickly.""
Depending on the speed of recovery, the country could collect 157 trillion pesos in taxes next year, he said, adding a tax reform will likely be put to congress in 2021.
The government has estimated the economy will expand 6.6% next year, though analysts are more conservative about recovery.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong on Thursday disqualified a dozen pro-democracy candidates from running in a key election, citing reasons including collusion with foreign forces and opposition to the new China-imposed national security laws.
It was the most sweeping move yet seen on the city's electoral freedoms, with even moderate democrats targeted. Some critics including Hong Kong's last British governor Chris Patten called it an ""outrageous political purge"".
Those disqualified included pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong, some members of the Civic Party, a moderate, old-guard opposition group, and others who won an unofficial ""primary"" vote held by the opposition camp this month.
The move comes one month after Communist Party rulers in Beijing announced the national security law that reins in dissent in the semi-autonomous city. It could also steer China further onto a collision path with the West.
The government said there could be more disqualifications.
Critics said the move sought to curb the ascendancy of a young, more defiant generation of democrats after an overwhelming win in last year's lower-level district council elections.
""Clearly, #Beijing shows a total disregard for the will of the #Hongkongers, tramples upon the city’s last pillar of vanishing autonomy and attempts to keep #HK’s legislature under its firm grip,"" Wong tweeted.
Chances for a historic majority in the Legislative Council, or mini-parliament, for the opposition camp will take a further blow if the government decides to postpone the Sept. 6 vote, as expected, amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Hong Kong has disqualified candidates before but not on this scale. The disqualification of Civic Party candidates signals Beijing is becoming less tolerant of even moderate democrats, who have for decades been a vocal opposition in the legislature. 
""The government is constructing a CCP (Chinese Communist Party) assembly in Legco to eliminate most of the opposition voices,” Nathan Law, a pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker who was kicked out of the legislature, said on Twitter. Law fled Hong Kong for Britain earlier this month. 
The Civic Party said its existence is not confined to the legislature, often referred to as Legco, and it will continue to work for its values.
""When the regime wishes to enslave us, the best thing to do is to stand firm and tell the regime we would not change,"" said Civic Party member Kwok Ka-ki, who was among those disqualified.
IMPROPER BEHAVIOUR
The government said advocating self-determination, soliciting intervention by foreign governments, or ""expressing an objection in principle"" to the enactment of the new security law was behaviour that ""could not genuinely"" uphold the city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law.
Candidates are required by law to pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and the Basic Law.
The government said there was ""no question of any political censorship, restriction of the freedom of speech or deprivation of the right to stand for elections as alleged by some members of the community"".
Beijing's top representative office in the city, the Hong Kong Liaison Office, said in a statement it supported the disqualifications as the candidates aimed to ""paralyse the government"" and ""subvert state power"".
Beijing introduced the security legislation to punish what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces in the former British colony.
Critics of the law say it erodes basic rights and freedoms, guaranteed when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, while supporters say it will bring stability after a year of often-violent anti-government and anti-China unrest.
The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance On China, a coalition of over 60 lawmakers from countries including the United States, Britain, Canada and Germany, said the moves were ""unacceptable obstructions of the democratic process in Hong Kong and raise further concerns about the erosion of rights and freedoms.""

In Taiwan, which is claimed by China, the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party said recent political developments in Hong Kong ""went entirely against the principle of democracy and the rule of law, as well as basic human rights"".

Tahir Ahmed Naseem was shot multiple times at close range as he appeared in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Wednesday.
""We urge Pakistan to take immediate action and pursue reforms that will prevent such a shameful tragedy from happening again,"" the U.S. State Department said in a tweet.
As Naseem's arraignment began before the judge, a young man in the room pulled out a handgun and shot him in the head, officials and witnesses said. The young man was arrested on the spot.
On Thursday, supporters of a hardline Islamist group held a protest rally in Peshawar calling for the release of the suspected shooter, saying he had defended his religion.
The aftermath of the killing, captured on video and shared on social media, showed Naseem slumped over in a chair beside the judge's bench, as other shackled prisoners, some with bloodied clothes, were taken from the room. 
""The young man who shot him had no remorse, and said he saw the Prophet Muhammad in a dream the night before,"" Latif Afridi, who heads the Peshawar High Court Bar Association, told Reuters.
Afridi questioned how the man managed to get a gun into the court given that all visitors are checked thoroughly at three different points.
""It is likely someone who can go without being checked, perhaps a police officer or a lawyer, handed the shooter the gun after he entered,"" he said.
According to the charge sheet against Naseem, seen by Reuters, the American was in contact with a student at an Islamic school in Pakistan on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and told him he was a messiah sent by God.

Naseem later met the student in Peshawar, after which police arrested him and charged him with a number of crimes, including insulting the Prophet Muhammad, which can bring the death penalty in Pakistan.

The Baha'i International Community group welcomed the releases and called for the men's assets to be returned, for all charges against Baha'is in Yemen to be dropped and for Baha'is to live in Yemen without persecution.
Baha'i community sources told Reuters the men had been taken by plane from the Houthi-held capital Sanaa with the intention of being taken eventually outside Yemen. 
In 2018, Houthi authorities brought charges against around 20 members of the faith, which regards its 19th-century founder as a prophet. Muslim countries, including Iran where the sect originated, consider it an heretical offshoot of Islam.
Hussein al-Azzi, the Houthi deputy foreign minister, said the six men were released in the hope that ""this noble stance would be met with more commitment and respect for the law and with observance of the general order of Yemeni society,"" without adding further details. 
In March the head of the Houthi political office ordered the release of the six men, but they remained in detention. One of the released men, Hamed bin Haydara had been given a death sentence.
The Iran-aligned Houthi movement ousted the internationally recognised Yemeni government from power in Sanaa in late 2014, after which a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia intervened to try to restore the government.

""We didn't want this swept under the rug,"" Trump told a tearful Gloria Guillen, the mother of Vanessa Guillen, during a meeting in the Oval Office. ""They're doing a very strong investigation. ... We'll get to the bottom of it.""
The remains of Guillen, 20, were discovered in June, months after she disappeared from the base. Her family claimed she had been sexually harassed before her disappearance in April, but Army officials say no sexual harassment reports were filed.
The U.S. Army on Thursday said an independent panel of five experts would investigate whether personnel at Fort Hood had allowed a climate of sexual harassment and discrimination at the base.
Trump said Guillen's death ""hit me very hard"" and offered to pay for her funeral. He said he had done so in other cases, using his own money.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Protesters set up tents on a major crossroad and in front of the government building early on Thursday, vowing to keep the center of the Bulgarian capital blocked until the government of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov resigns.
Several thousand mostly young Bulgarians have been rallying daily in Sofia since early July, accusing three-times premier Borissov of failing to fight endemic corruption that erodes the rule of law and benefits powerful local tycoons.
Demonstrations are also taking place in bigger cities.
61-year-old Borissov, who has dominated Bulgaria's political life in the past decade, has vowed to stay in office until next March when regular elections are due.
Borissov sacked key ministers to show his cabinet is not working under the influence of private interests, but the reshuffle failed to quash deeply-rooted public anger with wide-spread corruption in the European Union's poorest country.
With a slogan ""Please excuse the inconvenience, the country is under repairs,"" dozens of protesters sat in shifts in front of 10 tents perched on the asphalt at the Eagle Bridge crossroad throughout Thursday, blocking traffic in central Sofia, home to some 2 million people.
Two large tents and summer umbrellas blocked the central road in front of the government building, where thousands gathered to rally for a 22nd consecutive night late on Thursday, seeking also to oust the country's chief prosecutor.
""I am glad there are people who are committed 24/7 to the protests and pulled out tents. Extreme measures are obviously needed to get our voice heard,"" said Biliana Kantardzhieva, a 30-year-old marketing specialist.
Some 59% of Bulgarians say they support the protests, but only 25% believe they can succeed, according to a public opinion survey, based on 800 telephone interviews and published on Thursday by independent pollster Gallup International, which is not associated with Gallup Inc. 
The survey also showed that 54% do not want snap polls now, while 42% are in favour, the survey showed.

""There is a clear will for a change, but also some reluctance for an early election,"" the pollster said.

The Ukraine government later confirmed that it had received a letter from senior Kremlin official Dmitry Kozak proposing scrapping the talks in their current form, without withdrawing from the talks altogether.
Russia wants to end the technical talks between the foreign ministers and heads of states of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany in the Normandy format, so named because the first talks took place in the French region of Normandy in 2014.
""The format of advisors is ineffective,"" a source in Moscow said about the letter, without elaborating. ""There is little meaning in it"".
The head of the Ukraine president's office, Andriy Yermak, who has been engaged in talks with Kozak, said the negotiation process ""has not been easy"".
""Mr. Kozak's letter, in my opinion, is more about a subtle diplomatic game, when one of the parties to the talks wants to strengthen its position and seize the initiative,"" he said in a statement. He did not say when the letter had been sent.
""However, it is clear that there is no point in talking about the termination of negotiations. The work is still ongoing.""
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, and over its backing for fighters in the Donbass region in a war that has killed more than 13,000 people and brought Western sanctions on Russia.
There have been some signs of a thaw in relations, including prisoner swaps. Last week, Ukrainian, Russian and OSCE negotiators agreed on a full ceasefire in eastern Ukraine from Monday, putting on hold the military conflict.

Blocks-long lines formed in Santiago outside the offices of Pension Fund Administrators (AFP) as Chileans sought to take advantage of the new law. The emergency measure allows those with savings to withdraw up to 10% of their pensions.
""During the first hours, more than 1,100,000 members have been able to enter their withdrawal request successfully,"" said Fernando Larraín, president of Chile´s association of pension fund managers.
The websites of several of the fund administrators collapsed Thursday morning amid the deluge of requests, prompting an apology from the companies.
""As we warned from the beginning, this process is unprecedented and we have had to quickly prepare all the platforms,"" Larrain said.
Larrain said it would take 10 business days for the first payouts to arrive. The influx of cash into the pockets of everyday Chileans is largely expected to boost the economy.
Several economists and analysts have revised dire predictions for Chile´s gross domestic product upward since the law's passage in anticipation of a kick-start in consumer spending.
President Sebastian Pinera`s center-right government nonetheless opposed the emergency relief measure, saying it would support citizens through the public purse instead. It has also warned about the longer-term impact on the profitability and already low average payouts of pensions. 
Despite those pleas, opinion polls indicate nearly nine out of every 10 Chileans planned to tap their funds. Most said they would use the money to pay for basic goods and services.

Chile´s privatized pension system, introduced under dictator Augusto Pinochet, has often been hailed as a model, but has also been strongly criticized in recent years for low payouts.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - More than 1,000 people gathered outside a historic Atlanta church to pay their last respects to longtime U.S. Representative John Lewis as former presidents praised the civil rights pioneer at his funeral on Thursday.
Former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton both spoke of Lewis's humble beginnings on a farm in Troy, Alabama, to becoming a leader of the Black civil rights movement and ultimately the man known as the ""conscience of Congress.""
They spoke in front of the American flag-draped casket bearing Lewis' body at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. Once preached. King, a mentor to Lewis in the civil rights struggle, was assassinated in 1968.
Former President Barack Obama is scheduled to deliver the eulogy later on Thursday for Lewis, who died on July 17 at age 80 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. 
""We live in a better and nobler country today because of John Lewis,"" said Bush, who remembered joining Lewis in Selma, Alabama, for the 50th anniversary of the watershed march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. ""The story that began in Troy isn't ending here today, nor is the work."" 
Lewis, an Alabama sharecropper's son who strove for equality for Blacks in an America grappling with racial bigotry and segregation, was a fiercely determined champion of nonviolent protest and was inspired by King.
Lewis was first elected in 1986 to represent Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives. His death came at a time of reckoning across the United States over racial injustice, with widespread protests condemning unequal police treatment of Black Americans and institutions removing or renaming tributes to former leaders of the pro-slavery Confederacy.
The funeral follows a week of memorial services.
The coffin bearing his body was escorted across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Sunday, decades after his beating there drew a national spotlight to the struggle for racial equality. And on Monday his casket was taken to the U.S. Capitol in Washington where it lay in state through Tuesday.
Nathan Knight, 73, a retired building contractor, said he came to the funeral to honor a man he met as a young boy in 1958, joined in marches over the years, and was present when Obama awarded Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. 
""The reason why it's important for me to be here is because he has been a teacher, a leader and a mentor to me,"" Knight said outside the church, where more than a thousand people had gathered, some watching the service on a large TV screen outside. ""I can vote today because of him, because of him and Dr. King.""
In an essay written shortly before his death and published in the New York Times on Thursday, Lewis called on the nation to come together for justice and equality.

""When historians pick up their pens to write the story of the 21st century, let them say that it was your generation who laid down the heavy burdens of hate at last and that peace finally triumphed over violence, aggression and war,"" Lewis wrote. ""So I say to you, walk with the wind, brothers and sisters, and let the spirit of peace and the power of everlasting love be your guide.""

The ceasefire, announced by the Taliban, comes at a time violence has risen across the war-torn country as U.S.-brokered peace talks between the militant group and an Afghan government-mandated committee await the completion of a prisoner exchange between the two sides.
The Taliban denied responsibility for the bombing in a statement from spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. 
The explosion targeted Afghan security forces in Pul-e-Alan, the capital of the eastern province of Logar and civilian casualties are also feared, according to Shahpoor Ahmadzai, the spokesman for the provincial police.
He added it was unclear whether it was a car or suicide bombing, but that security forces had gathered for duty in the city to prepare for security measures for Eid al-Fitr, which will be celebrated in Afghanistan on Friday.
The head of the province's council, Hasib Stanekkzai, told Reuters it was a car-bombing and put the toll at 18 dead and 22 injured.
Since the U.S.-Taliban agreement in February, 3,560 Afghan security forces personnel have been killed in attacks by militants, according to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said in a report this week that more than 1,280 Afghan civilians had been killed in the first six months of the year, mainly as a result of fighting between Afghan government forces and the Taliban.
U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad was in Kabul on Wednesday to discuss the need to keep violence down by all sides after the ceasefire and the completion of the prisoner exchange, according to a statement by the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. Republican lawmakers on Thursday rejected President Donald Trump's suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 presidential election, saying the contest should be held as planned even as they mostly backed his concerns about mail-in voting.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told television journalists from his home state of Kentucky that the election would go ahead as scheduled, and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy rejected the suggested delay out of hand.
""Never in the history of the federal elections have we ever not held an election, and we should go forward with our election,"" McCarthy, a Trump ally, declared at a news conference. 
McConnell, in an interview with WNKY-TV that was excerpted on Twitter, noted the United States had always held its elections on time, through wars and economic downturns. ""We'll cope with whatever the situation is, and have the election on Nov. 3 as already scheduled,"" McConnell said.
Trump earlier on Thursday raised the idea of delaying the Nov. 3 U.S. elections, which the Constitution does not give him the power to do. Congress has the power to set the timing of elections.
Democrats condemned his words immediately and said they were an attempt to distract from devastating economic news and other crises.
Many fellow Republicans made clear they did not agree with the president, either.
""I think his concerns about mail-in voting are valid, but delaying the election is not the right answer,"" Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), a Trump ally, told reporters.
""I think we can be able to safely vote in person in November,"" said Graham, who chairs the Judiciary Committee. ""I think delaying the election probably wouldn't be a good idea.""
Another conservative Republican senator, Ted Cruz, told reporters: ""I think election fraud is a serious problem, and it’s vital to stop it. But no, we should not delay the election.”
Senator Marco Rubio, also a conservative Republican, said the election date would not change.
McCarthy said he understood Trump's concern about the integrity of mail-in voting, distinguishing it from absentee voting that he said can be easily traced and confirmed.
""If you just mass-mail ballots out, people have moved, voter rolls are not updated, and that's where you have real problems in elections,"" McCarthy said. ""That's what the president's talking about, he's not talking about absentee voting.""
Voting by mail is not new in the United States - nearly one in four voters cast 2016 presidential ballots that way. The decentralized nature of U.S. elections make it very hard to interfere with mailed ballots, experts say.
Republican Senator Mitt Romney also rejected the delay and noted that about 90% of voters in his home state of Utah submit ballots by mail.
""It works extremely well,"" Romney said. ""You can't tamper with paper.""
Trump's statement on Twitter comes as the United States is enduring a coronavirus pandemic, nationwide protests against police violence and racism, and the worst U.S. economic contraction since the Great Depression.

Opinion polls show Trump losing ground to and trailing Democratic challenger and former Vice President Joe Biden.

North Korean company Chosun Expo was also sanctioned on suspicion of having supported the Lazarus Group, which is deemed responsible for a series of major attacks worldwide, including an $81 million heist against Bangladesh Bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2016, the world's biggest cyber fraud.
The company is also allegedly linked to an attack against Hollywood film studio  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) Pictures to prevent the release of a satirical movie about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in 2014. 
The U.S. Treasury last year imposed sanctions on the Lazarus Group and two other North Korean hacking groups for their alleged participation in the attacks on Sony Pictures and the central bank of Bangladesh, among others. It said North Korea's main intelligence service was behind the hacking groups.
North Korea has denied any involvement in cyberattacks.
The EU sanctions also hit Chinese firm Haitai Technology Development, which is accused of having supported cyberattacks - known as Operation Cloud Hopper - aimed at stealing commercially sensitive data from multinationals across the world. Two Chinese individuals allegedly involved in the attacks were also sanctioned.

Sanctions include travel bans and asset freezes. EU individuals, companies and other entities are forbidden from making funds available to those blacklisted.

A parked truck exploded near the checkpoint at the entrance of Tel Halef village, west of the town of Ras Al Ain on the Turkish-Syrian border, killing at least five and wounding 12 others, said Anadolu.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nine people were killed and 15 wounded.
Anadolu said local security forces were examining the possibility that fighters from the Syrian Kurdish YPG, which Ankara views as a terrorist group, may have carried out the attack. 
Turkey, which is allied with some rebel groups opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, seized control of the town last year in an offensive to push back YPG fighters.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Senate lifted the immunity of former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini on Thursday, opening the way for a trial of the right-wing leader on charges of kidnapping over the detention of those on a migrant ship at sea last year.
The upper house voted along party lines and the result, 149 in favour versus 141 against, was widely expected. It is the second time Salvini has lost parliamentary immunity over a migration charge this year.
""It will be a joy for me to go to (court in) Sicily to defend my right to defend our beautiful country,"" Salvini, 47, told the Senate before the vote, knowing that it would go against him.
Magistrates in Sicily want to try Salvini for alleged abuse of office and illegally detaining the migrants, saying he acted independently of the government.
""This evening I will go home with my head high,"" he said. ""This is a political trial and if anyone thinks they have weakened me, they are mistaken.""
Salvini, head of the anti-immigrant League party, blocked the ship - which was carrying more than 100 migrants rescued at sea - from docking last August, while he was interior minister in the previous government.
A prosecutor eventually ordered the seizure and evacuation of the ship, operated by the Spanish group Open Arms.
There was no indication when a trial could be held. The indictment decision rests with a senior judge. Salvini could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty at the end of a tortuous, three-stage judicial process. A definitive conviction could bar him from office, scuppering his ambition to lead a future government. 
The Senate already lifted Salvini's immunity in February in a case involving another blocked ship and a preliminary hearing on that case is scheduled for Oct. 3 in Sicily.
As interior minister for 14 months, Salvini took a hard line against charity ships that rescued migrants at sea, accusing them of de facto collaboration with human traffickers.

""Those who support open ports have blood on their hands,"" Salvini said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will make a rare appearance before a parliamentary committee on Thursday amid questions over a government decision to allow a charity with ties to his family to manage a major student grant program.
The escalating scandal over the C$900 million ($671 million) contract granted to WE Charity Canada has hurt Trudeau in the polls, with his Liberal Party slipping to a 4-point lead over the opposition Conservatives, an Abacus Data poll showed Thursday.
The Liberal-led government's popularity had soared amid Canada's response to the COVID-19 crisis. 
Trudeau is scheduled to appear under oath at 3 p.m. (1900 GMT), while his chief of staff, Katie Telford, is to follow him at 4:15 p.m. The committee voted late Wednesday to extend Trudeau's testimony to three hours.
Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said a longer testimony is needed to get to the bottom of the affair. The committee alone cannot force Trudeau to stay on past his schedule time.
""One hour is not sufficient when we're talking about a billion dollars,"" he told reporters on Thursday. 
Testimony by a Canadian prime minister before a parliamentary committee is very unusual. It last happened in 2006 when then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper appeared at one to speak about Senate reform. 
Trudeau's testimony comes after he was put under investigation for possible conflict-of-interest violations. It is the third ethics probe he has faced in three years. 
The prime minister has already apologized publicly for participating in the Cabinet decision to pick WE Charity to administer the grant program. The charity backed out shortly after the program was announced.
Canada's ethics commissioner launched the investigation after WE Charity disclosed that it had paid Trudeau's mother and brother for speaking appearances.

Both the prime minister and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, have regularly participated in WE Charity events.

(Reuters) - A former manager of consultancy Unaoil was sentenced to three years in jail by a London court on Thursday – the second Unaoil executive to be jailed for bribing an Iraqi official to secure a $55 million oil deal after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.
Stephen Whiteley, a 65-year-old Briton, was found guilty by a jury of conspiring to pay more than $500,000 in bribes to secure a contract for offshore mooring buoys, which oil tankers could use to fill up offshore.
Whiteley, who was Unaoil manager for Iraq, Kazakhstan and Angola, was sentenced one week after Ziad Akle, a British-Lebanese former Unaoil Iraq territory manager, was handed a five-year jail sentence over the same charge last week.
Akle said payments were authorised for security purposes. Whiteley denied knowing about payments but said he wanted a ""level playing field"" during a competitive tender.
Both men plan to appeal against their convictions, their lawyers said.
""He (Whiteley) has co-operated fully with the SFO as they continued their investigation, which first opened in April 2016 - a lengthy period, which, as you can imagine, has taken a significant toll. It is a disappointing result for Stephen and we will be appealing the conviction,"" said Sam Healey, a partner at JMW Solicitors who is representing Whiteley.
SFO Director Lisa Osofsky said the men exhibited ""flagrant greed and callous criminality"" as war-torn Iraq battled to reconstruct its oil industry and boost exports following years of military occupation.
""We will not cease in our mission to bring such people to justice,"" she said.
Basil Al Jarah, Unaoil's 71-year-old former country manager for Iraq, pleaded guilty in the case last year and will be sentenced in October.
Paul Bond, a 68-year-old former sales manager for energy services company SBM Offshore, faces a retrial in January after the jury could not reach a verdict in his case.
Separately, British brothers Cyrus and Saman Ahsani, Unaoil's former chief executive and chief operating officer respectively, pleaded guilty to bribery in the United States last year. They have yet to be sentenced.

The government had allowed sit-down restaurants to reopen at the end of June after coronavirus restrictions were eased, but it restricted opening hours to 9 p.m (1900 GMT) and banned alcohol sales, which the sector says is damaging to profitability and jobs.
Restaurant and bar owners, along with their employees took to the streets on July 22, demanding an end to the curfew and that they should be allowed to sell alcohol. [nL5N2ET3PV]
""We believe that this change will go a long way towards increasing their revenue generation,"" Kubayi-Ngubane said as she announced relief plans for the tourism sector. 
The sale of alcohol, however, remains prohibited and the date for the new rules to take effect is unclear as regulations need first to be published.
The cabinet has also agreed to ease the restrictions around leisure travel, allowing individuals to leave their homes for leisure within the province where they live, she added.
Accommodation establishments will be able to take in people for leisure purposes, while tour operators will be allowed to conduct guided tours in open safari vehicles subject to certain rules. Short-term home rental or sharing accommodation through Airbnb, for instance, remains prohibited.
""The impact of the pandemic has been devastating for the sector. Many businesses are at risk and many jobs have already been lost. However, we are doing everything we can to ensure that the impact is minimised,"" Kubayi-Ngubane said.
Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa, chief executive officer at the Tourism Business Council of South Africa told eNCA news channel the sector will take time to recover.

""We don't expect to make any profit this year or next year. We want to at least have the wheels of the value chain moving to ensure that the employees that are so dependent on the tourism sector can go back to work,"" he said.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>",Ivory Coast defence minister Bakayoko named prime minister,"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara has appointed Defence Minister Hamed Bakayoko as prime minister after his predecessor died suddenly this month, the presidency said on Thursday. 
The death of former Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, who had been handpicked by Ouattara to succeed him, left his ruling party scrambling to find a replacement three months ahead of the presidential election. 
The Oct. 31 vote is seen as crucial for the stability of Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, which has spent Ouattara's decade in office rebuilding from a brief civil war that followed his first election win in 2010. 
Bakayoko, a former radio and newspaper executive and longtime ally of Ouattara, had been considered a possible replacement for Gon Coulibaly as the presidential candidate. 
However, the ruling party on Wednesday formally asked Ouattara to run again. Ouattara, who had announced in March that he would step down after the election, said he would take some time before deciding whether to run - a move his opponents say would violate constitutional term limits.
Bakayoko, 55, has a reputation as a populist and showman who holds rowdy campaign rallies. He will retain his position as defence minister in his new post, the presidency said in a statement. 
Bakayoko served as interim prime minister during Gon Coulibaly's two-month absence for heart tests in France. Gon Coulibaly died days after returning to Ivory Coast earlier this month. 
Party members said they asked Ouattara to run again because he was the only person who could unite the party ahead of an election that is expected to be bitterly contested. 

The civil war in 2010 and 2011 killed about 3,000 people and was fought largely on the basis of ethnic and regional divides that persist despite a tenuous peace in recent years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI said on Thursday that the errors and sloppy record-keeping identified in connection with 29 of its applications submitted to a federal court to obtain wiretaps to monitor U.S. citizens were ""non-material"" and did not undermine their legal validity.
The FBI's statement on Thursday came several months after Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz released an audit faulting the FBI for failing to follow procedures designed to minimize factual inaccuracies in applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
Those procedures, among other things, require the FBI to include only “scrupulously accurate” statements.
The FBI revealed on Thursday that, in a joint court filing with the department's Office of Intelligence, ""none of the errors"" identified by the inspector general ""undermined or otherwise impacted the validity"" of the court orders approving the wiretaps.
Of more than 6,700 facts asserted, most of the errors involved ""minor typographical errors,"" the FBI added. Only two were deemed material, but neither of them undermined ""probable cause determinations.""
The FBI's findings could help take some of the heat off the bureau, which has been under fire for missteps in its early-stage investigation known as ""Operation Crossfire Hurricane"" into whether President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia.
In December, Horowitz released a major report scrutinizing the FBI's FISA applications to spy on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. 
He uncovered 17 major mistakes in the FBI's applications - errors that were so substantial, they prompted Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge to issue a rare public rebuke of the FBI and order the bureau to provide details on how it would correct its procedures.
While the FBI has taken corrective measures to improve its policies, the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee is still probing the errors in Operation Crossfire Hurricane.

Next week, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates will testify before the panel about her role in the Russia investigation.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Nearly one in three children around the world have high levels of lead in their bloodstream, according to a new study, as widespread lead pollution puts millions of young people at risk of irreversible mental and physical damage.
Some 800 million children had lead levels of 5 micrograms per decilitre or higher in their bloodstream, the study carried out by United Nations agency UNICEF and environmental group Pure Earth showed, levels considered high enough to impair the development of brains, nervous systems and vital organs such as heart and lungs.
The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the high levels of lead in children were a ""cause for action"", according to the report, which cited inadequate battery recycling and open-air smelters among the lead polluters.
""The unequivocal conclusion of this research is that children around the world are being poisoned by lead on a massive and previously unrecognized scale,"" said the report released on Thursday.
It cited a wide range of factors responsible for high levels of lead in children's blood, from inadequate recycling of lead-acid batteries and homes with peeling lead paint to lead-laced electronic waste dumps and food contamination due to lead-glazed pottery.
Lead-acid batteries could be a key culprit, with nearly 85% of the lead used worldwide going into their production, for use in telecommunications and power back-up equipment as well as conventional and electric vehicles.
While more than 95% of the lead from batteries is recycled in the United States and Europe, developing economies lack the facilities to reuse the heavy metal, the study said.

The report also said that the longer the toxin goes undetected in the bloodstream and remains untreated, the more dangerous and potentially lethal it becomes.

LISBON (Reuters) - Clubbers in Portugal eager to shake off the coronavirus blues will have to wait a little longer to dance the night away, as nightclubs were given the green light to reopen from Saturday but with early closing and no dancefloors allowed.
The Portuguese government announced on Thursday that bars and nightclubs can reopen if they wish, but following the same rules applied to coffee shops and bakeries. They will have to shut by 8 p.m. in Lisbon and 1 a.m. elsewhere in the country.
Nightclubs, which were forced to close doors in March when a lockdown to fight the coronavirus was imposed, can use the dancefloor space for tables where people can hang out and grab a bite - as long as social distancing is respected.
""There is a possibility for establishments like bars to operate like bakeries or cafes,"" Cabinet Affairs Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva told a news conference, saying there were still ""no conditions"" for the establishments to return to business as usual due to the high risk of contagion.
Worried about the future of the sector and the industry's capacity to maintain jobs, business owners were not happy with the decision.
""This cannot be true,"" Hugo Cardoso, the president of an association representing nightclubs and bars nationwide, told radio station Renancenca. ""A nightclub that closes at 8 p.m.? A nightclub that closes before people arrive?""
Antonio Fonseca, the president of a similar association in Porto, Portugal's second biggest city, told Portuguese broadcaster RTP the government move was ""ridiculous"".
""It doesn't make any sense,"" he said.
Portugal initially won praise for its quick response to the pandemic, but a steady count of several hundred new cases per day in and around Lisbon in the past two months has worried authorities at home and abroad.
Authorities said the number of cases in the affected areas have dropped, leading the government to downgrade a state of ""calamity"" across a total of 19 civil parishes around Lisbon to a category of ""contingency"", the same level as the rest of the city's metropolitan area.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court sentenced a former U.S. Marine to nine years in jail on Thursday after convicting him of endangering the lives of two police officers in a trial the United States criticised as ""theater of the absurd"" and lacking serious evidence.
Trevor Reed, a student at the University of North Texas, said he could not remember the events of last summer because he was drunk when he was detained after leaving a party in Moscow.
But he denied the charge in court after hearing what he said was the flimsy evidence presented during the trial and the investigation's failure to obtain video evidence that could prove his innocence. 
""It's clearly political,"" he told reporters in court. 
The conviction is likely to spur media speculation that Reed could become part of a possible prisoner swap reportedly being negotiated by Moscow and Washington. Neither side has confirmed such talks are taking place. 
Russia convicted U.S. citizen Paul Whelan, also a former Marine, last month of espionage and sentenced him to 16 years in jail. Whelan denied wrongdoing. U.S. investor Michael Calvey is being held under house arrest on fraud charges he denies.
Whelan's lawyer has said he believes Moscow wants to exchange Whelan for an arms dealer, Viktor Bout, and another Russian held in U.S. prisons. 
Prosecutors accused Reed of grabbing a police officer who was behind the wheel of a car after the American was detained on Aug. 15. That, they said, caused the vehicle to swerve dangerously. He was also accused of elbowing a second officer. 
Reed said he travelled to Moscow in May last year to learn Russian and see his Russian girlfriend. She burst into tears in court and was escorted outside after swearing loudly during the verdict.
""This conviction, and a sentence of nine years, for an alleged crime that so obviously did not occur, is ridiculous,"" said John Sullivan, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow. ""This was theater of the absurd."" 
Reed's (NASDAQ:REED) father, Joey, said he planned to appeal publicly to President Vladimir Putin to intervene in the case.

""We believe (this case) happened for one reason – he stumbled him into police custody because he was intoxicated, and once they saw they had a former U.S. Marine they said 'We're gonna keep this guy',"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday the ""tide is turning"" in U.S. dealings with China, saying there is international support for American policies even as he said he was dismayed at the number of countries supporting Beijing's new security law for Hong Kong.
Reflecting rising tensions between Washington and Beijing, Pompeo took a tough line on China in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
""We see the Chinese Communist Party for what it is: the central threat of our times,"" Pompeo said.
He said other countries are supporting U.S. initiatives like the push not to use Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] equipment in 5G networks and stepped-up maritime maneuvers in the South China Sea.
""Our vigorous diplomacy has helped lead an international awakening to the threat of the CCP. Senators, the tide is turning,"" Pompeo said.
Washington and Beijing each recently closed one of the other's consulates and Pompeo recently announced an end to Hong Kong's special trading status.
However, Pompeo also noted the difficulty of forming an international alliance, given China's economic strength. He said he was ""surprised and dismayed"" at the number of countries that backed Beijing's crackdown on the autonomy of Hong Kong.
Pompeo declined to directly address reports that Russia offered bounties for killing U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. ""The proper people have been aware of every threat to our soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan,"" he said, in response to a question from Senator Bob Menendez, the top committee Democrat.
He defended the administration's decision to remove thousands of troops from Germany. Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he had spoken to senior German officials who considered the withdrawal ""an insult to Germany.""
Pompeo was testifying publicly at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing for the first time since April 2019, discussing the State Department's budget.
President Donald Trump's administration has tried to slash spending on diplomacy since it took office, something rejected by Congress every year.
Committee Democrats released a report this week harshly criticizing Pompeo's tenure at State, saying he had harmed diplomacy by leaving jobs open for months, treating career diplomats poorly and promoting a culture of retaliation.
Lawmakers asked Pompeo about Trump's abrupt firing in May of Steve Linick, the State Department inspector general, as he investigated arms sales to Saudi Arabia and allegations that Pompeo improperly ordered a taxpayer-funded subordinate to handle personal errands.

Pompeo denied wrongdoing, repeating earlier assertions that Linick had improperly leaked information.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Hidden and protected for millennia, an ancient shipwreck in Greece opens to the public for the first time on Aug. 3, fusing archaeological wonders in the depths of the sea with the marvels of modern-day artificial intelligence.
Access to underwater sites is typically restricted in Greece to preserve their integrity. But authorities have been able to allow recreational diving at the shipwreck at Peristera, thanks to computer surveillance technology.
Underwater cameras monitor the site, and use image recognition software to alert administrators instantly if the wreck is in danger of being disturbed. 
The site is located off a tiny outcrop off the Aegean island of Alonnisos, where a wooden vessel sank in the late 5th century B.C., taking with it thousands of amphorae, pointy-bottomed clay jugs used for commerce across the ancient Mediterranean.
""We were lucky to start with one of the most beautiful ancient wrecks in the world. They call it the Acropolis of sea wrecks,"" said George Papalambrou, an assistant professor of power propulsion at the National Technical University of Athens.
Papalambrou, who works at the University's School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, says the custom-made monitoring system -- with solar power, recognition software and luminosity-triggered lens wipers to unclog debris -- could be a template deployed to other underwater sites.
""The idea is to try to resemble how the human optical system, our eyes, are able to determine an object which passes in front of us,"" he said.
Dimitris Kourkoumelis, an underwater archaeologist at Greece's Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, says the pilot project could make more sites accessible. 
""It is the first time, and not only not just in Greece but on a pan-European level, that such a site, such a shipwreck so large with so many objects, is opening to the public and divers,"" Kourkoumelis said.
Archaeologists say the wreck gives insight into commerce in the period known as the Golden Age of Athens. The 3,000-3,500 amphorae on board may have been transporting wine.

""I have dived at many sites. It was the first time I felt so emotional,"" Kourkoumelis said. ""Truly, its difficult to explain ... it is something really impressive.""

The government will treat all 560 people as ""martyrs"" and each family will be offered 10 million diners ($8,380) in compensation, Hisham Daoud, the prime minister's adviser, told reporters.
Protests began on Oct. 1 and continued for several months, with hundreds of thousands of Iraqis demanding jobs, services and the removal of the ruling elite, which they said was corrupt.

The project, similar to those undertaken in other countries, was carried out by wastewater management technology firm Kando and researchers from Israeli educational institutions including Ben Gurion University and the Technion in Haifa.
The research pointed to wastewater as a means of detecting outbreaks of the disease early as well as the ability to narrow hotspots down to specific streets, Kando said on Thursday.
Early studies by scientists in The Netherlands, France, Australia and elsewhere suggest sewage sampling for signs of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could help assess the number of infections in a geographic area, without having to test every person.
Samples of wastewater from the Paris sewage system have been showing traces of COVID-19 again since the end of June, having vanished when France imposed a lockdown.
For the Israeli pilot study, the coastal city of Ashkelon, with 150,000 residents, was chosen as it was thought to have a low number of cases. But researchers discovered significant remnants of the coronavirus in municipal wastewater, Kando said. 
The results suggest that tracking coronavirus remnants in the sewer network can be a more efficient gauge of the extent of outbreaks than testing individuals, especially given the asymptomatic nature of many suffering from COVID-19, it said. 
""This will allow authorities to take actions to contain future outbreaks,"" said Nadav Davidovitch, director of Ben Gurion University's School of Public Health.

Kando said it is in talks with several cities in Israel and abroad about deploying the system.

The striking divide in the fortunes of the country's key tourism industry stems from the distortions in international travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Dubrovnik, the country's top tourism destination, has become one of the weakest spots on the Croatian coast this year since it is heavily dependent on visitors arriving by air or on cruise ships and those attending conferences and staying in hotels.
""We hoped to reach some 20-25% in turnover compared to last season,"" said Tiffany Cvjetkovic Rudenjak, a member of the family which owns the downtown Lanii restaurant. ""We're still not there, but we hope August can change things.""
According to Ana Hrnic, director of the city tourist board, at the end of July Dubrovnik saw just 30% of last year's tourist numbers. For the first seven months of this year the figure is even lower, 13% compared to the same period last year.
Hrnic said guest numbers had risen since mid-June when air traffic within Europe began to resume and had picked up more since mid-July when Britain eased its travel restrictions since the city is particularly popular among Britons.
""So far domestic guests and Germans have been among the most numerous, but we expect an increase in arrivals from the United Kingdom in the next few weeks,"" Hrnic said. Some 60% of hotels were now open and she said she hoped more would open in August.
Ivan Maslac, commercial director of Dubrovnik airport, said that in the last two weeks, flights from the UK had been quite packed in the circumstances. The airport offered discounts to airlines on take-off and landing fees and an incentive payment of two euros per passenger, he said.
Almost 20% percent of Croatia's economic output depends on tourism and the country hopes that this year it can earn around a third of last year's tourism receipts which amounted to some 12 billion euros ($14.11 billion).
At the moment there are some 600,000 foreign guests on the Croatian coast, many of whom are visiting northern Istrian peninsula where the number of guests from Germany and Slovenia exceeded 80% of last year's figure.
Easy accessibility by car and accommodation in camp sites and private houses are major factors behind their numbers, said Denis Ivosevic from the Istrian Tourist Board.
Despite an increase in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks in Croatia, which mostly hit the capital Zagreb and the east of the country, visitors do not seem overly worried.
Bence Smid, an IT consultant visiting Dubrovnik, had driven from Hungary, crossing a moveable bridge to the island of Murter in the central Adriatic.
""I wouldn't say it is dangerous to be here,"" he said.

The Chinese ambassador said China was not a strategic threat to India and that the ""general structure that we can't live without each other remains unchanged"".
The statement came after New Delhi's recent moves to ban or sideline Chinese business interests in one of the world's biggest markets, even as the border remains tense with many more troops on the ground than usual.
""China advocates win-win cooperation and opposes a zero-sum game,"" Ambassador Sun Weidong wrote on Twitter. ""Our economies are highly complementary, interwoven and interdependent. Forced decoupling is against the trend and will only lead to a 'lose-lose' outcome.""
Officials of the nuclear-armed neighbours have been talking regularly to de-escalate the border standoff after the June 15 clash in the Galwan Valley of India's Ladakh region when the Indian officials said soldiers were beaten to death with rocks and clubs.
Indian officials say Chinese troops have intruded on to its side in the remote western region, while China says it has not breached the disputed border and has asked India to restrain its frontline troops.
India's Ministry of External Affairs said in an online briefing that a troops disengagement process as agreed by the two sides had yet to be completed, and that another round of commander-level talks would be held soon.
""We expect that the Chinese side will sincerely work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas at the earliest,"" spokesman Anurag Srivastava said.
Analysts say the worst fighting between the giant countries in decades is likely to push India closer to the United States, both strategically and in trade.
China and India fought a brief border war in 1962 and China is a close ally of India's long-time foe, Pakistan.

Charlie Elphicke, 49, whose wife Natalie succeeded him last year as the Member of Parliament for Dover (NYSE:DOV) in southern England, was charged with committing the first offence in 2007 against one individual and two further offences against a second person in 2016.
He had denied the charges.
Natalie Elphicke said on Twitter that the verdict ""ends my 25-year marriage to the only man I have ever loved"".
Southwark Crown Court heard that Charlie Elphicke, who represented Dover in parliament between 2010 and 2019, became sexually suggestive and lunged at a woman in 2007, attempting to kiss and touch her while his wife was away. He paid her in cash to keep it secret from his wife. 
Nine years later, he forcibly kissed a parliamentary worker, the court heard, and later that year, sexually touched her again despite her having said she had no interest in him. 
Elphicke said he did kiss the first woman but stopped when she did not reciprocate, and while he was ""besotted"" with the second woman, he said he did not touch her. 
Natalie Dawson, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecuction Service, said in a statement: ""Charles Elphicke abused his power and influence over these women to make unwanted and forceful sexual advances towards them."" 
""Elphicke has lied repeatedly about his conduct and failed to take responsibility for his behaviour and the harm suffered by his victims.""
He will be sentenced on Sept. 15.

Last year, an independent inquiry was commissioned after Britain's parliament became one of several institutions to be embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal after abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted women and men to share stories about improper behaviour.

Eid al-Adha falls on Saturday in the South Asian nation, and like Muslims across the world, Pakistanis purchase cattle to sacrifice on the occasion as a religious obligation.
""It is very busy day just a day before Eid and we don't have time for a bike wash,"" Dawood told Reuters as he busied himself lathering a cow with soap before using the pressure hose to clean the animal.
Sacrificial animals are treated with deference by Pakistanis, who often decorate the cattle they have purchased with colourful garlands.
""We bring these animals here because we want them neat and clean because it is an animal for sacrifice and we are happy to see it happy,"" one customer, Osama Haider Ali, told Reuters.
Dawood's shop is located in a densely populated district of Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, and is one of many vehicle service stations with customers queuing up with animals.
""Servicing"" cattle is not as easy as motorcycles, says Dawood who charges 200 to 300 Pakistani rupees ($1.20 to $1.80) per wash, for which he uses shampoo, soap, brush and a hose. 
""A vehicles remains in its place ... but washing an animal is risky. It can hit you, it can kick you. It can break the rope"".
Eid al-Adha is observed by Muslims to commemorate their belief that prophet Abraham was willing to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God, before God replaced his son with a ram to be sacrificed instead.
Muslims who can afford it sacrifice cattle. But it can also be a camel, goat, sheep or ram, depending on the region. 
The coronavirus has cast a shadow over this Eid, with fears of another spike in infections prompting authorities to warn people to minimise movement, avoid cattle markets and refrain from public gatherings to witness the slaughter of sacrificial animals.
Eid al-Fitr, marked in May, was followed by a spike in COVID-19 infections with new daily cases hitting up to 7,000 in June. Daily infections have fallen to around 1,100 in Pakistan over the last few days of July.
Pakistan has recorded over 277,000 infections and close to 6,000 deaths from the disease. 
While cattle markets across the country have seen reduced footfall, a sizeable number of people are still going to them to choose an animal.

BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - The United States will take years to move its main military command in Europe from Germany to NATO headquarters in Belgium and updating facilities will be costly, three former senior officials said.
Despite concerns that the move announced on Wednesday is politically motivated, they told Reuters that ""streamlining and rationalising"" the U.S. military presence in Europe made some strategic sense. 
Under a plan to reduce U.S. troop numbers in Germany, President Donald Trump has instructed the United States European Command (EUCOM) to be moved from Stuttgart to Mons, near Brussels.
Mons is where NATO has its Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), the defence alliance's top military command. 
""This is not picking up your tent and moving to a different campground,"" said retired U.S. General Ben Hodges, who commanded U.S. army forces in Europe from 2014 until 2017. ""SHAPE is desperately in need of renovation and repair."" 
Jamie Shea, a former senior NATO official now at the Friends of Europe think tank in Brussels, said the buildings at SHAPE ""date from the 1960s and look as if they date from the 1960s."" 
""The site needs to be rebuilt,"" he said.
NATO's new headquarters, which alliance officials moved into in 2018, took two decades of planning and construction. Delays cost more than $1 billion. 
The move to Mons is part of a plan to withdraw about 12,000 of the 36,000 U.S. troops in Germany. Trump announced his intention last month to cut the U.S. troop contingent in Germany by about a third, saying Berlin had been taking advantage of the United States while not meeting financial obligations to NATO. 
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the decision was part of a review of U.S. troop presence around the world. 
U.S. Air Force General Tod Wolters, the top commander of SHAPE and U.S. EUCOM, said moving 2,000 U.S. EUCOM personnel to Mons would increase efficiency.
""On the U.S. side, they can certainly make a much more convincing argument for this decision than for the decision to withdraw thousands of troops from Germany"", Shea said.
He said the top U.S. general in Europe always led both military commands - that of NATO troops in Mons and that of U.S. forces in Europe, situated in Stuttgart since 1967.
Hodges said that, like Germany, neither of the two main beneficiaries of the relocation of troops within Europe - Italy and Belgium - was close to meeting the NATO goal of spending 2% of economic output on defence.
Wolters and Esper were ""doing their best to take a wrong-headed decision by the White House and do the strategic analysis after the decision was made ... and they have come up with the best they could to meet a presidential order,"" he said.
""I think the damage could have been worse."" 
""CLUMSY WORK""
SHAPE moved in 1967 from Rocquencourt near Paris to Camp Casteau, a Belgian Army summer training ground near Mons, after France decided to pull out of NATO's integrated military structure.
To overcome SHAPE's objections about the distance from Brussels to Mons, Belgium's government agreed to build a high-speed motorway between the cities, NATO says.
Retired German general Hans-Lothar Domroese, who led one of the highest NATO commands in the Dutch town of Brunssum until 2016, said bringing the two headquarters together in Mons would eliminate the inconvenience of travel and reduce costs.
But he said the redeployment of U.S. troops within Europe ""doesn't make any sense."" 

""The costs will be higher than the military benefit. This is either clumsy work - or the intention is to annoy someone,"" he said.

Police found five plastic bags containing the body of her husband, who had died four days earlier, at a flat on St Petersburg's main street, the source said. Police seized a knife, cutting board and a plastic box from the scene.
Russia's Investigative Committee, a law enforcement agency that handles probes into serious crimes, said it was working to establish the cause of the man's death. It did not name the woman or man, but gave their dates of birth as 1984 and 1989.
St Petersburg-based media outlet Fontanka identified the man as a rap musician who performed under the pseudonym Andy Cartwright. 
It said police learnt of the incident from a lawyer who said the woman had called him to say she had chopped up the body in order to hide it, but no longer knew what to do.

MINSK (Reuters) - Russia demanded an explanation from Belarus on Thursday, after Minsk arrested a group of alleged Russian mercenaries and said they were suspected of plotting ""acts of terrorism"" before a presidential election.
Belarusian state television broadcast footage on Wednesday of more than 30 suspected Russian private military contractors being detained near the capital Minsk. Authorities said they had received information that over 200 fighters had entered the country to destabilize it before the Aug. 9 election.
A criminal case was opened on Thursday after Belarus said is suspected ""the preparation of terrorist acts"". Some of the captured men had confessed to trying to orchestrate a revolution, and Russia's ambassador was summoned to explain, officials said. 
Tensions over the arrests risk worsening already strained relations with traditional ally Russia.
Moscow denies it uses mercenaries. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow wanted an exhaustive explanation from Belarus about the group detained and hoped their rights would be observed fully. 
""We don't have information about any illegal activity carried out by them,"" Peskov said in Moscow. ""We hope to receive information that will allow us to sort this out"".
The election campaign that has posed the biggest challenge in years to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has allowed little dissent in over a quarter of a century in power in the country of 9.5 million between Russia and European member state Poland. 
Authorities announced additional security measures for campaign events on Thursday. The opposition feared Lukashenko would use the alleged plot to intensify a crackdown on rivals.
Lukashenko, 65, has accused opponents of working with foreign backers to overthrow him and has jailed two of his main election rivals.
He is expected to win the election despite growing opposition and concerns about the economy, human rights and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
'PLOTTING A REVOLUTION'
Belarusian Security Council State Secretary Andrei Ravkov told reporters up to 200 mercenaries were being hunted by law enforcement agents.
Andrey Dmitriev, a presidential candidate, quoted Ravkov as saying some of the people detained had confessed to plotting ""a revolution"". 
They were alleged to have trained in the Russian cities of Pskov and Nevel and were mostly bombers and snipers, Dmitriev told reporters after meeting Ravkov. The authorities did not rule out shutting down internet access in Belarus, he said.
State media have suggested the detained men worked for Wagner, a private military contractor. 
Footage of the group's arrest showed they had Sudanese currency and a Sudanese phone card with them, prompting some Belarusians to suggest they were going through Minsk en route to Africa.
Responding to criticism, Lukashenko says he has delivered years of economic and political stability and that the state covers many of people's core needs as in Soviet times. 

After weeks of street protests, the opposition has rallied around Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, the wife of one of the jailed election candidates, who took his place after his arrest.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The biggest party in Malaysia's ruling coalition withdrew from a political alliance with the prime minister on Thursday, two days after its former leader and premier Najib Razak was sentenced to jail over the multi-billion dollar 1MDB scandal.
The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party said it would continue to support the government in parliament, but the move still undermines Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's administration.
UMNO makes up the largest bloc in the coalition, which has only a two-seat pariliamentary majority. 
UMNO president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told a news conference the party would quit the Perikatan Nasional coalition and strengthen its partnership with the Islamic party PAS, also in the coalition.
When asked if the move was linked to Najib's conviction, Ahmad Zahid told reporters it was ""up to you to interpret"".
Muhyiddin's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Najib made no comment.
Political analysts said UMNO's move made it easier to force elections, in which it might do better than in 2018, when it lost power amid anger over the scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
""They are no longer constrained within the coalition, which means the lawmakers can walk off at any time... the government could collapse at any time,"" said Ibrahim Suffian of independent pollster Merdeka Center.
UMNO joined up with Muhyiddin's Bersatu party and others five months ago after the collapse of the coalition that had ousted Najib on an anti-corruption platform.
Najib was sentenced to 12 years and a nearly $50 million fine for abuse of power and found guilty of six other charges in the first of dozens of verdicts he faces. He denies wrongdoing and his punishments have been delayed pending appeal.
Several UMNO leaders also face corruption charges. 
Aside from the cases, party members had become increasingly unhappy to play second fiddle despite being the biggest party in the coalition, a source close to the UMNO party leadership said.
UMNO leaders, including Najib, have been pushing for a snap election and believe they can win an election without Muhyiddin, political experts say. 
""Muhyiddin's position has been weakened. If we have an election, his party will most likely be wiped out,"" said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with Singapore's Institute of International Affairs. 

Separately Muhyiddin faces another test to his premiership. The opposition-run state of Sabah on Malaysian Borneo called on Thursday for a snap state election after attempts by the prime minister's allies to win control.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Dozens of Thai demonstrators singing patriotic songs and shouting ""long live the king"" rallied in the capital on Thursday in response to a series of anti-government protests led by student groups in recent weeks.
The crowd, a mix mainly of the retired and some vocational students gathered at Bangkok's Democracy Monument to show support for the monarchy and the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the royalist former army chief who ousted an elected administration six years ago. 
Some recent protests against Prayuth have seen veiled negative references to the powerful monarchy, despite a law forbidding criticism of the king. Such references would once have been unthinkable.
""Many Thais have been concerned about offensive things against the monarchy, especially on social media, and no group has come out to defend (the monarchy),"" said Totsapol Manoonyarat, a representative of the Vocational Students for the Nation, a group backing the rally.
Many protesters wore yellow, a colour associated with the royal family.
Prayuth's party campaigned in last year's election on a vision of traditional Thai culture and loyalty to King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
But public opposition to Prayuth has grown in recent months.
University and high school students have rallied to demand the dissolution of parliament, an end to harassment of government critics, and amendments to the military-written constitution that critics say virtually guaranteed victory for Prayuth's party last year.
Hundreds of anti-government protesters held a separate rally in Bangkok on Thursday, with university student groups unperturbed by the pro-government demonstration.
""If we continued to stay silent, I feel ashamed of myself. The students movement needs support,"" said a 31-year-old who attended the protest, who requested his name not be used due to concern about his safety. 
If the pro-establishment rally marks the start of further counter demonstrations, it could raise the risk of confrontations between pro-democracy and conservative movements.

Since a 2006 coup ousted populist billionaire premier Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand has seen periodic confrontations between his ""Red Shirt"" supporters, largely from among the rural poor and urban working classes, and royalist, pro-establishment ""Yellow Shirts"", which draw support from Bangkok's middle class.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Looking at his half-deserted cafe in central Cairo, once bustling with customers day and night, Essam Ali thinks of cutting his losses and closing for good.
He, like the thousands of other cafe owners in the city, pulls down the shutters, reluctantly, at midnight.
Egypt has allowed cafes to reopen after coronavirus restrictions were lifted, but has limited opening hours in non-tourist areas to midnight, slashed capacity to 50% and banned water pipes.
Months of restrictions have hit cafes hard. Cairo, a city of some 20 million or so, never sleeps. Life picks up at night as residents seek to escape the daytime heat, promenading through the streets and drinking tea until the wee hours.
Cafes are found in almost every street and are an important employer. Ali has laid off 14 workers as daily customer numbers fall to 50-60 from some 250 before the pandemic.
""When I have 300 pounds ($19) at the end of the day, how can I pay for my products? How can I pay for my electricity? How can I pay my taxes?,"" said Ali.
""I am honestly thinking about closing my cafe. Why? Because it is not worth it anymore,"" he said.
The biggest business used to be in providing water pipes, typically handed from person to person within a group, for smoking tobacco. 
Losing the pipes is not the only wrench. Customers are also struggling to adjust to the new opening hours.
""We are naturally a people that likes to stay up at night, especially during summertime,"" said 30-year old Salah Ali. ""So the fact that coffee shops now close at 12 is, for us, culturally difficult.""
Hassan Ahmed Mohamed, 65, who runs a small cafe, said this is the worst business has been since the cafe opened in 1960.
Egypt has been hit hard by the pandemic, which has hammered the vital tourism sector and also slashed Suez Canal revenues and workers' remittances due to a global trade downturn.
Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in March approved a 100 billion pound stimulus package, including payments of salaries for staff sent home by their employers and cash for informal workers.
Cabinet spokesman Nader Saad told a local television channel last month that cafes could open longer in tourist areas and would vary in summer and winter but otherwise hours would continue to be limited even after the pandemic was over as Egypt comes more into line with opening hours in the United States and Europe. Citizens sitting in a cafe beyond 10 pm were not productive, he added. 
The government had first allowed cafes to reopen until 10 pm then last week extended hours to midnight.
The state press centre did not respond to questions on how the government is supporting cafes. Saad could not be reached.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's security forces on Thursday cleared people off streets of the capital Harare and forced shops to close, a day before planned anti-government protests during the worst economic crisis in nearly a decade.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has struggled to keep his promise to revive the economy, with many Zimbabweans complaining they are worse off than when he replaced the autocratic Robert Mugabe after an army coup in 2017.
Activists have called for street rallies on Friday against corruption in government and economic hardships including soaring inflation that has eroded salaries and pensions.
Armed soldiers and anti-riot police patrolled on foot and in trucks, telling people to leave central Harare.
""Why are they forcing shops to close before the stipulated time?"" asked one nervous motorist, asking not to be named.
""I have no option but to close the shop since the town is now deserted,"" added a shop owner, locking up her electricals business. 
By soon after midday, downtown Harare was largely empty.
On Wednesday, Mnangagwa said Friday's protest would constitute an ""insurrection"" by the opposition.
A police statement said no demonstrations would be allowed on Friday. ""All security arms of government are on full alert and will deal decisively with any individuals or groups fomenting violence and sending threats or provocative messages through the social media or any other means,"" it said. 
Soldiers manned checkpoints on roads leading into the city centre, with vehicles turned back.
Critics say Mnangagwa, like other authoritarian leaders round the world, is exploiting the coronavirus lockdown to stifle dissent. 
Illustrating the crisis, senior doctors at government hospitals said they had stopped work on Thursday over poor conditions, joining thousands of nurses who quit work last month to press for U.S. dollar salaries.
Seven babies were stillborn in one night at a major hospital this week because their mothers did not get adequate medical care due to the nurses' strike.

LONDON (Reuters) - China on Thursday accused the United States of stoking a new Cold War because certain politicians were searching for a scapegoat to bolster support ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.
U.S. President Donald Trump identifies China as the West's main rival, and has accused President Xi Jinping of taking advantage over trade and not telling the truth over the novel coronavirus outbreak, which Trump calls the ""China plague"".
Asked if he saw a new Cold War, China's ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, said the United States had started a trade war with China and that there would be no winner from such an approach.
""It is not China that has become assertive. It's the other side of the Pacific Ocean who want to start new Cold War on China, so we have to make response to that,"" Liu told reporters. ""We have no interest in any Cold War, we have no interest in any war.
""We have all seen what is happening in the United States, they tried to scapegoat China, they want to blame China for their problems,"" he said. ""We all know this is an election year.""
The envoy did not mention Trump or Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden by name, but he said some U.S. politicians were doing and saying anything to get elected.
""They want to do anything including treating China as an enemy,"" Liu said. ""Probably they think they need an enemy, they think they want a Cold War but we have no interest, we keep telling America, China is not your enemy, China is your friend, your partner."" 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this month that the United States wanted to build a global coalition to counter China as he accused Beijing of exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to further its own interests.
Asked if relations with the United States had deteriorated beyond repair, Liu said: ""I don't think we have passed the point of no return."" 
After British Prime Minister Boris Johnson slapped a ban on Huawei's participation in 5G networks, Liu bluntly warned that the United Kingdom it had no future if it tried to decouple from the Communist state.
""It is hard to image a 'Global Britain' that bypasses or excludes China, decoupling from China means decoupling from opportunities, decoupling from growth and decoupling from the future,"" Liu said.

He said London had poisoned relations by meddling in its former colony of Hong Kong and cautioned that the United Kingdom would ""pay the price"" if it wanted to treat China as a hostile state.

HANOI (Reuters) - There had been so few coronavirus cases in Vietnam that every patient was known by a number: Patient 17 brought the virus back from Europe after an initial wave of infections from Wuhan. Patient 91, a British pilot, almost died.
Now there is a new number that has become an unwelcome marker. 
Patient 416, a 57-year-old man in the central city of Danang, tested positive for coronavirus last week after more than three months without a new infection in the Southeast Asian country. 
In just over a few days, a total of 47 people linked to Danang have tested positive, signaling the start of a third, untraceable and more concerning wave of infections in a country that had reopened faster than most of the world, confident it had beaten the disease.
The surge has spread to six cities and provinces in six days, including Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and the Central Highlands.
Vietnam's Prime Minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, slammed his fist on the table during a meeting on Wednesday in which he warned that the entire country was now at risk of infection. 
""Everyone, including health workers, had let their guard down months before the reintroduction of the virus,"" said Truong Huu Khang, head of the infectious diseases department at the Nhi Dong I Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. 
""People had stopped wearing masks in public and some health workers didn't pay enough attention to 'high risk' cases"".
So successful was its fight against COVID-19 that the post-pandemic ""new normal"" in Vietnam looked very much like the old one. Bars, restaurants and hotels had reopened with minimal social distancing measures in place. In early July, the number of domestic air passengers even rose by 27% compared to the previous year, according to state media.
But that oasis in a pandemic-stricken world began to disintegrate when Patient 416 went to a local hospital in Danang with a cough and fever. The last person to test positive for an infection in the community was a 16-year-old girl in April.
Patient 416 was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, according to Vietnam's health ministry, and did not test positive for the coronavirus until July 23. Days earlier, he had visited other hospitals in Danang to help his ailing mother, and attended one party and a wedding.
Vietnam's outbreak had been under control, thanks to an aggressive contact-tracing system and a centralized quarantine program, which had kept the coronavirus tally to under 500 cases, with no deaths.
""We acted fast and fiercely back in March but the virus is still breaking out all over the world,"" said Khang. 
""We can't let our guard down. This third wave is the cost for a moment of complacency"".
TESTING PATIENCE
The origin of the outbreak in Danang is unclear.
News of Patient 416's infection prompted the mass exodus of over 80,000 tourists from the popular resort city. On Thursday, authorities in Hanoi said they would begin the mass testing of 20,000 of those tourists who had returned to the capital, as Vietnam's human-powered contact tracing system was redeployed.
Some of the latest cases, including Patient 449, an American citizen based in Danang who appears to have developed symptoms in mid-June, indicate the virus had been quietly spreading in the city for several weeks.
It was not clear when Patient 449, who the health ministry said suffered from chronic pneumonia, was tested for the virus, but he was treated for COVID-like symptoms at three different hospitals before testing positive at a fourth hospital in Ho Chi Minh City.
The health ministry stopped publishing testing data in mid-May, when 260,000 tests had been carried out.
On Monday, the ministry said it had completed 430,000 tests since the pandemic began, indicating that testing continued to rise as thousands of returning overseas Vietnamese were quarantined.
It was not clear, however, to what extent COVID-19 testing outside quarantine had continued. Khang said some outside testing, especially on patients with pneumonia symptoms, had been in effect but on a significantly smaller scale.
Although the two issues have not been officially linked, the government has over recent days made several strongly-worded statements about illegal immigration, indicating that the source of the new infections may have come from overseas.
""I think it's most likely a reintroduction of the virus from elsewhere, sometime in the last two months, but how, when, or where remain entirely speculative at present,"" said Guy Thwaites, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City.
""What is happening now in Vietnam was almost inevitable. It is almost impossible to isolate an entire country from a global pandemic,"" said Thwaites

""Cases will occur"".

NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Myanmar will postpone elections in parts of war-torn Rakhine state if the military declares them unsafe, a senior election official said on Thursday, prompting a backlash from ethnic parties with strong support in the region.
""It is necessary to have peace and stability to hold elections,"" said Union Election Commission chair Hla Thein, adding that the army-controlled ministries of defence and home affairs would soon determine whether the region was stable.
""If they cannot give that recommendation, we will not do it,"" he told Reuters in an interview in the capital, Naypyitaw.
Military spokesmen did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
The nation goes to the polls on Nov. 8 in what analysts see as an important test of the transition away from direct military rule, but preparations have been complicated by the coronavirus pandemic and escalating ethnic conflict.
Longtime opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party took power in 2016 after a landslide election win that ended half a century of army rule, though the military retains significant powers. 
While Suu Kyi remains wildly popular among the country's majority Bamar Buddhist population, analysts say support for her party has waned among minority communities.
The Rakhine ethnic party, Arakan National Party (ANP), had a strong showing in the 2015 polls but was denied major roles in the local administration, fuelling resentment against the NLD government.
The region has since been engulfed by war between government troops and ethnic Rakhine rebels seeking greater autonomy. 
""If there is no one to represent a constituency, people will suffer more,"" Maung Hla Kyaw, a Rakhine lawmaker, told Reuters.
""If the election is postponed with the excuse of security, people will lose trust in the whole democratic system,"" he said.
Polls cancelled in 2015 in several areas affected by ethnic conflict were never held.
The minority Rohingya population was stripped of voting rights ahead of the 2015 election after the temporary documents many held were nullified. More than 730,000 fled to neighbouring Bangladesh after a military crackdown in 2017, but several hundred thousand remain.
Asked about the Rohingya, Hla Thein, the Union Election Commission chair, said only people who were above 18 and held citizenship would be able to vote. 
""If one is not in line with these facts, we will not include them in the voters' list,"" he said.

The Palestinian Authority (PA) has imposed a partial lockdown over areas under its control to battle a surge in new cases, forcing many businesses to close and sending unemployment to an estimated 18 percent. 
""Who exactly can afford (sheep) to sacrifice?,"" livestock merchant Daoud Ebayat asked at a hillside market in Bethlehem. ""People are unable to cover expenses for their children, there's no work.""
Around 115,000 sheep and ten thousand calves were sold during Eid al-Adha in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem last year, according to ministry data.
But with many out of work, and public servants on reduced pay as the PA attempts to weather a financial crisis, local officials say sheep sales have plummeted. 
""There will be a decrease, some are saying, of about 20% or more,"" said Tareq Abu Laban, an official at the Palestinian agriculture ministry, noting that final figures were not yet available. 
In Bethlehem, several dozen customers haggled with merchants at the sparsely-crowded market, hoping for a bargain on sheep that Ebayat says sell for around 2,000 shekels ($588) each. The average monthly income in the West Bank is $350. 
Many buyers share larger animals, such as cows or camels, with their extended families to manage the cost ahead of the four-day Muslim festival, which begins on Friday.
Eyad Daraghmeh, who runs a slaughterhouse in Al-Bireh, pointed to empty animal pens at his sprawling facility as evidence of Palestinians' economic hardship. 
""These sheds used to be full of livestock and sacrifices, at least 6,000 available for slaughter,"" Daraghmeh said. Behind him a lone calf walked around an otherwise empty pen.
Fawzat Rayyan, a livestock breeder in the northern West Bank city of Nablus, said that by this point in a typical year he would have sold 120 animals. 
""This year it is hardly half that number ... the coronavirus is weighing down on us,"" he said. 

Palestinians have reported 75 deaths and over 10,000 COVID-19 cases in the occupied West Bank, the majority of them in the last two months.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",A tour of crumbling Malta villa where the Queen lived in her 20s,"By Christopher Scicluna
VALLETTA (Reuters) - It is the only property outside of Britain that Queen Elizabeth called home.
A crumbling villa near Malta's capital, Valletta, where the heir to the English throne lived between 1949 and 1951, is about to get a new lease of life as a museum of the Mediterranean island's links with the United Kingdom and the royal family.
The arcaded, two-storey property is a shadow of its former self. The rooms are bare, paint is peeling off the walls to reveal old murals beneath, the enclosed garden is overgrown and part of a colonnaded belvedere in it has collapsed.
Now that the government of Malta has finally acquired the Villa Guardamangia after years of trying, it hopes to restore it to its former state when it was a charming, if relatively modest home for the future British queen.
The renovation could cost as much as 10 million euros, said Heritage Malta curator Kenneth Gambin during a recent walk-through to show off the dilapidated property.
""We are planning to invite anyone who remembers the royal couple when they lived in Malta to meet us, share their memories and possibly their photos,"" he said.
SWEEPING VIEWS
Princess Elizabeth was in the first years of her marriage at the time, and moved to Malta when her husband, Philip, was based there in command of a Royal Navy frigate.
The villa stands proudly in a narrow street at the top of Guardamangia Hill, and at the time commanded sweeping views of the harbour of Marsamxett and Valletta, where the Navy's frigates were moored.
Much of the structure was built in limestone in the mid-eighteenth century as a summer house.
Additions early in the nineteenth century included a belvedere overlooking a large, enclosed garden that served as a backdrop to one of the most frequently used pictures of the young royal couple on the island.
Malta was then a bustling British colony and a key naval base in the middle of the Mediterranean and on the route to India.
Guardamangia Hill itself was named after a ""guardia"" or guard, which Maltese and British troops jointly mounted as they trapped French Napoleonic forces for almost two years in Valletta, a siege that led the British to take over Malta at the islanders' invitation in 1800.
MOUNTBATTEN'S OFFER
The property was rented in 1929 to Lord Louis Mountbatten, Philip's uncle, who made it available to the royal couple.
It featured six bedrooms, three bathrooms, a grand hall, servants' quarters on the ground floor and, unusually for Malta, a fireplace in most rooms. The main entrance was through a small but elaborately decorated porch accessed by steps on each side.
Those were relatively relaxing times for Elizabeth, then in her early twenties. Security was light and she felt comfortable enough driving herself around in a humble Morris Minor.
Newspapers chronicled people turning up at the villa to hand her oranges. They reported her going to the cinema and a local hairdresser, enjoying picnics in the countryside and swimming at Sliema beach, three miles from her home.
Pictures show the princess chatting with locals, including an old lady weaving traditional lace. She hosted parties for service wives at the villa.
The royal couple left Malta in 1950 for the birth of Elizabeth's second child, Princess Anne, in August 1950, but they were back by Christmas.
They never again set foot in the villa after their departure in 1951, despite returning to Malta several times in later years. 
On her most recent visit in 2015, the Queen was presented with a painting of her old home by then-Maltese President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca.
""Oh look, Guardamangia, that's very nice to have,"" she was reported to have said, adding that the property ""looks rather sad now.""
HERITAGE MUSEUM
For many years after the royal couple departed, Villa Guardamangia was occupied by a woman who lived alone, using some of the ground floor rooms.
The property fell into disrepair, but repeated government attempts to buy it from the owners were rebuffed until earlier this year.
It was finally acquired by Heritage Malta, a government agency, for some five million euros.
There is much work to be done. Pieces of statues that once stood in the garden are piled up in a room, the servants' quarters are derelict, bathrooms are destroyed and traditional patterned Maltese floor tiling – which the princess reportedly found cold to walk on - have faded.
""The villa had separate apartments for the prince and the princess, each including a bedroom, walk-in wardrobe, an anteroom and a bathroom,"" said curator Gambin.
The plan is not just to restore the villa to the way it looked several decades ago, but also to turn it into a museum of Malta's history as a British colony until independence in 1964, and the links with the British royal family. 

Despite the hefty price tag, the restored property could prove a major attraction for British tourists who account for a quarter of Malta's tourism arrivals every year.

RIYADH (Reuters) - In years before the coronavirus, some 3 million white-clad pilgrims from across the world flocked to Islam's holiest sites to attend haj under Saudi Arabia's blistering sun.
With the pandemic making large gatherings impossible, only a few thousand pilgrims -- Saudis and foreign residents -- are gathering this year on Mount Mercy on the plains of Arafat for the most important ritual. They share a common plea.
""Everyone will be praying for this pandemic to end, and for all the people of the world to see better months to come after all the suffering caused by coronavirus,"" said Ammar Khaled, a 29-year-old Indian pilgrim who is an IT professional in Jeddah.
Saudi Arabia stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina and its peaceful organisation of haj, which has been marred in the past by deadly stampedes, fires and riots.
Over the years, the kingdom has spent billions of dollars on making one of the world's biggest religious gatherings safe. 
This year it faces the challenge of making haj, a once-in-a-lifetime duty for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it and a major source of income for the government, safe from COVID-19.
To that end, for the first time in modern history it has dramatically reduced the number of pilgrims to ensure social distancing measures are adhered to.
The haj minister said in June the number of pilgrims would be limited to around 1,000, but no official number has been given for those performing the rituals this week. Some local media cited a figure of around 10,000.
Saudi healthcare and security professionals, on the frontlines of the battle against the disease, make up about 30% of the total, with the remainder coming from 160 nationalities residing in the Kingdom.
Mask-wearing pilgrims circled the Kaaba - a stone structure that is the most sacred in Islam and the direction which Muslims face to pray - in small groups of 50 people, each keeping a safe distance apart and accompanied by a health professional monitoring their movements. 
Unlike past years when they lunged towards the Kaaba, pilgrims are not allowed to touch the plain stone cube building covered in black cloth and wrapped in Arabic writing in golden silk.
Workers sanitised the structure, rubbing Oud perfume, the popular Arab sweet and woody scent, on its walls and carrying incense as they moved around the premises of the Grand Mosque.
PLAY IT SAFE
Crowds of millions of pilgrims from around the world could be a hotbed for virus transmission, and in the past some worshippers have returned to their countries with respiratory and other diseases.
The government is extra cautious this time around.
Pilgrims took several medical tests and were asked to quarantine for a week before starting their journey, then isolate for another week in their hotel rooms. 
They were given an electronic bracelet to monitor their movements and a suitcase containing all basic necessities.
On site, 3,500 workers spread across the Grand Mosque in Mecca to sanitise it using 54,000 litres (11,888 gallons) of disinfectant and 1,050 litres of air fresheners daily.
The floors of the mosque were scrubbed 10 times a day, up from three times in the past.
Six hospitals were dedicated to serving pilgrims, 51 clinics and 200 ambulances were spread across different sites with the support of 62 field teams and 8,000 healthcare professionals.
""The kingdom is relying on years of experience in managing the pilgrimage and has worked hard in collaboration with the WHO to ensure that the pilgrimage goes very smooth,"" said Hanan Balkhy, assistant director-general of antimicrobial resistance at the World Health Organization.

With joy and tears, pilgrims will spend the day on Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Mohammad gave his last sermon.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Some of Japan's best-known artists are finding new avenues of expression in areas such as online communication and the environment, as the novel coronavirus outbreak sparks ideas as radical as renaming the country's ""Reiwa"" imperial era.
Five contemporary artists including Takashi Murakami were on hand on Thursday at Mori Art Museum for the unveiling of their ""STARS"" exhibition, which had been delayed by several months as the museum closed due to the pandemic.
Murakami, with works on display including his iconic life-size sculptures ""Miss Ko"" and ""My Lonesome Cowboy"" as well as two new 20 metre length paintings, said expansion of his online business since lockdown was helping him communicate more closely with fans.
""The museum exhibition was delayed and we're still not in a situation where a lot of people can gather, but I think human beings need communication through art,"" Murakami told reporters outfitted in mandatory masks and face shields.
""So I'm conveying various messages in detail online,"" he said.
South Korean-born Lee Ufan, a resident of Japan since the 1950s and known for promoting the ""Mono-ha"" art movement, described the pandemic as a warning over the impact that human development was having on the environment.
He highlighted the improvement in air quality and freedom for wild animals to roam while the world was locked down.
""This is the turning point where we need to go back to nature,"" Lee said.
Photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto, active in the United States since the 1970s, suggested turning the page on the pandemic by renaming the current Reiwa era, which began in May last year with the enthronement of a new emperor.
He noted that Japan in ancient times changed era names when there was a disaster or epidemic.
""We should immediately change the name Reiwa,"" he said.
""It's like a calling from the gods - Reiwa is not a good name!""

The exhibition, open to the public from Friday, also features works from Yayoi Kusama, Tatsuo Miyajima and Yoshitomo Nara.

Zimbabwe is gripped by a climate- and recession-induced economic crisis, its worst in more than a decade, which has seen shortages of foreign currency, medicines and soaring inflation.
The World Food Programme (WFP) said the number of food-insecure Zimbabweans will reach 8.6 million by December, which is 60% of the population, owing to the combined effects of drought, economic recession and the coronavirus.
The agency required an additional $250 million to support a rapidly expanding emergency operation. In April, the WFP sought $130 million to fund emergency operations until August.
""Many Zimbabwean families are suffering the ravages of acute hunger, and their plight will get worse before it gets better,"" Lola Castro, WFP's regional director for Southern Africa, said.
""We need the international community to step up now to help us prevent a potential humanitarian catastrophe.""
The WFP said a national lockdown would cause more job losses while rural hunger was rising as unemployed citizens returned to their village homes.
Political tensions are rising in Zimbabwe after activists called for protests on Friday against government corruption that they blame for worsening the economic crisis.
The government has branded the protests an ""insurrection"". On Thursday, police and soldiers increased security check points at all roads leading to urban centres around the country and turned back motorists and some workers, witnesses said.
With inflation running above 700%, prices of basic goods are now beyond the reach of many citizens and desperate families are eating less, selling off precious belongings and going into debt, the WFP said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The introduction of mandatory face masks in most enclosed spaces across Britain was designed to protect people during the pandemic but has made life very difficult for the deaf community.
Face coverings prevent lip reading and hide facial expressions, making it virtually impossible for the 12 million people who are either deaf or suffering with hearing loss in Britain to communicate and forcing many to stay at home.
Mangai Sutharsan, director of Empowering Deaf Society, said she understood why masks were important to help counter the spread of COVID-19 but the introduction had increased her anxiety about going into public spaces. 
""Personally I'm frightened to go to the shop and to mix where people are wearing masks,"" she told Reuters in sign language, translated into English by an interpreter.
""People don't know I'm deaf so they'll be talking to me but I won't know it, or I won't understand them which is embarrassing. This is really stressful.""
A survey in May for the Office for National Statistics showed that those with hearing problems were already less likely to leave their home during the pandemic and a charity supporting those with hearing loss say masks is making that worse.
""Communication for many is virtually impossible and it's a huge challenge causing massive anxiety,"" Ayla Ozmen, head of research and policy at Action on Hearing Loss, told Reuters. 
Those travelling with, or providing help to deaf people are exempt from wearing face coverings under the rules, and some manufacturers have begun making masks with clear plastic panels, but these are not yet widely available and they can steam up.

The restaurant ban, which took effect on Wednesday, barred any outlet from allowing dine-in patrons to curb the spread of COVID-19, an unprecedented move in the financial hub where hundreds of thousands depend on eating out for daily meals.
Construction and office workers were seen across the city trying to find shade as they ate their noodle and rice lunch boxes in temperatures of up to 35 degrees Celsius (95°F).
Others opted to eat inside storerooms or even toilets, public broadcaster RTHK said.
In a prompt reversal, the government said on Thursday it would partly relax its ban on restaurant dining, noting that it brought ""inconvenience and difficulties"" to many workers. 
From Friday, outlets will be able to open during breakfast and lunch, provided they operate at 50% capacity and ensure diners sit two to a table.
Ivan Tong, a 24-year-old engineer who was buying his takeaway lunch in the commercial district of Tsim Sha Tsui, said many industries did not have an office where workers could eat and some companies did not allow dining inside, making the restaurant ban very tough.
""Although these measures aim to lower the number of confirmed cases, it may be more dangerous as people are outside longer,"" Tong said.
The government's move to open centres across the city came after private businesses as varied as hairdresser salons and bus companies as well as churches provided space for the public to eat in.
One salon, Hair La Forme, posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that it would provide water, napkins and air-conditioned toilets for free.

At least 14 protesters were killed earlier this month in demonstrations that have shaken the government since June and raised fears the instability could derail the fight against Islamist extremists in West Africa's Sahel region.
Despite concessions from Keita and recommendations for moderate reforms by regional leaders, the M5-RFP coalition organising the protests said on Tuesday it wanted Keita gone and has called for more civil disobedience. 
But influential preacher Mahmoud Dicko, who has led the protests even though he is not a coalition member, took a softer line in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. 
""I think we can find a solution without going as far as the resignation of the president. Aside from his resignation, there are lots of things that can be done,"" he said. 
Asked if he would be satisfied by the replacement of Prime Minister Boubou Cisse, who has been heavily criticised for his handling of the protests, Dicko said that change by itself would not resolve the crisis but could be part of a compromise. 
Dicko's speeches denouncing Keita's governance have electrified protesters, and allies and detractors alike see him as the galvanizing force behind the demonstrations. Yet some of the president's allies think he is open to compromise and believe the protests would collapse without him.
Tens of thousands of people have protested over contested local elections, perceived government corruption and incompetence. Police killings of protesters have further inflamed anger against Keita.
Despite his divergences with other protest leaders, Dicko, who has never publicly called for Keita's resignation, denied there were tensions within the opposition. 
""There is no division. There is only a movement in which there are democrats who know that their differences are a strength,"" he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia is to set up a U.S.-funded military fuel reserve in the city of Darwin, authorities said on Thursday, a show of stronger co-operation between the allies who both face increasing tension with China.
The chief minister of Australia's Northern Territory, of which Darwin is the capital, confirmed the plan was part of a wider agreement between the allies to boost defence ties following high-level talks in Washington.
""What I am allowed to say is it will be thumpingly large, but the U.S. government will be spending the money to see it built,"" said a spokeswoman for the chief minister, Michael Gunner.
The agreement ""recognises the Territory as one of the nation's most strategically important defence locations ... and we stand ready to do more"", the spokeswoman said.
Darwin, an isolated city of 130,000 people, is closer to some Asian capitals than to the Australian capital of Canberra. 
The city has hosted a contingent of 1,250 U.S. Marines since 2011, under former President Barack Obama's pivot to Asia following China's increased assertiveness in the region.
A 2015 decision to grant a 99-year lease over the city's port to China's Landbridge Group Co, meanwhile, raised some eyebrows in the United States, which objects to China's extensive claims in the South China Sea.
Jian Zhang, a Chinese foreign policy expert at University of New South Wales, said the fuel reserve facility in Australia would be useful for the United States in the event of any conflict with China.
""Australia, as an alternative place for stockpiles of equipment and fuel reserves, is quite logical because the U.S. bases in southeast Asia and the U.S. bases in northeast Asia are most likely to be affected,"" Jian said.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam told tens of thousands of people who visited a central city to report to disease control centres on Thursday, as nine new coronavirus cases were confirmed and the country scrambled to contain its first outbreak in over three months.
The health ministry sent text messages to all mobile phone users among the country's 95 million people urging anyone who visited Danang from July 1 to come forward, after a new wave of the virus spread to at least six cities and provinces in six days, all linked to Danang.
Hanoi's ruling body on Thursday said mass testing would be carried out until Saturday among thousands of residents who recently returned from Danang, a popular holiday getaway that has been a big draw since restrictions were eased.
The response to the Danang outbreak is in line with a centralised quarantine programme and aggressive contact-tracing system that has seen Vietnam lauded for keeping its coronavirus tally to just a few hundred cases, with no fatalities.
Hanoi banned large gatherings and ordered bars closed from midnight Wednesday and its chairman Nguyen Duc Chung declared the city must ""act now and act fast"". 
""We have to use full force to test all 21,063 returnees,"" Chung said on Thursday.
""All must be done in three days."" 
Nine new cases were reported on Thursday, taking total infections to 42 since the virus resurfaced at the weekend, ending a run of 99 days without community transmission. Vietnam has recorded 459 cases overall.
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has told tourist areas to step up vigilance and imposed a strict lockdown in Danang, where flights have been halted for 15 days.
The coastal city has been inundated with visitors taking advantage of promotions to revitalise a tourism sector hurt by border closures and international flight bans designed to keep the virus out.
The current wave is traced to Danang, but the source is unclear. The health ministry said one case, an American, had reported symptoms as far back as June 26.

Tokyo confirmed 367 new coronavirus infections on Thursday, national broadcaster NHK said, topping the previous record of 366 cases on July 23. 
Japan had 1,264 new cases on Wednesday, according to NHK, surpassing the previous record of 981, with infections spreading rapidly not only in Tokyo, but also in other regions, including remote islands. 
Northern Japan's Iwate prefecture, which had been the last-remaining prefecture free from coronavirus infection, had its first cases on Wednesday, while the southern island of Okinawa had 44 infections, hitting a record for the third day in a row. 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government launched a national travel campaign, dubbed ""Go To Travel"", on July 22 that aimed to revive a battered tourism industry despite a resurgence in coronavirus infection.
Norio Sugaya, a member of the World Health Organization's influenza panel, said the campaign is ill-timed. 
""I'm all for supporting the tourism industry ... But we should not do that when infection is resurgent. The virus spreads as people move. This is clearly a mistake,"" Sugaya said.
""Doctors will soon be signalling the red light,"" Sugaya added. ""Hospitals will soon be filled, so will ICUs (intensive care units).""
Tokyo plans to urge shorter operating hours for restaurants and karaoke parlours next month to tackle a recent spike in coronavirus infections, the Nikkei business daily said.
The metropolitan government is considering a compensation of 200,000 yen ($1,900) to stores that comply with its request to close at 10 p.m. during the period from Monday until Aug. 31, it said.
Besides promoting domestic trips, Japan is slowly reopening to foreigners. 
The government plans to allow foreign students and workers to return to Japan starting Aug. 5, the foreign ministry said. 

The measure will be applied to some 90,000 people who left Japan before their destination was named as one of the 146 countries from which Japan is banning visits, the ministry said.

In a press conference shortly before midnight on Wednesday, a police spokesman said the three men and a woman, all students, were suspected of being involved in an online group that pledged to use every means to fight for an independent Hong Kong.
""We arrested for ... subversions and for the organising and also the inciting (of) secession,"" said Li Kwai-wah, police superintendent at the national security department. 
""They wanted to unite all the independent groups in Hong Kong for the view to promote the independence of Hong Kong."" 
China considers Hong Kong to be an ""inalienable"" part of the country, so calls for independence are anathema to Beijing's Communist Party leaders.
Police said some mobile phones, computers and documents were seized in the operation.
Beijing imposed the contentious legislation on its freest city just before midnight on June 30, punishing what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. 
Activists in Hong Kong scrambled to shut or rebrand social media accounts that could fall foul of the new security law before it was imposed. Police said the four were suspected of posting content that violated the legislation in July. 
Human Rights Watch condemned the arrests and urged governments to impose targeted sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese government officials responsible for the new law.
""The gross misuse of this draconian law makes clear that the aim is to silence dissent, not protect national security,"" Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said.
The law has been condemned by some Western governments, business leaders and human rights groups who say it represents the latest move by Beijing to tighten its grip over the former British colony.
Beijing says the law is crucial to plug gaping holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government protests that rocked the city over the past year.
Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong say the law will be used to target only a minority of ""troublemakers.""
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, Initiative Independence Party said four former members of Studentlocalism, a pro-independence group that was disbanded before the new law took effect, had been arrested on suspicion of violating Articles 20 and 21 of the legislation that include inciting secession. They were denied bail.
Police did not name the suspects but local media and online posts said Tony Chung, a former convener of Studentlocalism was among those arrested.
Critics of the security legislation fear it will crush wide-ranging freedoms not seen on the mainland, including freedom of speech, that were guaranteed to Hong Kong for 50 years when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
Like Studentlocalism, many anti-government groups disbanded just before the law came into force, ranging from pro-independence Hong Kong National Front to pro-democracy Demosisto, which was led by young activist Joshua Wong. 

Hundreds of small shops have taken down protest slogans off their walls, while publishers have started to censor or even reject books they fear authorities might deem subversive.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The leader and 22 members of the Black Disciples street gang have been arrested and charged with drug and gun trafficking on Chicago's South Side, a prosecutor said on Wednesday.
Among those arrested was alleged gang leader Darnell McMiller, 34, who is charged with distributing fentanyl-laced heroin in September 2019. 
The Black Disciples are a national street gang that is prevalent throughout Chicago and the surrounding suburbs, the U.S. Attorney's Office says.
U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois John Lausch told a news conference that law enforcement seized firearms, cocaine, heroin and fentanyl after the multi-year investigation.
Lausch said the probe was active well before the start of Operation Legend, a Trump administration initiative that last week sent federal agents to Chicago and other major cities to tackle violent crime.
The third-largest city has seen a spike in violent crime this summer, including a drive-by shooting by suspected gang members at a funeral last week that wounded 15 people.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's government on Wednesday launched a bid to reform the judiciary by increasing the number of federal courts, diluting the power of those that already exist, in what the opposition has labeled as an attempt to manipulate the court system.
The South American country's courts have been repeatedly accused in recent decades of pro-government bias and the reform was one of the first pledges of the new president, Alberto Fernandez on taking office in December.
A bill has been drafted to increase the number of federal courts from 12 to 46 and will be sent to congress this week, the government said.
""We must end the concentration of federal justice,"" Justice Minister Marcela Losardo told Reuters.
The government has a majority in the senate, but not in the lower house, where the plan could face amendments or rejection. 
The center-left president also announced the formation of an advisory commission made up of 11 experts to assess what additional changes might need to be made to the judiciary. 
That move has triggered claims in opposition circles about a potential bid by the government to hobble the independence of the Supreme Court.
Some members of the ruling coalition have cases pending in the courts for corruption, including the current vicepresident and former president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.
""There is an obvious driver here that is the search for impunity,"" constitutional lawyer Roberto Gargarella said on local radio.
The government rejected the claims.

""We have heard the claims that this reform suits the government or the vice president's bids for impunity. Nothing is further from reality. Those currently in the system will continue to have their cases tried by the same judges,"" Minister Losardo told Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday denied Ghislaine Maxwell's last-ditch effort to keep a potentially damaging deposition from becoming public, as the jailed British socialite defends against criminal charges she aided the late financier Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of girls.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan rejected Maxwell's argument that her arrest on July 2 and indictment were ""compelling"" reasons to continue sealing her April 2016 deposition, and a deposition by an unnamed Epstein accuser.
The depositions came from a now-closed civil defamation lawsuit against Maxwell by one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre.
Maxwell filed a notice of appeal less than an hour after Preska ruled.
She faces a Thursday deadline to appeal from Preska's July 23 order unsealing dozens of other documents, including flight logs from Epstein's private jets and police reports from Palm Beach, Florida, where Epstein had a home.
Maxwell, 58, pleaded not guilty on July 14 to helping Epstein recruit and eventually abuse three girls in the 1990s, and committing perjury by denying her involvement under oath.
In opposing the unsealing, her lawyers had accused Giuffre and federal prosecutors of violating a protective order in the civil case designed to keep Maxwell's deposition confidential.
The lawyers have said the deposition included ""intrusive"" questions about Maxwell's sex life and could prove embarrassing.
They accused Giuffre of leaking the deposition, and ""in conjunction with the government"" setting a ""perjury trap"" for their client.
But Preska said a criminal probe into Epstein's associates already ""loomed large"" when Maxwell opposed unsealing the deposition in June, and her arrest did not overcome the presumption the public deserved access.
""This is plowed ground,"" Preska wrote.
Giuffre has said Epstein kept her as a ""sex slave"" with Maxwell's assistance.

Maxwell's criminal trial is scheduled for July 2021. She is being held in a Brooklyn jail after the judge overseeing that case called her a flight risk.

On Monday, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) suggested 31 members of parliament whose elections were contested step down, among a number of proposals intended to appease an opposition coalition that has held large-scale protests calling for the president's resignation.
The M5-RFP coalition has already rejected the ECOWAS plan, but the lawmakers' apparent refusal to comply is likely a further setback.
""We decided not to resign because we believe the ECOWAS decision violates the constitution,"" MP Gouagnon Coulibaly told Reuters by phone, saying he represented the group.
One of the sources of protesters' anger is a decision by the constitutional court to overturn 31 of the results of a legislative election in March, which gave President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s party 10 more parliamentary seats and make it the largest bloc.
At least 14 protesters were killed earlier this month in demonstrations that have shaken the government since June and raised fears the instability could derail the fight against Islamist extremists in West Africa's Sahel region.
The coalition has said it will restart protests on Aug. 3 if their demands are not met.
The number of MPs in contested seats is 30 not 31, according to lawmaker Coulibaly.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed new sanctions aimed at cutting off funds for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and warned that anyone doing business with Damascus was also at risk of being blacklisted.
Assad's son, Hafez, was among four people and 10 entities, including a Syrian army unit, targeted by Washington over accusations they either aided government funding through luxury real estate construction - sometimes on land belonging to displaced civilians - or prolonged the nearly decade-long war.
""More sanctions will follow as part of a sustained campaign of economic and political pressure to deny the Assad regime the resources it uses to wage war against the Syrian people,"" the White House said in a statement.
A crackdown by Assad on protesters in 2011 led to civil war, with Iran and Russia backing the government and the United States supporting the opposition. Millions of people have fled Syria and millions more have been internally displaced.
The U.S. sanctions, imposed under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act and other measures, come as Assad grapples with a deepening economic crisis. 
Syria was already subject to U.S. and European Union sanctions that have frozen assets of the state and hundreds of companies and individuals. Washington also bans American export and investment in Syria, as well as transactions involving oil and hydrocarbon products.
Wednesday's action marks the second round of sanctions imposed by Washington under the Caesar Act, which can freeze the assets of anyone dealing with Syria, regardless of nationality, and cover many more sectors. It also targets those dealing with entities in Syria from Russia and Iran.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that the sanctions were intended to push Assad to take irreversible steps toward ending the country's war as called for by the United Nations Security Council.
A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also cautioned investors in the Middle East, including Gulf nations, that the United States would not hesitate to blacklist those who help the Syrian government ""steal land from displaced civilians to profit and support"" Assad's government.
Syrian authorities blame Western sanctions for widespread civilian hardship in the country, where a collapse of the currency has led to soaring prices and people struggling to afford food and basic supplies.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft told a Security Council meeting on Syria on Wednesday that Washington's sanctions on Syria are not intended to harm the country's people and do not target humanitarian assistance.

Critics of Sisi, a former army chief who was re-elected for a second term in 2018, say the amendments, passed by parliament this month, aim to curb any opposition from prominent former army generals. The government denies this.
The amendments bolster the role of the army by allowing it to offer an opinion on proposed constitutional amendments and bills related to political rights, elections and national security, according to the announcement.
The legal changes also make it obligatory for the defence minister to appoint a military adviser to the governors of each of Egypt's 27 provinces. 
Previously, only serving army officers had been restricted from entering politics or standing for election without permission from the military. 
""Officers on active service or those whose service has ended are not allowed to run for the presidential, parliamentary or local elections except after the approval of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces,"" the announcement said.
Former military chief-of-staff Sami Anan, seen at the time as Sisi's main challenger, was arrested in 2018 after the military accused him of seeking to run in the presidential election without permission. He was released last December.
The army said at the time of his arrest that Anan was called back to duty after retirement. Anan's spokesman denied that he broke any laws.
Under Sisi, the army has expanded its role, including in the economy, where firms it controls are active from food to cement production.

The new amendments have been criticized by human rights lawyers. But Ahmed al-Tantawy, a senior member of a small opposition bloc in parliament, told Reuters that the group voted for the changes, supporting the government's view that they were aimed at ""preserving the country's national secrets‮""‬.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military on Wednesday unveiled plans to withdraw about 12,000 troops from Germany, in fallout from President Donald Trump's long-simmering feud with Berlin but said it will keep nearly half of those forces in Europe to address tension with Russia.
Trump announced his intention last month to cut by about a third the 36,000-strong U.S. troop contingent in Germany, faulting the close U.S. ally for failing to meet NATO's defense spending target and accusing it of taking advantage of the United States on trade.
""We don't want to be the suckers any more,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday about the decision. ""We're reducing the force because they're not paying their bills; it's very simple.""
Defense Secretary Mark Esper has not portrayed the pullout in those terms and said the military's plan would prevent the troop movements from undermining NATO and its efforts to deter Russian intervention, following Moscow's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. 
In remarks likely to irk Moscow, Esper said some U.S. troops would reposition to the Black Sea region and some could temporarily deploy in waves to the Baltics. 
Other forces leaving Germany would permanently move to Italy and the U.S. military's European headquarters would relocate from Stuttgart, Germany, to Belgium.
In total, just under 6,000 troops of the 12,000 leaving Germany are expected to remain in Europe. Many of the other forces will be based in the United States but will rotate into Europe for temporary deployments without their families. 
""I'm telling you that this is going to accomplish what the president said with regard to getting us down to a lower number in Europe, and it meets his other objectives I outlined with regards to the strategic piece,"" Esper said.
IRE IN GERMANY, GLEE IN BALTICS
U.S. officials stressed that only a relatively small number of advanced units would move anytime soon. The rest of the troop movements would take years to fully implement, in part given the potentially billions of dollars in additional cost. 
Still, the moves out of Germany represent a remarkable rebuke to one of the closest U.S. military allies and trading partners, while two beneficiaries, Italy and Belgium, are low-spending alliance members, according to NATO data.
Norbert Roettgen, chairman of the German parliament's foreign affairs committee and an ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, said the troop withdrawal from Germany ""will weaken the (NATO) alliance.""
But NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg struck an upbeat tone in a statement, saying allies had been briefed by the United States. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told Reuters that his country was ready to accept more American soldiers.
""I value very favorably the news that the U.S. mentioned possibility of moving some troops to the Baltic countries,"" Nauseda said.
U.S. Republican Senator Mitt Romney, who has been critical of Trump, said the plan to remove troops from Germany was a ""grave error."" ""It is a slap in the face at a friend and ally,"" Romney said in a statement.
If he is elected president in November, Democrat Joe Biden will review the Republican incumbent's decision to withdraw the troops from Germany, a top Biden aide told Reuters earlier this month.
Since World War Two, the U.S. military has considered Germany to be one of its most strategic locations overseas, and it serves as a critical logistics hub for troop movements not just within Europe, but to the Middle East, Africa and beyond. 

Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, however, the number of U.S. troops in Germany has been steadily reduced from some 200,000.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Nearly half of all the violence visited on African migrants during their journey to the Mediterranean coast is perpetrated by law enforcers, the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said on Wednesday.
According to a report by UNHCR and the Danish Refugee Council's Mixed Migration Centre (MMC), thousands of refugees and migrants suffer extreme abuse including torture and sexual or gender-based violence, and in some cases death.
The report is based on nearly 16,000 interviews with refugees and migrants.
""In 47% of the cases, the victims reported the perpetrators of violence are law enforcement authorities, whereas in the past, we believe that it was mainly smugglers and traffickers,"" Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR special envoy for the central Mediterranean, told a news conference in Geneva.
""States have a responsibility that they need to discharge in that respect.""
UNHCR reported that 1,750 people had died in 2018 and 2019 trying to reach the sea, but Cochetel said the true numbers were likely to be higher.
""That is just the visible tip of the iceberg. There are many families looking for their loved ones along the routes, and there is no answer to give them,"" he said.
In recent months, hundreds of migrants have been stopped at sea and sent back to Libya despite the risk of violence there.
On Monday, Libyan authorities shot dead three Sudanese migrants trying to avoid detention as they disembarked from a failed attempt to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.

War-ravaged Libya is a major transit point for migrants seeking to reach Europe and now hosts an estimated 654,000 of them, often living in cramped conditions with little access to healthcare.

The election is seen as the greatest test yet of the tenuous stability achieved since a brief civil war killed about 3,000 in 2010 and 2011. 
The election commission's role is particularly sensitive. A dispute over Ouattara's 2010 poll victory sparked the post-election conflict and opposition parties have raised concern this time about the independence of local election offices, which they say favour Ouattara.
The national election commission plans to reform these offices and consult all parties in the run-up to the vote, its president, Ibrahime Coulibaly Kuibert, told Reuters.
""Our primary objective is to make our process credible and transparent,"" he said. 
The presidential race was upset earlier this month by the death of Ouattara's preferred successor, prompting the ruling party to ask Ouattara to reconsider a decision not to run again. 
His opponents say the two-term limit in the constitution bars him from standing again, but Ouattara has said his first two mandates do not count under the new constitution adopted in 2016. 
The other main confirmed candidate is Henri Konan Bedie, who was president from 1993-1999 and leads one of Ivory Coast's largest parties, the PDCI. 
In a Wednesday interview with France 24 television, Bedie said he had agreed with former president Laurent Gbagbo that their parties would back the other's candidate in the event of a second round run-off against Ouattara.

Gbagbo, who resides in Belgium and was acquitted of war crimes by the International Criminal Court last year, has not yet confirmed he will run as the candidate of his FPI party. But his application for travel documents to return to Ivory Coast has raised expectations an announcement could be imminent.

Omar Radi, a business journalist and critic of Morocco's human rights record, was also accused of receiving funds from abroad to undermine Morocco's security, the Casablanca prosecutor's office said in a statement. 
Radi, 33, denies all the charges, his lawyer Miloud Kandil told Reuters, adding that a first hearing would be on Sept. 22. 
His arrest follows 10 summons for a police investigation over suspicions of receiving funds linked to foreign intelligence which he denied.The investigation came after rights group Amnesty International accused Morocco of using Israeli-made spyware to snoop on his phone. Moroccan officials deny that and have demanded Amnesty turn over proof.
Radi had already been given a four-month suspended prison sentence in March, on charges of insulting a judge, for Twitter comments criticising jail terms for people in 2017 protests.
Rights groups say Morocco increasingly uses detention to target dissent. Courts have sentenced a dozen individuals to terms of up to four years on charges from insulting institutions or public servants to inciting protests, a committee of rights activists said in January.

Morocco mostly sidestepped the turmoil of the 2011 Arab uprisings, responding to protests with reforms to cede some of King Mohammed VI's powers to an elected government, though he remains the ultimate authority.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordanian security forces dispersed dozens of teachers trying to reach the seat of government on Wednesday to protest at the arrest of their union leaders and the closure of its offices across the country.
The government raided the union's offices on Saturday and shut it down for two years, escalating a confrontation with a group that has become a leading source of dissent.
The 100,000-strong union went on strike last year, shutting down schools across Jordan for a month in one of the longest and most disruptive public sector strikes in the country's history. 
The security forces mounted a huge operation to deter the protesters, with thousands of officers stationed across central Amman in one of the biggest such deployments in years, witnesses said.
Nonetheless, dozens of teachers chanted slogans calling for the resignation of the government before they were repelled from the cordoned off area in a square that has long been a focus for demonstrations. 
Political opposition is often marginalised in Jordan, but protests have grown in recent years over the erosion of living standards, corruption and slow pace of political reforms.
The prosecutor general has charged the deputy leader of the union, Nasser Nawsreh, with incitement along with charges related to allegations of financial and administrative wrongdoing for other union activists. Judicial authorities have also put a gag order on local media coverage.
Some officials have also accused union leaders of harbouring the Islamist opposition’s political agenda. The union says this accusation is part of a government smear campaign.
The union has also accused the government of failing to honour a deal signed last October that ended the strike. 
The deal included a 50% pay rise this year, which the government now says is unaffordable because of the economic blow from the coronavirus crisis.
Opposition politicians say the government has been using emergency laws enacted in March at the start of the coronavirus lockdown to limit civil and political rights.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Wednesday named career diplomat and intelligence officer Richard Moore as the new chief of the MI6 spy service as the West seeks to bolster its defences against hostile espionage from China and Russia.
Moore, 57, joined the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) in 1987, just four years before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
An accomplished intelligence officer, Moore served in various diplomatic and security roles before winning one of the most powerful jobs in the Western intelligence. Alex Younger, the current chief of MI6 - or plain ""C"" - will step down in the autumn.
""I am pleased and honoured to be asked to return to lead my Service,"" said Moore, who is currently director general of political affairs at the Foreign Office.
Moore served as British ambassador to Turkey from January 2014 to December 2017 and has also served as deputy national security adviser. Born in Libya, he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University and was a Kennedy Scholar at Harvard.
His biggest challenge is likely to be China, which the United States has identified as its major geopolitical foe, though he will also have to fight for funding after British politicians splurged on the coronavirus crisis.
As technology transforms spying, Moore will have to work out how one of the world's pre-eminent human intelligence services can best garner mass data while preserving its renown for getting high-level sources to steal secrets across the world. 
MI6, depicted by novelists as the employer of some of the most memorable fictional spies, from John le Carré’s George Smiley to Ian Fleming’s James Bond, operates overseas and is tasked with defending Britain and its interests.
Younger has served since November 2014. He stayed on longer than is usual to ensure stability through the political tumult of the Brexit negotiations.
His biggest challenge was the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, a Russian double agent turned by MI6, in the English cathedral city of Salisbury in 2018 with a Soviet-designed nerve agent known as Novichok.

Britain blamed Russian military intelligence (GRU) but the Kremlin denied any involvement. The attack prompted the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats and spies since the Cold War.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>",'Vaccine nationalism': Is it every country for itself?,"By Kate Kelland and Julie Steenhuysen
LONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - It's dog eat dog in the world of COVID-19 vaccines.
That's the fear of global health agencies planning a scheme to bulk-buy and equitably distribute vaccines around the world. They are watching with dismay as some wealthier countries have decided to go it alone, striking deals with drugmakers to secure millions of doses of promising candidates for their citizens.
The deals - including those agreed by the United States, Britain and the European Union with the likes of  Pfizer  (N:PFE), BioNtech (F:22UAy), AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and  Moderna  (O:MRNA) - are undermining the global drive, experts say.
""Everybody doing bilateral deals is not a way to optimize the situation,"" said Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI alliance which co-leads the scheme called COVAX designed to secure rapid and fair global access to COVID-19 vaccines.
Pfizer said this week it was in concurrent talks with the EU and several of its member states on supplying them with its potential vaccine.
And in the latest swoop, Britain announced a deal on Wednesday to secure advanced supplies of potential COVID-19 vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and Sanofi (PA:SASY).
This, according to global health charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), will further fuel ""the global scramble to hoard vaccines by rich countries"" and feed ""a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism"". 
The concern is that vaccine supply and allocation in this pandemic will echo the last - caused by the H1N1 flu virus in 2009/2010 - when rich nations bought up the available supply of vaccines, initially leaving poor countries with none. 
In that instance, since H1N1 turned out to be a milder disease and the pandemic ultimately petered out, the impact on infections and deaths from vaccine imbalances was limited. 
However COVID-19 is a far greater threat, and leaving swathes of the world's people vulnerable will not only harm them, but also extend the pandemic and the damage it can cause, health experts say. 
""There is a risk that some countries are doing exactly what we feared - which is every man for himself,"" said Gayle Smith, former head of the U.S. Agency for International Development and CEO of the One Campaign, a non-profit aimed at ending poverty and preventable disease. 
'I AM WORRIED'
More than 75 wealthier countries including Britain have expressed interest in the COVAX financing scheme, which is also co-led by the World Health Organization and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, joining 90 poorer ones who would be supported through donations. 
But the United States, China and Russia are not among countries expressing interest in COVAX, according to GAVI.
And an EU source said last week that the European Commission, which is the bloc's executive arm and leads EU talks with drugmakers, has advised EU countries not to buy COVID-19 vaccines via COVAX. 
""I am worried,"" said Thomas Bollyky, director of the global health program at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""What is happening with the handful of nations that are locking up supply of vaccine competes with the multilateral supply deals. 
""At the end of the day, vaccine manufacturing is a finite resource. You can expand it, but only so much."" 
Experts estimate the world can reasonably hope to have around 2 billion doses of effective COVID-19 vaccines by the end of next year, if several of the leading candidates prove effective in expedited late-stage trials currently underway. COVAX's aim is to distribute doses for at least 20% of its signed-up countries' populations. 
ANOTHER TWO YEARS?
Berkley of GAVI said, however, that if self-interested countries or regions snapped those up to cover their entire populations - instead of sharing them across nations and protecting the most at-risk people first - the pandemic could not be controlled.
""If you were to try to vaccinate the entire U.S., (and) the entire EU, for example, with two doses of vaccine - then you'd get to about 1.7 billion doses. And if that is the number of doses that's available, there's not a lot left for others."" 
If a handful, or even 30 or 40 countries have vaccines, but more than 150 others don't, ""then the epidemic will rage there"" Berkley said. 
""This virus ... moves around like lightning. So you'll end up in a situation where you will not be able to go back to normal. You won't be able to have commerce, tourism, travel, trade, unless you can get the whole pandemic to be slowed down."" 
He and Smith and other health experts said ending the pandemic meant ending it globally. 

""It's the difference from a pandemic (for) another two years as opposed to one year,"" Smith added. ""The economics and health consequences of that are enormous.""

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>","As U.S. police struggle to hire, next-generation cops seek more humane approach","By Andrea Shalal and Angela Moore
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Stephanie Robinson, 23, a rookie Black police officer on Detroit's West Side, has been challenged by Black residents about her loyalty while on patrol since the death of George Floyd under the knee of a white police officer. 
""They're saying, 'Are you going to be Black or be a police?' And I say, 'I'm Black and a police officer. I'm going to do both and do it the right way,'"" Robinson said. 
Robinson says she is committed to the force, but is also openly critical of police training and methods. 
""If we could have a better relationship with people, and not be going full force every time and treating people like criminals"" it would help, she said. 
Growing concern among young officers and cadets about racism and brutality in U.S. law enforcement after Floyd's death is the latest complication for police recruiters already struggling to hire and retain new cops. 
Drops in the number of recruits and increases in officers heading for retirement are so dramatic that the Police Education Research Foundation (PERF) dubbed https://www.policeforum.org/assets/WorkforceCrisis.pdf it a ""workforce crisis."" 
Job applications have plummeted in many police departments over the past five years, falling 50% in Seattle, for example, and 70% in Jefferson County, Colorado, a 2019 study by PERF showed. About 16% of the U.S. police force hits retirement age in the next five years, the study found. 
As local governments curb police powers, and Congress pushes reform bills, some of the police workforce of the future is also beginning to question how policing is done and their role in it.
This next generation wants better training; a more transparent, flexible and accountable police presence; and closer ties to the communities they serve. 
""We are not waiting two, three, four years for change. We need to change now - right now,"" said DeCarlos Hines, a forensic psychology major and president of the Black Student Union at New York City's John Jay School of Criminal Justice, which is one of the biggest feeders into U.S. law enforcement. 
Hiring and keeping Black and other minority officers is one of many challenges facing police recruiters, the PERF report says.
Law enforcement agencies are also increasingly struggling to find recruits who are conversant with technology to fight cyber crimes, such as human trafficking online or internet stalking, and able to be more active in addressing an array of social ills like the opioid epidemic.
A patrol officer for just over six months, Robinson says she was not taught how to handle the most common issue she faces: people with mental illness. 
""Honestly, 90% of the runs I go to every day are mental (health) runs,"" she said. 
LOT OF QUESTIONING
Whether young police can help reform U.S. law enforcement, where veterans say https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-blackofficers/black-cops-say-discrimination-nepotism-behind-u-s-police-race-gap-idUSKBN2432T8 discrimination and nepotism have been the norm for decades, remains to be seen. 
Young cops are not an organized political force, nor do they have any control over police or university budgets. But police veterans and educators charged with filling jobs as the force ages say their views cannot be ignored. 
""We all agree that they're the future, and it's just a matter of how to deal with them,"" said Detective Sergeant Christopher Kriner of Old Lycoming Township Police Department in central Pennsylvania, who has been working with a local college to bring in recruits. 
Some in the upcoming generation are reassessing the future of policing, said Debra Dreisbach, a former FBI agent who lectures on criminal justice and ethics at Pennsylvania State University, Berks and advises police departments on hiring.
""People who were set to go into policing - the diehards, if you will - are still pursuing that path, but there's a lot of questioning going on right now,"" she said. 
At the John Jay School in New York, Hines and the student union are pushing for more minority instructors; mandatory anti-racism training for staff, faculty and students; inclusion of minority scholarship in every syllabus and course across the college; and a mandatory course on alternatives to policing, such as social work. 
Karol Mason, who leads John Jay, said she is listening. ""We need leadership from young voices to tell us how we can do this better,"" said Mason. John Jay's 15,000 student body is about 80% people of color, but about two-thirds of the faculty is white. 
""I will consider it a personal failure if I don't figure out how to change and give our students people who look like them,"" she said. ""You often hear 'You can't be what you can't see.'"" 
Elias Oleaga, 19, joined the Boy Scout-founded Law Enforcement Exploring https://www.exploring.org/law-enforcement program when he was 13 and met veteran cops with a strong commitment to serving his Dominican community in the Bronx. 
Now a student at John Jay, Oleaga says the national debate about policing has not shaken his desire to become an officer. ""Honestly, I'd be lying if I said it did. Passion doesn't go extinct.""
But because of Floyd's death, he said he now plans to focus his police career on community relations rather than his original choice, investigations. ""I've seen what happens in the streets of the South Bronx. I'd like to be the support system that was given to me,"" he said. 
Thomas ""Tre"" Boone, 19, knows firsthand about the problems facing Black police officers - his father is one of a dozen officers suing https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-minneapolis-police-blackofficers/black-cops-say-discrimination-nepotism-behind-u-s-police-race-gap-idUKKBN2432QK the Prince George's County, Maryland department for racial discrimination. Prince George's County denies the allegations in the 2018 lawsuit. 

Boone says he is still planning to study criminal justice and become a cop. ""It's time for people to step up and reform the police,"" he said. ""I definitely feel that I'm part of that generation.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Dozens of students rallied in Thailand on Wednesday to demand from the government greater gender rights and an end to what they called outdated curriculum and discriminatory rules on uniforms and haircuts.
Onlookers in Bangkok cheered and applauded as students of mixed ages carrying placards and banners and rainbow flags, fans and umbrellas marched to the education ministry in protest at a school system they said was far behind the times. The group included secondary school pupils and some older students.
They took aim in particular at rules that prescribe specific hair length and styles for male and female students. 
""What about students of other genders? This is something the ministry needs to consider because it is normal to be diverse,"" said Panupong Suwannahong, 19, a protest organiser.
""The school uniform segregates the students' genders.""
The demonstration comes amid an increase in student-led political protests in Thailand in recent weeks. The group, however, said it had no ties to an anti-government movement.
On the steps of the ministry and in front of its permanent secretary, student Pimchanok Nongnual, 19, shaved her hair with electric clippers in protest at ""suffocating"" gender rules.
""What about gender fluid or non-binary students?"" said Pimchanok. 
Although it is a largely conservative Buddhist society, Thailand has a reputation for openness and free-wheeling attitudes and has a vibrant lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) social scene. 
Its cabinet backed a civil partnership bill on July 8 to recognise same-sex unions with almost the same legal rights as married couples, in one of Thailand's most liberal moves yet.
However, activists say its education system is reluctant to respond to changing attitudes. Nattapat Satavelarot, 17, tore up a textbook on health and hygiene, rejecting what he called a discriminatory curriculum.

""I want teachers to be educated about LBGTQ rights and they need to understand that students consisting of many genders is not a taboo,"" Nattapat said.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto will move into the third stage of its economic reopening on Friday, the Ontario provincial government announced on Wednesday, paving the way for the majority of businesses in Canada's most populous city to resume operations after a four-month lockdown to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The city as well as the region of Peel, which covers Toronto's suburbs, will be allowed to reopen gyms, movie theaters and playgrounds, with social distancing in place, during the third stage, the government said in a statement.
Indoor dining at restaurants may also resume. Businesses must ensure customers can engage in social distancing, either by staying two meters (6.56 ft) apart or providing barriers, and are largely subject to gathering limits of 100 people outdoors and 50 people indoors.
Dancing at restaurants and bars, amusement parks and table games at casinos will remain closed in the third stage, according to government guidelines.
Coronavirus infections and death rates from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, have moderated in Canada, but officials are urging the public to remain vigilant.
Ontario reported 111 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, with six in Toronto, while Canada reported 397 cases in the same period, for a total of 114,994. The country's death toll rose by 11 to 8,912.
""We have made tremendous progress ... but we are not out of the woods yet,"" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a statement.
Toronto mandated the use of masks in indoor public spaces in early July, and the city council will consider further rules for restaurants this week, Mayor John Tory said on Tuesday.
Toronto's financial hub, which is Canada's financial capital, will likely remain quiet, with banks allowing most staff to work from home until at least September. Bank of Nova Scotia said on Tuesday it has asked most of its employees in its head office to continue to work remotely until 2021.

Only the region of Windsor-Essex, which has seen outbreaks of COVID-19 among agricultural workers, will remain in the second stage of the reopening.

Sweden decided to forego a hard lockdown and kept most schools and businesses open throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, a divisive strategy that has set it apart from most of Europe.
The government said it would stop advising against non-necessary travel to Norway, Denmark, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.
It added that current travel restrictions for other countries within the European Union and the United Kingdom would remain until Aug. 12.
Daily COVID-19 death rates and the number of people treated at intensive care have been slowing gradually since April in Sweden.
The country's death toll of 5,730, when compared to population size, has far outstripped those of its Nordic neighbours, although it remains lower than some European countries that locked down, such as Britain and Spain.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - European airline and airport executives urged the Canadian government this week to allow a safe ""restoration of travel"" between Canada and Europe, adding industry pressure on Ottawa to remove coronavirus-related restrictions that have discouraged international air travel.
In a letter dated July 27, top executives of nearly a dozen European airlines and airports, warned that ""since many EU (European Union) countries and Switzerland require reciprocity to re-establish access, Canada's continued entry restriction and quarantine requirements are becoming problematic.""
The content of the letter, sent to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other government ministers, was reviewed by Reuters.
The EU has taken steps in recent weeks to relax travel requirements both internally and towards citizens of select other countries, including Canada, although Britain reintroduced a 14-day quarantine this week for arrivals from Spain.
Canada's borders are closed to all non-citizens except for essential workers. Canadians who enter the country from abroad must self-isolate for two weeks.
Trudeau has dismissed repeated calls from Air Canada to relax air travel restrictions to select countries.
The July 27 letter was signed by executives from Air France-KLM and Germany's Lufthansa Group, among others.
Trudeau's office and Air France-KLM were not immediately available for comment.
""Canada should look to remove the restrictions on travel to European Union and Swiss nationals and allow for a safe, cautious and sensible restoration of travel between two important trading partners,"" the executives said in the letter.
""Just as the EU has recognized Canada's successes in managing the pandemic, so too must Canada recognize the EU's.""
Executives pointed out that the EU and Switzerland are ""safe jurisdictions"" with many countries having lower infection rates than Canada.
""Canada has made tremendous strides during the pandemic but it cannot remain isolated forever.""

KHARTOUM/DUBAI (Reuters) - Efforts to bring stability to Sudan's conflict-ridden Darfur region have failed to reassure residents fearful of rising violence which has cast a shadow over peace negotiations. 
The fall of President Omar al-Bashir in 2019 raised hopes that Arab militias he supported, which have been accused of atrocities, would be reined in under the civilian-military government which replaced him. 
Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok is negotiating with rebel groups that had fought Bashir. But they hold little sway 17 years after a conflict which killed 300,000 people and displaced 2.5 million erupted. 
Over the last month, 100 people have been killed, both in attacks by the militias and tribal clashes over precious agricultural land at the heart of tensions.
The violence has triggered a wave of sit-ins across the region, demanding authorities protect civilians from the militias, who are scrambling to secure their gains now that Bashir has gone, says Jonas Horner of the International Crisis Group.
""They're the forces that used to terrorise citizens and push us out of our homes,"" said Suleiman, a protester in Nertiti in central Darfur, reached by telephone. ""They want to keep the same privileges.""
Protesters there allege that the militias, known as ""Janjaweed,"" have carried out dozens of killings, rapes, and armed robberies in recent months.
""Things could explode,"" said Mohamed, another protester in Eldeain, an eastern Darfur town. Like others, he declined to give his full name for security reasons.
The United Nations estimates that 2.8 million Darfuris are severely food insecure and might require aid if the current agricultural season is further disrupted by fighting.
Both Hamdok and rebel groups say a peace deal would be a necessary first step to ending turmoil in Darfur, a vast region roughly the size of France.
However, donor funding needed to implement the deal is not guaranteed and Sudan's government is trying to rescue an economy battered by decades of conflict and corruption.
The two most influential rebel groups have said they will negotiate if current talks succeed.
Sudan has agreed that rebels will receive 25% representation in the national government and 40% in Darfur. The deal also promises an annual $750 million development fund.
But some are sceptical after years of broken promises. ""We hear that money is given out, but it's just numbers, in reality there's nothing,"" said Suleiman.
Analysts question whether a deal will provide security as the rebels, as well as militias linked to Bashir, have fragmented and are themselves fighting over resources, often along tribal lines with no clear leadership.
And talk of peace has not deterred the Janjaweed, who attacked one of the protest sites earlier this month.
""They shot and assaulted people and looted and burned,"" riding motorcycles and camels, an eyewitness in Fatabarno village told Reuters.
SECURITY
Neither the rebels nor U.N. peacekeepers have been able to protect civilians, said Manzoul Assal, professor at the University of Khartoum.
Hamdok on Sunday announced a new force, including the police, army and Rapid Support Forces, which themselves were accused of atrocities in Darfur, an allegation they deny.
""The beginning of the solution is the appointment of civilian governors and the deployment of security forces, ... under the control of the civilian governors in coordination with the military,"" said Jumaa Kanda, an advisor to Hamdok. The governors were appointed last week after protests.
Demonstrators across Darfur had demanded the removal of some military and government officials they say have failed to protect them.
On Friday, militiamen killed at least 20 returning refugees in Um Doss, in South Darfur, residents told Reuters.

""They want to continue to occupy our land,"" said a local leader. ""We demand that the government interfere to protect us.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Allen & Overy (A&O), one of Britain's top law firms, said on Wednesday Black lawyers left its London office almost two-and-a-half years before their white peers, as it pledged to publish an annual ""stay gap"" to improve staff diversity.
The legal practice said the retention gap, which saw Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) lawyers as a whole leaving an average seven months earlier than white counterparts, was troubling for both the firm and the sector.
""The stay gap figure is an uncomfortable truth for us and the legal industry, but it gives us an objective way to measure the success of our efforts in this area,"" said Ian Field, A&O's UK diversity and inclusion partner.
""We want to be clear that we recognise the problems within our own firm and are committed to tackling them head-on.""
A&O announced the move after Rare Recruitment, a diversity recruitment consultancy, found that the average BAME lawyer's tenure is about 18 months shorter than white peers across the industry.
By 2025, A&O also plans to ensure 15% of London partners come from ethnic minorities, compared to 9% currently, and to increase the percentage of ethnic minority lawyers and support staff to 25%. 
The firm at present has no Black partners in London. About 22% of its associates, 31% of its trainees, and 16% of support staff are currently from BAME backgrounds.
A&O plans to annually employ 35% ethnic minority trainees, including 10% Black trainees, equalise retention rates for trainee lawyers and focus on retaining more Black associates.
Other top London law firms have also been trying to tackle diversity. 
Clifford Chance - like A&O, a member of London's Magic Circle of five top firms by revenue - plans to ensure that 15% of all partner recruits in Britain and 30% of senior associates and senior business professionals will be from ethnic minorities by 2025.

Netanyahu, whose popularity has plunged in opinion polls amid 21.5% unemployment, said his depiction in a mock tableau of Jesus's final meal before his crucifixion, was tantamount to a death threat.
In the installation, Netanyahu sits alone at a grand 10-metre (33 ft) long table, with two candelabras, grabbing at a huge cake resembling an Israeli flag.
Moet & Chandon champagne, Chivas Regal scotch and Courvoisier cognac are placed alongside a heaping spread of fruit and meats, accompanied by a single cigar, to allude to the corruption allegations against Israel's longest-serving premier.
Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing in three corruption cases against him, which include allegations he illegally received gifts of champagne and cigars from affluent businessmen.
His trial, the first for a serving Israeli prime minister, opened in May and witnesses are to begin testifying in January.
Passersby, many of them wearing face masks, stopped to snap photos of the sculpture by Tel Aviv artist Itay Zalait. He said the work was meant to symbolise the ""Last Supper of Israeli democracy"".
""Many people refer to (Netanyahu) as a genius - Mr Economy, Mr Security - he's more than anyone else, he's like the son of God,"" Zalait said, standing next to the sculpture.
""Mr. Economy ... people don't have food to bring for their children,"" he said.
Netanyahu, who has drawn accusations of autocratic rule by using emergency regulations to fast-track social distancing edicts, took to Twitter to term the exhibit ""a shameful threat of crucifixion"".
The Last Supper, as depicted in a 15th century mural by Leonardo da Vinci, shows Jesus at the table with his apostles in Jerusalem. The mural, one of the most famous paintings in the world, is in a Milan convent.

Zalait's work is displayed in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square - where several anti-Netanyahu demonstrations have been held this summer.

HANOI (Reuters) - A specially converted Vietnam Airlines passenger plane equipped with ventilators and state doctors returned from Equatorial Guinea to Hanoi on Wednesday carrying 140 Vietnamese workers infected with COVID-19.
The plane, which left on Monday night for 27-hour, 21,000-kilometre (13,000 mile) round trip to the town of Bata in the West African country, arrived in the capital Hanoi, where infected patients were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.
""We are all prepared,"" Pham Ngoc Thach, director of the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases campus just outside Hanoi, told Reuters. 
""One hundred ventilators, medicine and other equipment for testing and treatment as well as some 500 rooms have been set aside for the passengers."" 
Equatorial Guinea has registered more than 3,000 cases of COVID-19 and 51 deaths, numbers that relative to its population of 1.2 million make it one of the African countries considered by the World Health Organization as ""severely affected"" by the pandemic. 
Vietnam, virus-free for months, was bracing for a wave of locally transmitted COVID-19 infections on Wednesday after new cases were discovered in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and the Central Highlands, all linked to a recent outbreak in Danang. 
Of the 220 people on the flight from Equatorial Guinea, 140 were infected with the virus, state media said. At least a dozen were critically ill, said Thach, in what he described as an ""unprecedented"" large intake of patients for his hospital. 
State media said the rescue effort was organised after the stranded workers, who had been working on a hydropower project, sent a letter to the Vietnam embassy in Angola, 1,200 km away, asking for help. 

In a statement, Vietnam Airlines said it was only the second time one of its planes had flown to Africa. The first was on June 18, when it repatriated 309 Vietnamese workers from Angola.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is advertising for a skilled communicator to front newly-televised government media briefings - a job billed as ""speaking to the nation"" for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Johnson's government is moving to White House-style on-camera briefings later this year, ending decades of tradition and shining a new light on the sometimes cosy relationship between reporters and ministers.
""This is a unique opportunity to work at the centre of government, and communicate with the nation on behalf of the Prime Minister,"" said a job advert on the ruling Conservative Party's website.
""You will speak directly to the public on the issues they care most about, explaining the government’s position, reassuring people that we are taking action on their priorities and driving positive changes.""
Pay for the role would depend on experience, though the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported it could exceed 100,000 pounds ($130,000) - more than most lawmakers. 
It comes after the perceived success of daily news conferences during the coronavirus pandemic.
That echoes the format in Washington to televise what have been - particularly during President Donald Trump's administration - sometimes awkward and hostile tussles between reporters and officials.
NO MORE DRAUGHTY ""LOBBY"" MEETINGS?
It marks a shift resisted by successive governments and some sections of the press, and will partially replace twice-daily off-screen meetings between the government and reporters.
Those so-called ""lobby"" arrangements have evolved from secret briefings in the 1920s to on-the-record meetings in a draughty turret room inside the Palace of Westminster or, most recently, a former court chamber attached to the prime minister's residence.
Alongside an ability to ""remain calm and measured under pressure"", the successful candidate requires ""excellent risk management and crisis communications skills"", the ad said.
""Working in the prime minister’s communications team involves working under pressure and to immovable deadlines.""
Though less visible than American counterparts, Britain's spokesmen have long been influential: former Prime Minister Tony Blair's right-hand man Alastair Campbell became a famous ""spin doctor"", dividing opinion with his ceaseless efforts to turn bad news into good.
